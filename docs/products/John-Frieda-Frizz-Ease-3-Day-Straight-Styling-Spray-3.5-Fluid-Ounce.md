      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>results were not at all pleasant.</li>
      <li>All good.  </li>
      <li>and I still have good body without build up.  </li>
      <li>You just have to keep in mind that it is a styling aid, and will not replace the effects of a good straightener, but will work well in conjunction with one.</li>
      <li>My hair is always good for 3-4 days no matter what I do (including riding my horse with a hemet).</li>
      <li>Note that this is good if you have to add to an Amazon order.</li>

      <li>i paid for this, so i have no incentive to give this a good rating.</li>

      <li>it doesn&#x27;t even look good.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is a good assistant to styling, but not the miracle cure for uncontrollable hair.</li>
      <li>Good product, does what it says.</li>
      <li>frizz ease for good.</li>
      <li>So my advice is, get a good hair serum and use it together, because this product alone did not work well with me.</li>
      <li>I have nothing but good stuff to say about this product.</li>
      <li>This product works like a charm if u have good curly hair.</li>
      <li>and I was super impressed!</li>
      <li>I get brazillian Keratin treatments during the spring/summer/early fall months at the salon and will probably continue to do so, but this product is great for in-between treatments and a lot more affordable than going to the salon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for getting your style to stay more than 1 day.</li>
      <li>Nice product at a good price.</li>
      <li>but I am pretty impressed with this product.  </li>

      <li>No distinctive aroma that will interfere with my own perfume either.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a treatment out there that was this affordable, effective, and convenient, that lasted longer than three days.</li>
      <li>Still loving it</li>
      <li>Honestly, I will probably never know, I wash my hair every day</li>
      <li>It was a humid and warm day and my hair became sticky, curly and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, and it helps.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>Just consistently nice hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t matter if I used any kind of finishing product afterward either.</li>
      <li>Well , I can honestly say I &#x27;like&#x27; this product .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>EverSleek Frizz Taming Creme Serum or Awapuhi Styling Treatment Oil to give it a nice shiny look.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to have found it again.  </li>
      <li>My hair is not super-curly, just that frizzy kind of wavy.</li>
      <li>I have medium-thick curly hair, but it doesnt get frizzy, and whenever I straighten my hair it stays nice for about 10 minutes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely does what it says, keeps my hair frizz free until I wash again!  So glad I am able to buy this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> After using many products that left me more than disappointed, I finally found a product that works and is reasonably priced. Even my stylist likes the results.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin and wavy hair. It has a mind of its own most of the time. Most of the time I blow dry it straight but not without using this product first! this really makes it more silky and not greasy. It does tame most of the frizz but doesnt hold up if I go outside and its damp or misty or raining. I havent found any product that can do that for me. So I stick to this one as my favorite. I would totally recommend to anyone with my hair type to try it for sure!</li>
    <li> It really straighten your hair and flatten it too. If you looking for volume, this will not work for you. I like it because it made my frizzy wavy hair straight after blow drying and flat ironing. Also, it makes my hair shining too. I like it for this intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be great to I don have to spend so much time straightening my hair. Turns our it took more. The product is more like a hair spray or gel when it&#x27;s in your hair and sticks to your hands and hair sticks to other hair. So even when I finally straightened everything my hair didn&#x27;t flow and still felt like a rats nest. I&#x27;ve had much better results with cheep argan oil</li>
    <li> THis product is terrible! I used it, as directed, on damp hair prior to blow drying. My hair became an instant mess resembling cotton candy! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back in the shower and wash this junk out. Can&#x27;t see how anyone would like it. I will stick to silicon styling serum.</li>
    <li> dont like it when i put it in it felt like stiff hairspray in my hair and when i flat ironed it it stunk so bad do not buy this</li>
    <li> I am a 2C (see naturallycurly.com).  Using as directed, after the blow-dry, my hair looks &amp; feels worse than ever - dry sticky straw, major frizz.  The instructions say for \\&quot;best results\\&quot; a flat iron is recommended... for me, it is downright unacceptable without the flatiron step.  After flat ironing,  it looks OK - but not at all silky nor sleek - straight, but still dry looking.  Once I spray in some silicones, it is quite nice and will hold up for three days, which is saying something in Houston humidity.  I can definitely tell it is drying; I&#x27;ve had some success pre-treating with leave-in conditioner to offset the drying w/o decreasing straightening longevity.  I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle, but not likely to buy again.</li>
    <li> I simply love, love, love this product.  I have long hair.  It is to my waist, and this product does not dry out my hair.  It keeps it shiny, and simply gorgeous-looking all day.  I ran out one day, and used whatever else I had in my closet, and boy, did I regret it!  I want to stock up, just in case they discontinue it--but I doubt that they will.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Had great hopes for this product, but was greatly disappointed.  Have medium shoulder length hair and used recommended # of sprays, blow dried hair and used flat iron.  I really did not see any significant difference and did not care for feeling of residue on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have moderately curly but very frizzy hair.  It was a humid and warm day and my hair became sticky, curly and frizzy.  This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything except make my hair sticky, and I was really hoping I would love it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Try Nexxus Sleek Memory Smoothing Spray instead.  It takes a few days but it works!</li>
    <li> I have extremly frizzy curly hair. The kind that looks nice wet... until it dries and then i brush it and it turns into a dried up frizz ball. So I used to spend $200.00 on japanese straightening since i was 14... i am now 17 and i have just tried this product and i have the same results as the japanese straightening it&#x27;s that good! I didn&#x27;t even blowdry my hair I simply heated up my flat iron , and sprayed sections of my hair. Didn&#x27;t take me too long either. Anyone who has Curly frizzy hair should deffinitly give this a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: (next day) my hair is still straight! all i had to do was brush it out  :)</li>
    <li> I have now used a whole bottle and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  Do not expect your hair to come out completely straight, you will need to do a little work. First - DRY your hair COMPLETELY then use big hot rollers or a straightener. My hair, when I have used this product, stays greats for days without anymore effort. I do not understand the stickiness comment from another reader. I have in NO WAY found this to be true of my hair. Good luck I know having this hair can be a challenge!</li>
    <li> OK, I was so excited to get this product I literally jumped for joy when I received it in the mail.  I was BEYOND hopeful!  Needless to say, I am saddened to report that it did NOTHING for my hair.  I have thick wavy/frizzy hair but I can usually manage to straighten and get it pretty smooth on my own, people are usually quite surprised when I tell them I don&#x27;t have naturally straight hair.    I was hoping for that silky look you get after the salon, or at least I hoped it would deliver on its promise to keep my hair straight and impervious to humidity etc.  Sorry, it failed on all fronts.  I think maybe the people who are reporting success have fine/thin hair? I really don&#x27;t know.  I tried this product 3 times, trying different # of sprays etc and it just didn&#x27;t do a thing.  So, alas, I continue my search for something to tame this wild mane of mine :)  And yes, I have a very hot iron (as cheap lukewarm irons wouldn&#x27;t have a chance straightening my hair)</li>
    <li> Once again as I stood before yet another isle of products promising the world for my curly (and chemically straightened) hair, I saw this product and thought why not try this since I have tried every product known to woman-kind.  I tried it, I love it - it works.  No need to go on about the product other than YES IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine, thin hair that curls up in Louisiana humidity and have tried so many products to keep it straight.  This product works!  Spray on, then use a straight iron.  It really does last for 3 days &amp; beyond!  I also use a hair spray for humidity (Garnier Fructis) that helps to keep it straight.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I knew summer was around the corner. My hair is fine and wavy--a recipe for disaster in a humid, Southern climate. I tried the product on a windy day, and it definitely kept my hair straight. I used 7 sprays, and it felt a bit weighed down by the end of the day. I had to wash it the next day. The next time I tried it, I only used 5 sprays, and that did the trick. My husband commented on how shiny my hair was. One of students even commented on how soft my hair looked. As far as being able to keep hair straight for 3 days, I cannot comment on that part. My hair would be a flat dirty mess at that point, so I can only do two days at most. It worked for me for that. Overall, I recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I bought this, and I started using this a while ago.I was suprised to see results. I had ALOT of frizz but now my frizz isn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be. Overall good product</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with relaxed hair. I try not to relax often and as a result, the different textures can make it difficult to style my hair without causing breakage between relaxer applications. I workout at least four days weekly and when I want to wear my hair straight, it can be pretty difficult to keep it that way after a heavier workout. The slightest bit of moisture on my scalp causes my hair to revert at the new growth and my dilemma begins anew. Do I wash and flat-iron again to keep the style or do I wash and wear the same rollerset for the third week in a row? With this stuff, I can stretch the style another day or two before I have to wash again. I love it! It really works--but you have to follow the directions!</li>
    <li> This product worked really well for me - definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve used before, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of things.  I&#x27;m bi-racial and my hair is naturally curly but I almost always wear it straight.  But, I constantly have to throw it up in a ponytail because as soon as there&#x27;s heat/humidity, it frizzes right up.  I used this yesterday, it got my hair WAY straighter than I can get it on my own and in slightly less time.  It also made my hair super soft.  I wore it down to a wedding in 93 degree weather.  It stayed straight through tons of photos taken outside, which would have typically had me putting my hair up without a doubt.  Even when I started to sweat a bit during dancing it stayed pretty straight.  By the time I got home after a 12 hour day, it wasn&#x27;t stick straight anymore but granted how much I was outside and all the sweaty dancing, it looked really good - not at all frizzy - and I was able to wear it down all day.  It&#x27;s still pretty straight today, but I will definitely give my hair a wash tomorrow - it gets too oily to not wash for 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair even the strands are very course and thick. My hair has natural wave/curl to it and gets  pretty frizzy after I wash it. When I straighten it with my Chi within a couple hours it is ALWAYS wavy and fluffy again. I thought I&#x27;d try this because I&#x27;d seen so many positive Youtube reviews on it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Just after blow drying the product in, my hair looked like it usually does after straightening it! I of courseused the flat iron to seal in the product and I was SO pleased with my results. Super shiny, soft, silky, pin straight hair! Right after showering!! That NEVER happens to me using ANY product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many (some VERY expensive). My husband even noticed right away when he came home from work and I hadn&#x27;t even said anything to him. He just said, \\&quot;wow your hair looks a lot straighter than usual!\\&quot; He couldn&#x27;t stop touching it:) I have nothing but good stuff to say about this product. It totally did what it promises even for my fickle pregnancy locks. I am very impressed! It also lasted for three days as promised and after I washed on the 3rd day my hair seemed healthier and softer after drying. Maybe it offers a little protection from the heat? I don&#x27;t know. All I know is it is TOTALLY worth the money and I will be buying over and over again!!! Thank You John Freida!!!</li>
    <li> I picked this up after seeing it in one of my many beauty mags...and thought, what the heck?  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised.  I have shoulder length wavy hair that i always seem to be fighting against to get a smooth straight look.  I think what a lot of products don&#x27;t ever get right for me is this:  I want STRAIGHT hair, NOT FLAT hair!  Big difference!  This product pulls it off better than some way more expensive stuff I have tried...and unexpectedly, it makes it extremely soft and shiny too!  I did still put a bit of root lift in at the crown cuz i like my volume...but I am pretty impressed with this product.  Does it last 3 days?  Honestly, I will probably never know, I wash my hair every day, I can&#x27;t stand it if I don&#x27;t...but, regardless...I like the stuff.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this excitedly thinking it&#x27;d put an end to the constant straightening of my hair but I have to say it did nothing of the sort. I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair and followed the intructions exactly as it said. After blowdrying and straightening my hair, yes, of course it was straight, but when I woke up the next day the frizz and waves were back. I tried on 3 different occasions and it failed each time. I would agree with other reviewers that it leaves a kind of sticky/greasy feeling in the hair. Useless stuff.</li>
    <li> Gives you bouncy voluminous hair</li>
    <li> This product works OK.  Your hair dries a little faster, but this is not the miracle we keep searching for.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Amazon after reading the reviews and I must say it works great.  It is made to use while blowing dry and then using a heat styling tool like a curling or flat iron.  It is meant to keep your hair straight once you get it there and it definitely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I would not say it is weightless but once my hair is done, the only sign I can tell that it is in my hair is actually how great my hair looks and how it stays that way. I exercise outside in the evenings and it still looks great.  Usually my naturally curly hair frizzes and gets full and out of control but with this, it just looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about it is that it seems to protect from the heat which is great because I am trying to get my hair longer and have to go frequently to trim dry ends.  With this my hair stays in great shape and due to the fact I am styling it less frequently, I know I can finally get some significant growth going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks John Frieda for this product.  I love love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> pros&lt;br /&gt;it works for sure!&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t sticky, actually softens hair and moisturizes hair&lt;br /&gt;keeps hair straight, lasts long, does no damage, light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so many cons&lt;br /&gt;expensive, seriously a 14 day keratin treatment costs half this products price!&lt;br /&gt;costs more than what it given to you&lt;br /&gt;small spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;only offered as a spray and not a cream, which is most like more diffusible in hair so you don&#x27;t have to use the whole jar at a time!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;this one is the most annoying, IT ONLY LAST 3 DAYS, WHAT IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLES&lt;br /&gt;what about a product lasting for a week? that would be a little more satisfying&lt;br /&gt;there isn&#x27;t much liquid in the bottle so I have to drench every sections my hair with most of the product at one time!&lt;br /&gt;NOT FAIR!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It&#x27;s very difficult for me to blow dry my hair straight, and I still need to use my flat iron with this product, but my hair stayed straight the entire day, didn&#x27;t curl or frizz up (even with rain and humidity). It makes my hair feel super soft too, and not greasy the next day like I&#x27;ve noticed with a lot of other products!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product as most of the reviews I had read were positive. I have wavy hair that tends to get frizzy. I have used this product for a couple of weeks and it does not work especially on rainy or humid days. I have to agree with the other negative reviewers that product leaves hair feeling sticky. This product is also very drying - one of the main ingredients is alcohol so that is not surprising. I have had better results with Living Proof products. They are expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly, and very long hair. The top layers of my hair get frizzy specially in humid. And just like most of you, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything in the market. none worked so far.  This one doesn&#x27;t do much for controlling the frizz and the worse part is it totally ripped the color off my hair after a couple of uses. I have highlights and I only use the product on my top layers and now there is a huge difference between my highlights on top layers and the rest of my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this for color treated fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d more or less given up on trying to straighten my hair. My hair is normally type 3 according to naturallycurly.com, which means they&#x27;re defined but still very soft (think Taylor Swift or Debra Messing). For some reason though, no products ever worked despite not having particularly stubborn hair. I think the problem with most other straightening products is they try to moisturize and reduce frizz, which merely leaves me with moist frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKED. I used probably 15 sprays on my towel-dried hair because I have a lot of it. Five minutes blow-drying with my brush attachment and it&#x27;s stick straight. I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron it! I&#x27;m flabbergasted. It has no smell and leaves your hair soft and not-greasy. No word yet on how long it lasts, this is the first day. I&#x27;ll update as soon as the three days are up. Things are looking good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So a lot more than three days have passed, but whatever. After the first day my hair started to kink out again, but a quick run with a straightener fixed it. I&#x27;ve discovered that what this spray really does is make your hair very malleable without adding grease. I&#x27;ve started using the spray, drying my hair with a comb attachment, then rolling my hair up in pin curls (no heat, just bobby pins). After five minutes I let them down and my hair is wonderfully wavy and it lasts for days. I would suggest this product for anyone who&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
    <li> This Product is OK. it does work, but at the same time it has two really big drawbacks.    Positives: It does keep my hair straight for the three days and pretty silky (I have really curly hair that tends to frizz when its humid). It didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and I like that it had a heat protectant in the product. The bottle has a spray nozzel attached which I was happy about as I hate having to put gunk in my hands and then comb in through my hair with my fingers.    Negatives: the directions have you spray on damp or wet hair (specifically said NOT dry hair) so having to straighten wet curly hair is really HARD it makes hair extremely fluffy and I feel like I&#x27;m giving my self a mess of split ends with the constant brushing. my usual routine is to wait for my hair to dry completly before attempting to straighten which took around 20-25mins. This way takes around a 45-65 minutes so it makes the whole process about a half-hour longer.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to de-frizz and straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) just straight iron&lt;br /&gt;2) just blow dry&lt;br /&gt;3) no straight iron or blowdry, just the spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try the blow dry and straight iron as the instructions stated because I don&#x27;t have time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blow dry only worked the best. 3 days later, my hair was still straight and had less frizz without any other styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it would work w/o blow dry or straight iron, but guess not.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, and wavy hair...this product did NOTHING for my satisfaction. It left my hair thicker, which is not what I wanted. The flat iron did more to straightened my hair than the actual product. I do not reccommend this product at all, and especially if you have thick, long hair like I do (Hispanic-type hair).</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. I have medium-thick curly hair, but it doesnt get frizzy, and whenever I straighten my hair it stays nice for about 10 minutes. This product helped a lot. I&#x27;ve never had to blow dry my hair straight before, as I usually just let it dry naturally then straighten. But, when I did blow dry it came out pretty well. A little curl in the ends but that was it. I then straightened it in sections like it said to and it looked really good. I finish it off with either EverSleek Frizz Taming Creme Serum or Awapuhi Styling Treatment Oil to give it a nice shiny look. Unlike all the other times I straightened my hair, it stayed nice and straight much longer than usual, until I went outside for about an hour. It only got a little wavy which is good for my hair. Even when I went to workout, it only got a little curly on the ends from sweating. Once I got home I showered (without washing my hair) and re-straightened it. Even after going to sleep it stayed straight. I wore it in a ponytail the next day and now on my third day, it only has a slight wave in it and looks very good. All in all, this product is very helpful to people with wavy or curly hair and I would definitley recommend it to a friend.    Also, I&#x27;m not sure why people say this makes their hair sticky, as I had no problem with stickiness. All it did was make my hair much shinier. Also, on the third day, I used a dry shampoo so my hair looked much fresher. I recommend using either one from TreSemme or Suave.    I used this product a second time and am even happier now than before. My hair looks amazing! Only straightened it once and it&#x27;s still straight 13 hours later!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, and it is the only product that I have found in any price range that tames my extreme frizz-prone hair in the humid summer. I dread the day that this product may no longer be available! I find that I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with this product, as the heat from my dryer flattens out even my most stubborn curls, and keeps them straight even through the hot, rainy days. When the dewpoint reading exceeds 55, my hair is unmanageable without this product; what a world of difference after using it!</li>
    <li> My hair is not super-curly, just that frizzy kind of wavy. I straighten it daily. Which usually is fine, but on humid days it just doesnt want to stay straight. That is until I used this product! Use it on wet hair, blow dry then flat iron, and it stayed straight through 2 rainy days! No frizz and re-curl!</li>
    <li> i have hair that is on any given day, atrocious. i finally had the brazilian silk treatment a year ago and it changed my life. however, i have kinky,curly,frizzy hair and live in a high humidity state, so in between keratin treatments, still need help to keep it manageable. i do the brazilian silk in a salon every 6 months, am on month 5, so the regrowth is tough to keep tamed.  i tried this and i have tried EVERYTHING on the market. this does exactly what it says it does. it keeps your hair straight and frizz free til your next shampoo. it definitely leaves a residue if you use too much. it has taken me several times to figure out how much i need to use, once i got that down, it has been amazing.  you have to use a good hot iron, one that can heat up to a fairly high temp(i use the joico reconstructor), to seal in the keratin that is in the spray. i still used a little chi silk infusion oil on top of this to give it a little gloss, before i blew dry and applied a little once again after hot ironing. my hair felt healthier and looked much nicer than it normally does.  i paid for this, so i have no incentive to give this a good rating.</li>
    <li> This product has completely transformed my dry, frizzy hair into beautiful and straight hair.   I have to admit I was a bit hesitant when I bought it b/c nothing works on me. I have naturally wavy, frizzy, thick hair that I normally blow dry w/out a brush (just blow dry all over the place)and then I go over it w/ my flat iron. When I&#x27;m done it looks fabulous but 5 minutes later it starts to frizz and if I get hot or it&#x27;s humid forget about...it reverts back to it&#x27;s natural state. Not pretty at all and it makes me self conscious. When I read the instructions on this product I was a bit discouraged that I&#x27;d have to blow dry it straight completely to see the desired results but I have to admit it was so easy to do. I don&#x27;t really know how to blow dry my hair, but w/ this prod it makes it super easy and it looks so good after I am done that I almost don&#x27;t have to flatiron it but I still do. I go over all of it w/ my flat iron and it only takes a couple minutes b/c it is already straight. I have even started curling it instead of straightening. I have gotten many compliments on this!!   I&#x27;m sure that it could last 3 days straight but not on me, and that is ok! It looks beautiful the first day, at night I either try to hold it in a low pony tail (not to tight so it doesn&#x27;t leave a crease in my hair) and I keep the fan on so I don&#x27;t sweat, and the next day I go over it w/ the flat iron and it looks fabulous! By the third day it is somewhat oily so I can either wash it or curl it but I can&#x27;t go more than 2 days w/ washing it so that&#x27;s what I do.      *****I have noticed that if any water comes into contact w/ my hair it does get sticky. As long as I can keep it dry it feel soft and silky. I am completely ecstatic and am actually on my way to buy some more cause I am almost out.    I sincerely hope John Frieda never stops making this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Let me start of with this...I&#x27;m bi-racial, and my hair is more on the kinky side (as I still relax my hair every 2 months or so).  I am in dire need of another perm (relaxer), but am trying my best to keep from putting chemicals in my hair.  So right around when I felt like I needed another relaxer, I used this product instead and the outcome was phenominal....of course, as if states on the directions, you use this with conjunction with a flat iron...and it really works!  The straightening was better, lasted longer and I gauge that I may need to used way more sprays than the 7-10 sprays that the directions recommended, but the more longer or more volume your hair is, you will need more sprays.  So roughly, for the little amount that I paid for...I think I&#x27;ll get about 3-5 uses for only $10.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you bought this product already and hate it, try it again and experiment with the right amount that works for you. It took me a few tries. I have extremely thick coarse hair but after reading some of the reviews here I was concerned with using too much. Apparently my hair requires more to achieve the best results. It never felt sticky or gummy. Also, for best results, I found using the flat iron to refresh the results day two helped a lot. It&#x27;s important to remember when buying this product it is an over the counter at home use meaning it&#x27;s more subjected to user non-professional error. Be sure to completely blow dry your hair and use a good flat iron. I use a chi flat iron. Overall, this product delivered desired results for a great price and lived up to the claims, you may just need to have patience with getting it right</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I use it in tandem with the straightening cream and it makes my very curly hair nice and straight with just a little bit of body / bounce. (I actually had someone tell me that they thought I was still getting keratin done on my hair!!! I will take this price over the price of a keratin treatment any day!) Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t smell strongly (or bad), and works like it says that it will.</li>
    <li> Okay so I saw a commericial on the tv for this product and said hey maybe it&#x27;s worth a shot because it was not too expensive and decided what the heck. I have long, very thick curly Italian hair, or a horse&#x27;s mane which I like to call it, that is very hard to straighten and to keep straight. The bottle tells you to use like 15 sprays well that is bologna I use atleast 40 sprays but I guess it depends on your hair and I have a lot. It makes my hair very soft and shiny and does not weight it down or make it sticky like others say. I was actually very surprised when using this product and have been using it every time I straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Does a great job in reducing frizz and keeps my hair straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy, thin hair that curls at the slightest dampness and refuses to straighten completely unless I spend almost an hour on it, and it still doesn&#x27;t look that great at the end of the day. With this product, I am able to easily keep my hair straight all day (even when it&#x27;s rainy!). Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy at all. I&#x27;m very happy with it because I&#x27;ve never been able to wear my hair down often before due to the amount of time and messiness, but now I can.</li>
    <li> I think it may help with the frizz. I don&#x27;t know about the heat.</li>
    <li> I have long to medium hair. Excellent product. Kept hair frizz free and silky for a week. Totally Worthy buy</li>
    <li> This product did make my hair straighter, but seemed to do it by just weighting it down.  The result was my hair lost much of it&#x27;s body and by the second day just looked and felt like it was covered with alot of product and needed to be washed (I used the mid level of the recommended amount).  It is a good price point, but not worth the savings vs other products out there in the $20 range.</li>
    <li> I have coarse curly hair and this product smooths my hair when I want it straight and last until I wash my hair. It is light weight and not greasy as some products are</li>
    <li> Love this product and this seller! !!</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says.  I get brazillian Keratin treatments during the spring/summer/early fall months at the salon and will probably continue to do so, but this product is great for in-between treatments and a lot more affordable than going to the salon. I don&#x27;t flat iron.  I wash my hair, spray it when it is wet/damp, and blow dry. I&#x27;ve also found that my hair takes a curl much better when I use a curling iron.  I have wavy (not curly) and naturally frizzy hair and think this product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have fine dry color treated spiral curly hair that tends to frizz and look like straw on humid days. This is the best product i have ever tried. i absolutely can&#x27;t heat style my hair regularly without ruining it, turning it to a completely messing dry straw, and having to cut it off. I want to grow back my long spiral curls, so I absolutely have to stay away from heat styling. I use this on my hair wet, then toss and scrunch to encourage the spiral waves, then leave it air dry. Then after mostly dry i fluff it to make it less stiff and more natural looking. Best solution for my hair. You can use this product without going straight and heat styling - make beautiful non-fizzy spirals wiht a little scrunching while it air dries. I also use a leave in conditioner before using this product.</li>
    <li> I live in Phoenix, Arizona and during monsoon seaston (June - September) the humidity is terrific.  My hair is usually frizzed just from my 5:00 am yard watering and continues to get worse throughout the day.  With this product, my hair does not frizz unless I sweat intensely (in which case I wash may hair again anyway).  I am 65 and have thinning hair.  I use Minoxidil 2%(with success I might add) and I did not want to have my hair professionally straightened as I feared harsh chemicals would cause further hair loss and/or conflict with the Minoxidil.  This product it a great solution.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go more than 2 days without shampooing so cannot comment on the 3 day thing.  I typically do not need anything other than a light weight styling creme when the humidity is low.  But when the humidity goes up, my bangs get \\&quot;weird\\&quot;.  I use very little over all and just a tad more on my bangs.  Also, I avoid the ends of my hair so as not to dry  them out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great tool for getting your style to stay more than 1 day. I use it when straightening my hair or when I curl my hair (my hair isn&#x27;t naturally curly, just naturally wavvy). It&#x27;s nice to have the 2nd or an occasional 3rd day without having to redo my style from scratch. When I use this on the day I wash my hair, the following days I can just comb through it or add a few quick touch ups with the straightening iron or curling iron and it&#x27;s ready to go.     Tips for Application: I personally like to have my hair mostly dry before I apply. Yes, it is a little sticky (like hair spray) when you apply it, but after it dries it&#x27;s more like the feel of collagen products that are soft and add an extra little bit of sheen to your hair.    Nice product.</li>
    <li> I have always had very thick hair that tends to be very dry. When I was younger it had a nice curl to it but now that I&#x27;m 40 its just a frizzy kinky mess. I&#x27;ve been straightening it for the last 10 years and needless to say all that time with a flat iron and highlights has taken its toll. Basically tried this product because I have tried just about everything else that comes out promising frizz free hair. Let me say- THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO. Been using for a couple of months now and have had numerous people comment on how healthy my hair looks lately and ask what I&#x27;m using to make it look so good. I usually don&#x27;t go three days without washing my hair, but I do normally wash it every other day. My hair looks even BETTER on the second day and a few times I have gone 3 days and it still looks good! My Hair is softer and silky then it has ever been and it stays straight. Even takes less time to straighten it.   BTW- I have looked at a lot of reviews on this product and most people feel like I do about it. I saw a couple on a different site that complained it made their hair sticky and knotted up. Make sure to follow the instructions- spray on while hair is wet, use the blow dryer(I section mine and brush straight while drying) and then when its COMPLETELY dry go ahead and style with your flat iron. Also, the only time mine ever felt even slightly sticky and knotty was one day when I got really crazy and over applied it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It holds the hair straight even after an unexpected light rain...</li>
    <li> Moving from a low humidity state to constantly humid state turned my hair to frizz.  John Frieda 3 Day Straight made me like my hair again.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky naturally curly hair. I had my hair chemically straightened by a hairdresser many years ago. It lasted for almost two weeks. Way too expensive to do on a regular basis so dealt with the tangled mass for years. I would blow dry it, curlers (which softened the kinks) and let it go natural. My youngest daughter has my hair and the oldest (who has very fine straight hair) decided to straighten the youngest with a wand. We tried different brands of heat protectors but the didn&#x27;t work that well and if there was a hint of moisture the hair would start to frizz. Decided to try John Frieda and I am hooked! I always wanted straight hair and this does it! Not only is it straight, it&#x27;s soft! It will stay this way until I wash it! I have been using this product for two years and I LOVE it! I don&#x27;t use it during the summer as we swim just about every day. Once the pool is closed up, the Frieda comes out!</li>
    <li> Could no longer find it in stores where I shop.  I am thrilled to have found it again.  It really works.</li>
    <li> This spray is simply amazing. I cannot tell you how many products i&#x27;ve tried for my frizzy curly hair, that frizzes as soon as i walk outside into the humidity. Slightly still frizzy, but definitely stays straight for the 3 days. I&#x27;ve tested it by doing my normal hair routine and using the product and again with not using the product and i see a difference. Keep in mind that you must dry your hair straight and then straighten it right after for it to work!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I have triend numerous products and was never happy. I would definately recommend buying this.  It makes your hair frizz free, silky straight.  I never write reviews but for this I just had to.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for a year as part-dare, part \\&quot;I wanna see how I look\\&quot; challenge. Bought this the other day. After showering, I sprayed about 10 sprays in to my hair (My hair is not long, but extremely thick, wavy, and frizzes like no tomorrow) Waited till it dried, then set my flat iron to a good heat. Then... it felt totally gross. I did half of my head, then decided to use hair serum with it (I use the Fructis Sleek and Shine Hair serum) and it came out wonderful. So my advice is, get a good hair serum and use it together, because this product alone did not work well with me. It does keep it straight for more than a day, as all I have to do is brush it to get any kinks out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and it is tough to find in most pharmacies. I thought that JF was going to stop producing it and when I found it on-line and at a great price I knew that I had to order a couple of bottles just in case.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that I straighten and tried this product becuase it&#x27;s very humid where I live during the summer. I saw no difference in how straight my hair was after using this product (I usually wear my hair up during the summer because straightened or not, if outside in the humidity for any length of time my hair frizzes) - I went out after using this product, wore my hair down to test it&#x27;s effectivness - Was only outside for a few minutes and when I checked the results my hair was frizzier than it is when I only straighten (without using an anti frizz product) my hair and wear it up. It may work well for people with hair that only slightly frizzes in humidity but for thick, long, curly hair that naturally frizzes it doesn&#x27;t seem to help. I will say that after my hair frizzed after using after twisting it into a bun to sleep overnight it was frizz free the next morning when I took it down but after using the product and going outside directly afterwards, the frizz was still there and seemingly worse than usual.</li>
    <li> This product got pretty good reviews, but for me it is a definite, never buy again.  My hair is not overly curly, but gets very wavy. If I put enough of this stuff in to make it work, my hair is so sticky I can barely comb it. If I use the recommended amount, it does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has nothing to do with Amazon, still a great place to buy on line.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It gives my fine, wavy hair a frizz-free straight style that lasts through a convertible ride.</li>
    <li> This straightens my hair so easily and I have unruly damaged hair. Makes my hair so soft and manageable. Would def recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It is only day 2 but wow, I have to say this is the best my hair has felt in a long time!  I have tried many products and that could have been the problem, too much junk in my hair to weigh it down.  Now it is so light and fluffy and feels so much better.  I hope it continues because this product is much more reasonably priced then other ones I have used!</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine, and the review held true. Now, I do have pretty straight hair already, but if I blow dry my hair without this stuff, it can get wavy, especially on more humid days. Something to know, you spray this on damp hair, and then blow dry. It keeps the frizzies down as well.  If you put too much on, your hair will feel sticky, and gross. Only one spray/single coat is fine.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I am totally addicted to it. I have been fighting my curls all my life. This not only makes it easier to straighten my hair but does a good job of protecting my straight hair from humidity especially if you use it in combination with a flat iron</li>
    <li> The best straightener for natural hair! You must use enough like 15 sprays.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair straight for three days (keeps to promises, what a concept!). I spray it in and blow dry my naturally wavy hair. If it&#x27;s going to be a night out or I want an extra sleek look I follow up with a few passes of a straightener. Has the added bonus of giving shine and softness to hair. Love it. This is my 5th bottle in about two years (I don&#x27;t use it when I keep my hair curly so I don&#x27;t go through it like crazy, otherwise I would be on bottle 15)</li>
    <li> If you have trouble with humidity and frizzy hair like I do, then this product is worth the extra time, effort and money.  This particular product goes on WET hair, before you blow it dry and it says so on the bottle.  It is priced similar to Walmart, so if you&#x27;re placing an Amazon order any way, may as well get the Frizz Ease through them.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but it works perfectly</li>
    <li> Makes my hair fill stiff and hard. I like my hair straight but not the filling of 5lbs of hair spray straight</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, very wavy hair. In terms of straightening, this product is just okay. I had to use a lot to get any results and the the product comes in only 3.5 oz for between $7-8 i.e. way too much for what it is. I basically saw no change to my frizz. The only thing that has ever truly tamed my frizz was a professional keratin treatment by a brand called Keralyze, which is now out of business- not sure why. However, I have used way more effective temporary straightening and antifrizz products than this.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I loved it. I have very thick and frizzy hair that is wavy on the bottom and curly on the top layers. It worked wonders. I could blow dry my hair almost perfectly straight and not have too much to have to go back and straighten.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t compelled to write a review though until today when it amazed me. I was running errands and walked out of a store and was walking to my car when all of a sudden it started pouring rain. I got completely soaked and my straightened hair immediately went back to being curly. I ran a couple more errands (soaked clothes and running mascara and all) and then went home. When I got home, I brushed my hair and it went fairly straight. Then I blow dried it really quick and it went back to how straight it was before I ever got it wet. That would never happen normally and I was super impressed! I love this product and don&#x27;t straighten my hair often but when I do, I always use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very leery of using a flatiron spray with alcohol in it. I usually use a heavy on the silicone spray. My Italian hair is course and curly and 6&amp;#34; past my shoulders with long layers. I stopped using the chemical relaxers and have been wearing it curly. I wanted to try a different product and really like the whole Frizz-Ease line of products. I shampood and conditioned with the anti frizz John Frieda products. I sprayed much, much more than 15 sprays because I wanted all hair covered. I blew it out with a paddle brush and it usually is a frizzy mess at this point, which it was. It felt sticky, which I hate. I usually just use serum before using the flatiron. After using the flatiron at 450 degrees, doing small sections, I was amazed! My hair looks silky, full of body, shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I put a little serum on it after. It has more body at the crown than when I use the oilier stuff. I&#x27;m happy that I took a chance and tried this.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and just used this product, and have to say I love it and make my hair looks to sleak, straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> I am cursed with naturally very thick, coarse, curly, unruly hair and have tried every product on the market. I spend a fortune on conditioners, shampoos, serums, and abuse my hair with daily flat ironing. This product WORKS! My hair actually looks better than it did when I paid $400 for a Brazilian blowout. After doing this treatment, my hair is totally straight, shiny, silky, and bouncy and healthy looking. I used this product on a day when I wasn&#x27;t even planning to leave my house but ended up going out because I looked too amazing to stay home!! I just wish there was a treatment out there that was this affordable, effective, and convenient, that lasted longer than three days. This is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 3 weeks ago and I LOVE IT!!!  I have 4 different types of hair; straight, curly, kinky and wavy - all of which are FRIZZY.  I&#x27;ve used John Frieda&#x27;s products for YEARS!  This product works better than any I&#x27;ve used - including expensive products I bought at the beauty salon.  I also use both John Frieda straightening shampoo and \\&quot;Smooth Start\\&quot; conditioner, as well as Pantene \\&quot;Curls to Straight\\&quot; shampoo &amp; conditioner (I also use \\&quot;Pantene Restorative Frizz Control\\&quot; on very humid days).  After shampooing, I spray in 3-Day Straight and use a little of the \\&quot;Clearly Defined\\&quot; gel (also John Frieda).  Whether I use the flat iron or a large barrel curling iron, I get great results.  I don&#x27;t understand the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; comments that have been made; I&#x27;ve not had that experience.  I do notice my hair is very shiny, especially when I use the flat iron.  Once I&#x27;ve curled/flat ironed my hair, I use John Frieda&#x27;s \\&quot;Secret Weapon\\&quot; and \\&quot;Moisture Barrier\\&quot; hairspray.    I know this sounds like I have stock in John Frieda - not so.  At almost 50 years of age, I&#x27;ve had vast experience with different types of products on the market.  There probably aren&#x27;t many that I haven&#x27;t tried.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t have these products when I was younger!  Now I can&#x27;t imagine what I did without them all those years!      Needless to say, I certainly believe this is money well-spent.  AND---it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than many other products out there!!!</li>
    <li> I was getting keratin treatments at the salon but, my stylist refuses to do them now because of the Formaldehyde.  Not wanting to live with the frizz in my hair, I have tried every over-the counter remedy for Frizz that I could get my hands on.  Each one left my hair just as curly and frizzy as it would have been had I used nothing.  I was hesitant to try this one because I had been let down so often in the past and there are several negative reviews here but, this stuff works.  I don&#x27;t know why some people have issues with sticky hair, mine is just as soft and shiny as it ever was after the salon treatments.  It also smells really good!  I used about 20 sprays and I have medium length thin hair so, I can&#x27;t imagine that the 15 they recommend would be too much.  My hair is very curly so that might make a difference.  I did need to use the flat iron to get the best results.  I think this is worth every penny.  I will be using it for life!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY curly hair that gets totally frizzy and out of control in humid weather.  This stuff works as advertised.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to finish with a flat iron but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for hair that stays smooth.  I live in a VERY humid climate during the summer months.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly. it did  not smooth or straighten at all, my hair is actually smoother and straighter if I use no products whatsoever. This product made it feel like I had product in my hair and made it stickier, not sleek. Oh and the straight/smoothing effect did not even last a full 24 hours. My hair was a hot mess in the morning.</li>
    <li> It left my hair a sticky mess. I am throwing it out after one use. Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> So I recently moved to Tampa and my hair has been a total disaster. I would blow dry and straighten my hair and step outside, and within minutes it would turn into frizzy, curly mess. I had been thinking of getting a Keratin Straightening treatment, but decided to try this first. It is AMAZING! I can&#x27;t believe it. My hair is smooth, shiny and straight and it stays that way. Last night was my birthday and my husband surprised me by taking me out on a sailboat. Normally, within minutes of being in the salty, windy, humid air, my hair would be a mess, but it stayed perfect all night. And today it is still straight. I really can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really works to help keep you hair straight between flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I do love the product, I believe it does make a difference in the way my hair comes out. I do use about 3-4 other products on my hair so it is hard to tell. I do think that this does make a difference in getting my hair straighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used some other products in the John Frieda line and never had a bad experience.  This product is the exception.  It is simply awful.  For years, I&#x27;ve been using KMS Flat Out [[ASIN:B001B5EONC KMS Flat Out Hot Pressed Spray 6.8 oz.]] and decided to try the cheaper John Frieda 3-Day Straight after I saw an ad for it.  Thinking back on my previous positive John Frieda experiences, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply the product to wet hair and then blow dry.  The product indicates that a flat iron can be used for maximum straightness.  I blow dried my hair and the level of straight was laughable because it was not straight at all.  I pulled out the flat iron and while it created a fairly flat effect, my hair wasn&#x27;t as flat as when I used the KMS product.  The 3-Day Straight did do something my KMS product never does -- leave me with a greasy, sticky style.  While I wanted to wash my hair immediately, I decided to test its claimed longevity of three days.  That was also laughable.  I woke up the next day to greasy curls. While the product indicates a flat iron can be used on days two and three for touch ups, I did not see how my hair could be salvaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is junk and I wish I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; invented for curly, coarse, frizzy and difficult to straighten hair (like mine). This is even better than Nexxus Spray  to straighten hair. I use a blow drier and a flat iron. My hair was NEVER this straight, shiny and nice. I will never stop using this.     cblanke1@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Helps keep my wrap straight.  My hair comes out silky and smooth!  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really really really really wanted this product to work. So first my disclaimer - I have fine hair, and the original Frizz Ease never worked well on my hair. However as it had been a long time since I used Frizz Ease, I hoped that this might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product every day for 15 days. When it didn&#x27;t seem to be working well, I experimented with the dampness of my hair and the amount of sprays I used. My first issue is that my hair blow dries curlier and frizzier than it would with any other product on it or even without product on it at all. My hair is mostly wavy with a couple curls here and there when air dried. My second issue is my hair would either be extremely frizzy but feel clean when I used less sprays, or still frizzy but feel greasy and disgusting to touch. I had a couple times where my hair looked a lot better once I straightened it, but 5 seconds out the door it was back to a frizzy wavy/curly mess. It didn&#x27;t matter if I used any kind of finishing product afterward either. Mostly, though, my hair suffered from worse frizz than blow drying it without product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that a lot of people seem to like this product, so it might still be worth trying for your hair. But my hair gets much better results from other products. I also don&#x27;t think straight hair is worth it if I don&#x27;t even want to touch it because it feels so dirty afterward.</li>
    <li> This works like a dream.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> No good.  If you have thick curly hair don&#x27;t bother.  It just created a big frizz mess.  And the frizz isn&#x27;t even straight.  Total waste of time and $$$$. I suppose maybe it does something on thin or wavy hair but not thick curly - forget it.</li>
    <li> Is this the holy grail of all straightners? Maybe not, but I do like it.  I&#x27;m hispanic and although hispanics have somewhat smoother hair when I was in college is when I noticed a major change in my hair.  It is truly unmanageable in its natural form.  This is no exaggeration.  On top I have VERY coarse/kinked hair, it&#x27;s puffy and although it might be \\&quot;curly\\&quot; there are no defined curls, each strand has a mind of its own.  The bottom half of my hair is decent.  Too bad its not the same texture all over!! Anyways, I like this stuff better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s definitely a lot shinier than any product has done, so I&#x27;m satisfied.  I pair this with Aussie Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner (This is a lot better than Redkin All-soft, the more expensive).  Ignore the part where it says straighten while blow dry. I don&#x27;t use a brush, I just blow dry to get my hair dry. I let the Chi flat iron do all the work.  Besides no one has been able to get my hair straight with a brush and blow dryer.  It was a tiny bity sticky, but it seriously didn&#x27;t even bother me.  I&#x27;m eager to find out how this does in the humidity.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, I got it from Target. I decided to write a review here tho so that ppl know what they&#x27;re getting. I had so much hope that this product wld actually help me.i have naturally curly hair, more like loose curls and it&#x27;s not very course. I followed the instructions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and I flat ironed my hair. My hair was soft, gorgeous, fab and bouncy.it. ..UNTIL I went outside. In less than 5 minutes, I looked like a poodle :(My hair is cut into a bob w/bangs that are eyebrow length. After the humidity got me, my bangs look like those bangs ppl had in the 90&#x27;s and of course the &amp;#34;poodle poof&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll add that I live in NE Florida where the humidity is worse than a sauna. Maybe NO frizz fighting treatment is strong enough for Florida tho :/ I have yet to find one that helps even a little bit.i guess the only thing I can do is sit here and wait for the blessed cooler temps :(</li>
    <li> Listen, my hair has been one of the miseries of my life.  Frizzy, curly/wavy -- an absolute mess.  Of course I use a flat iron and in winter it usually looks ok.  But summer in New Orleans (which basically is April - October) is like living in a great big steam room.  I can do my hair and if 10 seconds of humidity hit my hair it&#x27;s over.  I am not being dramatic, trust me.  So, I was considering getting the keratin straightening treatments at the salon.  It seems like it would be the answer to my prayers but I was nervous.  Would my hair be so straight and flat that it would be greasy looking? So I started doing some research and came across a post about this Frizz Ease 3 Day Straightner.  I came to Amazon to read the reviews ( I love love love Amazon by the way) and most were great.  I decided I would try it -- I have a big party planned for tomorrow night so I ran to Walmart tonight to get it.  Washed and sprayed this product in and followed the simple instructions-- blow dry straight then flat iron.  Oh my God!  My hair is STRAIGHT.  It supposed to last 3 days but I wash my hair everyday -- usually because it looks like Medusa after being out running around.  We&#x27;ll see -- maybe I can skip a day.  The next test is how it does in the real world of New Orleans - 98 degrees and 90% humidity.  I&#x27;ll post an update and let everyone know.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this is my new favorite hair product. I have curly hair, which I don&#x27;t mind, but it&#x27;s so frizzy when I do try to wear it straight it doesn&#x27;t even look good. 15 sprays of this product later and I&#x27;m in love! Not only did it make my hair pin straight, it stayed smooth and lovely while I ran around downtown Seattle in the rain and humidity for (4 days now!) After wearing my hair up tight it does require a few touchups with a straightener on the ends, but hardly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything in my hair, most straightening products have left my hair feeling weighed down or greasy, this is the lightest weight, most effective product I have ever tried... and also the least expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 would recommend to anyone wanting straight hair that isn&#x27;t greasy or frizzy.</li>
    <li> I order the straight styling spray for my wife and they sent me a curling styling spray, the same thing happen to my sister in law when she received it.</li>
    <li> To first start off... I bought this from Target, not online on Amazon. My hair is dyed black, &amp; is mixed (Hispanic/African American). I was bombarded with tons of commercials on tv about this product &amp; finally I bought it. I don&#x27;t regret it at all. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this product I get a ton of compliment&#x27;s because it leaves my hair straighter than it&#x27;s ever been in my life. It tends to get sticky if you over spray, so make sure not to do that. I don&#x27;t leave it in for 3 days, but only 2. So, I wouldn&#x27;t know how it would hold up or look by then, but it looks nice on me on the second day. I never thought I would find a product that can tame my frizzy ethnic hair. So far, these all these Frizz-Ease products work miracles! My hair looks absolutely GORGEOUS. I will re-purchase again. :D</li>
    <li> I have the most thick, frizzy, course hair in the world and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to be straight and not frizzy!  I&#x27;ve thinned it out (helped a little, but not much), tried every leave-in conditioner that exists, and even got a $200 straightening treatment at a salon but none of it worked.  Then my mom bought me this product a few weeks ago.  PERFECT.  It makes my hair half as thick (in a good way), and there&#x27;s hardly any friz.  Just remember that you MUST use a flat iron for the product to work. If you don&#x27;t, your hair will be slightly less frizzy but it won&#x27;t make much of a difference. And it doesn&#x27;t matter what the quality of your flat iron is because mine was only like $10.00 and it works wonderfully. Seriously, you have to try this stuff.</li>
    <li> Perfect and extremely effective to battle and tame aggressive curls. The product works well and helps keep frizz at bay.</li>
    <li> My hair is a massive pain-even using my chi straightener with the super expensive flat iron chi sprays, I&#x27;ve never had success like I did with this product. Will be stocking up on this! Only down side-if you do it, leave it for three days, then wash and do it again, by the sith day your hair looks nasty and greasy. Will stick to using this only once a week</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I think that it was well worth the buy. Some people have stated that you have to use a great deal of it, which I think depends on the type of hair you have. I have very thick and coarse African American hair that I typically wear in it&#x27;s natural state. I bought this in early November and have used it several times since. It is now almost mid January, and I think I can still get about 2 more uses out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find that the effectiveness of this product also depends on what you combine it with. Even though it includes heat protection, I still recommend using an additional one. I found that the first time, when I used just this spray, my hair was a little dry afterwards.  It will also depend on the straightener you use and how well you blow dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, because my hair is very thick and coarse, I will leave my hair straightened for a week or two at a time. With light touch up with the straightener, as well as keeping it moisturized with other hair oils, it will stay pretty straight. I usually alternate wearing it straight for a week or two, then I was it every day for a week or two and wear it naturally to let it stay nicely conditioned and keep it from drying out. Again, I think the amount of time you get out of this spray will depend on how much time you spend initially straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a very good product. You just have to keep in mind that it is a styling aid, and will not replace the effects of a good straightener, but will work well in conjunction with one.</li>
    <li> I have taken to my blog to complain about my frizzy hair many times and all the products that I have tried to tame it. From different shampoos, top of the line straighteners, gels, mousse, hair spray, etc, I have tried many, many products. My latest shot was given to John Frieda Frizz Ease 3-Day Straight Styling Spray. I had started to see the commercials on TV with the models with the gorgeous straight and shiny locks flouncing about, and then I saw the product for only $10 at my local Walgreens. Why not, right? So I bought it, eagerly went home and showered, then sprayed the product throughout my hair 15 times. The directions say to apply to damp or wet hair, with 7-15 sprays. My hair is always super frizzy, so I thought the 15 would really help. I also have long hair (halfway down my back) and it is very fine and thin, and the wavy kind of curly. Back to the spraying. Got the 15 sprays in, then blow-dried my hair, also according to the directions. After a thorough blow-dry came the straightening. I have an expensive Chi straightener, one that gets super hot super fast. When I got done straightening my hair looked....worse than it usually does! It was hard and clumpy and even though I had just showered, it looked oily and dirty. And was on frizz-overload. Fail.&lt;br /&gt;Take two. I assumed that using 15 sprays was too much. I tried again the following week. Shampoo, condition, rinse, spray (10 sprays this time), blow-dry, straighten. Results...same. Gross looking hair, even frizzier than when I did my normal routine of just using a straightening gel. Fail.&lt;br /&gt;Take three. This was going to be my final attempts with the spray. Tried only 7 sprays this time, thinking it was simply my fault for using too much product and that was causing my hair to look icky. But the results were once again the same. My hair looked even more frizzy (which I truly thought was impossible with the amount of frizz my hair showcases), it looked dirty, and it felt gross to touch.&lt;br /&gt;My results were not at all pleasant. This spray has been chucked to the back of my linen closet in disgust. I won&#x27;t lie- I have heard some good things about John Frieda, and really held out hope that this was going to work for me. I have read the other reviews on Amazon saying it worked like a charm and I am dumbfounded. Not sure if you need a certain hair type to achieve the results. I know this spray is supposed to turn your curls to straight, but also reduce the amount of frizz. While it may have helped straighten the kinks a little bit, they straightness didn&#x27;t last for three days, and there is no way I could keep me hair unwashed for that amount of time looking as dirty as it did. I will not be recommending this product, and my quest to tame the frizz continues.t at all pleasant. This spray has been chucked to the back of my linen closet in disgust.

    <li> I see no difference using this product to try to style my hair straight.  Expensive for just seeming like water.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I know I won&#x27;t be washing my hair for a few days. I have very curly hair and this helps keep it straight!</li>
    <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair.  I also color it.  I hated my hair until I tried this product.  It takes some time to blow it straight and then flat-iron it, but this product definitely helps it hold the smooth, straight look.  I avoid rain and I can make my straight hair last almost a week, by using dry shampoo inbetween.  I will buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> USE IT EVERY TIME I WASH MY STRAIGHISH BLONDE HAIR....EVERY BIT HELPS TO GET THAT STRAIGHT LOOK. THESE PRODUCTS ARE CHEAP, BUT THEY REALLY WORK..........DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID OF not BEING RIPPED OFF WITH SALON PPPRODUCTS. I USE BOTH. THESE ARE JUST AS GOOD!</li>
    <li> I brought this product have used it for 2 months now and I am so happy. I have curly hair that reverts easily. I followed the directions, sprayed the product on the hair while wet combed through, blow dried, and then used my flat iron. I also used a frizz free serum when flat ironing. My hair remained straight for 1 wk. It remained straight through showers, rain, and workouts at the gym. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair naturally and tried the John Frieda Frizz Ease 3-Day Straight Styling Spray to help reduce the amount of time required getting ready in the morning.  I found that it works well when applied directly after washing my hair.  It does not work as well when applied with or after a leave in conditioner.  For best results, apply to clean, wet hair and blow dry your hair right away.  It does not work well if I let my hair air dry and then try to blow out or flat iron it later.  Also, I would not recommend using it too often as it does tend to dry my hair out a bit which could result in damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I have found it to be a good useful product.</li>
    <li> I have Indian, thick, curly frizzy hair. I have tried EVERYTHING out there product wise to keep my hair straight in the humidity and until this product came along NOTHING had worked. I put this product to the ultimate test when I was recently in Miami- I used my normal shampoo &amp; conditioner then towel dried my hair and used about 8-10 sprays for my entire head (i have thick, long, mid back length hair) and then it took me about 10 min to blow dry my hair with a round brush and I could already see the difference- my hair was much straighter and much less frizzy. I then quickly ran a straighter over, and my hair was silky, straight amazing without being greasy. It still had a lot of volume and it stayed straight the whole day! This product has changed my hair- DEFINITELY A MUST if you have curly hair and live in a humid place. Great price too!!</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm if u have good curly hair. It worked for my friend. But for me it was pencil straight for just few hrs. There after it started curling up. :( but this product is surely better than many products out there. Give it a shot..u might love it.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I put it in and my hair got hard and gross, it felt more like a hairspray than a de-frizz. And my hair was still super frizzy after I used it.</li>
    <li> Best kept secret!  Really works to straighten hair when blow drying.  I stopped doing the $400 pro straightening because of this and I have thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I think that maybe this is not the right product for everyone, but it works wonders on my hair. I have very difficult hair, and this stuff is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried out a lot of products). My hair is thin, but wavy/curly and very frizzy. When I use this stuff, I straighten my hair and it stays smooth and straight until I get it wet! When I don&#x27;t use it, my hair starts to get poofy and frizzy not long after straightening it. This product has helped me out so much and the price isn&#x27;t bad either when you consider what other products go for.</li>
    <li> I tried this several times and although my hair is just wavy it did not work at all. Next morning it had curled and not stayed straight. It did not work any better than a cheap local hair spray. Could it be because I am in humid Domincan Republic? Still I would think I would have a better result.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and have been using it exclusively for the last couple of years. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my frizzy mess under control in the Georgia humidity.</li>
    <li> I am a greek gal with extremely thick curly and alas, as I have aged frizzy hair. I wore my hair curly until about 7 years ago when I discovered the flat iron. First off, I never ever blow dry my hair as I really find it to be an unnecessary step. I wash my hair using Eufora shampoo and conditioner, add some Eufora  beautifying serum then use about 8 sprays of three day straight and then I let it air dry. Once dry I spray some Eufora illuminate shine mist, flat iron  and I am good to good to go for three days with just a little touch up. This stuff works great for me. I must add, my daughter is a cosmetologist hence my using Eufora but not a product snob. Think she might be disappointed I use other products on my hair. She is the one responsible for my hair being healthy again but it makes it easier for me. When she does my hair it is Eufora all the way.</li>
    <li> Works well, repeat purchase</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous.  It helps me keep my hair straight for at least 5 days.  Its not sticky and my hair isn&#x27;t reacting to it in any bad manner.  For example, some things make my hair feel a bit crunchy.  But this product goes on, does its job and then washes off.  All good.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy either, but I have learned to use a small amount.  My hair is about 5 inches below my shoulders and all I use is about 3 squirts.  If I use 5 or more, it makes my hair feel heavy.  No distinctive aroma that will interfere with my own perfume either.</li>
    <li> I looked forward to trying this product because of the primarily positive reviews. My hair is VERY fine, long, and wavy (type 2B according to the Naturally Curly website). For whatever reason, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair has become more difficult to style - it was always easy to style either straight or wavy, but now it&#x27;s really cowlicky and weird, which is why I bought this product. My main goal with ANY hair product is to reduce the amount of time spent styling my hair - I will never be able to \\&quot;wash &amp; go\\&quot; (unfortunately), so anything that makes styling a little easier and quicker is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t really do either of those things. I spent the same amount of time as usual styling my hair, and it really didn&#x27;t look any different than it does any other day. I think it may have reduced a bit of the wave here and there, but not significantly enough for me to HAVE to have this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it made my hair look amazing, I&#x27;d probably forgive the fact that it didn&#x27;t decrease my styling time. However, I think my hair basically just looks and feels the same as if I&#x27;d not used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or heavy like some other reviewers have noted, but it didn&#x27;t do much of *anything* for me, unfortunately. I think I still need to continue my search for a (probably nonexistent) product that makes my hair a little less of a pain!</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS!!  I am a Latina and I have course, thick and wavy/curly hair. I&#x27;ve spent tons on expensive salon products and treatments.  I gave this a try because I try everything once in hopes of finding a less expensive alternative.  It is amazing. No sticky or oily feel left on hair.  It keeps hair straight (with very minor flat iron touch-ups) for three days.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I told my hair stylist about it, and of course he snubbed it because it&#x27;s \\&quot;John Frieda\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t care. The only thing that made me hesistant in the beginning is that the instructions require that you first blow dry hair straight with the product before flat-ironing.  I ususally air dry my hair at night and flat iron in the morning.  I was concerned about the extra heat on my hair with blow drying, but to my surprise, after following the directions, my hair was almost completely straight. I followed up with the flat iron and it was done in a quarter of the time it usually takes me.  It works. Period.</li>
    <li> Worked for me. The first time I tried 7 sprays and my hair was straight but not very shiny, and it did last 3 days.  The 2nd time I tried 15 sprays and it worked great.  All the ladies at work asked if I just had my hair done, because unless I just came from the hairdresser, it looks like a frizzy mess by the time I get to work - looked great in the mirror at home. I used a blow dryer at warm setting with a boar hair round brush, and a straightener at the lowest setting.  I usually have to use 5 different products to achieve this look (leave-in conditioner, straightening creme, gel, anti-frizz (shiny) spray and hair spray). I only used 2 - leave-in conditioner and 3-day spray.</li>
    <li> works fine. not keep my hair in rain, though. too much appilication is not good either.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, wiry and fine, so I have a lot of difficulty styling it. My secret weapon against a particularly troublesome cowlick is this 3-day Straight styling spray. I spritz the cowlick 2 or 3 times, then iron it out with my Conair 2-in-1 curling iron (it&#x27;s a curling iron/blow dryer combo). It tames the cowlick for far longer than the advertised 3 days. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005A43X Conair Hot Air Curling Combo, 1.5 Inch]]</li>
    <li> I have tried other JF products and they have worked very well for me. However, this one burnt my scalp and made it extremely itchy and I am not a person who experiences sensitivity to many beauty products. The ingredients are not even listed on the bottle (is that legal?) so I am unsure what is causing the reaction. I wanted to post in case anyone else has a similar reaction.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and straighten it on a daily basis.  In the summer months, the humidity will immediately begin the wave, then curl in my hair.  I bought the whole John Frieda 3-Day Straight system (serum and sprays) ................... They did NOTHING, except add more layers of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on my hair!  Not worth a penny spent!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a bad review, however in this case I just couldn&#x27;t ignore the horrible result. I followed the instructions and my hair turned into a sticky mass, super frizzy with absolutely no shine. It took me 3 washes to get it all out. Do not use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would get rid of the excessive frizz that I have. I have no issue getting my hair straight, but I have a horrible problem keeping it from getting frizzy. In short, it works okay. I don&#x27;t have enough pros to outweigh the cons, so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. But I will continue using it until I&#x27;m out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I sprayed about 15-17 times on one section of hair (like the bottle recommends). I have incredibly thick hair. I&#x27;m African-American and I think I discovered that I have type 3C hair. After I blow dried my hair. I use a pro babyliss blow dryer and I have left reviews on amazon for the blow dryer stating that it gets my hair as straight as a flat iron would. I wouldn&#x27;t normally flat iron after I used the blow dryer (if I hadn&#x27;t used this 3-day straight spray). After using this spray with my blow dryer, my hair felt weighed down and over conditioned. If I had a finer type of hair, I might call it \\&quot;greasy.\\&quot; I had no other option but to flat iron my hair (which is good, because this product says it doesnt work if you don&#x27;t flat iron it). I finished with John Frieda frizz-ease hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I flat ironed it, it felt no better. Still weighed down by product. It WAS, however, incredibly straight. But, like I said, I don&#x27;t have a problem getting my hair straight. My problem is keeping it straight. I went outside and bam. The frizz hit me. It was less frizzy than usual, but the frizz was obviously not completely gone. I was (and still am) mildly disappointed. I wonder if maybe I just didn&#x27;t use enough product on the section of hair that remains frizzy, but like I said, it already felt weighed down as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two: my hair remained straight during my overnight routine (I slept in rollers). My hair woke up flawlessly straight (which is rather uncommon). However, once I walked outside it became mildly frizzy, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what day 3 will bring (probably more frizz). It isn&#x27;t asfrizzy as it usually is. But it IS still getting frizzy. I recommend you try searching around a bit more before you settle with this product. It smells nice, and it helps. But I will try another product in the future</li>
    <li> Good product, does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works great and keeps style longer.</li>
    <li> this product did not work on my hair.  i have thick, curly hair that will frizz in the humidity.  i live on the coast of south carolina where it is very humid.  this product made my hair feel sticky and as soon as i went outdoors, it curled right back up. i give it 2 stars b/c it will probably work on someone&#x27;s hair that is just wavy, not super curly like mine.</li>
    <li> Seems like just any other old conditioning spray. No special success at keeping my hair straight; in fact, it was not as effective as some others at making it straight in the first place. had to go over it twice or three times with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Not real pleased with this product. It was shipped to me promptly, but as far as the product goes it leaves ur hair feeling a little stickie to me.</li>
    <li> Wost Product ever. It is very heavy on your hair. Weights it down and feels like u have glue in your hair. Used it in about 65 % humidity out, and by the end of the night-my hair was curly!!!!!!! I mean really bad. I suggest u dont buy.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product, however the product came in the mail banged up and with absolutely no liquid in the bottle itself. I will be calling amazon to complain.</li>
    <li> I love how this works on my hair. I have a naturally curly hair combination of 3a and 3b curls. This product helps me maintain a straight look for about 4-5 days!* (note: it does depend a lot on your curl type. check naturallycurly. com to see what curl type you are) No, I dont get paid to announce them, I just really want to help guide natuarally curly haired girls like me who had no idea of this! It&#x27;s a very helpful guide I might say. :)</li>
    <li> So I was a little worried about this product hearing some of the reviews. I thought it would be sticky, thick, and make my hair feel gross. So when I received and tried it out, I decided to do the minimal squirting required, and follow the directions from there. After my hair was finished my ends were still frizzy but my hair was super soft. The next day, my hair was a little kinky, but not as wavy as it would have been normally. I tried it again, squirted every strand of hair, made sure there were absolutely no dry bits, and straightened in sections. My hair, which would normally feel fried after all that, felt great, not even a little bit sticky. My hair was pretty straight, and minimally frizzy. The next day, my hair was very kinky, but was pretty easy to straighten out. The third day, it had lost its straight and my hair started to feel like it was drying it. I feel like this is a good assistant to styling, but not the miracle cure for uncontrollable hair. So if your hair has a lot of problems to began with, this probably won&#x27;t be your answer.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions to a tee. I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair, and my hair wasn&#x27;t clean when i used it (just damp) So I may ammend my review after tomorrow, but as of now, the only difference is that my hair isn&#x27;t very frizzy, but being out in the rain and with it being so hummid, my hair would normally be out of control. I&#x27;m just getting some waves and curls. It is a little sticky but it&#x27;s not that bad at all. Before the rain my hair was super straight, and I have out of control curly frizzy hair. All in all, worth the money. Maybe I should just follow directions better.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Now, I don&#x27;t really have curly hair at all - it&#x27;s mostly straight with a slight wave, but tends to get extremely frizzy. I sprayed this on damp hair, blow dried it straight and then straightened with my flat iron. I noticed that my hair became straighter easier - I didn&#x27;t have to pass the flat iron through my hair so many times. Most days, my hair has kinks in it by lunchtime, and the ends are all flipped out. That day, it stayed perfectly straight all day! I was so impressed. I didn&#x27;t expect it to last overnight, however. What usually happens is I put it in a ponytail and go to sleep, then wake up with waves EVERYWHERE, having to straighten it again (20 mins) or take a shower and then blowdry and straighten (45 mins). This time? Not a wave in sight. I didn&#x27;t even have to style my hair at all that day and that was so amazingly refreshing. I just brushed it, put some dry shampoo in the roots and left. I am so looking forward to having a ton of time in my mornings to make a smoothie or take my dog for a longer walk. The third day, my hair was really greasy (I usually wash my hair every day) but still amazingly straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so so so satisfied with this product. It didn&#x27;t feel sticky or gross at all, and I didn&#x27;t get product buildup. If that happened to you then I would recommend spraying less in - you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> I have really really curly hair and blow dry doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair much so I was happy to check out this product. I sprayed the product as per the instructions and blow dried the hair just like they suggested. There wasn&#x27;t any difference at all in terms of keeping my hair straight. It was just like a normal blow dry without this product. So I ended up ironing my hair. The only good part is it keeps my hair soft and the straightened hair lasts longer and looks nicer. So I am going to continue to use this product but not for the claims it makes.</li>
    <li> This item is definitely priced right.  Works just as well as the Angel serum at the Hair Cuttery Stores.  What else can i say.  Certainly a great partner with any current hairstyling straightener.  My teen daughter has requested this again and it will be the third bottle.  Note that this is good if you have to add to an Amazon order. Otherwiise, it can be picked up at Target.  Why not get this as part of a stocking stuffer?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in my cocktail of styling products.  I have long hair that straightens with a round brush, but wants to curl at the thought of humidity.  I also use Ion keratin shampoo and conditioner and heat styling creme, john freida heat prep for damaged hair, and Aveda  smoothing style gel like stuff.  My hair is always good for 3-4 days no matter what I do (including riding my horse with a hemet).</li>
    <li> 3 days straight, I could not even get 1 hour of hold.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use this product, but very disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy/frizzy hair that can easily be dried straight; the problem is keeping it that way. After drying and styling which was a struggle as the product made my hair stiff and hard to get the brush threw when styling. I managed to tussle my hair in to shape, left my air conditioned apartment, and within an hour the NYC summer heat and humidity to turn my hair into a limp frizzy sticky mess!  I thought maybe I did not use enough product and tried it again had the same result. I have used many of the Frizz ease products with some working better than others. This was the worst, it reminds me of the old Flat Out product from John Frieda, only now you spray it on.  I finally decided to I had to try a different brand. I chose CHI and LOVE it. The Infra shampoo &amp; conditioner, with Keratin spray. It is amazing.  Leaves my hair frizz free for days and I still have good body without build up.  Bye Bye frizz ease for good.</li>
    <li> my supet frizzy hair appreciates this product. Works to keep it under control for days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!! I have naturally really curly hair and this allows me to wear it super straight!!! Love it, buy it.</li>
    <li> I started using 3-Day Straight in November 2012. Love It! I was a little leery with some of the reviews about people&#x27;s hair being sticky, greasy etc. So I tried just a few sprays and have increased it to about 7 or 8. I have little past shoulder length, wavy/curly/frizzy medium textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;After washing and towel drying my hair I spray on the 3-Day Straight, generally, let me hair air dry, spray heat protector on my hair, and then section it out and flat iron it. Unless, I have a special event or something to go to, I only \\&quot;do\\&quot; my hair once a week. Yes, by the end of the week my hair does feel and look a bit greasy so I use a spray dry shampoo and for the most part it helps. But otherwise it is just a straight as the 1st day. I generally only have to do touch-ups on my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I did Kera-Straight in 2011 and I feel my hair looks just as good using 3-Day Straight as it did after the Kera treatment.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about 3-days. This product works ok but I&#x27;ve used better products in the past.  Nothing miraculous about this - I don&#x27;t think it helps straighten hair all that much.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but I feel like dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year and it has been a life saver. I have the most uncontrollable mane of thick red hair, one that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be wavy, curly, straight, or just a frizzy, dry mess. Even on days when I&#x27;m too lazy to straighten my hair, the product adds weight to my hair and makes it look less big, more controlled. Sometimes I just straighten my bangs, and it works wonderfully, it definitely lasts until the next time I wash my hair (every 2-3 days). I have even tested it in the legendary humidity of Tokyo&#x27;s summer last year (although I washed my hair every day there, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the 3 day thing in such humidity). People who are getting bad results must not be using the product right. It never feels sticky on my hair. Make sure you always apply it on WET hair, and don&#x27;t put too much or too little. If you are not willing to dish out hundreds of dollars on a straight perm, this cheap item will help you greatly.</li>
    <li> I wrote the bottom review after a month of using this product.  A year later I&#x27;m still completely in love with this.  I know I sound like a commercial but I have very thick, coarse, dry hair and have tried every straightening balm ever made.  Plus have had a Brazilian blowout and I still feel this is the best product out there.  Not to mention that it is soooooooo cheap.  Still loving it and I would say spend a few bucks give it a try and you will be a believer as well.  Thanks Frieda!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this product.  I have very coarse dry thick curly hair.  I have spent hundreds of dollars at the saloon getting professional blowouts to get that sleek, straight shinny look.  No matter how hard I would try at home to get my hair to look that way I never could.  This product does the trick and it really looks nice for days.  I was very skeptical because of the price, but had read an article in a beauty magazine that rated the product high, it just seemed too good to be true for $7.00.  This is the real deal.  Don&#x27;t be surprised that after you blow dry your hair it still looks like a lion&#x27;s mane, but once you flat iron it the frizz comes out and looks silky and very straight.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  It&#x27;s the best thing I have found on the market and I have tried many products at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> It really does help to keep hair straight and shiny for 2-3 days</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have frizzy, dry hair that curls up in the Georgia humidity. With this spray, I can usually get at least two good hair days out of one wash.</li>
    <li> This spray helps keep my hair under control when I decide I want to go straight. I keep some on hand at all times. I do have to touch up on day 2 and out, but overall I huge time saver. I have naturally wavy, not curly hair, and live in a humid climate.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed too, but was disappointed that the spray makes your hair feel limp after blow drying and flat ironing. my hair feels better not using the spray personally but if your hair is &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; then I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, colour treated hair and while it is not curly, it gets fuzzy and looks like a halo of cotton candy when I wake up.  I have recently trained my hair to being washed 2-3 times a week instead of every other day.  Believe it or not, after you get over the initial greasy stage (can someone tell me how to use a dry shampoo effectively?) your hair is actually healthier and has more body.  Took a few weeks of pony tails but now I am glad I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to Three Days Straight.  I wash, condition, apply a leave in conditioner and a heat protector (the last step might be overkill) before applying this product.  Since I don&#x27;t have much hair and it is very fine, straightening treatments make it completely flat so I sometimes apply a little mousse to the roots.  While my hair is still wet, I spritz 7-8 sprays of Three Days Straight into may hair avoiding the roots (might not work as well for those with very curly hair.)  I blow dry my hair quickly just to get it dry.  While my ends get fuzzy if I don&#x27;t use a round brush, I have found that it ultimately makes no difference at all whether I make an effort to straighten it with the drier or not because in the end it is the straightening iron that does the real work.  After my hair is completely dry, I quickly run an iron through it (again avoiding the roots) and it looks super sleek and smooth and is often pretty soft as well.  Lately I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions for volume and even with sleek straight hair, if applied correctly, they don&#x27;t show.  (I have used the Three Days Straight on my extensions but realise it is not really necessary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol is one of the top ingredients so I try to use this only once a week although if I am going out a lot I may use it twice.  I pile my hair up loosely on my head at night and may have to touch up ever so slightly with the iron the following morning if the kink is in the wrong place.  Has worked well for me so far with no damage I can directly attribute to this product.  It&#x27;s never felt sticky and is only greasy when it is already high time for another wash.  Not sure if it is the best thing for your hair but makes a big a difference in my appearance.  Will be using it until the next big thing comes out!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think any product could keep your hair smooth for this long, but this product works.  You spray it on damp hair, blow dry and straight iron and your hair stays just right for days! No frizz or flyaways.  No constant application of more heat to damage your hair. Just consistently nice hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and wavy hair. It has some ringlet curls in it, but for the most part, it is just wavy since it is so long. It&#x27;s a pain to straighten and so I would never do it and I would just wear my hair up in a ponytail every day, which is so damaging. Because of that, combined with the fact that I just moved to Florida and am experiencing living in humidity for the first time, my hair has become extremely frizzy. And dry, but I believe that is due to the water from showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I researched what I could use to help tame my frizz and decided on buying sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner and then I stumbled across this product and thought it sounded awesome! I decided to try it before using the sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner so I could see if this product helped me or if it was the new shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a day so it was already dirty. I didn&#x27;t really count how many sprays I used, I just sprayed until I felt like it was all covered. The spray fans out pretty far so one spray covers a significant amount of hair. I combed it through my hair and blow dried it immediately while combing it. I was amazed! I could normally blow dry my hair fairly straight on the bottom, but the top was always a huge, frizzy, still wavy mess. After using this product, I could blow dry all of it almost pin straight! I sectioned my hair and straightened it in little pieces, going over each piece only one time and then I was done! It cut down on my blow drying and straightening time by half. I did all this in the morning so I had the product all day that day and all the next day until I washed my hair the next night since it was starting to feel greasy from not washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it was yesterday. I washed my hair, conditioned it, sprayed until I felt like my hair was covered, and combed it. This time, I didn&#x27;t blow dry it straight away and let it air dry a little bit just so I could save my hair some of the damage. I let it get about 80% dry and then blow dried it, without a comb -- only my fingers. I then straightened it in sections and was surprised, again, at how easily it straightened and only needed one time in each section. I slept on it (and I am a crazy sleeper!) and I woke up with it still pin-straight. It wasn&#x27;t even very tangled, which my curly hair gets very easily. I could brush my hair out with my fingers this morning and it&#x27;s looked perfect all day. I have no doubt that it&#x27;ll look perfect still tomorrow and I&#x27;ll be washing it out again tomorrow night and using my new sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my way to fixing this frizzy mess and this product is now a must-have for me!</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast. I was so excited to use this product because I was tired of my hair Getting frizzy even after i straightened it. So I would take a shower and wash/conditon my hair and then I&#x27;d spray this product all over then blow dry and straighten my hair. It worked okay for frizz I suppose but it made my hair look and feel greasey and dirty. So I would end up taking another shower and damaging my hair even more. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> simply no better product in the hair straightening department. and i&#x27;ve tried them all. i gave up on products and went over to regular keratin treatments but i can&#x27;t get keratin treatments now because i&#x27;m pregnant and this is getting me through!</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes my curly/frizzy hair quite smooth when I use it with a flat iron.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle, no complaints.  Nice product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on 3 separate occassions. First of all, my hair is fine, thin, naturally wavy (in a bad way) shoulder length, and pretty healthy. Humidity does ridiculous things to my hair - it gets weird waves, bumps, looks like Peter Framptom in the 70s or one of the Bee Gees! I have come to the conclusion that my hair is going to be \\&quot;weird\\&quot; in humidity no matter what product I try. BUT, this one comes close to almost working. When I tried it the first time, it seemed to work pretty well, but the weather wasn&#x27;t very humid. When I slept on it and woke up the next day, it was like it always is - wavy and frizzy. The 2nd time I tried it, I used a little more (8-10 sprays)... It looked ok when I dried and straightened it, but not great... HOWEVER, when I woke up the next morning it was amazingly smooth and kept most of the straightening effect. I think this product comes closer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried to make my hair smooth and straight. Not great, but better than most. After spending hundreds on smoothing straightening products, I now know that if your hair is suseptible to humidity and naturally wavy, the best thing to do is invest in a hat or get used to wearing it up.</li>
    <li> Well , I can honestly say I &#x27;like&#x27; this product .&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick , curly hair . I had been previously not been using *any* hair protecter when I straightened my hair . But , I had bought this from Walmart , and I really like it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST read the directions , and follow them , or else this product will not work .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me , it does not keep my hair completely straiaght for three entire days . It protects my hair great . But after about the second day , my hair starts to become a bit curly . ( it shouldn&#x27;t need to last three days however , if you take showers )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall , I am relativly happy with this product .</li>
    <li> Great product and results</li>
</ol>
