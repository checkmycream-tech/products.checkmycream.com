      <li>They are perfect!</li>
      <li>The adhesive begins to lose all stickiness after a day or 2 at best if you do either of these things...</li>
      <li>These nails are great!  </li>
      <li>it is perfect for me</li>
      <li>I loved them</li>
      <li>These nails are amazing~ easy to apply and beautiful!  </li>
      <li>This color is more beautiful in life.</li>
      <li>Excellent color, a nice rich burgundy.</li>
      <li>The nails themselves are gorgeous, I absolutely love the color</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous and there were many sizes, I was able to get one wear from each box.</li>
      <li>I have devised my own method for applying them that gives beautiful, flawless results and typically lasts 2 weeks or more.  </li>
      <li>But the sizes aren&#x27;t a good fit for my nails.</li>
      <li>When you use the appropriate size, they look absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous and best of all they look real and straight from the salon.</li>
      <li>I use a computer and the short length is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love these nails.</li>
      <li>I will keep using them because I love them.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they would have been okay if used with nail glue, not the sticky tabs.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this product</li>
      <li>So much better than a manicure.</li>
      <li>I love it ..</li>
      <li>I am very glad that I discovered this wonderful brand of press-on nails that comes in a wide variety of beautiful solid colors as well as patterns and glittery versions.  </li>
      <li>Love the design, color, and the product - they  really do stay on, look great, and feel fine.</li>
      <li>The nails never chip or peel and are extremely easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t stick and fall off way too easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a convenient way to have beautiful nails in an instant.</li>
      <li>These nails last a full 7days on me, and look perfect the whole time!</li>
      <li>They also are not hard and break very easily.</li>
      <li>But the price, and I don&#x27;t get two full sets out</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame though because I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when i wear these and love the fact that there are different lengths.  </li>
      <li>They are very cute however the nails are made for smaller nail beds</li>
      <li>Not only were the Kiss nails beautiful to look at, they also protected my natural nails and the glue did not damage them at all.  </li>
      <li>Wish I would have purchased two sets because they looked natural and my boyfriend would keep on touching my hands</li>
      <li>adhesive is better than old school</li>
      <li>I had the hardest time trying to find the right size.</li>
      <li>they start out okay, however if you enjoy long showers or have to wash your dishes by hand, God forbid you do both...</li>
      <li>The most important thing to remember to achieve a natural, salon-perfect look is to lay out all 24 nails and carefully choose the appropriate size nail for the nail bed on each of your fingers.</li>
      <li>This nail was strong and kept for many days without breaking or chipping (like some of the falsies from other bands).</li>
      <li>and you are ready to go!</li>
      <li>Use these exactly as directed and they will wear 5-7 days.</li>
      <li>are so pretty.</li>
      <li>I got many compliments, and would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>They do last more than a week for me.  </li>
      <li>But these were well worth the cost, compared with paying ten times the cost at a salon and then having them filled every 1-2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Clean hands/nails, dry, clean with included prep pad(alcohol swab).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I get a lot of compliments on my nails they look so real.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend these nails!</li>
      <li>and it is so much cheaper than the salon and the designs</li>
      <li>but so far doesn&#x27;t beat the good old pink nail glue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a different kind for next subscribe and save delivery.  </li>
      <li>Long lasting and easy to&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
      <li>and I thought the color was pretty and a change from the french</li>
      <li>want these false nails you better invest in some nail glue first</li>
      <li>I bought a set so that I could grow out my natural nails underneath and not be tempted to bite them.  </li>
      <li>When you have applied all 10 nails, apply a quick dry clear topcoat for extra shine and durability.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s the only reason this purchase wasn&#x27;t a complete bust).</li>
      <li>I constantly get compliments on my &amp;#34;gorgeous natural nails&amp;#34; or have women ask me what salon i use.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea behind these and they look well made.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend unless you only need for special event that is only for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s listed that nails are supposed to last at least a week but not even a good 24 hours had past before I had lost two nails.</li>
      <li>They come with a cushion-like self adhesive on the back of each nail which I find does not hold the nail on by itself, but if you apply brush on nail glue to your nails individually as you apply each adhesive nail (as if you are applying a coat of clear polish, then place the self adhesive nail on)</li>
      <li>and at first I was pleasantly surprised, they held firmly!  </li>
      <li>After I put them on, I do cut them a little with a nail clipper, as I&#x27;m not a fan of the really squared off look, and I think they last longer that way too.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions on how to put them on and remove them.</li>

<li> they last a long time and cause no damage to your nails.</li>
<li> comparison for acrylics, Jams, or heck, even classic super glued on fake nails!</li>
<li> themselves are a bit flimsy, very thin, so they&#x27;re not too strong</li>
<li> You want to apply the brush on glue, peel backing off of the nail, press it onto your nail bed as close to the cuticle as possible, and use your other hand to hold the nail on with pressure for 5-10 seconds.  </li>
<li> are pretty and well made, but the &amp;#34;lasts up to a week!&amp;#34; claim is false.  </li>
<li> The trick is that you will need to reapply the nails using nail glue when they start feeling loose.  </li>
<li> Throughout the next morning they were still holding on tight, but by the afternoon, I could feel the nail moving into my cuticle as I did things.  </li>
<li> It does take a little work for them to come off, so it would probably last a week as advertised.</li>
<li> The sticky on the back of the nails do allow for some sliding on your nail bed, so if you want a really firm attachment, you&#x27;ll have to peel off the sticky and use nail glue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I got a defect batch, but the largest nail is not large enough to cover my thumb nail..</li>
<li> it due to size shortages?</li>
<li> This product is a thumbs down they didn&#x27;t stay on at all of you</li>
<li> Nails crack in less than a day, so</li>
<li> I usually just use</li>
<li> and I am not able to use them.</li>
<li> If by &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; they mean 24</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use the sticking material on false nails, but rather a nail glue.</li>
<li> I wear fake nails a lot as I don&#x27;t have time for acrylic or paint.  </li>
<li> Stays on, but it&#x27;s very thin and flimsy.</li>
<li> I got them, I was disappointed that they had adhesive</li>

    <li> This color is more beautiful in life.</li>
    <li> These nails are great!  I get so many compliments when i wear these and love the fact that there are different lengths.  I use a computer and the short length is perfect.  They do last more than a week for me.  So glad I found this product and it is so much cheaper than the salon and the designs are so pretty.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kiss Products for about a year.  These nails last me two weeks before they come off.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper then getting a manicure.  I get a lot of compliments on my nails they look so real.  I will keep using them because I love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I got a defect batch, but the largest nail is not large enough to cover my thumb nail.. and my hands are not abnormally big or anything. Otherwise, they would have been okay if used with nail glue, not the sticky tabs. They also are not hard and break very easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the sticking material on false nails, but rather a nail glue. The sticking side on this nail wouldn&#x27;t last a day otherwise. This nail was strong and kept for many days without breaking or chipping (like some of the falsies from other bands). The color is gorgeous and there were many sizes, I was able to get one wear from each box. I got many compliments, and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Use these exactly as directed and they will wear 5-7 days.</li>
    <li> This product is a thumbs down they didn&#x27;t stay on at all of you want these false nails you better invest in some nail glue first</li>
    <li> These nails are amazing~ easy to apply and beautiful!  I bought a set so that I could grow out my natural nails underneath and not be tempted to bite them.  Not only were the Kiss nails beautiful to look at, they also protected my natural nails and the glue did not damage them at all.  These nails are designed to last for about one week.  However, I kept one set on for FOUR weeks before they started showing wear on the edges.  The trick is that you will need to reapply the nails using nail glue when they start feeling loose.  But these were well worth the cost, compared with paying ten times the cost at a salon and then having them filled every 1-2 weeks.  Highly recommend these nails!</li>
    <li> Had these on at a nail salon and they guy doing my pedi asked where I got my nails done. I told him they were glue on and he was in disbelief.</li>
    <li> I love the idea behind these and they look well made. They are very cute however the nails are made for smaller nail beds and I am not able to use them.</li>
    <li> I am very glad that I discovered this wonderful brand of press-on nails that comes in a wide variety of beautiful solid colors as well as patterns and glittery versions.  I have devised my own method for applying them that gives beautiful, flawless results and typically lasts 2 weeks or more.  The nails never chip or peel and are extremely easy to apply.  They come with a cushion-like self adhesive on the back of each nail which I find does not hold the nail on by itself, but if you apply brush on nail glue to your nails individually as you apply each adhesive nail (as if you are applying a coat of clear polish, then place the self adhesive nail on) they last a long time and cause no damage to your nails.

When you use the appropriate size, they look absolutely amazing.  I constantly get compliments on my &amp;#34;gorgeous natural nails&amp;#34; or have women ask me what salon i use.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Stays on, but it&#x27;s very thin and flimsy. Nails crack in less than a day, so I would not recommend unless you only need for special event that is only for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I love it ..it is perfect for me</li>
    <li> The nails themselves are gorgeous, I absolutely love the color (it&#x27;s the only reason this purchase wasn&#x27;t a complete bust). But the sizes aren&#x27;t a good fit for my nails. I had the hardest time trying to find the right size. Also it&#x27;s listed that nails are supposed to last at least a week but not even a good 24 hours had past before I had lost two nails. It&#x27;s a shame though because I really wanted to love this product.</li>
    <li> These nails have simple instructions. Clean hands/nails, dry, clean with included prep pad(alcohol swab). Apply pressure from the inside out to the edges then avoid water for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Easy enough, right?&lt;br /&gt;Well they start out okay, however if you enjoy long showers or have to wash your dishes by hand, God forbid you do both...they do not last. The adhesive begins to lose all stickiness after a day or 2 at best if you do either of these things...&lt;br /&gt;No comparison for acrylics, Jams, or heck, even classic super glued on fake nails!</li>
    <li> Long lasting and easy to&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
    <li> These nails last a full 7days on me, and look perfect the whole time! So much better than a manicure. After I put them on, I do cut them a little with a nail clipper, as I&#x27;m not a fan of the really squared off look, and I think they last longer that way too.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions on how to put them on and remove them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a convenient way to have beautiful nails in an instant. They are perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. Have purchased several different colors now. Once you get the hang of it, were talking max 5 minutes and you are ready to go!</li>
    <li> Took the advice of another reviewer and used some brush on nail glue and they stayed on perfectly! The color is gorgeous and best of all they look real and straight from the salon. My only gripe is the nails themselves are a bit flimsy, very thin, so they&#x27;re not too strong but I would recommend them for a night out.</li>
    <li> Excellent color, a nice rich burgundy. The sticky on the back of the nails do allow for some sliding on your nail bed, so if you want a really firm attachment, you&#x27;ll have to peel off the sticky and use nail glue. It does take a little work for them to come off, so it would probably last a week as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love the design, color, and the product - they  really do stay on, look great, and feel fine. But the price, and I don&#x27;t get two full sets out o it due to size shortages? That hurts.</li>
    <li> I love these nails. I use nail glue along with the adhesive for extra strength and longevity. I work with my hands a lot and these last me over a week. You can paint over them, add stones etc. They look like salon quality and I always get complimented. For extra shine try http://www.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Fast-Nail-Ounce/dp/B00150LT40/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420590192&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;seche+vite</li>
    <li> Wish I would have purchased two sets because they looked natural and my boyfriend would keep on touching my hands and I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at them I loved them</li>
    <li> They are durable. Don&#x27;t stick and fall off way too easily. Had them on for maybe 3 hours and they are already all popped off. Too flexible.</li>
    <li> Getting these nails was a bit of a rollercoaster.  I wear fake nails a lot as I don&#x27;t have time for acrylic or paint.  I usually just use glue.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these for the convenience of subscribe and save and I thought the color was pretty and a change from the french tip.&lt;br /&gt;When I got them, I was disappointed that they had adhesive, I didn&#x27;t catch this when I bought them.  I remember the type where they are the brown tabs but this wasn&#x27;t like that.  I decided to use them anyway and at first I was pleasantly surprised, they held firmly!  Throughout the next morning they were still holding on tight, but by the afternoon, I could feel the nail moving into my cuticle as I did things.  By the evening, I&#x27;d lost 3 nails.&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty and well made, but the &amp;#34;lasts up to a week!&amp;#34; claim is false.  If by &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; they mean 24-36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive is better than old school but so far doesn&#x27;t beat the good old pink nail glue.  I&#x27;m going to look for a different kind for next subscribe and save delivery.  I buy Broadway french tip nails from DG for $2.50 and they&#x27;ve served me well, I may just stick with what I know.</li>
