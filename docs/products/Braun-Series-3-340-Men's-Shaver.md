### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For best results use with Williams Lectric Pre-shave and finish up with a Neutrogena Post shave lotion!</li>
      <li>While not as close as a blade (what is)this is  perfect for those times you don&#x27;t have to go cheek to cheek with someone.</li>
      <li>Speaking of the battery, it is awesome..</li>
      <li>Excellent grip.  </li>
      <li>I just find the design of all electric shavers out there to be archaic at best.</li>
      <li>Happy shaving!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.</li>
      <li>Very good construction.  </li>
      <li>What a brilliant shaver.</li>
      <li>The razor came in record time, it was packaged very good, it was a great price, and it does an awsome job.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years...but not being happy buying $12 razorblades weekly, I researched and bought this Braun Shaver.  </li>
      <li>All I know is that this has been a great shaver, and when I replace the blades I expect it to keep being a great shaver.</li>
      <li>Great shave.  </li>
      <li>Rinseability makes the shaver great.  </li>
      <li>Very nice for the price..    </li>
      <li>but this shaver never does a good job.  </li>
      <li>So, I guess that means it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
      <li>It is good</li>
      <li>It looks good and Amazon is doing good to send the product ontime.    </li>
      <li>I think my 4 year Remington is superior in performance.i</li>
      <li>Considering the price of good razor blades these days this will pay for itself in no time flat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so decided this would be a good product to try.</li>
      <li>Has a battery level indicator, good feature.  </li>
      <li>Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The Good - The shaver works well on all my shaving areas - face and neck.  </li>
      <li>There is a good reason for this.  </li>
      <li>below that it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all.    </li>
      <li>Good shaver for the money</li>
      <li>It gives a great close shave on the face, but I sometimes have to work a bit more than I&#x27;d like to on the neck to get those hairs..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years and am very pleased with this one.</li>
      <li>Out of the box, I liked the razor.  </li>
      <li>I will get the more deluxe versions, but the Braun SmartControl3 4775, being cordless is very sweet !</li>
      <li>I purchased this Shaver to replace an old Remington that gave me excellent service for many years until the battery just wore out.</li>
      <li>I also loved the super saver discount.</li>
      <li>I use a fancier Braun at home that I&#x27;ve had for many years and don&#x27;t anticipate replacing it for a number more.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)    </li>
      <li>yes stepping up in the line up may get a slightly better shave</li>
      <li>shave is close and smooth!</li>
      <li>The razor did work for two more weeks, then died.  </li>
      <li>gives an even better shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure).  </li>
      <li>I do love the ability to rinse with water after shaving though.</li>
      <li>and I must say I love it.</li>
      <li>Could be used on mains, 12volt battery or on recharge, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>Now have two razors :-)</li>
      <li>i wasnt satisfied with either.</li>
      <li>You can choose to buy a top of the line and it will perform marginally better, but will also cost you [...] more.  </li>
      <li>It is noisy for sure</li>
      <li>I have used four Norelcos over many decades.</li>
      <li>The 340 is not an outstanding poduct.</li>
      <li>Shaver is most satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bought for my dad who has been a lifetime blade user and can&#x27;t use blades to shave anymore(anticoagulant medication), he thinks it does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>far, the thing works flawlessly and gives me a super close shave, and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It comes apart easily and washable which keeps things nice and clean.</li>
      <li>The design of the head makes for a very comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>It takes 10 minutes or more to shave and it still leaves fine hair and stubble all over my face.</li>
      <li>For that price I can&#x27;t think of better razor available.  </li>
      <li>The Not So Good - The trimmer is a straight trimmer, i.e., not a 90 degree angle</li>
      <li>Other than that, everything is perfect.</li>
      <li>and this is one of the best Braun Shavers that I have used so far and its reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This takes about 2 minutes, and will keep the razor clean and running well for many years.</li>
      <li>The trimmer effortlessly cut my beard down to size and the shaver gave me an excellent close shave with no irritation to my skin at all.</li>
      <li>My hubby was super pleased with this shaver until one day the mechanism just stopped working.</li>
      <li>The huge plug on the cord could be a nuisance when traveling.</li>
      <li>This is a great &#x27;entry&#x27; electric level shaver to get back into the swing of things, the razor shave was giving me problems, bumps et all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cheap.</li>
      <li>this 340-s4 is a great shaver, but dont listen to just me listen to your face, not everone will like the same razor types.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I have to shave the goatee for work anyway, so the trimmer&#x27;s limitations are not a deal breaker for me at this point.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean and maintain    </li>
      <li>shaves well  clean  quick charge  good for someone who&#x27;s on the go and doesn&#x27;t have too much time to wait to charge and shave</li>
      <li>The right angle trimmer on the Remington is a better design.  </li>
      <li>shaves out of a full charge easily.    </li>
      <li>this shaver shaves really well and has several very nice features also costs under $100!</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great, easy to clean, quiet, not bulky, and great battery life..</li>
      <li>The price was right, the shipping was reasonable and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I previously had a Norelco which wore out after many years of great shaves and faithful service</li>
      <li>I can never get a clean shave.</li>
      <li>Many times, the action of the shaver does virtually nothing, requiring many passes over a given area to shave anything.</li>
      <li>and it keeps itself clean as it shaves.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great shaver at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It did a good job getting the hair on my face that was above the jaw line but</li>
      <li>Also FYI, Amazon has good prices for replacement Norelco heads if you should need one, the one I ordered was ten dollars cheaper than in a brick and mortar shore.</li>
      <li>Otherwise for the money it&#x27;s and overall good product.</li>
      <li>This shaver isn&#x27;t even good enough to cut peach fuzz on a 14-year-old.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product.</li>
      <li>ok shaver that seems to do a decent shave.  </li>
      <li>Though this razor gave an excellent close shave on my face, I could run it over the same part of my neck again and again with no apparent change.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is amazing, very well designed and appears to be of high quality materials.</li>
      <li>The braun works pretty good, the only thing I am not fully satisfied with is the trimmer, which I expected to work better.</li>
      <li>have had several electrics before, mostly norelcos, but none gave me as close and comfortable shave as this one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Far better then the triple  headed system Norelco touts.</li>
      <li>I have not had to change the blades until now that I&#x27;ve noticed it not cutting as well as before.</li>
      <li>items that could be improved:  -using trimmer seems awkard as when it is fully extended it is still very close to the foils; having a trimmer set perpendicular to the main body would have been more useful.  </li>
      <li>+ Super quick charge time and retention capacity of the battery  + Seamless shave leaving the skin smooth and without razor bumps  +</li>
      <li>Smooth but NOT close; particularly on neck.</li>
      <li>I spend more time trying to get a full cut, using every 3-dimensional angle in space, and I&#x27;m constantly charging this thing (oh, by the way, you can&#x27;t cut when it&#x27;s charging - safety deal</li>
      <li>I always gave a good shave, though it did take longer than my previous rotary razor.  </li>
      <li>This is my first electric razor and I must say the shave is as good as a gillette, but with less irritation.  </li>
      <li>This shaver shaves very smoothly and extremely quiet.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery too.</li>

    <li> The Braun 340 does not shave as close as my Remington 407 and takes longer to shave.  The right angle trimmer on the Remington is a better design.  The huge plug on the cord could be a nuisance when traveling. After a month in using the 340, I am very disappointed in using this shaver.  George S.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years and am very pleased with this one. I use it as my travel shaver - I use a fancier Braun at home that I&#x27;ve had for many years and don&#x27;t anticipate replacing it for a number more.</li>
    <li> shaves well  clean  quick charge  good for someone who&#x27;s on the go and doesn&#x27;t have too much time to wait to charge and shave</li>
    <li> This is the finest razor I have ever used. Far better then the triple  headed system Norelco touts. Which I think is way overrated. Try to shave under your nose with this. While not as close as a blade (what is)this is  perfect for those times you don&#x27;t have to go cheek to cheek with someone.</li>
    <li> ok shaver that seems to do a decent shave.  items that could be improved:  -using trimmer seems awkard as when it is fully extended it is still very close to the foils; having a trimmer set perpendicular to the main body would have been more useful.  -cleaning blades (under foil attachment) is very difficult as the supplied brush is too big to fit in any of the crevices to brush out hair; could be minor as shaver is washable under water</li>
    <li> Out of the box, I liked the razor.  As the instructions stated, it took about a week for my heavy beard to be used to the new shaver.  I always gave a good shave, though it did take longer than my previous rotary razor.  I&#x27;m giving one star since the razor only lasted me about eight months.  During a charging cycle, the case got very hot and turned a small section a burnt brown color.  The razor did work for two more weeks, then died.  I typically keep my boxes and receipts on items like these for a year, but in this case the box with receipt was pitched after six months.  I would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> i have owned Braun shavers in the past, that i liked very much. The 340 is not an outstanding poduct. I think my 4 year Remington is superior in performance.i intend to retun it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco based on a review I found on the internet. My Norelco was a few years old and the cost of a new head for it was almost the same cost as a new shaver.  I now believe the internet review I read was probably written by the Braun marketing department. After a year of use, I have found that:    1)It is very noisy  2)It is awkward to hold and use  3)It requires three passes over the same area to get a decent shave  4)You have to shave slowly during those three passes to get good results  5)It took twice as long to get the same results as my old shaver    At first I thought that the problem was that I needed to get used to a foil shaver instead of a rotary shaver, but this wasn&#x27;t the case. I just ordered a new head for my Norelco and plan on giving this one away to someone I don&#x27;t like very much. Also FYI, Amazon has good prices for replacement Norelco heads if you should need one, the one I ordered was ten dollars cheaper than in a brick and mortar shore. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Though this razor gave an excellent close shave on my face, I could run it over the same part of my neck again and again with no apparent change.  The trimmer is also unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about two weeks now and I must say I love it. I previously had a Norelco which wore out after many years of great shaves and faithful service but I have to say that my new Braun Smart Control3 shaves me faster and closer with no hair pulling or razor burn at all. A battery charge is lasting me about a week of shaving every day and it charges in an hour or less. I don&#x27;t know if it will last as long as my Norelco did but for the price I feel it is a great bargain. So far I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst shaver I have ever owned.  It all started when my wife wanted to do me a favor and buy me a new razor, she typically buys products with elevated price tags because she wants the \\&quot;best\\&quot; for me, bless her heart.  This shaver isn&#x27;t even good enough to cut peach fuzz on a 14-year-old.  If you normally shave every day it&#x27;s a challenge to use, if you go two or three days you will be standing at the mirror for 30 minutes.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about the foil design, I have never had to rub my face raw just to go after a few hairs that seem to elude the cutting blades.  I spend more time trying to get a full cut, using every 3-dimensional angle in space, and I&#x27;m constantly charging this thing (oh, by the way, you can&#x27;t cut when it&#x27;s charging - safety deal I&#x27;m sure).  I will never own a Braun product again.  DO NOT BUY THIS SHAVER.</li>
    <li> Now this is a first rate shaver. I have had it for a few months. No goofy frills, just a top quality shaver.</li>
    <li> Well I was in need of a good shaver after suffering for a month with a useless Remmington R-4130NB. This one really amazed me. I&#x27;d considered shelling out the excessive cash for one of the series 7 models, but clearly that&#x27;s not going to be necessary. When I bought this I hadn&#x27;t shaved for roughly two weeks. The trimmer effortlessly cut my beard down to size and the shaver gave me an excellent close shave with no irritation to my skin at all. Prior to this (and the crappy Remmington) I&#x27;d used a mediocre Braun 3612 for about 7 years and trust me, this is FAR superior to that. I&#x27;ve also thrown out my plain, non-electric razor and plan to stick with this for a long time.</li>
    <li> On the one hand it is quieter than my old Braun, and seems to take the 7000 series screen and blade, on the other hand the head doesn&#x27;t tilt and battery life seems shorter.</li>
    <li> I received the first Series 3 shaver as a gift. It worked OK for about 6 months then it failed (would not turn on). I bought a replacement and it, too, lasted about 6 months before failing (it will not recharge). To get a decent shave, I had to repeatedly go over my beard, testing constantly to see if any stubble remained. I sustained several razor burns on my neck from applying too much pressure trying to get the job done faster. My old Norelco did a better job in less time, but it also had some issues with quality (three repairs in two years). I will not buy another Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others out there.. the reason I chose this one is because it uses the SAME blades as the more expensive Braun shavers, at a fraction of the cost..    It gives a great close shave on the face, but I sometimes have to work a bit more than I&#x27;d like to on the neck to get those hairs.. Maybe since this is my first electric I just need to get used to it or something, I don&#x27;t know... Other than that it&#x27;s great, easy to clean, quiet, not bulky, and great battery life.. Very nice for the price..    Update 11-20-10:  Once you get the hang of it, shaving your neck becomes easier. Also, your face and neck need to get used to shaving with an electric, as you will notice it becomes easier and easier to cut as the weeks pass. I believe your hair begins to grow out a bit differently allowing your razor to cut better. I have never had this \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hairs as other claim, unless the battery about to die in a few minutes. Speaking of the battery, it is awesome.. I still get 5-6 shaves out of a full charge easily.    I&#x27;m still using this shaver 2 years later. I have not had to change the blades until now that I&#x27;ve noticed it not cutting as well as before. Maybe they lasted so long because I only shave about every other day, not sure. All I know is that this has been a great shaver, and when I replace the blades I expect it to keep being a great shaver.</li>
    <li> It is good but still we have to spend little more time to do shaving. It looks good and Amazon is doing good to send the product ontime.    Ramesh  Bloomington, IL</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 340 razor from Walmart for $81.00 after I went looking for a blade and comb set for my Braun 7505 razor. I found that Walmart no longer carried parts for the 7505, so I got a new razor, the 340. What a mistake. My first clue  came when I read the the instructions and was told not to move the razor from side to side when shaving. How does a person shave between the nose and the mustache without using a side to side motion. I soon found there are other places on the face that require a side to side motion, like under the chin and directly below the sideburns. I used the 340 for two weeks in the hope that the fault was mine and I would soon learn how to use this razor properly. After two weeks of very poor shaves that took 2 1/2 times as long to achieve, I ordered a blade and comb for my old razor from Amazon. What a difference. I have been able to compare the two razors side by side, and the 340 performs less well than the 7505 on ALL parts of the face. If anyone wants to but a slightly used Braun 340 razor, I have one for sale.....cheap.</li>
    <li> My hubby was super pleased with this shaver until one day the mechanism just stopped working. Going to have to look for parts for it, or see whether its cheaper just to buy a whole new shaver. Not too pleased, paid around $84 for it with tax and not happy at all that it broke in just 4 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my son who is 22 yrs old. He says he loves it and \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t chew up my face like the old one\\&quot;. So, I guess that means it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years...but not being happy buying $12 razorblades weekly, I researched and bought this Braun Shaver.  I get a close shave without spending a fortune!  The price was right, the shipping was reasonable and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  I recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> Very good construction.  Rinseability makes the shaver great.  Great shave.  Excellent grip.  Won&#x27;t slip when you shake it dry.  Recommend next model up with the flex head (just a few extra bucks).</li>
    <li> Over the past twenty years I have owned at least 6 Braun electric razors. All past Braun razors worked fine so I had the expectation that the recently purchased Braun razor would be satisfactory -- but it is not! Either I got a lemon or Braun has lowered its manufacturing standards on their lower priced electric razors.    Problems: (1) my beard is not heavy, but it takes twice as long to shave as it did with my former Braun razor; (2) Moreover, the shave is unacceptable since the result of this Braun shave is a remaining rather rough, not smooth, beard. Repeated shaving over many areas do not do the job removing the stubble, particularly with respect to short hairs;(3) The side cutter is a \\&quot;menace\\&quot; -- I have drawn blood twice trying to use it; and (4) The razor did not come with a plastic \\&quot;guard\\&quot; over the cutter as all Braun razors did in my past experiences.  In summary, this Braun razor is a disappointment and I regret its purchase.  Dr. Stephen E. Goldston</li>
    <li> I shopped around a bit, bought this at KMart on a whim, than found it listed for so much less on Amazon, I returned it unopened and waited for it to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been a while since I have owned an electric shaver, and the Braun does not disappoint. This is a great &#x27;entry&#x27; electric level shaver to get back into the swing of things, the razor shave was giving me problems, bumps et all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the thing works flawlessly and gives me a super close shave, and it is very easy to clean.  Maybe down the road I will get the more deluxe versions, but the Braun SmartControl3 4775, being cordless is very sweet !</li>
    <li> I got this shaver as a gift and I was excited about using this over the regular disposable razors I have been using.    It did a good job getting the hair on my face that was above the jaw line but below that it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all.    After going over the same area repeatedly on my neck, it just wouldn&#x27;t get that hair at all.  I even tightened my skin in the area it was shaving as the instructions said but I still had no luck.    I&#x27;m planning on returning this shaver and just going back to the regular straight razors that work.  I think this kind of product is hard to review since everyone has different skin and beard types.  My soft skin and thin beard hair probably just isn&#x27;t made for an electric shaver in general.    It would be nice if they made an electric shaver that was different from the typical ones with a vibrating cutting head and a foil shield.  Maybe something like a self lubricating and cleaning straight blade that doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream or water and it keeps itself clean as it shaves.  I just find the design of all electric shavers out there to be archaic at best.</li>
    <li> Shaver is most satisfactory.  Has a battery level indicator, good feature.  This model does not have the floating head my last one had which was a waste.  Will shave for 6-7 days between charges.  Only negative feature is it should have a foil cover to protect shaver without putting in the hard case that is a nuisance unless traveling.</li>
    <li> Considering the price of good razor blades these days this will pay for itself in no time flat.&lt;br /&gt;I have had several electrics before, mostly norelcos, but none gave me as close and comfortable shave as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Almost no irritation even down on my neck. I do find the use of a pre-shave lotion such as Williams gives an even better shave.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver for a weeks now; Initially skeptical about it after reading some of the reviews -     But thoroughly satisfied with the smooth and seamless shave    + Super quick charge time and retention capacity of the battery  + Seamless shave leaving the skin smooth and without razor bumps  + Easy to clean and maintain    - Takes some getting used to, especially if you are switching from a regular razor  - Leaves some traces of hair in the neck which even after a lot of effort was difficult to shave - had to bring out my Gillette to get the job done &#x3D;)    For best results use with Williams Lectric Pre-shave and finish up with a Neutrogena Post shave lotion!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0006ZM4LM Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]    I purchased the Braun 340 because I am currently tired of blade shaving and I travel a lot and a shaver takes up less room in my bag than a razor, shave cream &amp; spare blades.  I have vascilated over the years between a shaver - prior Brauns &amp; Norelcos - and a blade - current blade is the Fusion.      I have found the Braun 340 to be a very good value as a shaver, but the trimmer is not particularly easy to use - especially if you have a goatee.    The Good - The shaver works well on all my shaving areas - face and neck.  It requires a minimal number of passes to get the beard cut (assuming that you pull the skin tight) and it does not pinch or cut my skin.  The shave is pretty close as well, so I like the shaver aspect of this bit of kit.    The Not So Good - The trimmer is a straight trimmer, i.e., not a 90 degree angle so you have to extend it and sort of stab at your face to use it.  This works OK so long as you don&#x27;t have facial hair you want to keep where the foil hovers.  If you have a goatee, when trimming your moustache you have the choice of shortening either your moustache or beard on your upper lip.  This is the reason that I rated this unit 4 rather than 5 stars - would have gone 3.5 if that was an option.    Overall - I like this shaver, but the trimmer should be a 90 degree job.  Fortunately, I have to shave the goatee for work anyway, so the trimmer&#x27;s limitations are not a deal breaker for me at this point.  I can&#x27;t see spending another $80+ for the proper trimmer and the pointless alcohol bath which continues to eat your $$$.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shaver to replace an old Remington that gave me excellent service for many years until the battery just wore out. The Braun Series 3 340 is horrible. It is noisy for sure but that is only a minor inconvenience. It takes 10 minutes or more to shave and it still leaves fine hair and stubble all over my face. The only way I can shave is under a bright light or I will leave stubble even tough I have passed over it several times. I can never get a clean shave. If you purchase this shaver you will have thrown away your money. I certainly did and I am now searching for another replacement.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  It gives him a very close shave. Very fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and I must say the shave is as good as a gillette, but with less irritation.  The braun works pretty good, the only thing I am not fully satisfied with is the trimmer, which I expected to work better. Other than that, everything is perfect.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a decent shave for modest price. It does not live up to the standards of the older German made Brauns but, for half the money works well.  The trimmer is awkward in use.</li>
    <li> The price for this exact model (same packaging etc etc) is $69 at Walmart and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although price here seems to have gone up, it is still far cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my dad who has been a lifetime blade user and can&#x27;t use blades to shave anymore(anticoagulant medication), he thinks it does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all and misses a lot of hair.  I have to go over my face 4 or 5 times.  And the trimmer is useless: it does not cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned quite a few Braun shavers and all of them worked just fine. This one does not.    The cutting system is either misaligned (I&#x27;ve had two) or simply very badly designed. It&#x27;s a brutal, uncomfortable shave that feels like individual hairs are yanked out of your face, one at a time. That&#x27;s when it works! Many times, the action of the shaver does virtually nothing, requiring many passes over a given area to shave anything. It&#x27;s given me rashes and lots of skin burns.    To their credit, Braun sent me a friendly email &amp; replacement cutting block when I let them know of my unpleasant experience. It was a little better, yet still gives a profoundly uncomfortable, incompetent shave.    Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this truly awful shaver! I hope Braun realizes what a step down they&#x27;ve taken and introduces a new line that works.</li>
    <li> The razor came in record time, it was packaged very good, it was a great price, and it does an awsome job.  I also loved the super saver discount. I hope I didn&#x27;t sign up for anything by getting it. Thank you, and I will be back.</li>
    <li> as mentioned in many other reviews your skin, hair type and facial contours all make a difference on the type of razor you choose, or should choose. After using a philips norelco that cost $40 more and a similar to this shaver remington i wasnt satisfied with either. both left my face rough and skin red the remington finally broke after 2 years so it was time for a new one and never used braun so decided this would be a good product to try. Man what a difference! shave is close and smooth! yes stepping up in the line up may get a slightly better shave but i cant justify dropping over $100 for a razor! this shaver shaves really well and has several very nice features also costs under $100! but try different ones if you havent bought one before. manual razors cut me up too much (sensitive skin) round blade razors such as the norelco pull my hair too much and leave a lot of spots untouched on my face. the remington did as well, but left a closer shave as it was a foil shaver like this one, but felt cheap and turned out to be ate up blades every few months and the pop up trimmer finally fell off so i decided to replace it. this 340-s4 is a great shaver, but dont listen to just me listen to your face, not everone will like the same razor types.</li>
    <li> My older higher end Braun 7526 went kaput so looked for a reasonably priced replacement.  This model has the same cutting head and foil as my older one so I bought it.  The only disappointment is in the long hair cutter.  It does not have the same L angle at the blade that the more expensive models have, so it is much more difficult and dangerous to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out that my older model 7526 was not actually dead.  The wall plug charger was simply broken.  I use the charger of this model 340 to charge both.  Now have two razors :-)</li>
    <li> I bought the basic series 3 without any fancy cleaning system nor tilting head.  I have been using electric razors for the past 15 years, and this razor is nearly as good as my last one which was a top of the line Panasonic.  The razor is smooth, cuts well with only a few passes required, and the battery is long lasting.  [...].  For that price I can&#x27;t think of better razor available.  You can choose to buy a top of the line and it will perform marginally better, but will also cost you [...] more.  Also any cleaning system is nothing but a scam.  With the razor I only need to clean it once a week by simply brushing the heads, then rinsing under hot water with anti-bacterial soap, and lastly pat dry with a towel and add a drop of oil (included with the razor).  This takes about 2 minutes, and will keep the razor clean and running well for many years.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money I have very coarse facial hair and this is one of the best Braun Shavers that I have used so far and its reasonably priced. It comes apart easily and washable which keeps things nice and clean. The only thing that would make it better if this razor had a swivel head on it. Otherwise for the money it&#x27;s and overall good product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing, very well designed and appears to be of high quality materials. It&#x27;s also very quiet. The design of the head makes for a very comfortable and smooth shave. It even gets the difficult to shave hairs on my neck without irritation. The hard plastic storage case has holes for the shaver to drain and even has a place to put the cleaning brush. I am amazed that it is recommended to replace the blades and screen only every 18 months. My old shaver required a replacement every 6 months. Overall a great shaver at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves very smoothly and extremely quiet.  I got it from Amazon for $50. Today I stopped by Target and they were selling it for $40!!! Shooooooot!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Remington MS-2700, when I had to ship that one back to the manufacturer for a replacement.  I&#x27;ve had the Braun 340 for about 3 weeks now, and I can already say that I won&#x27;t be switching back to the Remington if/when they send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 340 shaves way closer than the previous shaver, and I&#x27;m not left with razor burn when I&#x27;m finished; in fact, it feels very soothing compared to what I&#x27;ve been used to in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one fault I&#x27;ve found is with the sideburn trimmer, which doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as neatly as the Remington did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some odd reason, Braun included a charging cord with my unit.  Three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, and I have yet to see any reduction in battery power.  Maybe the battery will eventually go dead and I&#x27;ll need the cord to recharge it, but I&#x27;ll cross that bridge when I come to it. [in other words, battery life seems incredible!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-stars only because of the less than stellar sideburn trimmer.  Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> I have used four Norelcos over many decades. Rather than buying new cutters for two year old shaver, time to try Braun. I have used new Series 3/340 for three weeks now. Smooth but NOT close; particularly on neck. Leaves too much stubble. I do not particularly like these little buzzing/vibrating razors but I suppose I would get used to that. Contrarily, Norelco feels like it has small balanced electric motor in comparison. To get a close shave I find I have to go back and RESHAVE with Norelco. Not good! Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun&#x27;s. I have sixty days in which to return. I will put up with it for another week or so and then return it if shaves don&#x27;t get anywhere as close as they did with all my previous Norelcos. Not a bad product. Just mediocre results, but that does not make a nice, clean shave. I am disappointed. Expected more. I do love the ability to rinse with water after shaving though.</li>
    <li> The Braun 340 can shave real close around the face.  I have to agree with some of the other guys, though.  Even straight out of the box, it takes about twice as long to complete a shave as it did with my old Norelco, mostly because of my neck area.  It just doesn&#x27;t shave as close around my neck and I have to make several, several, SEVERAL passes to get it smooth (my \\&quot;beard\\&quot; is not that heavy either.)    Actually, my first Braun 340 fell apart before my first recharge.  Seriously, one day the trimming handle came loose and was flopping around, but I was still able to finish my shave.  Not holding that against Braun, I stayed with the same model number when I exchanged it.    Overall, I think I just like the three-head system better.  The extra time required to shave (again, mostly around the neck area) has gotten old.  The end result, however, is still a real close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this shave for over two years and replace the foil and blade at least twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have thick bear but this shaver never does a good job.  In fact, when I was traveling when some friends, they were surprised how long it took me to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over the same area again and again. I thought there was something with my shaving techniques. I searched online and tried all sort of movement. Nothing really helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the side cutter only once. It did not cut but pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reckon it is time to replace it after two years struggle.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for several years.  Good quality, quiet, close shaves, quick charging and inexpensive ($40 range when I got this) and above all I love its simplicity believe it or not, the only thing it does is shave.  I can&#x27;t vouch for the trimmer - I don&#x27;t really need it - I do shave the back of my neck and it works for that in those cases where I neglect it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only amazing modern feature is that you can remove the foil (simple) and rinse it.  It takes a 30b replacement head which is used on models currently manufactured and is readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some negative comments that you can&#x27;t use it when it is plugged in.  There is a good reason for this.  You shouldn&#x27;t be running water over something that is plugged in.  I know that is just so stupid and you wouldn&#x27;t think of doing that.  Well there are plenty out there who would and they live in old houses without ground fault breakers in wet areas.</li>
    <li> For years I had a Remington mains shaver from the 198o&#x27;s, best cut of all shavers i have owned, but finally failed. So bought a Braun in 1993. What a brilliant shaver. Could be used on mains, 12volt battery or on recharge, couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Had to stop using in 2012 as could no longer get the foils, probably only bought about four foils in that time. Had a Remington for a while but couldn&#x27;t wait for it to fail, so bought this Braun. Bad design, if battery is flat, can&#x27;t just plug in to mains and use. Have to wait to get some charge in. And now of course, just over two years old and it won&#x27;t charge!</li>
