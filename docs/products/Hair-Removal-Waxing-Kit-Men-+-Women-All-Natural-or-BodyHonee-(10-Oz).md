<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a wonderful product! I have purchased it and used it multiple times and will&lt;br /&gt;continue to do so. It is not without flaws I don&#x27;t know of any hair removal product that&lt;br /&gt;does not cause a little skin irritation or redness, but I can promise it is minimal if used&lt;br /&gt;correctly. Just don&#x27;t overheat the wax or it will sting upon contact – microwave it for only&lt;br /&gt;30 seconds. Removing the wax, done correctly, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. The wax quality is superb, and the wax strips are also really good. The details on the user manual is very detailed and much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this one simpler to use than the &#x27;extra strength&#x27; variety by the same brand, as they are water soluble and less of a hassle to take off after application or when they come into contact with other items by mistake. I ordered this for hair that is less coarse like that on hands and use the other type for hair on lower legs, underarm area and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is of excellent quality with everything you need included, and nothing more. I ordered the wax strips as well from the same brand as the ones that came with the kit got used up pretty quick. So more strips included would be nice.</li>
    <li> I was so nervous at first but this was literally the easiest thing ive ever done with waxing. THe directions were easy to follow and the product worked perfect the first time.  I didnt even feel any pain or discomfort.  I didnt get irritated or get red skin either.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a nice wax!  I start waxing over shaving because it last so much longer than shaving &amp; leaves a nicer smoother result.  This wax is so easy to use &amp; heats up in the microwave very quickly!  It only comes with too sticks &amp; a few strips so you will need to order a good set of sticks &amp; wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would def. recommend!  : )</li>
    <li> Not the best around.....the rave reviews exaggerate a smidge. To give you some background, I&#x27;ve waxed myself for over a decade now, having used both strip AND hard wax before for all parts of my body (LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this works pretty well on legs, but even with talcum powder...it&#x27;s not the best for underarm....so if you were hoping this would be the saving grace for underarm hair.....maybe if your hair is super fine? But my hair even grows straight and generally just in two directions (and yes, I do each part separately so that I can yank in different directions...) and still....it hardly removed any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, the Gigi Brazilian hard wax seems to work the best (work in small batches). And yes, to reiterate, the hair was the appropriate length and the area was free from sweat and very clean and dry and I also held the area taut when pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short....buy it for legs and arms, it&#x27;ll be just fine and the red bumps only take a couple hours to go away....but underarms? You&#x27;ll just end up with wax still stuck to you and not the strips. I just ended up tweezing as much as I could and then just wiping the area away with water. I *do* love that it&#x27;s water soluble, so clean up is awesome.</li>
    <li> Ok so I decided to try my hand at home waxing and was a bit afraid at first, but after trying this product I am completely sold! First, it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I expected it to, second- it removed all my hair, and third- it&#x27;s my 5th day after waxing and still no re-growth!! Ha! I also want to mention that this stuff wipes down with water- you don&#x27;t need any kind of special oil to clean it off! It&#x27;s by far the best wax I have ever encountered!</li>
    <li> summer was coming up and i wanted to do something about my back hair. My wife suggested i go get it done at a salon.  I decided to give this product a try instead for several reasons 1. price  2. privacy and 3. if it didn&#x27;t work i could always go to a salon and i didn&#x27;t break the bank on this product.  My wife again was skeptical about me buying this but i bought it and it worked great!!! It did not irritate the skin like when I used Nair. No red marks, no blood stains, etc.  I&#x27;m not going to say its pain free but not to bad, it hurts less than when you pull a bandaid off and it pulls some hair off. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since i used it and back looks great. My wife was impressed and I&#x27;ve ordered more strips to use again and she now wants to try it too!!! Highly recommend this product! Great experience also with the seller because USPS screwed up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the intension for bikini waxing and because the reviews were basically flawless. I was very excited based on all of the great feedback. I followed literally all the directions from the manufacturer. During my first use, I managed to painfully wax a few hairs. I am not a waxing newbie, so I knew the process would not be comfortable. However, may I please stress the word pain. Because I used the product, obviously it was too late to send it back so my fiancé encouraged me to give it another shot. This time I followed the advice from other reviewers and used talcum powder prior to waxing. This time I was able to remove maybe 10 more hairs with additional bleeding in conjunction with the excessive pain. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be trying another round and will stick with the expensive experts...bummer and waste of money :/</li>
    <li> I was a first time user - the instructions were very easy to follow, and I got great results. It was not as painful as I thought it would be, it took about 20 minutes total for chest and upper arms. It was much better than shaving, which doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.All in all a great experience and great product - will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> As a pro athlete I need to keep myself and my body in shape, and that includes waxing. Over the years I have tried every type of product on the market and none of them work as well as this one. Its so easy to use and the fact that you can heat up the wax in the microwave is a huge bonus, none of that messy hot water on the stove!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the product is all natural so I know exactly what I am putting onto my skin, no harsh chemicals that leave a nasty smell or burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I had no re-growth for 8 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Product came really quickly too. I highly recommend this product to anyone, its a must buy.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!</li>
    <li> Please consider that this is a male perspective on using BodyHonee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax doesn&#x27;t harden.  This makes BodyHonee very forgiving because it can be easily washed away.  However, it also makes it very difficult to remove all the hair unless you wax the same area several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi-session waxing irritates the skin and will leave you with a rash that lasts for several days.  I also found that my normally clear skin broke out in pimples the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent about 2 hours waxing and got about 50% of the job done.  At this point, I&#x27;d had enough of the pain, awkward angles and wax on virtually every surface of the bathroom.  So, I decided to pull out the electric hair trimmer and finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten minutes later, I had my entire body groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awkwardness of using the trimmer and, more to the point, the bloody nicks on my balls led me to try waxing, however, after this experience, I&#x27;ve decided to try the Norelco BodyGroom Pro, which is reported to be kind to the gentler areas of the male anatomy.</li>
    <li> Package leaked badly during shipping, ruining most of the included strips. Remaining product was nearly ineffective. This wax removed maybe 10% as much hair in one strip as hard wax (bought GiGi Hard Wax at the same time) but hurt just as much!! This sugar wax only *kind of* worked on my legs where my hair is very fine. On my chin, underarms, and bikini area it was very painful and would only pull out a few hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar included with this kit is made of plastic that is too thin to seal securely. If tipped at all, it WILL leak and it&#x27;s NOT a fun mess to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to DIY waxing and have coarse hair, definitely go with hard wax.</li>
    <li> Curse words will leave your lips, as expected. I used this before a vacation with my boyfriend and it did not work. Maybe I&#x27;m too well trimmed and my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough. But it only ripped out some of my hairs. It pretty much just thinned it out with random patches.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, shipping very fast!</li>
    <li> I always find it difficult to find a waxing product that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. I suffer from very sensitive skin and as a result find it almost impossible to get a product that I can use on a regular basis with out it being &#x27;hypo-allergenic&#x27; which usually means I get have to spend an awful lot of money one something that doesn&#x27;t really do its job!&lt;br /&gt;This product however was great for me. I found that I didn&#x27;t have any issues whilst using it (you might, but i didn&#x27;t!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so easy to use too. You just pop it in the microwave and its done, ready to use. None of that messy over the stove with boiling water nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that these strips really get to the root and make your wax last a little longer than other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally for the money i think its a fantastic product and highly recommend using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you wont regret it, i didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> While no waxing/sugaring is every comfortable, this is about as good as it gets. This is my go to brand to remove hair from my back and shoulders. eventually I will get laser hair removal, but in the meantime this is what I will be using.</li>
    <li> I have always associated wax with immense pain. I refuse to even get my eyebrows waxed because of the painful feeling. Coupled with the fact that I have very sensitive skin, waxing was a painful event that I rather avoid. I wanted to venture back into waxing because of how long lasting the results are and I happened upon this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that caught my eye about this kit were the natural ingredients. As a lover of organic foods and all things green, it was a good first sign. The ingredients are also water soluble, so they are easy to take off just in case I wanted to chicken out (I almost did). When I got the kit, the ingredients were laid out in a simple manner and each step was easy to follow. I warmed the wax in the microwave and spread it across the small section I wanted to wax. I decided to go for the gusto and pull the strip off and surprisingly it wasn&#x27;t that bad! I was able to wax with minimal pain and issues. A friend did tell me about putting a little oil on my skin to barrier since my skin is so sensitive and I will try that next time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this kit over any other.The ingredients are trustworthy, the instructions are simple, and the pain isn&#x27;t so bad that you feel that you need labor pain medication. This kit is definitely a staple beauty product for maintenance and upkeep for me. Get this kit!</li>
    <li> This does not hurt to use, however, it only removes about half the hair from the area. It really doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job. I looked over the instructions to see if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, and I don&#x27;t think I am.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse dark hair, and with a little practice and patience I managed to get every single hair out.&lt;br /&gt;This is also my first time waxing anywhere and I am so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;First, most important step: Use Baby Powder!!! Skin that is moist or has lotions/oils on it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;Ensure that the wax is stringy and not too hot, then apply in the direction that the hair grows, put the strip over the wax and rub it down firmly 3-4 times, and then rip off in the opposite direction. Very Easy! Do small patches at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing can get messy, but at least this one is water soluble, so any mess can easily be cleaned up without issue. The final results were fantastic for me!</li>
    <li> This wax needs better application applied method.  Works well once you get the process figured out.  Just follow instructions.  Water washable nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bigger girl and if you&#x27;ve ever been overweight or know someone who is overweight shaving can be a grueling task in itself. Sometimes it is easier to put it off than to bend into awkward positions to try to reach. I&#x27;m also a girl who wears pants all the time, so shaving is never a priority for me. That being said, I hate when I do go swimming or wear shorts because I have to find time for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair removal wax kit really changed things for me! I was actually kind of worried it would be too painful to tolerate (I&#x27;m kind of a big baby...) But, it was not so bad! A few weeks into using the product and I&#x27;m still hair free!! I will definitely be purchasing this more often because it feels great not having to worry about shaving multiple times a week!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Been using it for over 2 years now. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me!!</li>
    <li> read the instructions and used the product as said to. Nothing happened at all. I just ended up pulling skin instead of hair. Really disappointed. The only thing that was good was that is was an easy set up.</li>
    <li> Being a guy, I&#x27;ve never really been one for waxing and similar alternative methods for hair removal. Give me a solid razor, and I’m generally fine. That being said, however, it can get tiresome shaving the thin hair that grows on my neck. My girlfriend uses this stuff and swears by it, and she convinced me to give it a try. I was a little leery about putting it on my throat and all, but she assured me that it would not, in fact, melt my skin off, and I wouldn&#x27;t need to shave for several weeks after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to find out, she was right. As usual. It hurt like the devil the first couple times, but it&#x27;s gotten a lot easier and less painful over time. I&#x27;m not sure how much time I&#x27;ve saved not having to shave every single day, but it&#x27;s a lot. Altogether, I&#x27;m pretty glad I let myself get talked into trying it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Decided to try this after having trouble with other wax--and am REALLY glad I did.  SO easy to use, so easy to remove. The best part of this product is that it washes right off your hands or anything else you get it on--I plan on purchasing more to use in the future.  Two Thumbs UP!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Fairly pain-free. Doesn&#x27;t come with nearly enough strips or applicators. The wax itself is great. Easy to warm up and apply.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the cover, it came earlier than expected and I am very much satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hair Removing Waxing Kit for my husband and I. My husband has a lot of hair on his back. He probably has enough hair on his back that he could make a small wig and it needs to be taken care of. I heated the wax up, applied the strip and I had to catch my breath as it removed all the hair that was under the strip. I couldn’t believe it. In 20 minutes I had his back completely hair free. There is no stubbles left. It left the skin completely soft. When you are done with the waxing, then I took a warm cloth and went over to remove any wax. It was so easy to use. If your husband has hair on his back, then I totally recommend this product. It isn’t painful. It removes all hair and leaves the skin soft. Once I tried it on him and he did fine, then I did it on my legs and perfect results. I will continue to use the Hair Removing Waxing Kit for men and women. It works amazingly!</li>
    <li> Horrible, absolutely horrible. I was giving this a shot for a second time and its still no good. Doesn&#x27;t grab all the hairs on even the simplest of areas.  Go use the Nads for men waaaaaaay more effective and cleaner. These things are a mess and a pain to clean up after.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to apply and effortless to wash with just water. No residue to stick to skin or bathroom tiles. All natural ingredients completely dissolves with water. It doesn&#x27;t come with many strips, but I easily found some on Ebay for really cheap.</li>
    <li> Bad wax ever used! Bought based in the good reviews, but honestly pls save your money and look for another wax! Not at all effective in hair removal and worst part, you will find your tiny hair coming out of skin the very next day as if you have done razor. Not at all worth it! I wish I had never bought it</li>
    <li> First time using sugar wax. I&#x27;ve been using the prewax strips. I have to say that I was using strips on my bikini area. Painful but by morning redness was gone and worth not having to do it for a month again. I tried this sugar wax this time (really wanted to try a brazilian area). The instructions were good and not hard to follow. Warm it so it drizzles like honey but not hot to burn. No smell really. I was surprised by what little irritation &amp; pain while I did my bikini area so I went ahead doing a bit at a time for a brazilian. Not to horrible especially since I&#x27;ve never done that area before. Didn&#x27;t have redness &amp; irritation that would last for hours either. This first couple times doing a new area have a little more discomfort. I&#x27;m not saying you won&#x27;t have any pain. I mean really you are rippin out hair at one time. I will say I have very coarse hair that grows back fast, there is a definate difference in the texture &amp; regrowth time. I  was so pleased that I did my husband&#x27;s back (gross but fun to rip off the strips). Make sure you buy extra strips or use old, thin jeans cut up. You can wash and re-use. I also got a plastic cake decoration spatula to put the wax on (I know it sounds strange but it works well and again wash and re-use). I laid a towel down and had a little bowl of room temp water.  It helps to periodically wipe off stickiness plus the cooler water helps the sensitive areas feel better right after. Just blot dry then move to another area while your skin dries completely then you can go back to waxing again. I love the fact it was easy water clean up.  Much less messy. Watch some videos, they do help.  Also if the skin is damp or clammy it doesn&#x27;t work as well so try sprinkle of corn starch baby powder, just a very little. Make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too long it hurts more. No more than 1/2 inch.i also read to wipe off with tea tree oil &amp; water to help keep infection down. It smells strong and medicinal. I may do the rose water to sooth next time. Iwill buy this product again. I also bought Gigi hard wax to try. There are alot of steps it seem plus instructions were not in english. I&#x27;ll have to look that one up and try it on a less sensitive area. We shall see. Good luck</li>
    <li> The product is really a must have in any guy&#x27;s grooming kit. I use this to keep my chest, stomach, and pubic area smooth. The first time i used this product it was painful, it gets slightly better over time. It is not a very messy product to use, but i only use it when I have a significant amount of hair to remove not just a few stray hairs. I would recommend an epilator to compliment this product. The epilator can allow you to go many more days without having to wax. Ive been able to go 2 months between waxes by using the epilator to touch up. Also grab extra waxing strips, you are going to need them.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Gotta get extra hair removal strips though. It&#x27;s very easy to clean off since it&#x27;s water soluble. Makes for easy cleanup since wax can get pretty messy.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 20 years now.  I tend to still nick myself once in awhile. I have heard alot of great things about shaving creams and lotions but had never tried any.  I found BodyHonee by accident when I was looking for something else on Amazon.  So I ordered the hair removal kit.&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it, my legs were so soft and and the hair on my legs were gone.  Along with the stubbles that I usually feel the very next day with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use.  I cannot believe I waited so long.  Love sugar wax!</li>
    <li> Awesome easy and that&#x27;s what I like</li>
    <li> After over a year of using BodyHonee, I&#x27;ve finally got my technique down and will never use another hair remover. Honestly pulling out your hair from the root is going to hurt regardless of what you use but I feel like BodyHonee makes it a little more bearable than conventional wax. It takes a little bit of practice to get used to it, but after the first few tries, I was able to get the clean professional results I wanted. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent if you have sensitive skin. Shaving daily can be irritating to the skin, time consuming, and expensive over time. Cream hair removal products either don&#x27;t work or leave the skin feeling like it has a chemical burn and doesn&#x27;t last much longer than shaving. However, this wax will provide lasting hair removal that is not irritating. It may take a few tries to get the hang of it if you&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, but taking the time to learn how to use it will be well worth it. Some people may take to it with no problem at all. I struggled a bit at first because I&#x27;ve never had much luck with tax that requires cloth strips, but after a couple tries I figured it out. Make sure you pay attention to the heating instructions and always run your hand along the cloth strip in the direction of your hair growth before you try to remove it. This really does make a difference! Patience and practice will provide excellent results with this product even if you struggle in the beginning.</li>
    <li> shipped fast and work great too thanks for great product. painful of course and not long lasting but worked.</li>
    <li> I am a total baby when it comes to waxing. I&#x27;ve never been able to do it before, but BodyHonee made it easy. The box came with everything I needed, even though I wasn&#x27;t very familiar with waxing. Instructions provided everything I needed to know. The waxing was as pain free as waxing can be. It was a little uncomfortable, but any waxing will be. If youre looking for 100% pain free, just shave. That being said, this wax is about as gentle as wax gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I used the kit about 3 weeks ago and I still have no hair on my legs! ! My hair does grow slow, but even so, no sign of hair and it’s been almost a month! Totally worth it to not have to deal with shaving for so long.</li>
    <li> I have tried three other wax systems and this one is the best I have found and no plans to look for another!!I really appreciate the simple ingredients and the directions. I do recommend that if you plan to do a full wax job that you buy additional strips though.</li>
    <li> this waxing is so good to remove your hair.&lt;br /&gt;this works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I totally removed my hair on my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I think i can use this for several years.&lt;br /&gt;So much price competitive compared to visiting skin care clinique.</li>
    <li> It worked okay, I guess, definitely wasn&#x27;t the greatest wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Left some hair behind. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is using this product for, but I tried to use it to remove hair and it did not. I read the instructions carefully and used it as directed, but it did not remove a single hair. It made my skin sticky (and it is not, as it says, water soluble- I had to scrub it off with soap) and I remained as hairy as ever. Can anyone recommend good tweezers?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing (legs) and this was what I got to start out. There aren&#x27;t nearly enough strips that come with it, but the few that were there worked well. I didn&#x27;t like the wax at all. The hair just didn&#x27;t come off with it. I didn&#x27;t even use the whole jar. I bought &amp;#34;L&#x27;Orbette LO-2100 Wax-Liquid Natural Wax&amp;#34; and I love it - it&#x27;s a much better deal and the wax actually works! Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love that this comes off with just water!! I have waxed before and always have a huge mess to clean up afterwards, and baby oil gets everywhere. This heated up quickly, and washed off quickly in the shower. I figured out I have to use smaller strips (cut them) and was using too much wax at once. Doing smaller sections like that worked better and no shaving for a while! &#x3D;) I also love that this is not full of nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t rip skin off and no bruising if done correctly with their instructions. The natural ingredients are great on anyone&#x27;s skin, especially sensitive skin. Does the job right the first time and the strip can be washed to be reused if you prefer to save money. I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback, but I couldn&#x27;t help it this time - Super satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. Anything from shaving to salon wax makes it angry red. After reading reviews from many users with sensitive skin, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash off any moisturizer from your skin, pat it dry and powder it before applying the wax or the results will be patchy. My skin looked normal and smooth after I completed one leg and that&#x27;s awesome. It is a perfect starter kit with all the supplies for anyone trying to find something better.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here except it works as advertised. I wanted to remove hair on my back and it did exactly that! I have nothing to compare it against but will say that i&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Tried it out and was NOT happy. It didn&#x27;t pull the hair follicle at all, but just broke the hair and left what basically feels like stubble. May work on women, but it probably won&#x27;t work on men with thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have coarse body hair and have never had success with at home kits. My hair also grows fast and so if I don&#x27;t shave daily it can get out of control fast. Where other waxes fall short, this one delivers. Not only that but its all natural which is awesome for people who are label readers like myself. You really only need a little bit to take care of stubbly hairs and it does definitely work best if there&#x27;s enough grow out for it to grab. My skin is sensitive to chemicals and usually freaks out for days after waxing but not this time. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works in the privacy of my own home.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and the wax removed very little hair.  Because of the pain it caused, I won&#x27;t be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Info:  There are only 2 sticks and a few wax strips, so you&#x27;ll eventually need to order more if this stuff works for you.</li>
    <li> Difficult to work with, would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This works better than I expected. Especially since it&#x27;s made of glucose. Doesn&#x27;t work very well for my eyebrows though, but for pits and bikini it works great. Plus it&#x27;s REALLY EASY to clean off excess wax because it&#x27;s just sugar and you can rinse it off with water. Great for people who make mistakes in putting too much wax on.</li>
    <li> In past experiences I have had never had any luck with waxing kits so I was pleasantly surprised when I used this product.  I really enjoyed the fact that it has just three ingredients and that it is natural because I love using natural products.  The amount of product is also great because I can use this product multiple times instead of just a one time use product.  the instructions were simple to use and easy to understand.  This product removed the hair and basically just worked great!</li>
    <li> This is full orice like the actual website.  Tip off alert!</li>
    <li> Great for removing back hair and other thicker hair. The residue wipes off easily and doesn&#x27;t stick like other brands do. My only gripe would be that it doesn&#x27;t  come with a whole lot of strips. It left my skin very smooth and did not irritate my skin at all other than the little redness expected. Does it hurt? Is hair being pulled out not supposed to?</li>
    <li> It is works, but is not strong enough. I get a hard time using it. I will try something else</li>
    <li> My body hair grows rapidly due to a medical condition I have and I&#x27;ve tried numerous methods of getting rid of it.  I saw the recommendations on this product and decided to give it a try.  It removed the hair as promised and so far the regrowth is minimal,  The only negative comments I have is that like all products of this type it is messy and you will have to be careful when applying it.  Also, I did have a few red areas show up along with some burning and I needed to use a &amp;#34;healing cream&amp;#34;, like Curel, instead of my regular moisturizer on these areas.  But overall I am pleased wsith the product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> The price seems steep for a product that you can make yourself with simple recipe on the internet (water, sugar, and lemon). It works quite well and is way less painful than non-sugar waxes.</li>
    <li> I could not understand why this product had so many good reviews and virtually no bad ones. This stuff is terrible. One of the worst purchases of my life. For some reason though when I try to give it a bad review my review won&#x27;t post. You have to be tricky with the wording so their system can&#x27;t determine whether your satisfied or not. Maybe this review will post. Likely not though since previous reviews have not. I bet a lot of people had a horrible experience with this stuff but their opinion was blocked by amazon.</li>
    <li> For years, I have struggled with shaving my legs. I don&#x27;t know what it is with my skin or the hair on it, but it&#x27;s terrible: ingrown hairs, razor bumps, immediate regrowth, red spots. You name it, I&#x27;ve dealt with it. I bought this at-home waxing kit because to be honest, I am scared to death to go to a salon or spa and have this procedure done. Part of it is the embarrassment of having someone see my legs up close and part of it is having to go through excruciating pain in public. I thought an at-home kit would save me embarrassment and offer me the chance to stop if I decided that this process wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparing the wax was quick and easy - just follow the instructions, and you&#x27;re good to go! Everything you need to complete several waxes is included with the kit, and they are high quality products. Even though I&#x27;ve never been waxed, it was pretty easy to figure out how to do it. I watched a couple of videos online prior to starting, so I was able to position my hands the correct way and pull the strips up in the right direction. I am not going to lie: there is some pain (you are pulling hair out of your legs, y&#x27;know), but it&#x27;s not nearly as painful as I&#x27;d imagined. Best of all, the hair comes off -- all of it! I received this product in the mail about 3 days ago, and I still have absolutely no regrowth! This is amazing! My legs have never felt so smooth and silky before, and I can&#x27;t wait until all of my old scars and blemishes start to disappear so that I can rock these gorgeous stems with a nice skirt and some heels.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t spread if not hot enough, if you got it to hot it was useless.....and came like completely stuck shut.</li>
    <li> This sugar wax is unlike other wax kits I have tried to use. I have thick hair and this product actually got all the hair on the first use. I am going to need to by strips and applicators because I will be using this for my wax again because it works so well. Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> Great! I used it on my arm pits &amp; had salon quality. Everything was gone!! Very easy to do. Highly recommended! Make sure you exfoliate &amp; use on clean skin! (:</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It is the first hair removal waxing product that I have tried that actually works. If you are looking for a way to get rid of unwanted hair, this is the perfect choice. It is affordable and effective. The only downside is that it should contain more strips. Other than that, this kit is money well spent!</li>
    <li> Despite numerous attempts on all different length hair, and using two different brands of strips in addition to the ones that came with the kit, I could not get this product to work at all. It simply does not grip the hair no matter how thin or thickly or at what temperature you apply it. Was excited to try an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product but I might as well have thrown my money in the trash.  Useless product. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I randomly decided I didn&#x27;t like having such a hairy chest, shoulders, and stomach. I tried shaving and it just came back too quickly. I&#x27;ve never gotten a professional wax before, and I&#x27;ve never used any home waxing products before trying BodyHonee. I liked the idea that it was three simple, natural ingredients. The instructions were quite simple: warm it up 30 seconds in the microwave, apply in the direction of the hair growth with the popsicle stick applicator, put the waxing strip on, and pull back against the direction of the hair growth quickly. Easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 seconds in the microwave, and the wax was runny and easy to apply, and it was noticeably warm but not hot. In fact, as I continued to apply it over a period of about 20 minutes, the wax cooled down but was still easy to apply. Pulling the first wax strip was quite a shock. In the moment I pulled, it was a flash of pain and my skin turned bright red. The amount of hair on the wax strip was amazing. Be sure to pull very quickly, and pull close to the body -- do not pull outwards. If you have trouble mentally getting ready to pull, looking away helps. I developed lots of bloody spots, presumably from where the hairs were pulled out. A cleanser and lotion helped for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a bunch of spots that I missed, which I know I can easily go back and get, but I had enough for one session. I took an hour-long bath afterward, got out, and felt a smooth chest and stomach for the first time since I was 12. A few hours later, and there&#x27;s some very light stinging but only when my shirt rubs against the waxed areas. The redness went away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the Fantasea non-woven body wax strips, and I&#x27;m glad I did -- I quickly ran out of the first set of ten in the box. The Fantasea strips were better and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was pretty messy, but you have to expect that with any wax. Lining the sink / countertop with newspaper or paper towels solves that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, you can wax too!</li>
    <li> I used this product to help a friend wax his chest and I was impressed by the results. It was a very simple, easy process but make sure you completely follow the instructions, I don&#x27;t think the outcome would have been the same if I had not followed the instructions correctly.</li>
    <li> After a few different days of trying it, it just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. It was just messy and sticky. Bit it was easy to clean up</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how it was very hard to get the wax off your skin and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair. Maybe I was doing something wrong but I followed all the directions.</li>
    <li> It works for small areas, but it did not work for the bikini area at all. Probably will just go to a professional next time and not waste my money.</li>
    <li> After using this product I will never complain about, or understand why, my wife get her &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; waxed every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use on my back because I&#x27;m probably a little hairier than most.  I&#x27;m not like &amp;#34;is that guy wearing a sweater at the beach?&amp;#34; hairy but I definitely have some back hair that I would like to get removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my wife recommended getting this product to take care of it.  I laid down and she put the product on, which felt surprising good.  It was warm and kind of like getting my back scratched....until I realized something was wrong.  My wife was laughing manically as she pulled my skin tight and ripped the bandage off like she was pull starting the lawn mower. I screamed and cried like a two year old getting a shot and my dog went running from the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After she was done my back was a little raw but smooth (except for the patches that she missed).  I kind of felt like a mulching bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works great but takes some practice.  You will need to buy more bandages and sticks and I would recommend buying them before you begin.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything. I followed instructions to the letter but result was 0. &amp;#34;Wax&amp;#34; is liquid even at room temperature and not nearly strong enough for anything but extremely soft heirs.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my husbands back hair. I tried it several times. It just jerked the hair and made his back hurt. I followed the directions exactly what they said. I guess it is not good for hairy men. I ended up using a razor on his back.</li>
    <li> I love this product. does work well and removes the hair.&lt;br /&gt; easy to use, just pop in microwave to melt. and not messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it might actually work but way too messy and hard to remove to even deal with. Would also be easier with someone else&#x27;s help. Too much struggle, not worth it.</li>
    <li> Ive tried many waxes, and none of them worked very well. I used this wax for my bikini line, and I was impressed! I could wax myself (it still hurt) but it didn&#x27;t take near the effort of some waxes that I have tried. I suggest buying extra wax strips though, because it doesn&#x27;t come with enough.</li>
    <li> Love that it wipes away with just water and does not leave any sticky residue that is impossible to remove. The kit comes with enough wax for your full body and *almost* enough strips - I went ahead and purchased additional strips since I was planning on a full body wax. Using talcum powder before applying the wax helped it hurt less and work better too! I love this wax so much I am about to buy more right now.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my Back and Chest. I have to say I was completely surprised as i have alot of hair. I though i would have to go to a waxing spa. I ordered this product and tried it out. It actually worked as it is supposed to and removed the hair my my chest and back with no problem, Next step will be to do my arms and legs, and then work on my tan. It worked well enough that my wife had me order her a set as well, as she hates traditional waxing. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with unwanted Body hair, that wants it gone.</li>
    <li> not good for bikini area and armpit....may be should buy the stronger one!</li>
    <li> I had never used a wax kit before, and was a little nervous trying this one.  I had expectations of pain (excruciating pain!) whenever I thought of waxing, but thought I would give it a try.  I had read to use some powder on areas that are a little warmer or more moist so that the sugar can grab the hairs more easily.  I chose to use baby powder and it worked just fine. I left the wax a little longer int he microwave than recommended, but got the perfect consistency for removing hair from my underarms (the first area I dared try).  I was relieved to find it did not hurt at all, and was incredibly effective at removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other areas next, and like the first area I had tried, it was easy, painless and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing kit received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this product to give it a try as I was tired of going to salons. I was amazed by this wax kit. It is the best home wax kit I have ever tried. It has natural ingredients,long lasting, easy to use and the best thing is it is appropriately priced.  Unlike all wax, this wax is suitable for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;It was really simple and amazingly quick - 30 seconds in Microwave, apply on to dry skin, quickly pull off, easily wash off the extra wax and its done, you have your smooth hair free skin. No skin irritation, no mess.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this wax kit to anyone who wants to save time and money going to salons.</li>
    <li> I love the Body Honee kit! I get irritated reallllly easily, but I did not break out after this one and it was very smooth. I will be repurchasing and making this my permanent wax kit.</li>
    <li> Was an awful product! I purchased this to use for back hair, and it did nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> This was absolutely the worst idea I&#x27;ve had in a while. It made a HUGE mess, and didn&#x27;t even get the hair out even after several applications and strips. The wax cools within a minute, so it doesn&#x27;t even stay warm and you have to constantly reheat. Not worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> This product works well, and does what it says. wax on, rip hair off. Perfect for manscaping, AKA hedge trimming, AKA the Justin Beiber, AKA 12yr old, AKA yeah they slick, AKA looking good.</li>
    <li> does not work- very hard to heat</li>
    <li> Great product.  I really appreciate that the wax is water soluble so I can reuse the waxing strips, and also wash any excess off.  Works great at removing hair and clean up is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product since epillating is quite slow and painful and going to a wax center is pricey if you are a relatively hairy male like myself. If you can handle the pain of epillating, then this product will be a great switch for you. It goes on warm,  and is quite efficient and plucking out hair including fine ones. The finished result was quite nice. As other posters have said, you should buy additional strips as the ones with the product will not be enough to last. In addition, if you are a male and looking to wax your shoulders/back/chest then 1 jar of this stuff will get you through it but you won&#x27;t have enough to do it twice. Still, the price beats the wax center. I will continue buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this as I had never even heard of it before. I was looking for something to keep my legs smooth for a while. This product was easy to use and not painful at all. The residue washed off quickly and my legs felt so good and smooth. The only draw back is that you may need to reheat the BodyHonee to keep it soft enough to spread thinly.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred using a wax for hair removal over a trimmer and thought of trying out this product after looking at some other good reviews. Surprisingly, it turned out very well. The wax heats up in like a min in the microwave. After applying the wax, the hair comes out very smoothly with the strips and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, it can be a bit strenuous to do it yourself and also can be a little messy with the wax sticking here and there. The pack has only 10 strips which is not enought to do a leg and hand wax. I had to order a couple more for a cheap price. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is totally worth the price and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this wax kit! It works well for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.&lt;br /&gt;As with any wax kit, there is a level of pain, but the results are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth skin with no traces of hair at all! I am anxious to see how long this wax will keep the hair away and will be ordering more of the fabulous strips to use in the future.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural hair removal kit. I am tired of shaving my legs all the time. I love this product because it&#x27;s all natural. There are three ingredients - sugar, lemon and a little salt. It easily warms up in the microwave and stays warm for a while, so you can continue using it without having to heat it up. I had no pain at all while using this hair removal product. BodyHonee removes hair on my legs and arms. My son used it on his chest and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply spread a little on an area, laid down a piece of the cloth that came with it, then pulled it off and the hair came off with it. Any excess is easily washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is a large jar, it will take me a while to finish this because you only use a little bit at a time. I love the BodyHonee hair removal kit, and when I do run out, I will buy some more.</li>
    <li> I do not normally leave reviews but when the product exceeds my expectations I feel I must. I recently had the pleasure of using the Hair Removal Waxing Kit for men and women 8.8 Oz All Natural by BodyHonee and have to say that it worked phenomenally. I have very thick hair and all of the other wax kits I&#x27;ve tried either doesn&#x27;t remove all my hair or irritates my skin, so naturally I was very sceptical on the quality of this kit. Friends have tried it and swear by it&#x27;s effectiveness. The kit was easy to apply and works the first time. The fact that it is made from natural resources made my skin feel smooth with no irritation. It was quick and the results were salon quality. I am surprised I haven&#x27;t tried this from the beginning! I highly recommend this product to everyone looking for a great alternative to shaving.</li>
    <li> Love this wax kit - it&#x27;s gentle, effective, everything I have always searched for in a wax kit but never found. Any leftovers left on the skin can quickly be wiped away with water...so there is little to no mess. The pain was much less than what I have experienced in the past with other wax products. Skin feels as smooth as butter now :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take off any of my body hair</li>
    <li> horrible product. didn&#x27;t remove one hair just hurt like hell anx left skin very irritated. would never ever buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use and very effective. I have never done this before, but used to shave my husbands back in the summer to get rid of the unwanted hair. I ordered this product and it was to my house in less than a week.The directions were thorough and I followed them and the results were excellent. There was no mess and I saved money, as to have had this done in a salon would have been $50+. Thank you Body Honee!</li>
    <li> used this product hoping to wax my legs but absolutely zero hair came off! I tried it on my arms and I have very thin hair on my arms and it still didn&#x27;t get any of the hair off. Disappointing and a waste.</li>
    <li> Great for removing that wool sweater ur guy wears on his back.  I kinda like the hair, but he does not, and its HIS back.  This stuff really works good.  He came away from the whole process with just a bit of pink skin.  No bumps, or sore areas.  Did a good job of hair removal too.</li>
    <li> Body Honee was very easy to use for me.  I have tried several other products; and I have even paid high prices to be virtually tortured by my local spa as they waxed the unwanted hairs from my body.  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by how little it hurt to use this product.  On top of that, it really worked and I didn&#x27;t have to repeat the process for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble waxing my bikini area either; and it was perfect for my face, arms, and even my legs.  The only complaint I have is that the canister of wax wasn&#x27;t big enough for me to do my husband as well.  Lord knows he needs it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants smooth skin without a lot of pain.  On top of that, it is a perfect kit for those who wish to use all natural products, as it only has 3 ingredients.  It makes a great gift as well as an ideal staple for any woman&#x27;s home.</li>
    <li> I guess my body hair was too thick for this to work properly. It works on my hands and wrists where there were some hairs but not on my backside or thighs. Shame.</li>
    <li> This hurt so badly. I recommend any Italians or Spanish people to shy away from this product as it&#x27;s 10 times worse than 40 year old version makes it out to be.</li>
    <li> I had never used a wax kit before. Thought it would be too painful – and I have very sensitive skin. But, I also have very light, fair skin and my dark coarse hair shows up within a day after shaving. I decided to try waxing so that I could truly have soft, smooth-looking skin this summer without the look of “stubble”. My friend recommended this product to me after she had good results with it. I prepared myself for the worst and she helped me out. A quick, fast pull is how she removed the strips and I was shocked to see the amount of hair that came off! I will not lie . . . this product is not “comfortable” but it is tolerable. And the results were more than enough to make the pain worthwhile. My skin looks so smooth – like a newborn baby! – and it has been weeks and no hair regrowth yet. I am glad I finally tried waxing because it is something I will continue to do as part of my beauty routine. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The best</li>
    <li> This product quite simply did not work for me. I have relatively thin but dark hair, and I have a huge problem getting any waxes or similar products to actually stick to my hair well enough to pull it out. I followed the directions and put a bit of baby powder on the area and it still pulled out virtually none of my hair. I was very disappointed as most people seem to swear by this but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> What a mess!!!!  No way</li>
    <li> I got this for my back. I do not have a ton of hair on my back, but I do have some patches that can get thicker than I like. I decided to have my girlfriend wax my back. She didnt have much experience with waxing but has done it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you heard about waxing hurting is true. The pain is pretty bad but it only last for a second and you start to get used to it after about 10 strips or so. Certain spots hurt worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My back stayed hair free for a good 3-4 weeks. Its now 2 months later and hair has grown back but it is still minor compared to what it was. Around the 2-3 week mark when hair was wanting to grow back i did get some red bumps. I have fairly sensitive skin though. That cleared up fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a pretty neat experience. Loved my back hair free but I probably wouldnt do it again. I will just stick to buzzing it once a week or so. Waxing just isnt for me, but may be right for some people.</li>
    <li> I noticed that a lot of people were complaining about there not being enough strips in the kit. Because the formulation is water-soluble, you simply need to wash the strips in warm water and lay them out to dry. Then they&#x27;re good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize this until I read the reviews for the Nads gel hair removal kit. It&#x27;s saved me a ton of headache knowing that you don&#x27;t need to buy new strips every time you wax (even if they are cheap). Save yourself the money and just wash the darn suckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulation is pretty nice and it&#x27;s virtually painless compared to other waxes I&#x27;ve tried. My only issue is that it does not come with calming lotion/gel and the redness lasts longer than usual. Overall, would recommend buying this kit.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how well this wax would work, but it fully surpassed my expectations. It heats up very quickly in the microwave (about 20 seconds is enough). It spreads very easily and doesn&#x27;t need to dry before use. It also comes off very easily with water. If you follow the instructions, you should have absolutely no issues using this wax. However, I recommend you order some more wax applicator sticks and strips with this wax, as this kit only contains enough to wax small areas. You should also consider ordering a novocaine or lidocaine numbing cream because waxing is far more painful than I expected it to be. Lastly, when applying the wax, make sure to apply it very thinly and scrape off the excess to prevent painful mishaps.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am doing it wrong but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product!! I haven&#x27;t tried to wax myself since I was a teenager, and was a bit hesitant to try again, but I was getting sick of paying so much for my monthly wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it would be helpful to know a bit about how waxes work (even though this technically isn&#x27;t a wax) if you&#x27;re going to use this product. How this product works also depends a lot on the person using it. You need to use it properly to get the best results, so make sure you read all of the instructions first. (Apply the warmed product to dry, clean skin in the direction your hair is growing, press firmly with the cloth right away,hold skin tightly, and rip off quickly in opposite direction.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took only 25 seconds for the product to warm up in my microwave. I loved that it was only supposed to be warmed up slightly (to a honey-like consistency), and not hot. No burns here! I have very sensitive skin, and was so happy to find something with all natural ingredients. It caused no irritation at all. I used this product on my entire bikini area, forearms, and even on my hubby&#x27;s back! (That was fun! lol.) If I applied too much, or got some on the floor, I just used a wet cloth to wipe it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product removed all my hair the first time. This is so much less than the cost of a salon wax, plus I can do more areas all from the same jar. The jar is Huge (10 ounces!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. I have no desire to try anything else. I will most definitely be using in the future again as soon as my hair grows back. Very happy with this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Having gone in for professional waxes through my teenage years then switching to epilating in college, I found my way back to waxing with this cheaper home waxing alternative and I love it. I manage my pain better when I am the one doing the wax, which is why the wax removal was relatively painless (to me). This product removed my body hair exceptionally well, and as an added benefit-it wipes clean with water, so it is very easy to clean up from your skin and other surfaces afterwards. Overall, highly recommended- but be sure to use talcum powder and make sure your hairs are at least 3/4\\&quot; long- It helps tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the amount of wax strips I would use. The wax kit comes with only 10 strips, so I ended up ordering the pack of 100 wax strips by BodyHonee and that was more than enough for a number of full body wax sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and give this product a try, it worked great for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It needs to include more strips, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Only comes with 2 sticks so definitely purchase more. I ended up ordering some as soon as I received the delivery for about $5. There are lords of waxing strips even tho I ordered more. There are much better kits but this one is easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase &amp;#34;BODYHONEE&amp;#34; again. Starting off the packaging is small, convenient and easy to open. It comes with everything you need and the instructions are concise, easy to follow and helpful. The price is very reasonable along with the shipping costs. What sold me on “BODYHONEE” is that it’s all natural and safe. I have very sensitive skin and I had no issues with this product! After I used “BODYHONEE” my skin was softer and did not look irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;“BODYHONEE” offers great advice in their booklet that comes with the wax. For example, you get advice on the proper way to wax, and the “do’s and dont’s” of waxing, which is beneficial if this is your first time waxing at home. The instructions are short, clear, and to the point. I really liked this because I didn’t have to do a lot of “reading between the lines”.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend anyone looking to do any sort of waxing at home to buy &amp;#34;BODYHONEE&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair and deep roots. I have tried other products but decided to test this one. It didn&#x27;t remove any of my hair and I followed all directions and used baby powder. Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this on every part of my body....worthless.  Save your $.  Didn&#x27;t remove any hair, but was just as painful as real wax.</li>
    <li> I have coarse body hair...and am rather hairy. Since the day I started shaving I&#x27;ve known there HAS to be a better way. I&#x27;ve tried the depilatory creams both drug store and professional grade. They burn my skin and leave me with hair. That&#x27;s AFTER I scrub my skin raw getting the nasty smelling cream off. Every new fancy razor just seems a variation of the same, with only the price tag changing. The day I decided to get waxed by a friend (and esthetician) I thought I&#x27;d finally graduated. That painful experience I had avoided for years had become my only option. Waxing wasn&#x27;t terrible, especially with the gentle products used so I started searching for an option to do at home. After trying a couple of kits that ended in sticky, painful messes, I got this one. The high ratings are definitely earned. It did exactly what it says, removed the hair with one use. Not only that, the product came off easily WITHOUT hurting my skin. I&#x27;m so relieved.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. A hell of a lot less expensive then going to a waxing place.</li>
    <li> does not work for me.</li>
    <li> I used this to wax my husband&#x27;s back.  He usually gets this done at the salon for $60 plus tip.  We did it at home with a perfect result.  We used half of the product.  I did order extra strips.</li>
    <li> The only positive thing is that it washes away easily. Besides that there are definitely not enough strips to even fully shave two legs and bikini. I think the ones you buy at the store are about the same price if not cheaper for same results. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this waxing kit for the summer, I really only wanted to do my bikini area (not a Brazialian, this wax would be a mess for that). Once I got the hang of it, the waxing worked very well. I made a few mistakes, but luckily I was unharmed. I was a bit alarmed at the amount of redness right after waxing, but it went away in a few hours and skin was smooth and beach ready! I definitely recommend purchasing the extra strips, I used up about 5 strips just trying to get used to doing it. Also, make sure the wax is nice and thin, it works much better with a very thin coat. So much better than shaving (which I HATE). I think I&#x27;m one of those people who just can&#x27;t shave anything with good results, I always get ingrown hairs and they are very painful. No pain with this wax! I love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews for products but this review is warranted. I did a ton of research on at home waxing kits before I purchased this one and I am 100% satisfied with BodyHonee Sugar Wax. All waxing is going to hurt a little no matter what product you use. But I barely felt a sting with this. I also used a small amount of talc powder (as recommended with over reviews) before I used the wax. Results are outstanding. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do some at home waxing. Its a process for bigger areas of the body (legs and arms) but completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have to first mention that I haven&#x27;t tried other at-home waxing products but wanted to give this a try.  Boy is it messy!  And doing it by yourself is tricky.  If you&#x27;re good at this sort of thing (one hand waxing for each arm...self-inflicting pain) then this is a great product...  Definitely get more strips - there aren&#x27;t even enough to wax one leg!&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: all natural ingredients, and it does get the hair out if you apply correctly</li>
    <li> I only tried waxing a few times before this, every time at home, and it&#x27;s never worked on my skin. I&#x27;ve followed the directions, and I even grew my leg hair out for a good 2 1/2 months or so before trying this kit, but I have extremely fine hair and it just didn&#x27;t come off. (Even after the couple months, it was really short). Doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to wax my legs. It&#x27;s a little messy, but it works really well! I have darker, thicker leg hair (sometimes 3 little hairs from the same follicle), and this product did a great time removing them. Since it only has 10 strips, I bought a 100-pk of strips and those should last me a looong while.</li>
    <li> This was a mess.  I think the Surgi-Wax was much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this product works.</li>
    <li> Wax works great on fine, sparse areas.  If the hair has been shaven in the past and has become even slightly more coarse, it takes several strips to remove the majority of hair (which for some can cause sensitivity) and the remaining hair will have to be tweezed.  If you are looking for a wax to take care of your bikini line, there&#x27;s others better than this...because come on ladies, if we&#x27;re going to go through that pain, it better be worth it.</li>
    <li> Just your average wax. Not worth the price when you can get it cheaper at tour local store.</li>
    <li> I have waxed at many different salons and tried numerous at-home products. Most are extremely messy and ineffective. Salons are often expensive and out of my budget- yet so many at-home waxes are completely worthless. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and so few actually work. The ones that do work are messy and hard to clean up (and God forbid I spill some on the floor- or accidently get it on my hand). Some have ridiculously complicated instructions that leave me feeling like a science experiment rather than an at-home spa treatment recipient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this product is perfect. The first time I tried it I was so surprised how easy it cleaned up- just use water! Yes, literally just water. I have never found any other kind of body wax that works in this way. And I&#x27;ve been pained time and time again with ridiculous clean-up tactics trying to eliminate sticky residue from building up all over my body (that&#x27;s no fun for anyone!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product needs practice to make perfect (as with all waxes). Spread it thinly and practice pulling the strip correctly- so the hair comes off with the root. It may take a few tries to get it right, but once you figure out the angle and speed that works for you, this product will work better than most waxes out there. Pull quick and efficiently- in fact for some people it may be better to have a close friend help you out and do the pulling for you. Pull in the opposite direction of your hair growth (for legs you&#x27;ll pull up). An important tip is to remember that your hair needs to be long enough in order to wax. A lot of people think you can wax short hairs- not true. Let your hair grow out to an appropriate length before trying to wax or it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for brazillion, bikini, leg, and eyebrow waxes. It&#x27;s worked great each time. In hard-to-reach spots I have my roommate help me to make sure it all goes smoothely (no pun intended). This is now my third time buying the product, but definitely not my last. And that says a lot- because I&#x27;ve switched from so many different brands. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found one I can stick with!but definitely not my last. And that says a lot- because I&#x27;ve switched from so many different brands. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found one I can stick with!</li>
    <li> Waxing is an uncomfortable thing we all must do....not with BodyHonee! This has by far been the best waxing kit that I have ever tried. You might need to get another packet of strips, but that is no big deal. I would recommend this for not only women but also men! Most comfortable experience I have had with hair removale. I have shaved, had laser, as well as spa waxing and this has beaten out all of them. I have very sensitive skin as well and I had no reaction to the product at all. I would recommend to anyone willing to try the easy way out, plus it is a great price as well!!</li>
    <li> I had never used any kind of waxing product before and was afraid it would be complicated or messy. While this can be a tad messy if you&#x27;re not careful, it&#x27;s basically made of honey so it washes off fairly easily (as compared to a waxier substance). It works very well for hair removal and it&#x27;s simple to use. It doesn&#x27;t come with many strips though so be sure and purchase extra.  Another tip is to apply only a very thin coat. If it&#x27;s too thick, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. For this reason, a little goes a long way. This is definitely my new favorite way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Wow incredible waxing kit, but the only problem i had with it is that, it took more than 30 sec to heat the wax and it cools down faster so i had to do warm it over and over again.</li>
    <li> This wax is great. I actually have not used an at home wax since college (a lot of years ago :) but I am now staying home and not working so going to a salon just doesn&#x27;t happen. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. First, it smells like actual honey and I like products with more natural ingredients. It IS pretty sticky which is what you want though to ensure you get all the hair. I did a patch test on my legs and had no reaction- just disappearing hair. I would recommend getting an extra set of the epilating strips (also good). The product easily washes off with simple soap and water. You don&#x27;t have to be a pro to do this, just take your time.</li>
    <li> I have used it once and it was ok</li>
    <li> Great product!  I am so addicted to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a novice to waxing kits. I used a kit from a beauty supply store and I ran out before I could finish. What a waste. I&#x27;ve tried making my own wax and that was a disaster. This wax is easy to use! I put it in my microwave for 30 seconds and it stayed warm for about 20 minutes. A little pain, but actually much less painful then the last kit I tried. I did both of my legs and I still have plenty of wax left over to use for multiple applications. This is totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this water soluble product, but it didn&#x27;t even pull off the wax, let alone the hair. I have waxed for years, and am experienced, but this stuff was a dud.</li>
    <li> It did not work as well as I hoped. It got some hair off but never really got all off</li>
    <li> I did careful research before buying this product. I read over the instructions given on these reviews twice before trying it. I have only done my underarms so far, but I am amazed! I bought the wax kit and used it as directed. I was in shock that all the hairs came out. It left a few hairs, but I just applied wax over those tiny areas to get the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product and I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well on my bikini line, which is what I originally bought it for. I recommend this for any guys or gals out there who prefer to DIY, like me and will take the time to read directions thoroughly. It&#x27;s worth it - my pits are so silky smooth in a way that can never be achieved with shaving.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easy to heat up, literally 30 seconds in the microwave. And not to mention easy clean up, Icky and stickiness gone by just wiping it off with damp cloth. It does however takes a few tries sometimes to take the hair off, but I believe it might just be me being too impatient and not waiting for the wax to dry enough.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience waxing my legs. It took me a while to grow my hair long enough to be able to have it waxed. It was very easy to use this kit. After just 30 seconds in the microwave, the waxing solution was warm enough to be easily spread on my skin. It was of a very comfortable temperature, not hot at all. Since I’ve never done it before, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it went great! It did take me a few tries to figure out how to minimize the pain. My boyfriend helped me with ripping the paper off my legs and it helped as he was able to do it closer to the skin and it didn’t hurt as much. It did take off a lot of hair. However, my hair is very fine and I had a lot of shorter very thin hair growing under the longer hair. I’ll have to do it again during the winter when I can grow out my hair much longer to ensure that all the hair gets waxed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great kit and it really does work. I really like it that it only has 3 ingredients: salt, sugar and lemon. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it for everybody.</li>
    <li> Too much pain bulls***</li>
    <li> Does not remove hair very well. It gets maybe 75% of my hair but I&#x27;m always left with fussy legs from the stragglers. The plus side is that if I spill it, it is very easily to clean up since it is just sugar.</li>
    <li> Really liked this wax product. Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin irritated. I like what the other reviewer said about the short comings of shaving which leaves behind stubble and ingrown hairs. And used the product on my butt and underarms and will try manl and next. I&#x27;ll let you guys know how that goes :-).</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. I did everything the instructions say, and it pulled maybe 1 or 2 hairs out. I was doing my underarms for reference. Wax was exact temp, made sure the strip was good and rubbed onto the wax on the skin, pulled the skin tight, ripped it off and nothing!! Worst product ever!! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Easy to clean up since its sugar and disolves with warm water. The strips are washable and reusable.</li>
    <li> It works, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay that price again for a waxing kit.</li>
    <li> Can be a little difficult to use the first time but works well when you get the hang of it!</li>
    <li> Time after time I&#x27;d go to the salon for a wax and was always disappointed by how much money I would end up spending each week. I did some research online and found out about this product. Takes a little practice to learn how to wax yourself, but it&#x27;s worth it - I save SO much money every month! I love that it is water washable and DOES NOT permanently stick to everything it touches. Just a little water and BAM, any leftover residue is off! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I prefer wax over this product.  As a novice, it was messy.  The fact that the hair needs to at least a 1/4 inch long to achieve removal, is not good for me.  I tried this to see if it was better than wax... In my opinion, it is not an improvement.  I&#x27;m thinking that perhaps the best alternative would be laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> Not bad for at home just kind of messy.</li>
    <li> I just started waxing this past year and had been using the standard wax hair removal kits sold in the drug stores.  Decided to give sugar wax a try and am so glad I did.  I love this stuff!  I use it on my underarms and lower legs, and it works very well.  For the actual hair removal, I&#x27;d say it works about the same as the regular wax kits I had been using (the stuff you melt in the tub, not the strips), but I love this so much more because it is so ridiculously easy to use and clean up.  It&#x27;s water-soluble, so any residue just easily washes/wipes away, and it&#x27;s not drippy sticky like glue the way the regular wax is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only get two wooden sticks with this kit and that&#x27;s plenty because after you use one, you just run it under water to clean it for next time.  I bought a package of JMT Beauty Non-woven Waxing Strips to make sure I have plenty of strips on hand, and I&#x27;d recommend them as well.  They work perfectly with this sugar wax.  These are the products I plan to continue using for hair removal.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this is it! I tried a couple of Sally Hansen waxes which ended up ripping my skin off, and were very messy. I then tried surgi wax. It wasn&#x27;t great on my legs and had the consistency of warm gum. It removed hair out of my armpits, but I was literally crying while trying to get it out as it was breaking into pieces. Bodyhonee however, not painful, the consistency was more like honey as opposed to hot glue or warm gum. It was MUCH easier to clean up - it just washes right off. If you&#x27;re just starting out, I would give this a try first.</li>
    <li> Works like a gem! I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and saw this one only had three ingredients. Really easy to wash off with water and really easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. Fast shipping and just overall satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been getting waxed for a year and decided it was time to try doing it myself to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers said, buy extra non-woven wax strips, as there are not a ton of them in the kit (I ran out when I was only 1/4 through the jar of wax and went to get some at the beauty supply store, only to realize that they are much more affordable here on amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you spread it on thin, that is key to how this wax works. I couldn&#x27;t do my underarms myself, so I had the hubs help me and it only took 2 attempts to get the hang of it. I also did my bikini area with no problems. I found this to be less painful than hard wax, which was a pleasant surprise. And as bonus my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t react at all (with the tiny white bumps or soreness) - I only had a little redness right after I did and my skin looked great when I woke up the next morning! So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, am I glad that I have purchased this BodyHonee All Natural At Home Hair Removal Wax for my fiancé! He has always griped about being extremely hairy on his back and shoulders, but didn’t want to deal with the problem because he was afraid of waxing. My mother actually purchased a kit for herself before she went on her last vacation, and she told me that it was amazingly gentle with long lasting hair removal. I knew if she loved it so would I, so I immediately purchased the kit and tried it on my reluctant fiancé. He came away with a beautifully smooth back and shoulders after the waxing, and now almost 8 weeks later there is still no hair growth! I’ve actually ordered more for myself now that I’ve seen how well it worked for my fiancé!</li>
    <li> Good experience  Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  [...]</li>
    <li> I love this! I switched to sugar wax after using regular wax and finding it almost impossible to remove. If you get this all over it&#x27;s still pretty easy to clean up. You can either buy more strips, or (since this is sugar) rip up an old Tshirt and use that as strips instead and just wash them in between uses!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.  Used on lip and took like 10 tries and still didn&#x27;t get it all.  Worked OK on eyebrows that had never been waxed before (used on my preteen).  I got the prep kit from another brand so I know it was all clean and used power and rubbed the strips over and over to get a good hold....  This is going back and will spend the extra $ for the salon wax set.  This was too much messing around and not great results.  Bought it due to the other raving reviews</li>
    <li> I prefer waxing over shaving any day!&lt;br /&gt;Now, this product is pretty expensive, but it works great!&lt;br /&gt;1) easy to heat. 30 seconds in microwave&lt;br /&gt;2) easy to apply,  can get messy though&lt;br /&gt;3) removes almost every hair!&lt;br /&gt; *For stubborn hair, I suggest the one for thick hair. Very strong!&lt;br /&gt;4) washable! Unlike the waxing kit for thick hair, leftover wax can be remove with water.&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest you buy extra waxing strips!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product, works everytime with complete ease!</li>
    <li> Worked great, heated it on a stove in a shallow pot with some water. Only bad part is that I ran out of strips. XD&lt;br /&gt;Ordered more and they are on the way.</li>
    <li> This product was pretty terrible. Tried using it for chest waxing. Even after going over some areas twice, it still only removed about a third of the hair. I would not suggest this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The wax itself was too think and warming it wasn&#x27;t helping. couldn&#x27;t spread it because of thickness and warming it only made it get hotter and not more liquified.</li>
    <li> The only negative to this product is that it can be a bit messy when you&#x27;re first getting used to using it. Otherwise it works great. Getting the temperature of the honee just right is very important - too cold and it won&#x27;t stick to the removal strips; too warm and it won&#x27;t stick to the hair.</li>
    <li> It was small, I expected it to be a bigger box. I could have sworn the description said it had more spatulas and more wax in it, but that might have been my mistake. Overall it&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s described and it really does last eight weeks! Great product, would buy again and definitely would recommend. *Follow the directions, they know what they&#x27;re doing!!*</li>
    <li> I think the negative reviews are from people who have never waxed at home before and don&#x27;t know how. I usually get professionally waxed and enjoy waxing at home in between to save a little money by spreading out waxing appointments at the salon. This wax works pretty well on course, thick hair (bikini area) and very well on thinner hair like hair on legs. Just don&#x27;t let your hair regrow back in too thick and too long or else its going to be difficult and painful (whether it is done at home or at the salon!). This wax spreads easily and washes off easily. It has not irritated my skin anywhere on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never waxed at home before, try going to the salon once or twice just to see how its done. Pay attention to every single thing they do. Make sure your skin is dry and clean, hold your skin taut (this is very important), etc. The directions in the package explain the process very well, but it may help to see it done by a pro before trying yourself.</li>
    <li> Love this product because leftover wax comes off with a wet wipe! Performs very well!</li>
    <li> quick and easy, washes off with water</li>
    <li> Easy to apply; I find that using less is better, and I found that it works better with the cloth strips than the one that come with the kit.  Overall , its very good.</li>
    <li> Product is super easy to use and washes off perfectly.  Will continue to re-order. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Want my money back! No good</li>
    <li> I was very eager whenever it arrived. The packaging looked nice at first until I realized that the wax had leaked somehow all over the wooden sticks. I could not get the lid unscrewed! It was stuck together so badly that I had to heat it in a bowl of water several times and then pry it open. The inside of the lid was coated in a hard wax while the wax inside was decent. When I tried it.. no avail. I warmed it several times until I grew tired of it. The first time it was too hot, it simply burned me and practically slid off. The second time it was perfectly warm but it would not pull off. The continued about two more times with cooling time to become tacky for the fabric strip. I tried a third time and the wax was too cold to put on (after heating for twice). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but maybe I just do not know what I am doing.</li>
    <li> Great wax! I have a sensitive chest so I&#x27;ve tried a bunch and nothing works better then Sugar Wax!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit due to the positive reviews.  Do yourself a favor guys and order extra wax removal strips.  The 10 that are included in the kit don&#x27;t get you very far.  Also I&#x27;d say the kit comes with enough wax to get you through two waxings......depending on useage I guess.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax kit I have ever tried. It removed all the hair from the areas I used it on and went on so smoothly while applying it! I love that this product is made with simple ingredients without harsh chemicals and that it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It actually didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I am used to with other products, probably because it&#x27;s sugar based. The absolute best part is that any residue that was left over just wipes away with water. Simple, effective, and easy...gotta love it.</li>
    <li> Works good but only comes with a few strips. I highly recommend buying extra strips or you will have a ton of leftover wax</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good quality, large quantity too. used this with both disposable and reusable strips, worked just as well with both kinds. worked on all areas.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been quite some time since I have tried waxing (mainly because of rough experiences in the past), but I wanted to give it a try again, especially after reading positive reviews of this hair removal waxing kit. I received the product in a timely manner with no issue whatsoever, and immediately opened the package to go over instructions and see how the kit worked. The instructions were super easy to follow, and clearly laid out. Nothing was complicated or left me with questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found preparation (heating ready wax in the microwave) simple as well, and unlike other wax kits I have used, the texture was even and easy to spread at a warm temperature. If instructions are followed exactly (great recommendation on the talcum powder), I don’t see any resulting pain, discomfort, or excessive redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, wonderful product from an all natural producer. I will no doubt revisit in the near future. Thank you BodyHonee!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promised.</li>
    <li> This is the only honey hair removal kit I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s super easy to use (be careful to let the honey cool down slightly once it&#x27;s out of the micro...yikes! test it on the inside of your wrist), it&#x27;s super very effective (bye bye hair), and a cinch to clean up.  I did buy the extra waxing strips, as other reviewers recommended, because there aren&#x27;t nearly enough in the kit.  Follow the instructions, and you&#x27;ll be on your way to smooth, hair-free skin!</li>
    <li> Bodyhonee was my first experience with waxing and everything went much smoother than I anticipated! The kit comes with very clear instructions, which is great for first timers. I used it on my bikini line and armpits so far and I am super pleased! I have sensitive skin but I had no problems with irritation, which is great. The price is great and you get the same results as going to a salon. Overall, my skin feels smooth and hair free and I would highly recommend using this wax kit!</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I found a recipe online for making homemade wax. I should say that I&#x27;d only ever gone for a wax once before for my eyebrows, and they turned out so nice. So, the thought of having smooth, silky legs was something that really appeared to me. All I can say is that my waxing adventure didn&#x27;t go so well. I burned myself, I made a huge mess and I even pulled off a couple sheets of skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, a friend was telling me about how she&#x27;d stopped going to her local salon and had taken up waxing at home. Of course, I had no interest in it after my last debacle, but the more we went to the beach and the more I saw her gorgeous, stubble-free legs, the more I wanted to give waxing another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came onto Amazon and found BodyHonee at the top of the list. Nice-looking packaging and tons of positive reviews gave me the confidence to give it a go. When my wax arrived, the first thing I noticed was that everything came in nice, compact packaging, which means that I didn&#x27;t have to dedicate lots of counter space to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming up and applying the wax was super easy, and while I was nervous that I&#x27;d burn myself, I had no problems. Best of all, most of the hair came off after just one pass! When I&#x27;d made my own wax, I had to wax and re-wax (and re-wax and re-wax) the same area over and over in an attempt to get all of the hair. With BodyHonee, most of the hair was gone on my first try. I must have been shouting in excitement because my roommate came to see what was going on, and we ended up waxing her legs, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re currently spending way too much money getting waxed at a salon or spa or if you&#x27;re interested in trying waxing for the first time, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This wax is super easy to use. It was my first time using a home system and I just followed the direction and applied it.  My boyfriend loved it.  He has very sensitive skin and curly hair, and this wax left his skin smooth.  I love the after spray too.  It has great ingredients and leaves your skin silky smooth.  I highly recommend this home wax kit for men or women.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but I wish that it comes with more removing cloths. Be careful of heating it by a microwave. Don&#x27;t heat it for more than 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed how effective it is and def worth the money. Happy to have purchased it. Great product !!</li>
    <li> Waxing is hard to do by yourself. I feel they should have included twice as many strips as they did. Does the trick though!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hair removal waxing type of kit for a while now and a common problem I&#x27;ve found is that some do not work too well and I end up with some left over hair left here and there. I like that I don&#x27;t have to microwave the hair removal wax for too long and it wipes easily off of my body. I received the product before the estimated time of shipping. It was just what I needed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing, and after using it I was impressed, but not amazed. To begin with, I am a male (this is my mother&#x27;s account), and wanted to have a clean chest before going away to college. The instructions are easy to follow, and heating up the wax is a breeze. Before you put wax on your body, make sure to test the temperature on the inside of your wrist. Trust me, scorching wax on your chest is not fun. Applying the wax was easy and not a problem. Also the two applicators (tongue depressors) it comes with are enough if you reuse them, which I have been doing. When they say that sugar wax is less painful than normal wax, don&#x27;t believe them. This thing hurt like a *****. It may be because I am new to waxing and unaccustomed to the pain, but it was very painful. My advice on that is to just close your eyes, and pull with a quick swift movement. Make sure to pull the strip down close to the skin instead of away from your body. As for the results, I would say 95% of the hair was removed, and the entire section of my chest was tomato red. Afterwards, make sure to rub aloe vera on the waxed section to ease the aggravated skin and to prevent ingrown hairs. After a few weeks, I noticed the hairs started to grow back, but they were light and thin, instead of thick dark hairs. This is much better than the unpleasant itchy stubble that grows back from shaving. I&#x27;m sure with more waxing, the hairs will cease to grow back. I like that the wax doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals and that clean up is easy. While I did get the wax everywhere, it came off easily with a damp towel. Overall, I think this waxing kit works well, but takes a few times to remove all hair. I also bought extra non-woven waxing strips, and these were essential. I used up the 10 strips that came with the wax instantly, and was thankful to have more strips.</li>
    <li> Messy, hurts alot, and doesn&#x27;t work. What else is there to say? I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed with a purchase..</li>
    <li> Have had for awhile and it works very well, we have hair removal partiies which have been fun to say the least, was packagedand arrived in quickly</li>
    <li> My first time waxing and it was pretty nice product. Easy to remove wax and leaves skin very soft. Extra points for being an all natural product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the fact that this is an all natural product. It warms easily, goes on easily, and works great.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Was easy to remove, even on sensitive areas. Didn&#x27;t leave me irritated like some over the counter products i have used in the past. Plus, all natural. Would recommend it to anyone trying to smooth up.</li>
    <li> This is a great waxing system that doesn&#x27;t leave you with bumps or ingrowns only smooth skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve gone though an entire container of it waxing my legs, underarms and parts of my bikini area, but ultimately I had to order salon wax to do a Brazilian....  This will pull sparse, fine hair, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work on the coarser hair.  If you had someone else waxing you rather than DIY it might be more successful</li>
    <li> I waxed my chest with this nonsense and it really hurt :(</li>
    <li> This product rocks! After YEARS of shaving my chest and having it grow back the next day and even thicker than before, I decided to try my hand at waxing and WOW - what the heck was I thinking all this time?! I thought it would hurt like heck, but turns out that shaving my chest is an even bigger pain in the butt than waxing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shaving, I needed to do it almost every other day and I had to deal with stubble and NASTY in-growns (sorry). Also - I was spending so much money because I was using a specific \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; so much that it would often break down after a month of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I started waxing my chest (thank you BodyHonee!!) I only have to do it about once every 2-3 weeks! Less and less hairs grow back, I don&#x27;t get any in-growns and, hallelujah - No Stubble!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the men out there - Give this a try, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> It removed hair (Okay) leaving behind a few small stubs but it caused me to break out and almost get a rash-like reaction on one area..  definitely not worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy myself some time in between barber visits. Needless to say, this process hardly took any hair away from my neckline. Not worth the time.</li>
    <li> Its really sticky, but it fails to grip the hairs on my gooch and balls.</li>
    <li> I have been afraid of using hair waxing removal products as my number one concern is pain. I love that the product contains natural ingredients which is sugar, salt, and lemon. It&#x27;s great to not have to worry about using chemicals my skin such as Nair and Veet that sometimes burn my skin if left on too long. BodyHonee&#x27;s hair waxing product left my skin so smooth and I was surprised by the hair re-growth which took over two months for the hair to grow back.  I was instantly satisfied and I have made sure to share about this project with my friends who have been searching for a better waxing solution.</li>
    <li> This works!  I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself for the first time.  I heated it up as directed, but to me it cooled down sort of fast.  But when warm, the hair was coming off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wipes off with water, which is nice.  But it still is messy. I had a towel handy to wipe off excess wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need extra strips though.  I used all the strips from the box in one waxing.  You can get a 100 pack for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For next time, I will heat up a little more and will do in a non air conditioned spot.  I think the air conditioner helped cool it faster.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work that well pulls very few hairs to none, plus if you follow the directions and pull when it tells you the wax is still hot and nothing will come up and the wax will still be on the skin. This product sucks all around, bad directions, and bad wax.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good if you just follow the directions.  At first i just glimpsed over the directions and I initially tried to use this product hot after leaving it in the microwave too long with only modest results.  However, after reading the directions again, i realized that for best results warm temperature is the way to go. I&#x27;m not sure how that would even make any difference but it definitely does.  I was also pulling the strip the same direction as the grain of my hair when instead I should have pulled the strips away from the grain.  I did waste a portion of the product by not following the procedure but after following these two steps, the product actually worked very well.</li>
    <li> For being a beginner I must say this product made it a great experience. Very minimal pain, and feels great applying on and after. I love this product. I was always very nervous of waxing myself and I decided to give it a go anyway, and it was fabulous. I will never shave again! The hairs are growing back in SO much thinner than when I wax! Love it! I know I&#x27;ll get better each time.</li>
    <li> the packaging needs to come with more strips though, only enough for one use, but works awesome! I&#x27;m a dood and my gf used it on my back.</li>
    <li> Horrible idea only use with a trained professional</li>
    <li> It works and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try my hand at waxing, since summing is fast approaching and I really hate shaving.  After a lot of browsing on Amazon, I picked this wax to try because it was all natural, and I try to use only all natural and/or organic stuff on my skin.  This came with a few waxing strips as well as a four sticks (2 big ones and 2 small ones), which was really all I needed for my legs.  I liked that the directions were very simple, and the fact that they said the consistency should be like honey made it easy to tell when the wax was warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I have to say, I really love it and will definitely buy more.  There was a little pain, of course, but if you&#x27;ve tweezed your eyebrows, that&#x27;s basically what it feels like, except I think it&#x27;s a lot better because you&#x27;re not pulling out each hair individually.  There was absolutely no unpleasant smell or anything - actually, I didn&#x27;t really notice any smell, which was a pleasant surprise because I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to smells and am prone to migraines.  The wax was sticky like honey, and it was a little tough for a newbie like me to get used to spreading it thinly, but I managed to wax my legs with no problems or messy spills.  As yet another plus, I was able to wipe off any residue with a water-damp towel and there was no problems washing my hands free of any sticky wax using just regular water and soap - no hard clean up required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> So while I don&#x27;t have much experience with waxing I do have some.  There were 2 problems I had with this product.  One, it didn&#x27;t seem to remove all the hair from where I just waxed (and yes I waited for it to grow out for like 2 weeks).  And two, it left me with red bumps afterward.  Maybe my skin is just too sensitive but I figured the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; would help.  Guess not.  I used this on my legs by the way.  Can&#x27;t say anything for other areas.  I figure if my legs were too sensitive then everywhere else would be much worse.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed, but I do use an epilator on my legs and armpits. Compared to the epilator, waxing was so painless (and did a better job). This wax is great and easily cleans up with water. Towards the bottom of the jar, I was re-microwaving it frequently (which was a little tedious). This was a little messier than using an epilator, and took as long (or longer with set-up), but was less painful. I&#x27;ve already bought it again!</li>
    <li> Bought these for the young ladies in my house. They loved it, apparently it works well.</li>
    <li> While I love getting professional waxes, it gets expensive having to keep up with it, and I refuse to shave. I was pretty nervous to try out the wax for myself, but it was very easy to prepare--just under one minute in the microwave to warm up. It was quick and painless to me. I also thought it would be hard to do to myself, but the sugar wax worked great. I LOVE that it is all natural, only a few ingredients (I have sensitive, dry skin, and chemical-y stuff irritates it). I will definitely continue using Body Honee, especially for my legs which are the most annoying to keep hairless!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite sugar waxing kit. I&#x27;ve tried a few other sugar wax brands (some organic/no heat ones were painful, and/or hardly pulled any hairs out), but always end up returning to BodyHonee. The wax is painless to apply,efficient, and extremely easy to wash off if there&#x27;s a little wax residue. Also pleased with how much sugar wax comes in the package, last&#x27;s a long time (other brands I&#x27;ve tried left me shocked with how little wax you get for the price, total rip-off&#x27;s). I always recommend this brand to friends and family. The shipping was quite fast as well, took only 4 days from my order date which made me happy. :)</li>
    <li> Just tried this after readying all the wonderful reviews on here, and I must say - This stuff works! Make sure to get the extra \\&quot;non-woven\\&quot; wax strips they sell! There are only 10 strips in the kit.</li>
    <li> I have some questions about this one: how often do you need to make a procedure? Does it increase the amount of hair after several procedures?</li>
    <li> BodyHonee was my first hot wax experience and everything went a lot smoother than I was expecting.  It can be a bit of a challenge getting the wax heated up without a microwave or wax warmer, but once it&#x27;s warm, the rest is a breeze.  The kit comes with clear instructions (great for first timers!) and the strips are sturdy, so if you wash/dry them, they can be reused a few times.  I love the simple, clean ingredients and that any excess wax washes off easily with just water.</li>
    <li> It claims to be easy and remove the hair, but it is not as easy as it sounds and it sure left plenty of hair behind; so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very difficult to use.  It is either too thin and therefore too hot or it is too thick and does not spread well with the wooden applicator.  If it is too thick it will absorb into the paper and therefore is not effective in sticking to the hair so when it is pulled off, nothing but wax comes with the paper. To get the proper thin spread, it has to be warm enough to be thin enough to spread without being too hot to put on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love my BodyHonee waxing hair removal kit; it allowed my normally rough skin to be silky smooth. My skin is highly sensitive but this product has allowed me to feel safe about using a home waxing hair removal kit, whereas previously I was extremely cautious about using any form of ‘at home’ hair removal. Most people like me are afraid of quick hair growth, with BodyHonee I can feel confident for the next couple months that the hair will not grow back, or grow back thick. I love that the wax is easy to remove with just a bit of water, fast heating for quick removal of hair, and leaves my skin feeling amazing. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Highly recommended for those that are scared to try any type of hair removal!</li>
    <li> As it suggests I have never waxed before and was not sure what to expect. I bought this because of the great reviews. I was not sure what to expect but I know I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this easy. The kits has some basic directions that are easy to follow. I am normally pretty skeptical about these directions that seem obscure too so I tested them. Firstly your hair really should be about 1/4\\&quot; long, so if you recently shaved an area you will need to let it grow out. Secondly what they say about moisture is true I would highly recommend talcum powder as it suggests. Other than that I put my bodyhonee in the microwave for 15 sec to warm it up and make it easier to apply, and within 5 min my chest was hairless. Easy at that. It didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as the 40 year old virgin made it look. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is actually my first review ever but this product definitely deserves it. I used to get my arms and legs waxed before so I have had some experience with the pain. I haven&#x27;t waxed in a couple of years so I was worried about it hurting but it actually hurt way less than I expected and worked really well! My only suggestion would be that it only comes with 10 wax strips so make sure you buy some extra ones!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My results are great - 2 weeks in and little to no hair has grown back. Will be back to buy more shortly.</li>
    <li> I heated it 20 seconds, burned still and i couldn&#x27;t stand it, good thing it was only on my finger, don&#x27;t use it on pubes</li>
    <li> Works great! I did originally think I was getting just plain sugar without the waxing part. But personally I like the sugar wax over regular wax.</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t sticky. disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about the product but I will mention to do your research before you use it, my waxing experience was a nightmare. Did everything i was suppose to and broke out like you would not believe</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a natural hair removal process for a long time. Shaving gets tedious since I have to do it every day during the summer time and quite often in the cooler weather as well. When I saw that this kit used all natural ingredients, I knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire process was quick and simple. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to wax as often as I thought I would. I came back on Amazon to order more of the wax strips because this is the only thing that I am going to use on my legs from now on.</li>
    <li> This is my Very first experience waxing, using this product was an interesting experience. Used on my chest and I was surprised at how much hair came off. Definitely a great buy, like other buyers wrote more waxing strips are a must.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand where these 4 stars are coming from. Stuff did not work.  Multiple attempts following exact instructions.  Waste of time. Pain without gain!</li>
    <li> I waxed myself 3 times, and I still have to shave every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My groin looked like it had an STD with the constant red spots that last 3-days (give or take).&lt;br /&gt;It required constantly required tweezers to get all of those in-grown hairs out.</li>
    <li> Not much to compare this to as this was my first experience using wax for hair removal.  My expectations may have been a little high.  I followed the directions to the letter and while a majority of hair was removed, it was not a clean removal, meaning I had to go over the same area several times.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it! I Just keep buying!</li>
    <li> This hair removal waxing kit is a dream comes true. I have some embarrassing unwanted hair I have been trying to get rid of and this is the first product that has actually worked for me. It was easy to use and I have never looked better or felt better about myself than I do now that I have discovered this great kit. I love that it’s all natural so I know I’m not putting any harmful substances on my body. Even my husband got great results from using this kit. We will recommend it to all of our friends.</li>
    <li> It worked just the way it should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for many years and have tried many brands. I chose this brand because of it being a natural-based hair removal solution. I am against using chemicals on my body! I have to say this is something I will always use from now on. I&#x27;ve used everything possible for hair removal from threading to professional hair removal and I am so happy that I finally found something that is affordable and works.</li>
    <li> great hair remover, easy to spread, easy to tear the hair! watch out with the heating temperature, can burn your skin! Could be more paper for hair removing.</li>
    <li> Family owned company. Great product at a great price. Can&#x27;t beat the way its works and does the job no razor can do.</li>
    <li> This item, in the instructions, indicates &#x27;do not use on eyebrows&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This is something that may be available some where in the literature online, however, I did not see it and that rendered this product a wasteful purchase for me. I had tried it so I am happy that I had no real adverse reaction or problems with trying it on my eyebrows despite the &#x27;directions&#x27; not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now…. the rating I&#x27;ve listed is simple based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;i hate it&#x27; is appropriate to my feelings not because the product does not work but because I did not see any mention of not being used for eyebrows on the &#x27;information&#x27; page by the seller. So.. I hate it. I am amazed by the videos I saw and the positive reviews by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to spend so much time reviewing different waxing kits only to find out upon wasted time that this would not meet my needs…. destroy the unibrow</li>
    <li> I have no formal training with waxing and using this proves that you need good formal training  not off of YouTube . And you need much more than what is given from what I&#x27;ve looked up</li>
    <li> I loved this product and followed the enclosed directions which made the process very easy and successful. I was actually surprised at how well the product worked considering it is all-natural! I Love my results and love that any residue wipes clean with water! This is honestly the best wax product I have ever used, I highly recommend it! I even convinced my boyfriend to let me use it on his back and he liked it too! :)</li>
    <li> An easy and inexpensive option for men&#x27;s back hair.  It was quite convenient to microwave the container, apply and simply rinse off the residue.  It worked quite well from my coarse dark hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does what it claims, easy to use, washes off with just water. I have tried many other wax products in the past and this one is gentle on the skin but it gets the job done! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried using this and it hardly gets any of the hair, i have to go over and over to try and get the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product quality appeared to be good, however did not use and returned due to size, price and consistency of wax.</li>
    <li> I admit - this is my first foray into the world of body hair removal via pulling it out by the roots... My results have been moderate. I often times get absolutely no hairs pulled and sometimes get about 15-20% of the hair in the &#x27;honey zone&#x27;. Is this a good result? I do not know. I am going to keep trying until the stuff is gone. I noted that some posters mention that there is a bit of skill involved in getting the technique correct. I will update my review as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using Body Honee erratically for about 3 mos and have improved my skills significantly. These are the details I have observed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the longer the hair, the better: I suspect that it is easier to get a solid connection with a longer hair. I am using on my neck and chin and upper lip even though I know it is not recommended for facial hair. Thus, a week away from social interactions is needed unless you have really cool and intelligent (that is - understand women have facial hair just like men) friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) hotter is NOT better: I am so desperate to remove this hair that I have tried different approaches including heating the product until it is very thinned (and very hot). This did NOT help - it actually made it less effective. Using the product while it is just warm and spreadable is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I am sure this is not what the Body Honee people want to hear but - you can reuse the strips. I just throw them in a sink of hot water after each use... the product dissolves and then a clean rinse and dry (lay on towel for a few hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for whether or not hair will grow back finer, I am still waiting to see.</li>
    <li> This is a really great natural product. I was a bit skeptical at first because their are so many of these, but this one works and is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as a guy, I use this everywhere.... Almost :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to more products from then</li>
    <li> I have yet to try a home waxing product that works perfectly. However, this product is the most effective one I&#x27;ve come across. It grabs most of the hairs (not all). I love that it has only 3 natural ingredients (sugar, salt, and lemon).</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t really like the hair on my chest and arms and, I must say, I was surprised just how well it worked.  I got it because it&#x27;s all natural but, honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so good. We&#x27;re both extremely pleased with the results and now my girlfriend is going to start using it on her own legs too. I highly recommend it especially because it&#x27;s made with just 3 simple ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals that most hair removal products have. It&#x27;s natural and does exactly what it promises! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but a product like this needs one. I have never waxed at home before or my biniki area so I tried it last night &amp; LOVE IT!!!! I think the only thing I will change next time is having the wax warmer and having baby powder to get some of the smaller hairs. Yes it is sticky but the clean up was super easy. Took the hair right off and by today no redness or break outs!!!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This wax kit is awesome. I&#x27;ve tried many types of hair removal/reduction/whatever (shaving, bleaching, plucking), and nothing worked well for me. I have super fair skin and super dark hair, so shaving resulted in still being able to see the hair roots under my skin. Truly ridiculous. This is the first wax kit I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results. I didn&#x27;t believe that waxing could last for weeks and also make hair grow in thinner, but it does! My skin is also quite sensitive (allergies and whatnot), but the Body Honee is gentle enough to avoid irritating my skin. It wipes off clean and overall works great. I&#x27;m psyched to be able to wear a swimsuit without worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with this kit is that it did not come with enough wax strips. I bought a bunch more on amazon for a good price, though.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to try a home wax kit, since I have always shaved.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to use and how effective it was!  In order to do both of my legs, I ended up having to microwave it again about halfway through.  But I didn&#x27;t expect it to stay warm and soft the entire time.  My legs did turn slightly pink afterwards, but lotion helped calm that downright away.  I think I may be a convert from shaving!</li>
    <li> I have dark coarse hair and the box says for light to medium hair so it takes a little extra work.</li>
    <li> works great, just messy. but it is wax. minimal skin irritation.</li>
    <li> My man hood looks great now. We expect her to mow the lawn so why not us men? Mow your lawn, you better half will thank you. Oh yea, it hurts in the mow-able areas. On my ears and other random areas guys get hair it&#x27;s fine. Mow men, mow....</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t want to have to do over the same area twice or more for the same sesh and because of that i am not a happy camper. gave it a chance tried it and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> My wife used this on my back. She has never waxed anyone before this was our first expierence. This product worked very well and did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Worst wax ever. Super sticky and got hardly any hair up. I was extremely disappointed by this wax.  I followed the directions closely... Washed before, use powder before applying and everything. Hands down the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I love using natural products, especially when it comes to my body. This product is everything it says it is. Feels great, does its job, and leaves my body feeling smooth and clean!</li>
    <li> By far the BEST home waxing kit I have used!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I read some of the reviews, I too suggest ordering additional waxing strips and spatulas.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t find this product messy or hard to work with.  Also, less painful than other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied and definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as discontinued Nair microwavable wax, which is impossible to find at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Works good. not completely removal, maybe because I am kind of hairy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time waxer, period. I attempted to try this wax on my underarms with no luck. However, it worked pretty great on my legs but I have no expertise so I missed some areas. Wax stayed warm throughout the process, which took me 45 minutes a calf thanks to my lack of skills. Clean up was easy but I definitely need to fine tune my methods.</li>
    <li> Simple to use, works great..Pain free? Sure, there is no charge for the pain  :) Just gotta stay strong! Amazingly easy to clean off, and did I mention that it works great?  It does.</li>
    <li> Doesnt get all the hair out at once but its still pretty good</li>
    <li> Not very effective as compared to other sugar wax I&#x27;ve previously used</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me,, tried below the belt line  area  but was way too painful&lt;br /&gt;left that area red for three days and it didnt remove much of the hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, this is the third time I buy this. Love it! very easy to use! I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good choice when you want to do it yourself, it came with a round cup of glue and a few strips for removing hair, but the strip is not so big, I mean u can&#x27;t cover big areas, so before u know it you&#x27;ll run out of strips</li>
    <li> We loved it, I used it on my husband&#x27;s back. I got some on me and it washed off easy.  Now his back is nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product not work, but they also didn&#x27;t send me any cloth strips like it&#x27;s supposed to come with. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, and I have also never used an at-home waxing/sugaring kit before, but i have to say I am very impressed with this product! I used this on my bikini line, legs, and arms and while it took me a few tries to get the hang of it, I figured out the best way to get out the most amount of hair with one rip. I don&#x27;t have a very high pain tolerance, so yes, this was a bit painful, but it was tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first wax probably 10 years ago right before a vacation, and all i remember is that it was very painful and i was left with red bumps for my whole vacation. I have had no bumps with this product. I do have some slight pinkness in areas where i had to go over more than once, but the pain afterwards is minimal and fades away very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con is probably that it is a little messy if you are not careful, but it washes off super easily with water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i love this product! I have already recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Have used Sugar Wax for a couple of months now and am very pleased.  The kit is easy to use with lengthy but clear instructions. You&#x27;ll get a lot of mileage out of a jar, but be sure to buy a pack of strips -- 10 included in the kit won&#x27;t go very far.  It&#x27;s not terribly painful for legs, bikini line or underarms.  Lots of sting, but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Get extra pads though to use all of it. I got the 100 pack and will be good for 2-3 of these kits.</li>
    <li> I bought this off eBay but didn&#x27;t realize u needed a microwave. I am one of the few living a dull life with out a microwave</li>
    <li> First-time home waxer and this stuff seemed legit. I think it really depends on following the directions closely and getting better at it! Only downside about this wax is that once you start getting low, it is more difficult to get out and cools off faster. I bought a second container and melted the extra together to resolve this problem. Still feel confident about using this and waxing every once in awhile!</li>
    <li> Unless your waxing some really long ones don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other wax products and read a lot of reviews before purchasing. It works great and I will buy again. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for really coarse hair removal and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, but it&#x27;s effective and I like that it comes off with water.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to removed unwanted hair and was very satisfied with the results.  The biggest pro for me is that this product is all-natural and has no harmful chemicals in it. It only contains 3 natural ingredients: salt, sugar and lemon.  I always liked the results of professional waxing but could never get any home waxing kits to work for me until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with the container of wax, application spatulas, and removal strips.  It contains easy to read instructions for ease of use.  Following the simple instructions included made my experience a success.  I found that the waxing kit was not messy like other waxing kits that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The clean-up is fast and easy—especially since the wax container is microwavable and the wax is water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to wax my arms and legs.  I was amazed at how easily the wax applied and removed.  I found that when I pulled the wax strip it was not as painful as it is when I have professional waxing services.  I also waxed in small patches—which is another reason why it was not so painful.  Following the directions in the packaging makes a huge difference. There are also visuals in the directions that also help with the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the waxing kit a week ago today and I am still thrilled with the results.  I had no signs of redness, irritation, or ingrown hairs right after I waxed and I can still say that after a week of use the areas that I waxed are still clear of any of these issues.  My skin was smooth and silky after the application process. I am looking forward to being hair free for the next 8 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this product again! I will experiment with waxing my bikini area during the next use. I love that I am saving time and money by waxing at home!  This is a product that I would recommend to anyone who wants a successful hair removal experience in the privacy of their own home.</li>
    <li> Good lord-my girlfriend about tore my sack off with this stuff.  Stick to arms/legs/back &amp; let the pros do the dangerous stuff.</li>
    <li> This is pretty powerful,  took hair out by the root and left my skin soft.</li>
    <li> didnt work as i thought it would</li>
    <li> I ordered 1 kit and I was able to wax my hands and legs. This was my first time waxing myself and looks like it saved me some 100 bucks. Chest and back are hard to do by yourself so it&#x27;s better to get them done. This product is very good and does everything what it says. For some reason it wasn&#x27;t that painful as it is when I get it done.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother. He loves the product! Says it is super easy to use and works great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I am one of those people who avoided waxing. The first few times I waxed it was a horrible, painful experience. Even worse, I broke out from all the nasty chemicals in the wax. When I first tried BodyHonee, I was very nervous. Thankfully, it put waxing in a whole new light for me. It was super easy to use and not as painful now that I knew what was doing. Since it was water soluble, it was also very easy to remove when I was finished. While I wasted quite a bit of wax the first time, I can easily see waxing more in the future now that I have found this product. Overall, I have to say this is the best natural wax out there, hands down!</li>
    <li> Good lord waxing is painful.  I got this to start waxing and learned I don&#x27;t like waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right, but I heat up the whole thing in a pot of water to get it slightly runny and go through the procedures I&#x27;ve read in blogs.  As others have said, buy extra paper stuff and smearer sticks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hair dude, and my wife used this on my back. We also used these strips: FantaSea Non Woven Facial and Body Wax Strips, 0.05 Ounce. We followed corrects very carefully, and overall the kit seemed effective. The pain was bad, but perhaps my wife&#x27;s technique wasn&#x27;t ideal. The hair did come off, but the pain was bad, some of my pores were bleeding. I don&#x27;t really get acne on my back, but within a day or two of waxing, my back was covered in acne, practically nullifying all the work/pain that went into waxing in the first place for our honeymoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife did a pretty good job, but there were still some little patches of hair here or there. Unless you 100% know what you are doing, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone trying to remove a large patch of hair. Maybe bite the bullet and go get it done professionally. If this is for smaller areas, then I think you&#x27;ll be fine. But I&#x27;d read other reviews for people trying to wax just smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to a friend who waxes professionally, and she said to definitely use lotion after waxing. That&#x27;ll bring the pain down and the redness/acne. So probably good advice for anyone trying to accomplish something similar.</li>
    <li> I have a new found respect for women who get waxed all the time.  Pure curiosity made me want to see how it was.  The first strip felt like someone had 10,000 sewing needles attached to a board, pressed against my chest.  It&#x27;s been 30 minutes and I still feel the needles.  Despite that I kept going.  I thought, maybe it wont be as bad this time?  Nope...  Nope nope nope nope...  The pain is now on half my chest.  I couldn&#x27;t just leave it like that!  But there was no way I was going to lose a nipple to this thing.  Wax done.  Shave the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this stuff is great normally, and I&#x27;m sure it works for most people.  But not me.  I&#x27;ll keep my hairy chest from now on.  Also my nipples.  Especially my nipples.</li>
    <li> Not enough strips - ineffective at removing hair from legs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few body sugaring products, and this is excellent considering the price. It has a good consistency, so you don&#x27;t have to heat it up as much to get a paper thin layer. It is a pretty big container and I think it will last awhile. Works just as well as more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. I have Asian coarse-but-sparse body hair, and it gets the hair by the root without breakage. I much prefer this to my epilator, which mostly broke the hairs off after yanking them painfully. Faster than an epilator as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may find that there are too few strips included with the pack; one trick is to re-use the same strip several times. I might use 1 for each lower leg, 1 for each upper leg. The sugar on the strip will stick to new stuff on your leg just as well as a bare strip, I&#x27;ve found. Or you can get extra strips, but I like my cleanup to be a minimum.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00A3LHIO2 Hair Removal Waxing Kit Men + Women, All Natural, Sugaring Hair Removal for men + women (9 Oz)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really Amazing product, i suffer from really sensitive skin this left no irritation at all!! Also my skin was left really smooth NO HAIR at all!!!</li>
    <li> Anyone who has waxed knows there&#x27;s a bit of pain involved. BodyHonee can&#x27;t do anything about that, but I will say that the natural ingredients were less irritating to the skin than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  And it&#x27;s true - 2 months of soft smooth skin afterwards without having to do touch ups!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has tried waxing and hasn&#x27;t found a product they love, and the price is also better compared to some other options.</li>
    <li> In order to save a buck, I&#x27;ve tried millions of Groupon deals for waxing deals ($50 for a painful wax?! No thanks.), but after finding this kit I refuse to make appointments any longer. You get the same salon results at home (or, in some instances BETTER than the pros) and for much cheaper. I&#x27;ve already turned several friends on to the product.</li>
    <li> Love that this is all natural, smells great and is water soluble.  I have sensitive skin, and this left me hair free without irritation.  The directions are simple and easy to follow even for first time at home wax users.  No smelly lotion filled with chemicals required to remove any wax residue... simply rinse with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of wax (enough for several uses), but 10 waxing strips and 2 spatulas is not enough by far.  You will want to get more strips and spatulas to be able to use all the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now the ONLY body wax I will use!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
    <li> We use this wax for my husband&#x27;s back prior to beach vacations and it works very well and he loves how smooth and soft his skin feels.  As indicated by the instructions, the key to good results is to have clean/dry skin and adding a small amount of powder before you start will help wax work even better.&lt;br /&gt;I learned the hard way on my first purchase/first time ever waxing that you will need significantly more removal strips (the 10 included are not nearly enough for the amount of wax you have) &#x3D; buy an extra pack of 100!&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate that this is a water soluble wax - I&#x27;m no expert and get wax places I didn&#x27;t intend and it very easily cleans off with wet cloth (skin, counter, etc.,).&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for new users - don&#x27;t wax in big patches - cut the strips in half and do smaller sections for better results.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to grab the hair but I was not entirely sure I was applying it correctly.  I think this is a hit and miss depending upon the hair of the person</li>
    <li> Works well for waxing larger parts of the body and it was even less painful than I was expecting it to be. It washed off easily with a wet washcloth. It was a little difficult to spread, but I think that may be the case with any wax. A wider spreader than a popcycle stick might have helped with that.&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is that I&#x27;m going to run out of the strips long before I make a dent in the wax. However, overall it met my expectations and I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is wax is wonderful I love how the kit comes with everything you need and you can just rinse any excess wax off with water. Make sure to follow the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;instructions though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I applied talcum powder to the area before waxing and it helped with the pain and gave me better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product and at a good price too!</li>
    <li> This was a good product overall but it didn&#x27;t have enough strips for me to do my entire chest. On the bright side, the wax was very strong and gave a good wax.</li>
    <li> Folks, if you&#x27;re using a sugar hair remover, you do not need strips. Lay the sugar against the hair growth then quickly flick it off in the direction that the hair grows with your fingers. Takes a little practice, but it works great that way. Take it from me, I&#x27;m an aesthetician and a certified sugar practitioner.</li>
    <li> This product worked great! I am very happy with the results - my hair is taking a lot longer time to grow back and it was much less painful that I expected it to be. I will be using this on my husbands back too! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely easy use and is very effective! Save time and money by waxing at home. Best company and product I have found to do waxing in the comfort of my home!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a year or so to occasionally wax my chest and stomach. Things I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;Does not have to be scalding hot in order to work&lt;br /&gt;Is natural&lt;br /&gt;Is safe/non-toxic&lt;br /&gt;Is environmentally friendly&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Is very effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;Muslin strips need to be thrown away or rinsed off after use, which adds to the cost to use&lt;br /&gt;The plastic container is non-eco friendly</li>
    <li> The whole idea of &#x27;manscaping&#x27; one&#x27;s nether region is something I have admittedly been reluctant to embrace, having done a full cut and shave the &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; way (scissors, electric shavers, razors, etc.) several years prior.  No wonder I let it go; it&#x27;s like an accident waiting to happen.  However to be perfectly honest most guys appreciate a deforested region on their female companions and so it seems women often share the same sentiment towards our Chewbacca inspired briar patches.  Having acknowledged that, as well as the fact that I was scheduled for a round of visits with the urologist, it was time to clear the area for renewed ops.&lt;br /&gt;  I had never before worked with any waxing kit or had a waxing for that matter, so I was in unfamiliar territory.  I did pre-shave with a new Norelco skin-friendly, &#x27;below the neck&#x27; shaver which did a commendable job; maybe too good.  It seems that unless the hair is a certain length then the wax and waxing strip are somewhat ineffective.  Knowing that I will have to let things grow out a bit and give it another go and if the results are better I will re-submit my review with that info.&lt;br /&gt;  A few observations and a word of caution are in order; first the dangerous stuff, when the directions say to heat wax mixture in microwave for only 30 seconds; do not add another 30 sec thinking more is better!  Boy this stuff really retains heat and even after letting it cool for several minutes it still was hot enough to cause pain, I won&#x27;t make that mistake twice!  I found that if you can dip the end of your little finger in the wax (give it a second or two) and it hurts, its too hot, conversely if it just warm then its OK for a more sensitive area.  I was amazed at how long the product stays warm in the container but it cools fairly quickly when out of the container or applied.  As for the stupid little applicator sticks, they&#x27;re kind of a waste.  I found it helpful and less wasteful to cut the paper-cloth waxing strips in halffor the tighter areas a guy has to deal with down there.&lt;br /&gt;  For me personally I think the jury is still out on this product, its a bit messy and I&#x27;m not convinced it was worth the effort.  Having said that I will try it again after a few weeks and maybe the results will validate its worth?</li>
