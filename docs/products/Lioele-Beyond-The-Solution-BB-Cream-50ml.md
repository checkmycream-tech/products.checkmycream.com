<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best bb cream yet. Medium coverage with good shade range. However offers about a 4 hour wear time.  And kind of smells like sunscreen and a little tacky to the touch. But most bb creams do though. Would highly recommend this one over any others.</li>
    <li> I have fair, oily skin (I&#x27;m a ginger) and this has been the best make up product that I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I use it as foundation and it&#x27;s great for all day wear. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Skin79 I wanted was not available. I have normal skin - very fair. The last year or so I&#x27;ve used Lancome products and diligently wash my face each evening (with the most amazing Nutrasonic electronic brush). With summer in full force I&#x27;ve been abandoning my foundation and wanted to try out a BB cream. This one did not work for me. It does go on well and blend in great, though makes me look slightly more fair than I&#x27;d like. However, by the end of the day my face looked greasy and my bangs were a mess from touching my greasy forehead. It also seemed to clog my pores and even after washing my face you could still see little white bumps on my nose. Bummer. I&#x27;d like to try the Skin79 and if that doesn&#x27;t work stick to my Lancome.</li>
    <li> first product came faster than expected considering it came from korea. the product is good makes definitely recommend. it is light so it fits best those of use who have light complexions.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best BB creams, with my favorites tending to be the water based ones...&lt;br /&gt;It comes in 50 ml, 10 ml, and 5 ml.&lt;br /&gt;The 50 ml you can get for $12 shipped, and the others for less (obviously).&lt;br /&gt;It is for very fair skin and has great coverage and a clean make-up scent. Not oily and in a pretty package.Recommended!</li>
    <li> i do like this product only for summer because i have very dry skin, but for fall and winter, i dont think my skin will survive with this bb cream because its not moisturize enough for my super dry skin</li>
    <li> This foundation is suuuuuuuuuuuper thick which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Color is much lighter than my natural skin tone but it eventually blended out throughout the day</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this BB cream! Actually, I love most of Lioele&#x27;s products. I have purchased some from Amazon and some from another website. The only thing to remember when considering to but this product is that it only comes on one shade and is meant for very fair skin. If you are not very fair, then this product is not for you. The coverage on it is amazing and I do not need concealer or anything else. I do like to set it with their sebum catching powder because some days I am a bit oily.</li>
    <li> Great full cover BB cream. I think it would be great for covering acne.</li>
    <li> love this cc cream! also a fan of lioele bb cream ... this product is no greasy and really light coverage. never makes me break out</li>
    <li> I have traded in my foundation for this ligter and better coverage option! This has the best coverage, but feels light as air. I will never go back to regular makeup. I have even put my bare minerals away.</li>
    <li> Traditional foundation makes me break out, so when I heard about BB cream, I had to try it. I tried Missha Perfect Cover before Lioele Beyond the Solution, and I prefer Lioele by a mile! The Missha one was dry, flaky, and a bit too pale for me (might be because I got light beige). Lioele&#x27;s leaves a smooth, matte finish that prevents my naturally oily face from getting too shiny as the day goes on. It also looks kind of pale at first, but it blends into your skin pretty quickly. It reduces redness tremendously and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Keep in mind that BB cream is lighter than foundation though, so it won&#x27;t cover acne perfectly. If you want to make pimples disappear, add some powder concealer. I think just this cream is sufficient though. I wear it eeeevery day. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would give good coverage without feeling too heavy or being too oily; my skin is combination and I do have a couple of scars, not to mention some serious dark circles that I have a heck of a time covering up. I had, after some research, decided to give this a try, even though it looked like it might be a little darker than I wanted.    When this arrived - much, much sooner than I was expecting! - I was super excited to try it out. I was horribly disappointed when I saw how dark it was (it&#x27;s not THAT dark, but I have pretty fair skin). I decided to try it anyway. A thin application was more than enough to cover the scars and a little bit more covered up the dark circles completely; since it is darker than my skin tone, even a thin application was somewhat noticeable, but with a little bit of careful blending and a layer of mineral foundation, I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there (other than the fact that I could no longer see the imperfections :) ).    It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, nor has it caused any excess oil, and it&#x27;s held up well, even in high temperatures. My skin is pretty sensitive to most make up, but this hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation, and my skin even feels softer after I wash my face at night.    Though I do wish this came in a lighter shade (that way I could just wear the BB cream if I didn&#x27;t feel like doing anything else with my make up), I&#x27;m still extremely happy with it, and I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice! It smells a bit like Baby Powder! At first when I put the product on my hand to do a test swatch the tint was very dark for my skin tone. I have done some research on the product on youtube and found that it needs to adjust to your skin tone color, and to give it a few minutes to dry. On the box it also instructed me to pat it into the skin. After patting and waiting a while to dry the color is a GREAT MATCH for my very fair skin! I love how it smells, and it is very soft on my skin! I am in love!    I have done an initial reaction review on YouTube on my channel. My name on YouTube is Cutiexs.   [...] feel free to check it out. I will also be posting an in depth review after I actually use it on my face! Thanks for watching! Comment and Subscribe too!</li>
    <li> I have scoffed at BB creams for years.  Nothing would cover my redness or give me enough coverage period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this and I&#x27;m hooked.  I may have to reapply just a tiny bit to tzone area because of extreme redness but give it a try.  Ships to USA East Coast in about a week from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I find that this bb cream runs very yellow, I am a MAC NC 5 and I can&#x27;t get away with wearing this. The formula is also a bit too oily for my taste.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews but I had to for this product. It is the best BB/foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s highly pigmented like a foundation, but applies smooth and dewy like a BB cream. I have combination skin, which is oily in most parts but very dry around my nose and undereyes. I can use it in the dry places beautifully, without looking flakey or highlighting fine lines. Because it&#x27;s more dewy than other products, I have to use a little more finishing powder to keep from looking oily later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about the smell, and I was a little worried because I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong odors in products, but I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive or overpowering at all. It is a fresh floral scent that fades shortly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fair skinned caucasian, and I usually find korean creams to be a little too ashy, but this one is slightly warmer than most and looks very natural with my skin tone. The undertones are more yellow than pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I am very breakout prone and literally 9 out of 10 foundations/bb that I try will cause break outs for me. Not only does this not break me out, but somehow my skin actually feels healthier after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for how much you get too. This stuff rocks.</li>
    <li> Covered my acne scars and neutralized my redness and good for oily skin. So i enjoyed this product but it comes in only one shade so it&#x27;s either a hit or a miss.</li>
    <li> The color was perfect - this product did not cast grey like other BB creams tend to do, nor did it oxidize throughout the day. The pump is certainly a plus for hygienic purposes!!! However with my oily skin, the makeup slid down my face after a few hours of wear - even after a little bit of powder. I ended up giving this to my mom (normal/mature skin). She loves the coverage more than the Skin79+Gold she&#x27;s been using for years and it&#x27;s cheaper to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For color/tone alone, this product is fantastic. For normal/dry/mature skin, this is a wonderful option. For oily, less product is certainly more (but also invest in a stable translucent powder).</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Love this bb cream! It makes my skin feel flawless and it looks like I&#x27;m not even wearing any makeup.</li>
    <li> This product makes me pale and turn grey at the end of the day, and I only used as little product as possible. I have combination skin type and this make me look oily. I don&#x27;t think this one is for me, I am not saying that I won&#x27;t work for you. A lot of my friend uses it, and they like it.</li>
    <li> I love this bb! I am fair and neutral and this comes off a bit yellow on me but still a well blendable and wearable bb, makes a great primer/base. I&#x27;m so impressed with the coverage you get from this bb without it having a heavy feeling on the skin, it&#x27;s  light and comfortable but offers up to medium coverage. On a daily basis I will wear this and set it with a powder. It&#x27;s light, quick and lasts all day with a little extra help from a setting spray.  This is my 2nd favorite bb next to Skin79 hot pink and only because it is not yellow like lioele.</li>
    <li> Love this! It has great, natural-looking coverage that&#x27;s perfect for redness, acne, etc. It feels nice and smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t get cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: I apply this over primer using a damp beauty blender, and it makes a tiny bit go a long way. I also cut open the container when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; because there&#x27;s a ton of product left in there.</li>
    <li> My new favorite BB cream. Goes on so smooth and even. Works so well with my pale skin. I have Asian heritage, and the gift of ultra pale yellow-based skin. It&#x27;s difficult to find products here in the U.S. that match my skin tone. Most expect that if you have yellow/olive undertones, you must be dark skinned. But mine is very fair &amp; this cream works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin all the time. Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Great service and awesome product! Has amazing coverage but feels like you have nothing on! Truly recommend it! But for my oily skin I feel like I have to set it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product once before and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I have acne prone skin and it covers all of my blemishes with out my face looking cakey and it actually seems to improve the look of my skin. The only con, if you have oily skin this makeup doesn&#x27;t last for a full 8 hours. My skin usually gets pretty oily with this after a few hours. This is great coverage when your in a rush to get out of the house or go to the gym with out taking an hour to put on make up. I will definitely continue buying this!</li>
    <li> This is WELL worth the money.  Love the feel - mositurizing, not drying.  Covers like a foundation (still need a tiny bit of concealer) but has a very natural (not cakey AT ALL) finish.  Will buy several times over.</li>
    <li> thick texture cakey feeling</li>
    <li> Very good! This bb cream is very creamy but not sticky. It has good coverage!!  Just love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had horrible problems with acne before but I do have some scars so I was hoping this would help. The product matches my skin tone but it&#x27;s caused me to break out quite..disgustingly..   It has decent coverage but it&#x27;s not the easiest to blend out with a finger--sometimes it can look cakey and really obvious even when you don&#x27;t use that much</li>
    <li> This is one of the best foundations that I&#x27;ve ever used. I love BB creams and have had trouble finding pink-undertone foundation that looks light and natural. Makes skin look flawless!</li>
    <li> I have fair, combination skin, this product is absolutely amazing. It perfectly evens my skin tone and my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry OR greasy with this on. I can&#x27;t imagine my life without it now!</li>
    <li> The color is perfect for me as I am pretty fair skinned. It provides good coverage and I like that I don&#x27;t need a separate moisturizer. The only thing is that my face is oily and if I don&#x27;t use a matte primer with it, then my face is shiny within a couple hours.</li>
    <li> It says that it doesn&#x27;t brighten your skin like other Asian BB Creams, but it is brightening. Maybe it&#x27;s just lighter in color. I am pretty fair and still.. Pretty bright. I have to layer it with bronze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the BB benefits — it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have several BB Korean creams.  This is by far my favorite.  It&#x27;s natural skin tone color, not grey.  It doesn&#x27;t oxidize or turn orange.  It applies like a dream.  On your skin - it reduces your pores, covers all discoloration and leaves you with a porecelin finish.  It does have some shine, but I would say it&#x27;s more like luminous pearl kinda glow.  I just reminds of my skin of little kids, just healthy and flawless.  I absolutely love this.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and part of my everyday makeup routine. It is moisturizing, light weight, and covers up my blemishes very well. I have tried many different foundations and BB creams, and this product is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The color of the product is a little on the grey side. However, the product is very pigmented and has great coverage. There is a bit of fragrance in the cream and it can be a bit much sometimes but I overall like it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Definitely not disappointed! This provided great but light coverage. The smell isn&#x27;t bad like some other reviewers state. Great purchase and has lasted me forever!!! I&#x27;m fair to medium skinned and add a little bronzer over it an it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This bb cream comes in a more natural shade than most, light but not too light, none of that grey cast some bb creams have. The texture is creamy but covers well without being too thick. The best part is after wearing it for a few days in a row, I can actually feel my skin becoming smoother after taking it off at nite! This one is a home run.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it covers blemishes well and the color (even though it&#x27;s a bit darker than my skin), blends nicely. It&#x27;s a shame it has no sun protection. My only real problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisturization for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin do not buy this product. It slides off easily and does not blend well into your skin. It also looks and feels greasy. I have acne acars and this bb cream doesn&#x27;t provide that great of coverage.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is nice because it isn&#x27;t as snow white as others and had great coverage. I do think it&#x27;s a little heavy though for everyday wear though and seems to clog pores a bit. I would buy it again though.</li>
    <li> Great coverage (much more than skin79) and it has a natural color, perhaps a bit dark for me but it&#x27;s not bad. It makes skin look great, even hours later when it has been oxidized and your skin gets a bit oily.</li>
    <li> I tried the drugstore brand...for approximately the same price, I can go with ingredients that don&#x27;t cause acne or whiteheads, that moisturize and blend evenly, that are just as easy to order and that come in a cute pink tube. I&#x27;m sold on this stuff. It&#x27;s not oxidized to a different, deeper, icky shade. It&#x27;s stayed a lovely light pale color that works with my very, very pale porcelain skin. I use a beauty blender sponge to buff it in and it stays all day. I love it. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the high end foundations and it has so much more to offer. Why bother with the other stuff?</li>
    <li> I simply adore this bb cream, even more than the Skin79 hot pink bb cream. It has a nice, smooth consistency that is easy to blend onto my face. The color of this is a bit darker than most creams, and has yellow undertones. However, it matches my Asian skin perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t make me look super pale. The oil control is average but I don&#x27;t really need that in the middle of winter anyway. I also don&#x27;t really care for the smell, it has a powdery, makeup-like scent. But the best thing about the Beyond the Solution BB is probably the coverage it provides. It evens out my skin tone, covers most of my acne and gives my face a nice, dewey look. Although it doesn&#x27;t provide as many benefits as some other creams, Lioele has become my favorite bb cream.</li>
    <li> i wanted to love this because its so smooth and has beautiful coverage. looks nice on the skin and isn&#x27;t too pale. but it broke me out. my sister used it and it broke her out too. so we gave it to our mom and she loves it. she will be purchasing again. i guess it was too moisturizing for us. might be nice for dryer or more mature skin.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for a few months now.  It&#x27;s okay.  I have dry skin, and this isn&#x27;t drying at all! :D&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice coverage, and I feel like it stays on my face well enough.&lt;br /&gt;However, there&#x27;s something about it that will break me out.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is- but it&#x27;s not so bad.  Although I probably will not repurchase because it does break me out.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do recommend this product because it works very well!! It just doesn&#x27;t get along with my skin too well, hahaha.</li>
    <li> This product is so so so AMAZING! I watched beauty gurus on amazon use it, and they just raved about it, and i had to try it for myself, and I&#x27;m so glad i did now it&#x27;s a staple in my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good product.  Wish it had SPF. I guess I will use this in the winter time. I think it provides a good coverage with more opaque consistency.</li>
    <li> Love this. Don&#x27;t even need foundation. Great for light coverage. accidentally bought the kind without sunscreen though, so pay attention.</li>
    <li> I went on a crusade to find the best BB cream. I ordered tons of samples and this was just what I wanted! It is a mid to full coverage and leaves a nice slightly dewy finish. I&#x27;m very sensitive to products an have had no problems. It is for fair skin. A+++</li>
    <li> Very full coverage, I rarely have to use concealer with this. It is very dewy, so I have to let it dry for a little bit and use a setting powder. I highly recommend this! So much better than any other BB cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Excellent for every day use, is a very light foundation and it looks like you are using powder without using any.Nice buy! It came on time.I recomend it !Love it!</li>
    <li> This provides a natural finish on my skin and has not broken me out since I started using it about two weeks ago. I have oily skin so it tends to get shiny around 6-8 hours but over all its a great bb cream. I would say the color is fair with a pinkish undertone-- which is great for me as I am very light. I only use this for now instead of foundation.</li>
    <li> I have VERY pale skin and I bought this product because  of it&#x27;s supposedly very pale color. I usually mix my foundation every morning with a bottle of white makeup and bottle of regular makeup, and some thick ointment for moisture. However, I am travelling and I wanted to get something I could have in one bottle while also getting some sun protection. This looked perfect. But not only is it too dark for me, it has that weird characteristic orange pastey color. If you&#x27;ve tried a lot of different foundations, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. If you&#x27;re seen women with that way-to-much-makeup-where-is-your-skin look, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Not natural at all. I know my skin color is uncommon, but I really think the tone and texture would make this look pretty unnatural on anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream/foundation I have ever used!  The coverage is phenomenal and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover.  I have medium fair skin and it is perfect for me.  It is not meant to be applied with anything other than your hands and it does dry pretty quickly, so apply quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream! I used to use the skin79 one and that made me way too pale and gray and although this bbcream is still a bit light for me, it works if I blend well. It does make me oily after hours but only in my t zone. It takes longer to make me oily than the skin79 one. I find that it applies best with a damp beauty blender. I would definitely purchase this bb cream again once I run out!</li>
    <li> After looking at many BB creams I went with this one to try. I have to say I feel a bit let down.&lt;br /&gt;For the price its just not that great, I&#x27;ve used plain old foundation before in many brands and this did not seem any better to me.&lt;br /&gt;People always say they are very fair and tend to have a gray cast.. However, I found this to be almost too dark on me.&lt;br /&gt;I can see maybe using it under my eyes now an then but for a daily thing this is not going to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also people said it was good for dry skin... I&#x27;m sorry but after putting on a LOT of moisturizer just to be safe and avoid dry skin it still looks cakey/flaky in places. I would not say its good for us with dry skin. Still if you are med toned and have normal/oily skin it might work great for you.</li>
    <li> best coverage, does well on any type of skin, covers my acne and scars as well. Just an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Alrighty, this BB cream is honestly one of the most amazing things ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit thick when it first goes on the skin, but that is to be expected from an Asian BB cream. (They&#x27;re thicker than the bb creams here in the states.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage ranges from light to medium, but you can build it to a FULL coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Literally makes redness and age spots and freckles DISAPPEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me PERSONALLY is because after about 3-4 hours, the coverage sheers out a tad too much for my liking. All my problem areas were visible, but it DID keep the redness down to a minimum. :)</li>
    <li> this is a great bb cream for if you have very fair skin. there is only one color and i am pretty light &amp; it works for me just great. it has great coverage for a bb cream. the smell is very subtle &amp; i use this everyday. i will definitely be buying this once this one runs out :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SKIN79 Hot Pink BB, but decided to give this one a shot.  I will keep this review short..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both have pretty similar coverage, but I would say Liole is slightly better.  SKIN79 is thicker and has less scent, and Liole BB has more moisture in it and has some fragrance.  It takes more of SKIN79 BB to get same coverage of Liole BB, even though it&#x27;s thicker.  I think that&#x27;s because of the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are pretty good.  I have very oily and sensitive skin, and both don&#x27;t make my skin break out.  I used to use expensive foundation only (Dior, Makeup Forever, Urban Decay) because of my sensitive skin, but realized these products are just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want sun protection (SPF25 PA++), go with SKIN79&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that&#x27;s easier and quicker to apply, go with Liole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have flaky skin, go with SKIN79 (the flakes stand out less with SKIN79 BB)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want better coverage, go with Liole (Both are pretty good though. SKIN79: 3.5/5, Liole: 4/5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is dry, go with Liole since it has more moisture</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, but is hesitant about picking up makeup online. I ordered it for her and she loved it!</li>
    <li> basically use this as a moisturizer...not much coverage at all. bad that it only comes in 1 shade, but i&#x27;m very light skined, so it works for me.</li>
    <li> By far the best BB cream i have used. I struggle with acne and acne scars and this BB cream masks all the imperfections. I was amazed how it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts. Makes my skin smooth and flawless without packing on the makeup. I use E.L.F Mineral primer followed by the Lioele BB cream then brush on Physicians Formula mineral powder and lock it in with E.L.F make up mist . Definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Coverage: medium coverage. Felt very light and a small drop went a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Application: smooth application and blended well.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Adorable and functional. The pump design was a major plus for me and the packaging would be fantastic for travelling. Its also the type of thing that looks pretty on your vanity with its pink Harley Quin print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side: This wasn&#x27;t my shade. I have incredibly fair skin and I was hoping that an Asian BB cream would offer me the coverage I wanted in my shade since Asian women value even, light colored skin.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the difference between my skin tone and the product shade was noticeable enough so I passed it on to my mother who is slightly darker. She was more than happy to take it off my hands and is quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this BB cream twice so far and I really enjoy the product.  It&#x27;s different from other BB creams out there, as this one is less gray and more true to actual skin color.  With that said, it does still provide a nice whitening effect on your skin.  I also love how creamy the product is.  I&#x27;ve tried other more popular BB creams and this one seems to outweigh them, in my opinion.  The others make your skin too white or gray.  Perhaps I like this one because I&#x27;m not full Asian so having super white skin doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I would give the product 5 stars, but it does move on your face a tiny bit by the end of the day, even after setting it with powder.  Besides that, I think it&#x27;s a great product and very affordable for the beautiful natural coverage it gives.  It&#x27;s very light-weight and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m weighed down with makeup, but it still provides a nice even coverage with a slightly dewy look.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> After searching and trying three different BB creams, I decided I&#x27;d purchase this one. Not only did I get it far before the expected time, I tried it and I love this! It is creamy, smooth, and I just plain enjoy it! Amazing! I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream! It has the best coverage and you do not even need a foundation over it. I am extremly pale and it works for me, but my mom is tan and works for her. This stuff really is amazing!</li>
    <li> Covers well.  Provides a great layer for baked foundation.</li>
    <li> really, really white.</li>
    <li> So first off, I have young skin with some minor acne scarring and the occasional breakout now. This BB cream doesn&#x27;t have THAT much coverage unless you build it up to a few coats and buff in it gently. I was a bit scared when I first pumped it out because it looked kind of dark, but when I put it on, it seemed to just adjust to my skin color, so I like it. Kind of a dewy finish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing beauty bloggers go crazy over it. I had high expectations and they were exceeded. I love they way it apply&amp;#34;s and feels on the skin. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does not cover all of my acne scars and flair ups but it does a really good job. Anything Ive used in the past with this much coverage always made me feel like i was wearing a ton of makeup but I don&#x27;t feel that with this at all. You can build up the coverage and i find the color matched my fair skin very well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It covers really well and it lasts a long time since you only use 1 pump a day. Great product I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Wife was thrilled with the product, and it was exactly what she was expecting when we ordered the cream. Will definitely order more when this is finished.</li>
    <li> I was going to just try it on a small area of my face when I received this BB Cream, just to check it out, but I couldn&#x27;t stop once I started, because it was so satisfying to watch my skin transform into a smooth, even, natural tone.  I have seb derm, and this worked like a magic eraser on my red patches.  It also is by far the best dark circle minimizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It looks so natural and non-cakey/clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively fair skin, though I&#x27;ve gotten slightly sun-kissed recently, and this color blended very well with my skin tone.  I&#x27;m very excited about this product, and a small amount goes a long way, so one tube will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> i love this bb cream it gives you amamzing coverage also quick shipping! it was a great price and the packaging was completely  adorable! im a definitly going to repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice BB cream! I am used to Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB. I decided to give this one a go. And it blends very nicely with a good amount of coverage for my skin. It gives of course a little less coverage than you&#x27;d expect from a foundation, but great for the summer! One of my biggest beauty secrets (not so much anymore): in the summer, use Korean BB products! They give you a healthy glow, workable coverage, and they blend so beautifully. Foundations usually are too heavy for me in the summer, and tend to melt a little. This lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Took about a week and half to get here, but it came directly from Korea, so no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: the smell of the BB cream gives me nostalgia. It smells so good. It powdery scent reminds me of my mothers makeup bag from when I was little.&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely give Lioele a try. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it!&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: A-&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A+&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: A</li>
    <li> I loved it. It works fantastically and I will buy it again in a future, when i finish mine. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> love this! I&#x27;m light skinned but not really white and this works really good! it covers some imperfections like a light coverage foundation would and evens out skin tone. loved it so much i told my mom about it and she bought one too :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually have very sensitive skin, but this bb cream made me breakout! always in the same place too! also i don&#x27;t think this even has a SPF.  Gives me a gray cast; not very flattering.</li>
    <li> This is my first Korean bb cream, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it has really great coverage, medium-full coverage depending on how much you build it up. It has a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not anything terrible, it&#x27;s soft and it goes away in about 30 minutes to an hour. I used to use Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream, but I&#x27;m gladly replacing it with this one! I have combination/oily skin, but this bb cream doesn&#x27;t make me oily or shiny at all.</li>
    <li> I received this and the Missha M Signature Real BB (#13) and sadly to say both products had a date code of 2012. (most cosmetic products with date codes I assume are the expiration date, not a production date) So it was kind of a waste. But since they have never been opened I would think the product would still be ok as long as it didn&#x27;t break me out. This bb in particular only comes in one shade to my knowledge and it has NO SPF so I used a sunscreen as a base. I liked how it blended and I didn&#x27;t need much either. The shade was good for me, I have pale dry skin so the coverage was good, not as moisturizing when worn alone. Overall it was good but if I had received an updated product would the consistency be any different? Probably not but after trying many Korean BB creams, so far I like the BRTC Jasmine Water BB which is the perfect color and hydrating. Also Skin 79 diamond prestige is a great one for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with my order At all. It&#x27;s a complete fake and smells horrible I&#x27;m just really pissed off I&#x27;m usually very easy to deal with it when it come to stuff like this but seriously i want what I ordered &amp; I only put one start cause it&#x27;s required :\</li>
    <li> Love my BB Cream and the price is very affordable for what you get in the tube.</li>
    <li> Speedy Delivery! Amazed at how quickly the product arrived. I really like this product because I have acne blemishes from my teen years. The product itself delivers good coverage. I can wear this BB Cream alone or with some liquid foundation. There is a scent to it, but it&#x27;s a very subtle smell. I do have light/fair, yellow tone complexion so I find this as a good fit for my skin. I did not give the item 5 stars because I wish there was more info listed on the packaging. Such as the benefits: spf, blemish (dark spots) repair, whitener, etc...I&#x27;m strictly liking this product because it delivers coverage for my not so flawless skin and the feel of it is wondeful!</li>
    <li> The coverage is amazing on this product! You could definitely wear it alone with a setting powder and be good to go. It&#x27;s by far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve used so far. It&#x27;s not too pale for my skin either which is really nice. I&#x27;m a light/medium skin tone. The only thing is that it is pretty moisturizing so if you have combo to oily skin like me you may want to try something else. But I gave it 5 stars because that&#x27;s with my skin, not the product itself. I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so moisturizing. So when I wear it I don&#x27;t use my regular moisurizer, I just use that and set it with a pressed powder. I will definitely use the rest of it up though. I highly recommend mostly for normal to dry skin types.</li>
    <li> I put it on every morning after moisturizer and sunscreen. It smooths out my skin and blends uneven tones. I love it!! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> All the other BB I have tried (which I also love) Have left me a bit over moisturized which in the winter is no problem but i get oily fast in the summer. So far this one feels great!</li>
    <li> Conceals flawlessly. Looks a touch grey initially, but blends well.</li>
    <li> I had a customer compliment my skin today at work. I&#x27;ve been using bb creams for the past couple of years, I had the Missha no.23 before getting the Lioele bb cream. I found the no 23 a little bit too dark and pink for my skin and was going to get the no 21 before deciding to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;At first when I used the Lioele bb cream I forgot to shake up the tube before testing it, it seems the product settled a bit during shipment/storage and the first pumps were very thick and chalky. I tend to have fairly oily skin and wearing this product alone seems to increase the amount of sebum produced on my face. I did not have this problem before with the Missha. However, I went and got NYX&#x27;s HD translucent finishing powder and my face stayed matte the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;Despite having to use a setting powder for this bb cream (when I didn&#x27;t have to for another brand) I really do like effect it has on my skin, smooth, poreless, and as the customer put it: &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;. It is less pink compared to the Missha I had, but it not too yellow which is perfect for my skin. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> i LOVE how this BB cream doesn&#x27;t make me snow white! It&#x27;s a very natural color, and it fits my skin tone MUCH better than my skin79 BB cream which tends to make my face really white in pictures. Lioele Beyond the Solution gives medium coverage and a very dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the normal properties that most BB creams have. It lacks SPF, Whitening (not that i care for that one) and Anti-wrinkle (don&#x27;t care much for that either). The SPF was what i REALLYYY wish this product had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe reason why this BB cream is darker than other typical BB creams (skinfood, skin79, Gold Caviar, etc) is because it lacks the whitening properties that most BB creams have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this BB cream and recommend it to anyone who finds that most other BB creams are too light for them (i&#x27;m about an N-25 (face-wise))</li>
    <li> Second tube for me! Got it for Christmas. I love how it&#x27;s not greasy and is very matte. Its not very moisturizing at all and I wish it had sunblock in it. But, that&#x27;s not really a big issue for me.. I like to mix it with my moisturizor so I can make it as pigmented as I want. It covers really well.</li>
    <li> It gave me massive acne, instantly. It only comes in one color and it is not for fair skinned people.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream ever. I&#x27;m a medium Bare Minerals and not Asian. This is perfect for me. Great coverage and staying power. No need for additional make up. Love the pump. Very fast ship! ~ Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bad consistency, with a very grey undertone that made the skin look ghostly.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty amazing I must say. It really does perfect the skin and I prefer to use this over other foundations or founddation-like products. I was disappointed that I accidentally bought this one instead of the Triple the Solution version, but I still really like this product for what it is. Cons: It smells like those Chinese soaps, which I don&#x27;t really like and it also does not mention containing an SPF. If you purchase this, keep in mind that if you try putting on a moisturizer or something with SPF underneath, it makes the end result kind of oily looking, but try it anyway, maybe it&#x27;s just my moisturizer. I find that this looks better when applied on a naked face. I would definitely repurchase again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, fastest shipping ever! :) ordered it on Friday &amp; received it on Monday, I am very impressed. I just used this product for the first time, and so far it looks good. It has a slight rosey scent to it, but i don&#x27;t mind it much. I originally thought i purchased the triple the solution one honestly, but im please with how this works so far. the coverage is about medium &amp; goes on smoothly. I will update if needed.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it is a bit oily. oily skin girls, beware!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I remember when I got it as a free sample with a different purchase elsewhere, and it was in a little tiny packet. Even that little tiny amount was enough for my whole face. You don&#x27;t need to use much to get amazing coverage. Unlike other BB creams, it really does cover spots, acne, and redness. The consistency is good and easy to apply on the face. As I&#x27;ve seen mentioned, the smell isn&#x27;t anything fancy and some people don&#x27;t like it, but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s easy to apply and provides great coverage. Some cons are that it can seem a little greasy at times and if you apply too much it can get cakey and heavy. But just use a little bit and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!! Great coverage! Good as a primer and no makeup day</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. i originally picked it up as recommended by YouTuber Emily Fox. it works great for my skin, which is sensitive and dry. it only comes in one color, which is really light for my tan skin, but once it dries, it seems to adjust. i use it in place of my foundation and it actually covers pretty well; definitely not full coverage, but after (8) hours in the office, it still looks good. i do set it with powder. i loved it so much that i also picked up their SPF cream that came as a sample with this delivery. looks very natural &amp; feels natural.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Some BB creams just don&#x27;t provide enough coverage and this product definitely provides coverage.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear any foundation but my mom got me hooked on this. I use it when I have break outs due to lack of sleep or humid weather. It has great coverage, has. SPF, and multivitamins etc. it&#x27;s not too thick and the color blends well into any skin tone. It gives a dewy finish and lasts most of the day. My eye shadow lasts longer too when using this product underneath. I&#x27;ve had many compliments and even friends have converted to this. Would definitely recommend! They shipped really fast and I even got some samples from Lioele as well. Great service and awesome product</li>
    <li> Gives great coverage lasts a long time and feels nice. On the light side though so best used during winter when you are at your most pale. If you are anothing other than a fair skinned person probs don&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product EXCEPT for the fact it has parabens. Otherwise, it has great coverage and it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> For reference, I wear NC 30-35 and I have combo dry/oily skin. First, it was wayyy too light on me; I looked like a ghost. Second, it was drying. Third, it has a weird scent to it. However, the coverage is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a BB cream and my first time trying an Asian foundation product. I have to say that I am impressed and I love it. My skin is very fair and very, very sensitive. This BB cream has a funny smell, like processed plants, but it goes away very quick. It has great coverage and stays on all day. It doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all. This BB cream can rub off easilly if you do not use a setting power but I think that is too much for my skin and makes it look cakey so I do not use it with this BB cream. I have cystic acne and I have not had a problem with my skin breaking out with this BB cream yet. I would really recommend this BB cream if you are looking for something for fair skin, have acne and want to use a BB cream that is not going to break you out, or to give something new a try. It is really great. I am happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using up my hot pink Skin79 bb cream, which I was in love with, but I wanted to give something else a try because I love trying new products. I had high hopes for this from all the rave reviews, but sadly, my skin broke out like crazy from this. It started with little tiny bumps on my forhead, then cheeks, then chin... and I knew it had to be the bb cream, as it was the only new thing I was trying. I was quite sad because the texture is good and the coverage was pretty good, but I cant wear it because it breaks me out. So I don&#x27;t recommend this if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This product takes a little long (by Amazon standards) to arrive but it is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. I have problem skin and have had acne all of my life. I have tried all kinds of foundation from Clinique and Bobbi Brown to MAC and Urban Decay, mineral, and drugstore foundations. None compare to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is a pump to prevent contamination and waste, and when you pump it looks like a creamy foundation. The miracle happens when you put it on. I stipple it on with a stippling brush that I also got from Amazon and it covers like a dream but at the same time is feather light. It can be light to full coverage by layering, when my skin is really bad I do four pumps and my face looks flawless - most of the time two pumps will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for me is that it smooths out my acne scars, when I have this on my face just looks smooth (no dented surfaces). I have  sensitive skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t broken me out. I use a primer when I want it to last (Too Faced Primed and Poreless Sensitive) or on it&#x27;s own when I&#x27;m just out and about. When I take it off at the end of the day, my face feels soft and smooth - my skin never felt this way with regular foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this to anyone that has problem skin and wants a flawless look without feeling like you have a mask on - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  I gave up on BB creams for a while because of it and went back to my MUFE HD Foundation.  Then I noticed the rave reviews that Skin79 was getting for their BB creams so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  It gave me a newfound hope for BB creams.  It made my skin look really matte and natural- the coloring is great.  The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  I wear all of my BB cream with Laura Geller Spackle Under Primer (clear) and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin only muchmuch better.  I&#x27;m in love!  I am now awaiting the Lioele Beyond the Solution because I want a BB Cream with no SPF version for when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream start out with) so no waiting to oxidize!&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold, Lioele Triple the Solution, and I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention that these above BB creams also lasts all day, and stays matte on my super oily skin without ever having to blot!</li>
    <li> My skin alone has improved I absolutely love this product and it&#x27;s a great primer will not use any other!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this bb cream yesterday, and so far I am VERY happy with it. The first bb cream I tried was the Skin79 Gold, and it was okay, but I much prefer Lioele. The coverage is amazing, the texture isn&#x27;t greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t go on gray the way that Skin79 did. It also seems like a really good value: There is a lot in the tube and just one pump of the stuff easily covers my whole face. I agree that it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing, but I like to wear a little moisturizer under it anyway so that there is something between my skin and my makeup (if you can call bb cream \\&quot;makeup\\&quot;). Also, I should not that I am very fair skinned, so - as the other reviews mentioned - if you&#x27;re tan this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. I can&#x27;t tell yet whether or not it&#x27;s going to make me break out, but so far I&#x27;m totally in love.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream, It covers my pores and redness. :) I just wished it had SPF in it.</li>
    <li> This is the first BB cream that i have ever used that literally covers like a foundation, yet feels light like a BB cream should! It goes on beautifully! I like to use to 1 1/2 pumps and mix it with Boscia  beauty oil. Will definitely keep using this BB cream in the future! perfect for those days where you dont want to put foundation on but still want coverage.</li>
    <li> Good love it just wish it had more shade ranges its a little gray toned</li>
    <li> I have fair, dry, acne-scarred skin.  This product is awesome!  I would say it has light to medium coverage.  It is a perfect daily bb cream--not to heavy but enough coverage.  It is super moisturizing and does an excellent job of covering up my acne scars--I barely have to apply concealer.  It has a pump which is perfect and not messy at all. The only con I have is that I have fair skin (NW15-20) and it is about half a shade too dark so I do have to go in with a lighter foundation on the edges to blend it into my neck.  But with how awesome the product is, it is worth the extra minute of application!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product I was searching for BB creams VIA YouTube and what the Pros prefer, when this product came up, I was surely skeptical, and seeing all the 5 stars I thought that this product would work for others but not for me, I was so very wrong. This is one hell of a product, whatever they have in this, works for ANY skin type, my skin is very hard to work with, dry patches here, oily patches there, it&#x27;s so very difficult to find a foundation that works even if it says its for certain types of skin. I was blown away by what this product does for me and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product does the following.&lt;br /&gt;-Covers blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;-Evens Skin Tone.&lt;br /&gt;-Targets problem areas and conceals them.&lt;br /&gt;-Has SPF.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy Application&lt;br /&gt;-Clean bottle with pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I applied this for the very first time (with fingertips no brush needed)I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe how easy, simple and clean my face looked. This is VERY GOOD for those who have a naturally red/pink tone to their face, covering any blemishes. One more important thing, Summer is coming up, and I hate putting on a full face of foundation for it only to smear right off, even if set with a powder. This is PERFECT for the summer time, Fast, easy but more than anything ACCURATE!&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s an amazing product, i&#x27;ll never go back to foundation AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I like it it does cover blimeshes but it is to light for my skin so I use a little of my usual foundation on top.</li>
    <li> Great product- good coverage and works well with oily skin. Color is a bit  funky at first but blends well.</li>
    <li> Not for darker skinned.&lt;br /&gt;Only fair skinned. Makes your face too white.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had heard so many good things about lioeli bb creams from youtube gurus and just had to try it. The coverage is medium on my skin, you can probably build it up for more coverage though. It really melts into my skin, I don&#x27;t feel any stickyness after applying. I brought this BB cream with my on vacation in the tropics and it didn&#x27;t budge all day! It is very long lasting. My old complaint is in color selection. I have very fair skin (revlon colorstay 150 buff) and it&#x27;s a tad dark for me. But it seems to fit best under a lighter powder or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this and will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this entire transaction! The price was unbeatable, the shipping was extremely fast, and the product is wonderful! This is unlike regular bb creams that you find in drugstores because it has more of a medium to full coverage. It has a really nice smell to it, which I love and don&#x27;t mind at all, although some might. Buy this bb cream here and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The greatest thing about this BB cream is that it causes no Grey Cast unlike the American ones! I love this brand, not only are the products cute and the packaging is nice, the products work great. I have had no problems with this so far! It smells great and feels very good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I was worried that the color of this product wouldn&#x27;t match my skin well because it is from an Asian brand and Asians tend to have much more yellow toned skin. I am naturally super fair with very neutral undertones. Often times foundations look to yellow on me. This product pleasantly surprised me. Another thing that was a very pleasant surprise is the coverage. Usually bb creams are very light on coverage but this one is definitely not. I would say this is more medium or full coverage. Unfortunately I have to deal with adult acne so I rely on my foundation/skin products to help cover that up. This product has been one of the best I have tried in awhile. This has worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Great product and the coverage is amazing. A little goes a VERY long way, 50 ml will last a while. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin and really evens out complexion.</li>
    <li> Blends and absorbs very well. Only thing I dislike is that it&#x27;s only one shade and it&#x27;s nice but I&#x27;m pale so I have to rub it all the way down my neck so the color doesn&#x27;t stop at the jaw line an look too defined. It is very nice though. I&#x27;d recommend it to people who already have some color to their skin so it matches better.</li>
    <li> The product is really worth it. I can say I will buy this FOR YEARS TO CAME I love the way it feels on my skin and how well it stays on!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprise it was mail from South Korea and 100% Original!! Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream especially since I wanted one without whitening. I wanted to tan this summer but thought it would be a wasted effort if I got a bb cream with whitening!  Gorgeous shade and it makes u look fabulously flawless! Definitely my fav at the moment!</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive middle aged skin.  I love Lioele.  No redness, stinging or spotting.  It matches my skin tone.</li>
    <li> first of all, this product came 3 weeks early and in great packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only got it today, but I tried it right away. I do musical theatre, so I wore it to rehearsal (I&#x27;m a cast member and a dancer in this show, so it&#x27;s a lot of running and energy) and my face didn&#x27;t get all goopy or gross from the cream at all! it stayed in perfect condition and looked great! I am going to start using this instead of foundation, even for shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This bb cream is great for when you don&#x27;t want a heavy foundation, great for day wear and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily or dry.</li>
    <li> This BB cream was easy to use. It has a pump and you can control how much you need. I am an olive medium complexion, and i blend this in using another foundation to achieve the right look. Its long lasting and can tolerate high temperature.</li>
    <li> I tried a bunch of american BB creams but didn&#x27;t like any of them. A friend told me to try an asian one so I did. I absolutely love this BB cream! It makes my skin look flawless and the tube has lasted me a while.</li>
    <li> Best bb cream ever. I use it as a base before foundation and skip concealer completely. I love the way my face looks and feels with this product. I only wish that there were more shades.</li>
    <li> Too ashy and broke me out.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is amazing, have purchased numerous times.</li>
    <li> awesome when using by itself&lt;br /&gt;a very decent BB Cream with makeup (NOT EXCELENT)</li>
    <li> Good coverage, one of the more better coverage BB creams out there.  Blends into skin well, I have combination skin, and product holds through morning and night just fine. No need to touch up. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I started using BB cream a year ago when I decided that I wanted a light coverage on my acne scars. I have never bought any other Lioele products, but this BB cream kind of... let me down. I&#x27;m very pale but this BB cream makes my face look ghastly and caked up, even when I apply toner and lotion + facial mist before applying this BB cream. It accentuates the little bumps and imperfections I have on my face (so it&#x27;s worse than not wearing it :[... it&#x27;s kind of thick but it doesn&#x27;t have much coverage) I think it&#x27;s because I have absolutely no oil on my face. If you have an oily complexion, this might be the BB cream for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pump that lets out the cream is also kind of hard to control, and it&#x27;s too much per use. If you use all of it, it&#x27;ll definitely make your face look caked up... It&#x27;s kind of disappointing because I paid around 27$ but I ended up not using so much because it doesn&#x27;t match my skin type. :(</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. A bunch of Lioele creams are too light for me but this one is great. Goes on a little light at first but after a few minutes its just right. I do set it with some powder so I&#x27;m not sure if that helps. Sometimes I mix it with Lioele Super Gold Snail BB cream in golden beige which I think is a little too dark for me, together its perfect if I want a bronzer look. This BB cream stays put all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this bb cream and i will be re-purchasing it when it runs out! Ive had it a few months now and my skin looks healthier than it did using a liquid foundation everyday.</li>
    <li> 1) excellent coverage!&lt;br /&gt;2) make-up stays on for hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) OILY SKIN! - this is not fit for those with oily skin. Every morning I would put this on, and less than 3 hours, my face is super oily! If you do purchase this, buy some blotting papers. I have combination skin, but mainly OILY skin, and it definitely makes your skin break out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) break out - the fact that it&#x27;s so oily, it made me break out :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUGGESTIONS: try SKIN 79 PINK bottle - I tried using my mom&#x27;s BB creme and it definitely less oily.</li>
    <li> by far the best BB cream ive tried! not even expensive high end department store BB creams are as awesome! it doesnt irritate my very sensitive skin and actually has amazing coverage! medium to full! very awesome for a BB. will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great BB cream! I love everything about it. The color, texture, smell and coverage. I&#x27;ve been using the Misha 23 but I like Lionel better because the color is a bit warmer, not much but enough too be a better match for my skin. I have drier skin and love a dewy finish, this BB gives very little shine but I wouldn&#x27;t call it matte at all. It just looks like your own skin but better. The texture is light, as in I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup and doesn&#x27;t settle into lines or pores. It has a very slight scent that smells nice, and disappears soon. The coverage is light to medium depending on application amount and method. I use a brush to lightly apply and seems to disappear but my skins looks more even toned. I have Melasma and it doesn&#x27;t covers the hyper pigmentation completely but it makes the darker areas fade and not too noticeable. If you like misha, you will like lioele.  I recommend it and will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I do like the Lioele BB Cream but I found that it has less coverage and not as smooth as others.  Missha and Skin 79 are better I think and will stick with them.  My Lioele will be just a back up.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage and moisture that it gave my skin but this product broke me out :( that&#x27;s the only reason why I gave this a 3 star rating. For your reference I have oily/combo skin and I am an NC30 by Mac but don&#x27;t get me wrong this product offers great coverage and adds amazing moisture and gives a slight dewy effect to your skin which makes you glow kinda...</li>
    <li> This bb cream is pretty good but honestly it just reminds me of my regular foundation or even a concealor. Unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong then I don&#x27;t know lol. I&#x27;m new to the world of bb cream. I even bought some of the nyx brand and enjoy that one more to be honest.</li>
    <li> This is a 50/50 for me. I&#x27;ve tried so many different Korean BB creams that it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll use! My skin is&lt;br /&gt;-fair (NW15 at MAC, and translucent finishing powder. I&#x27;m paler than the lightest Clinique shade!)&lt;br /&gt;-sensitive/combination&lt;br /&gt;-prone to redness since I&#x27;m a ginger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was actually part of the three-instead-of-one-star rating. Dont listen to reviewers who say it&#x27;s too yellow/beige/whatever because more than likely, they don&#x27;t have lighter skin. Korean BB Cream carries different shades, but they&#x27;re all meant for lighter skin. American brands have adapted to darker skin tones--hence why I&#x27;d recommend Dr. Jart or Benefit or Clinique (edit: Dr. Jart is not American, but since you can buy it at US cosmetics stores, I always associate it with American brands!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-neutral color for all lighter skin types&lt;br /&gt;-not overly oily or cakey&lt;br /&gt;-isn&#x27;t too shiny, which is my #1 problem with many BB Creams because my face looks shiny afterwards to achieve that &amp;#34;dewy glow&amp;#34; but hey, any of that problem could be fixed with finishing powder&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the coverage isn&#x27;t good and I often feel like I need to let it dry then apply another (which I never do, I just do not know what else to do)&lt;br /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t stay on for as long as I&#x27;d like, and doesn&#x27;t do much to reduce undereye shadows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, or if you live in a climate with a lot of humidity like I do. I traveled to Ohio with this and it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream ever! It&#x27;s so great, you can use it as a base with foundation on top or even just on its own! Great coverage.</li>
    <li> This is my first Asian BB Cream and I am in love, it is the best it covers all my imperfections and I use it with my Stippling Brush and OMG it makes my face look flawless. This seller is AMAZING, shipping was super fast and I got a free sample :) I cant wait to do more business with them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I thought it would.  It has a weird scent when you apply the cream.</li>
    <li> It was perfect at mimicking my skin tone at first, but then it turned me into a ghost and I didn&#x27;t look natural anymore. Welp, back to Sephora.</li>
    <li> I completely adore this product . I modeled for years so I have tried about everything . Yet this by cream is by far the best coverage and delicate scent ever . I completely love this whole line of products but for those women who have trouble finding all day coverage .. This is it ! Truly a fantastic price as well !</li>
    <li> I like the texture and how it makes me skin look. It&#x27;s a tad bit lighter so I mix it with a drug store foundation that I normally use.</li>
    <li> So far, I have used it several times. I like the coverage that a Korean BB cream offers compared to the thinner US ones.  I have a pretty light skin tone, but I thought this BB cream was a little too light for me. So i have had to mix it with another BB cream so that it&#x27;s not too pale on my skin. I bought this cream for use in the winter, since my normal BB cream is a little too drying in the winer, but perfect in the summer when my naturally oily skin is oilier.  This did work better on me in the winter.... I just wish they made this BB cream in other colors. I would def like to go a color up. Otherwise, since I can mix it with a darker shade, I am good with it.</li>
    <li> Amazing BB cream for light skin. I got the one without skin, because I got is as an everyday foundation (sometimes primer.) It matches my face EXACTLY. When i say light that is like Mac C2/2.5. this is Yellow-neutral undertone. As it is an Asian bb cream, it will cater more too Asian like skin, which is yellow undertones. I do still need to bronze up my skin, I never like the look of foundation on my skin alone, it looks unnatural! Definitely fuller coverage, I used one full pump on my face and it gave me medium coverage! Pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> This is incredibly dark, even orangey in color.  I am caucasian with medium to light skin tone and this looked like clown makeup on me.</li>
    <li> This product rocks! It has great coverage and works well with my skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a full coverage bb cream!</li>
    <li> Better for the Caucasian babys. Love this stuff but you have to be very light skinned to wear this..</li>
    <li> I love it. Not thick or cakey. Not heavy. Just very fair. Works great as under eye concealer or primer.</li>
    <li> reviewed alot of bb creams... wanted one with no spf and they are hard to find! found this after great reviews! it is great! can use as a concealor or overall. is buildable for flaws soft clean feeling , looks natural for lighter skin tones and you get a big tube that will last a long time!  fast shipping good price so glad i found this! my skin breaks out with cosmetics that have spf especially around eyes and sensitve areas who wants spf  in your eyes! have read about spf and pros and cons and decided i would choose what i put on my skin not deal with ingredients added in... this bb cream has good ingredients mostly check out reviews on line! i love this bb cream!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my daughter and she likes it.  She reordered when she finished it.  I didn&#x27;t like the texture on my skin.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is amazing.  I stopped using moisturizer, primer and foundation and only use this product now.  It feels great and keeps my skin hydrated very nicely.  Only downside would be that people with darker skin tones wouldn&#x27;t be able to get away with that because it is fairly light colored, but you can always put foundation on overtop or bronzer to darken it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great.  No problems with delivery and it came very quickly.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> heard so many good things about this product i had to buy to see for myself and I love it...keeps my skin soft and applies great...great for spring and summer when you want to go light with foundation...don&#x27;t really need to use foundation if you don&#x27;t want to...I absolutely love bb creams</li>
    <li> I have the Kat Von D Lock it foundation. I had heard to mix this with it to thin the foundation out. It is on the gray side of color, as a lot of foreign bb creams tend to be. This tends to make you very oily throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product...the color matches very well. The only problem is that the coverage is light coverage.</li>
    <li> My skin looks 10x better with just this on my skin! I just put a layer of powder over it and I am done!</li>
    <li> If its waterproof, that would be be perfect.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, perfect color and makes my face look even and smooth! Cheap but lasts about 2 months or so if you use it everyday! Would recommended for any fair skinned person to use!</li>
    <li> For years and years I have struggled to find a makeup that would give my skin a flawless look, not break me out or make my skin oily, match my skintone AND be affordable. Well, after all those years of searching I think I&#x27;ve found it!!! After all the hype of BB creams, I really wanted to try one for myself, but had no clue which brand would cover the best and work well with my skin. (I have combination skin, some oily spots, some dry, and prone to breakouts) I have some acne scarring and needed coverage for that as well. Basically, my skin was a mess and you would NEVER guess that with this BB cream. My pores are minimized, my face feels moisturized, but not oily at all. I have a nice matte, slightly dewy glow to my skin. The color matches perfectly, like it was made for my skin (fair skinned, red/pinkish tones). The coverage is amazing! I was a little skeptical if this would cover my blemish marks/scars and it does. It looks like my skin has been airbrushed! Hands down, the best stuff ever - and the best part, I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer, concealer or foundation, just this bottle because it does it all. Will DEFINITELY be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. The packaging was nice, but unfortunately it made my skin break out :( but it might work wonders for someone else</li>
    <li> I love using this as a primer. Will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I love it. I love you all for bringing it into my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this product because of its Amazon fandom and I am so glad I tried it! It&#x27;s crazy that someone it just blends perfectly into my skin, even though the color looks so light. No smell to it from my experience. Gorgeous texture. I use a stippling technique to apply it and it just goes on some smoothly and covers moderate imperfections well. Perfect for daily wear.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and my biggest challenge is to find a BB cream that will not only stay on my face for 12 hrs, but help control the Exxon valdise effect it starts to take on right around 3pm. That said, I researched (via beauty blogs and youtube) what BB Creams were best for my skin type, and decided to order the top 5 all at once and compare. A little expensive, but i wanted to rate how each of them compared, and in the long run, with shipping included, i ended up spending as much as i would have had i marched into sephora to buy a tube of BB and maybe some powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 5 i ordered, I like this best. It&#x27;s the least scented of the BBs and it applies very smoothly with finger tips. It has the fullest coverage of all the creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I really like the matte, natural look it has  ( as opposed to the &amp;#34;pearlescent&amp;#34; looks some bb creams provide). It stays on my face all day, and withstands the my bike ride to / from work enough that if i wanted to go to dinner afterward, I can just reapply powder to my nose, forehead and chin, and still look polished. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this BB cream. I haven&#x27;t tested it out when the weather gets hot / humid, but i don&#x27;t foresee any problems.</li>
    <li> I had been using Dr. Jart+ BB cream, and I still love that one. I didn&#x27;t mind paying the 40 bucks or so on Sephora for it, but when I started watching Shaaanxo&#x27;s videos on YouTube, I decided to try this one, and found that it was much less expensive. It has everything I love about my other BB cream with a better price. It instantly neutralizes my skintone and has great coverage. I have pretty decent skin (one or two blemishes at a given time but mild, persistent dark circles) and I can wear this plus powder and my skin looks great. The color sinks into your skin rather than sits on top of it (I&#x27;m looking at you, TooFaced). It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing, and I can cover my face with one pump. I&#x27;m fair, and it matches my skintone (probably because it&#x27;s a Korean product) so I can&#x27;t say anything about its performance on darker skintones. I&#x27;d suggest using a tinted powder if you don&#x27;t want to put foundation over it, just in case it washes you out.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with this BB cream, it gives really great coverage but still looks dewey, I struggle with acne and this covers most of my spots very well. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> This is darker than I expected.  Every Asian bb cream that I have purchased so far has been light enough to work with my skin tone but this is just a tad too dark. I can still wear it but I just don&#x27;t love how it looks. I prefer the lightening kind because it helps reduce the red/pink in my skin tone. This is just not great if you&#x27;re very fair skinned or have any pink tone. Goes on well so not bad overall but just not for me!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because I love the Secret Pore Rich Balm.  But it&#x27;s extremely dry and almost leaves a gray cast.  Not my fave BB cream.  Still searching for a great ashian bb cream</li>
    <li> I have tried many BB creams and it would leave my skin oily by the end of the day, but this one doesn&#x27;t! It blends in my skin so well! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big BB cream lover and while the texture of this bb cream is really nice and works well with my oily skin and I can&#x27;t get over how grey it is.  Who has grey skin??? I did like the performance and texture enough to want to purchase the Triple Beyond the Solution BB Cream (I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s lighter in color) and a few other Lioele products which I have really enjoyed.  I also have fairly fair skin (NW13) and this was too dark (and too grey) but perhaps if you have darker skin that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue as it did seem to buff into the skin quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Buy this for my wife faithfully. According to her it&#x27;s the best BB cream ever made. She highly recommends this product to anyone who wants an amazing cream!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brand of BB cream, and after I saw this, i decided to give it a try. It did has a nice smell, and the texture wasn&#x27;t very thick either, it&#x27;s a bit creamy and the blends my skin very well when I applied it on my face.</li>
