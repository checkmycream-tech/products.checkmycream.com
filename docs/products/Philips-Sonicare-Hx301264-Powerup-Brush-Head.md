<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> We are using these brush heads with Philips Sonicare Powerup Battery Toothbruses:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Blue]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00NL2AON2 Philips Sonicare Hx3631/07 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Soft, Spearmint Green]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads don&#x27;t show wear like our manual toothbrushes, so we will replace them every 3 months as recommended by Philips. The  reminder bristles  fade when a replacement is needed. After a month of use, the bristles are beginning to fade, but the bristles aren&#x27;t showing any wear. I like to brush my gums too, so I prefer to use the brush heads with soft bristles. The sensitive brush head is the same as the soft bristle brush head that comes with the Spearmint Green Powerup Battery Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of these brush heads has a different color strip at its  base (silver, orange, &amp; dark blue)  so family members know which Powerup is theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save money, I order these through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
    <li> These are just spares. I&#x27;m sure they will do just fine.</li>
    <li> Much better than the regular brush heads that come with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money</li>
    <li> It works with Philips Sonicare HX3631/06 Powerup Battery Toothbrush.Good to know that.</li>
    <li> I tried this sonic toothbrush head for a few months and at first I thought it was great. I think it does clean the surface of my teeth well, but not as great between my teeth. I decided to try my rotating toothbrush again, and really think that actually cleans between my teeth better.</li>
    <li> I got these on here with an instant coupon. They were already cheaper than in the store and the coupon made the deal even better.</li>
    <li> Was very impressed with how my mouth felt after brushing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> The soft brush heads don&#x27;t irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> Solid performer, get one week&#x27;s usage per set of batteries, brush twice a day, Great for travel</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit for the version of Philips Sonicare I&#x27;m having. All electronic brush makers has to keep in mind to design brush head so it fits all versions of their own brush.</li>
    <li> love the way the brush make you brush for two minutes.  Anything that may get you out of the dentist chair faster is great by me!</li>
    <li> This is only a fair substitute for the more high-end Sonicare toothbrushes.  The brush head is chunky and the motor tends to rattle my brain, but it cleans well.  Will continue to keep this in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> I love this! This battery operated toothbrush feels cleaner than a manual toothbrush.  That&#x27;s the reason why I order another toothbrush head for my family and myself.</li>
    <li> Excellent product liked it very much .Price was reasonably and would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a good product..</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these refills in the store.  Happy to locate.</li>
    <li> These fit the Philips Sonicare Powerup toothbrush. Most importantly for me, they are far cheaper than buying the Philips branded replacement heads. They also work perfectly! Each one has a different color band at the bottom, which isn&#x27;t really shown in the pictures. They are nice and soft but do a great job. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Much bigger than standard Sonicare brush heads. Price was much better than at the local store.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the refill brushes yet but the price was great for the 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Much softer on the gums than the regular brushes which caused bruising.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush on a lark around Xmas time to give it a try...but now i couldn&#x27;t live without it and my teeth and gums seem so much happier...that has a lot to do with the tooth brush heads and price was incredible from this company... i am still using the one that came with the brush but will be trying one of the sensitive brushes any day now</li>
    <li> nice toothbrush does the job leaving your teeth nice and clean battery lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Very happy w purchase.</li>
    <li> i like the toothbrush</li>
    <li> This a great buy compared to local stores.  Best toothbrush ever.  All of us in the family use these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> the brush heads are simply too big and the bristles have a curve that is not conducive to cleaning behind the front and bottom teeth.  Love this for traveling but I had to modify the head by eliminated and trimming bristles.  Please Phillips, make a compact head for the Power Up.</li>
    <li> Works fine and is a great value as well.  It holds it&#x27;s charge from AA alkaline batteries supplied for three weeks&lt;br /&gt;lets you know because the machine doesn&#x27;t turn on.  My teeth have much less plaque, look and feel much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives include a noisy motor, a lot of vibration, and plastic back of brush hits forcefully against other teeth&lt;br /&gt;on occasion.  For this reason I do not use this toothbrush for the back side of my front top teeth as I cannot&lt;br /&gt;keep it front smashing into my two front teeth and fear it could crack them.  So I manually brush those teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use my Powerup and even bought a second one and additional brushes, which&lt;br /&gt;are nice.  Great value for $11 and  three replacement brushes for $15.</li>
    <li> I love these! When I bought my toothbrush, it came with a regular toothbrush head, which is hard on my gums. These are for sensitive teeth and they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift, the recipient love it.</li>
    <li> Good price, and good items. Suitable for my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These powerup brush heads are easy to replace.  They clean the teeth well.  I just wish they were a smige less in cost.</li>
    <li> These are replacement head with soft bristles for the Sonicare toothbrush that came with a medium bristle head.</li>
    <li> These are for my wife and she reports that they fit and work great.</li>
    <li> This product comes in a package which states on the front and the back that it is ONLY for the Philips Sonicare PowerUp battery toothbrush.  The product page designation was for *sensitive* but the package I received says *soft*.  Whether they are called sensitive or soft these brush heads are absolutely the best for my teeth and gums.  The reminder bristles fade so slowly that I forget how dark they are supposed to be so I just keep track of the date and change the brush head every three months.  I saw my dental hygienist for the first time since changing over to my new Sonicare PowerUp brush and she said I almost didn&#x27;t leave any work for her to do.  Unfortunately she still said I need to come in every six months.</li>
    <li> Very simple brush heads that were perfect for our kids.</li>
