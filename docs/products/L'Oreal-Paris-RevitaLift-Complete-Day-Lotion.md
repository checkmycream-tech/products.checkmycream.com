      <li>I love this lotion, which is more like a cream and great for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>IF L&#x27;Oréal redesigns the dispenser pump, this is the best product, at the best value, available at ANY price - far better than Olay&#x27;s more expensive Pro-X products.</li>
      <li>very light - provides some sun protection (not beach worthy but great for daily wear).  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery of my favorite skin care product!</li>

      <li>It goes on light and absorbs quickly, and my skin feels like it is becoming smoother and smoother over time.</li>
      <li>This really works after just one week I see a difference FAB!!!</li>
      <li>Received my lotion, took the new bottle out of its packaging, pumped the dispenser top, but not a drop of product dispensed!</li>
      <li>First of all, I have to say that I usually love Loreal products</li>
      <li>The lotion is easily accessible.  </li>
      <li>I did not have any problems is dispensing this, it works fine, and covers nicely, with a smooth feel, really like it, for the hot desert summers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll write a more positive review if/when L&#x27;Oréal improves the design of the dispenser.</li>
      <li>The cool water however was utterly&lt;</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and most lotions with SPF exacerbate the oiliness.</li>
      <li>Luckily, you can return beauty products @</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and works very well.  </li>
      <li>The traditional wide pots that L&#x27;Oreal has always used are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin and when I apply this in the morning, it takes like 15 min for it to get absorbed somehow in my skin.</li>
      <li>If you do not have oily skin, I believe this product was be worth while.</li>
      <li>It has SPF 30 and is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>This is the best, least expensive day lotion on the market - not greasy, an excellent moisturizer under makeup -</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend trying this product, especially ok conjunction with other products from this line.</li>
      <li>I use this everyday and have for 5+ years, it&#x27;s great for your skin and has kept my skin from showing much age.  </li>
      <li>I loved the fact that this is SPF 30 for anytime wear, but the cost is a little steep for the benefits of this cream.</li>
      <li>As far as the moisterizer itself, for an inexpensive brand it goes on smooth</li>
      <li>You can obtain the exact quantity you want.  </li>
      <li>I have really noticed a change in how my skin bounses back more than it used to.</li>
      <li>I used to love L-Oreal above all other facial products, and was delighted to find this Revitalift daytime cream in the pump style.  </li>
      <li>I ran out way to fast.</li>
      <li>It really works for me.  </li>
      <li>This lotions spreads evenly and absorbs very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the anti-aging portion; straight from the product description: \\&quot;...</li>
      <li>Really like this 30 SPF lotion.</li>
      <li>I have really nice firm breast</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and the 30 SPF is great.  </li>
      <li>That is a significant percentage of the total quantity.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am happy that the lotion includes SPF, though, but not impressed that the lotion smells exactly like sunscreen to me</li>
      <li>Great product, leave my skin soft and hydrated and it protects from the sun like a regular sunblock without the mess</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so easy to use because you can just push down on the top and get as little or much as you like</li>
      <li>If they can&#x27;t get something this basic right, I wonder about their product quality.</li>
      <li>It is more difficult to obtain a precise quantity.  </li>
      <li>After the bottle stopped dispensing (as if empty), I did indeed rip the top off, and discovered about 1/2&amp;#34; of lotion left at the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines are truly less visible.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the product dispenses easily; sometimes it dispenses in tiny drops; sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dispense at all, but oozes out of the back of the red dispenser top.</li>
      <li>And, very importantly, you can get every last little bit of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>This lotion makes your skin really soft.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin soft all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have mature very dry skin or dry skin this is not a good lotion for you. Will make your skin even drier!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say that I usually love Loreal products but this 1 is a dud. I was happy to try this @ CVS but my excitement was short lived as I noticed that the lotion began to peel off, leaving white flecks. Luckily, you can return beauty products @ CVS w/out any hassle &amp; that&#x27;s just what I did!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years!</li>
    <li> nice cream with SPF in it. love the price</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on so smooth and feels great. Works perfectly under make-up. I am so glad I tried it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This goes on nice and light, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy and absorbs quickly.  SPF30 is perfect and I don&#x27;t have to worry about over exposure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for almost a year now. I hate putting sunscreen on my face, so this is a great alternative. It is not greasy and my makeup goes over it perfectly. A bottle will also last me a while. The only problem is, you don&#x27;t know when it is going to run out, so I always have a back-up for when I think it is getting low.</li>
    <li> I used to love L-Oreal above all other facial products, and was delighted to find this Revitalift daytime cream in the pump style.  BUT -- it is quite heavily scented, so it you have allergies, be forewarned -- watch for the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products.  After 2 days of testing, I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> This is the best, least expensive day lotion on the market - not greasy, an excellent moisturizer under makeup - BUT, I&#x27;ve had a running dialog (via phone) with L&#x27;Oréal about the design of the pump dispenser. Sometimes the product dispenses easily; sometimes it dispenses in tiny drops; sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dispense at all, but oozes out of the back of the red dispenser top. IF L&#x27;Oréal redesigns the dispenser pump, this is the best product, at the best value, available at ANY price - far better than Olay&#x27;s more expensive Pro-X products. What&#x27;s the point of having a good product if you can&#x27;t get it out of the container? I&#x27;ll write a more positive review if/when L&#x27;Oréal improves the design of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, which is more like a cream and great for my dry skin. I use it mostly in the summer (Maryland), as it&#x27;s the perfect weight &amp; coverage and has 30 SPF to boot. Adding just a tad of tinted moisturizer/foundation works well in the evening, too. It&#x27;s small and light enough to throw in my dop kit when traveling -- and I travel for weeks at a time.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal has the most wonderful products.  This item is great for the day time.  It has SPF 30 and is worth the price.  The seller has provided this item to me in a timely manner, packaged the item well and the item was received with no defects.  The lotion glides on the face smoothly and with no greasy feeling.  This item is great for anyone who wants to protect their skin from the elements and feel great about caring for their skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use as a daily moisturizer, despite multiple reviewer warnings about the pump breaking. The lotion does a decent job of moisturizing, but it dispensed less and less lotion until it stopped dispensing altogether. As I hate to waste products, I used a pair of needle-nosed pliers and a thin knife blade to remove the red top (be careful if you decide to try this) and discovered more than an inch of perfectly good moisturizer which I am still using. However, I also discovered a false bottom more than 1/2 way up the dispenser. Shame on the manufacturers of this product for deceptive and defective packaging. No more L&#x27;Oreal for me and I think I will stick with moisturizers in jars where I know I will be able to use what has been purchased.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20 years. Everyone says I have beautiful skin. I love this product. It is the best!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would LOVE to be able to try this product....however, I too am having problems with the dispenser. Received my lotion, took the new bottle out of its packaging, pumped the dispenser top, but not a drop of product dispensed! It&#x27;s one thing to have a product quit working half way through the bottle (and that&#x27;s not good either), but mine didn&#x27;t work from the get-go! I really hate it because I truly like L&#x27;Oreal products and have been excited about trying this new face lotion, but I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing. Now I&#x27;m concerned that even if I get a bottle that dispenses, it will quit working half way through the product. And, let&#x27;s face it, how many of us actually take the time to return a half empty bottle? What a waste of $$! I will be returning this one and opting for something else.</li>
    <li> Really like this 30 SPF lotion. Very light pleasant scent and great coverage. I use it every morning!</li>
    <li> This product appears to be good. I would buy it again. I just wish the container was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the dispenser (yet). I was looking for a non-greasy daytime lotion with SPF. I have very oily skin and most lotions with SPF exacerbate the oiliness. This lotion does still cause more oil than I would prefer. I will probably keep looking for a product. If you do not have oily skin, I believe this product was be worth while.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty great moisturizer. It goes on light and absorbs quickly, and my skin feels like it is becoming smoother and smoother over time. I definitely recommend trying this product, especially ok conjunction with other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for the spring and summer months. It&#x27;s light, non greasy and it smells great! The SPF factor makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great product, leave my skin soft and hydrated and it protects from the sun like a regular sunblock without the mess</li>
    <li> very light - provides some sun protection (not beach worthy but great for daily wear).  I do not wear makeup and this is just perfect for everyday moisturizing</li>
    <li> I use several of the L&#x27;Oreal face products (one at a time, of course), including Age Perfect DAY Cream SPF 15 2.5 oz. , Revitalift Complete (Day) SPF 18 1.7 oz. . and the Age Perfect BB cream 1.7 oz. which puts a little color for winter time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so easy to use because you can just push down on the top and get as little or much as you like and it spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 68, still have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks).  I was really happy to find this SPF 30 product.  The directions say to reapply every 2 hours but I think that is only if you are sweating profusely or swimming.  I only use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> Feels good on. Not greasy. It wore well under makeup. Some products keep you shiny and feel like a mask. This wears well with great protection! Skin looked healthy.</li>
    <li> This really works after just one week I see a difference FAB!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that this is SPF 30 for anytime wear, but the cost is a little steep for the benefits of this cream.</li>
    <li> excellent.  Meets my needs.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and have for 5+ years, it&#x27;s great for your skin and has kept my skin from showing much age.  I&#x27;m 42!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin really soft. I haven&#x27;t really seen a big difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for around 2 months. I have a few minor fine lines I&#x27;ve been trying to diminish. I will finish the bottle and try something different.</li>
    <li> This lotions spreads evenly and absorbs very well.  A little goes a long way and the 30 SPF is great.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have really noticed a change in how my skin bounses back more than it used to. Fine lines are truly less visible. Not gone, but not as bad.</li>
    <li> The lotion?  4 stars.  The bottle?  2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is very nice, with a high SPF.  I am very happy that L&#x27;Oreal came out with an SPF higher than the 18 of its original day lotion.  It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel thick and gunky like some higher-SPF lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bottle, I am at a loss.  The traditional wide pots that L&#x27;Oreal has always used are wonderful.  The lotion is easily accessible.  You can obtain the exact quantity you want.  And, very importantly, you can get every last little bit of the lotion.  Nothing is wasted.  But this pump bottle?  It is more difficult to obtain a precise quantity.  And it is impossible, unless you rip the top off, to get every last bit out before chucking the &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; bottle.  After the bottle stopped dispensing (as if empty), I did indeed rip the top off, and discovered about 1/2&amp;#34; of lotion left at the bottom.  That is a significant percentage of the total quantity.  Please, L&#x27;Oreal, put this lotion in one of the little pots!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking that my wrinkles would be less visible, plus I would have the protection of SPF 30. My wrinkles were less visible and I hope the SPF helps too, but The smell of this product is not good and it is greasy! I have oily skin and when I apply this in the morning, it takes like 15 min for it to get absorbed somehow in my skin.</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be an improvement in skin condition with some reduction in wrinkles with usage of this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It keeps my skin soft all day. Living in California, I want to use sunscreen every day, but could never find anything that didn&#x27;t feel greasy. This is like a dream come true--a firming lotion and sunscreen in one! A bit expensive in drugstores, but affordable on Amazon--and well worth it, as it little dab will do ya. I just bought some for my friend yesterday to make her try it out!</li>
    <li> Have used Avon&#x27;s Anew lifting product for years, but this is actually better. The effects last almost&lt;br /&gt;all day, though it does get weaker after about 3 hours.</li>
    <li> I bought so many products, I forgot I bought this. So it was extra... I had a thought, it was, applying it to my breast. I have really nice firm breast and I&#x27;m in my middle 40&#x27;s. the past years I have applied facial creams to my breast and I do think that has helped them. Anyway, I used this on them and boy, I love the results myself. Try it and see if it does anything for you, you never know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks....  This product came on time if not before....</li>
    <li> I did not have any problems is dispensing this, it works fine, and covers nicely, with a smooth feel, really like it, for the hot desert summers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local department store when looking for an anti-aging face lotion that included sun protection. I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for about a month now, so I feel that&#x27;s long enough to form a reasonable opinion on whether it delivers on its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the anti-aging portion; straight from the product description: \\&quot;...Formulated with fortified Pro-Retinol A to accelerate skin renewal and reduce the number and length of lines and surface wrinkles...\\&quot; In the month that I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed no reduction in lines and surface wrinkles. I realize these things tend to take some time, but in the products I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve found if I&#x27;m going to see any results, I usually see some indication within the first couple of weeks (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, the lines aren&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;deep set\\&quot; yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that the lotion includes SPF, though, but not impressed that the lotion smells exactly like sunscreen to me (it&#x27;s a bit off-putting). I&#x27;ve had several day lotions with the same or higher SPF that did not have this scent. I&#x27;m wondering if I would have gotten the same moisturizing and effect from just purchasing a much less expensive sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found on my skin this lotion has encouraged breakouts, but being I&#x27;ve been using it for only a month, it may be my skin just adjusting to the lotion. All-in-all, I&#x27;ve given it a 3 star, based on the fact that it does moisturize and the SPF would be some form of anti-aging in the long run, but I wouldn&#x27;t bank on any line reduction.</li>
    <li> I have used Revitalift for several years.  I love the fact that it has sun screen built into it.  I am looking forward to the auto delivery option.</li>
    <li> Okay.  This works well, but the pump became stuck shortly after I started using it.  I have to stand up, using the full force of the palm of my hand and body weight to get it to go down and then it squirts the cream out all over the place.  I have finally gone to getting a tiny jar, pumping the mess into my clean hand, and then scraping the cream from my hand to the jar.  I wouldn&#x27;t but this again because of the problem.  Don&#x27;t think it is I either; I had my adult son try pushing it down and he had a terrible time too.</li>
    <li> it goes so well on my oil to combination skin, and it&#x27;s effortless to apply liquid foundation on top of it. absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery of my favorite skin care product!</li>
    <li> Hard to say if this product works if you can&#x27;t get it to squirt out of the container!  What a waste of time and money.If they can&#x27;t get something this basic right, I wonder about their product quality. This product also has a LOT of fragrance that doesn&#x27;t dissipate.</li>
    <li> Love this spf moisturizer.  Makes me feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it under-foundation for a smooth base with wrinkle protection built in.</li>
    <li> I just returned for the 2nd time in the bathroom rinsing my eyes with cold water due to the heavy&lt;br /&gt;fragrance in this facial cream. As far as the moisterizer itself, for an inexpensive brand it goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. Too bad the company feels such a need for strong perfume to be included in their&lt;br /&gt;recipe for an otherwise okay day cream. My eyes are too sensitive for that crap &amp; will be getting a refund&lt;br /&gt;1st thing tomorrow. I&#x27;ll just stick to my usual \\&quot;pro-med\\&quot; cream and alternate with vitamin E oil, although&lt;br /&gt;am still in search of a fabulous day cream out there but will go for a more expensive brand made with&lt;br /&gt;all organic ingredients AND FRAGRANCE FREE for crying out loud. ... The cool water however was utterly&lt;br /&gt;refreshing once I rinsed my wonderful face off gently.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light, works great under my foundation or alone.  Nice smooth texture and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion but the container does not allow for dispensing all of the product inside. I ran out way to fast.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It really works for me.  It is easy to use, and works very well.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
