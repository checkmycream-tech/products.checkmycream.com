      <li>this works as good or better and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been tried many of products, even the good brand from the mall.</li>
      <li>ONLY THING IS THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE A GREAT COLOR SELECTION FOR NAIL ENAMEL AND ITS THE BEST</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Effective removal of nail polish.</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and remove very easy any color , gel or glitter nail polish</li>
      <li>This nail polish remover is not any faster or more effective than  drugstore products even for gel polishes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even takes off glitter polishes with ease and although I haven&#x27;t removed my own gel or shellac with it, I&#x27;m confident that it will get the job done.</li>
      <li>I once used very cheap remover</li>
      <li>Nice sent, not too strong.</li>
      <li>Totally amazing how quickly it removes the polish!</li>

      <li>I like polish lacquer better</li>
      <li>love OPI products and when I have a choice</li>
      <li>SO many polish removers have your house smelling like the remover forever but this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Opi nail lacquers are arguably the best nail polish around, but you can only remove this nail polish using this product.</li>
      <li>It does remove my nail polish for sure, but also the cheapest thing in Wallgreens</li>
      <li>and I find that I can stock up on more product that buying online.  </li>

      <li>I LOVE THEIR STUFF.</li>
      <li>Wow, this stuff works great at removing gel nail polish.</li>
      <li>It is much more kind to your nails than using a pure acetone product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It removes polish easily without an offensive odor.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The best polish remover ever.  Removes glitter polish!  A little goes a long way.  One saturated cotton ball can clean one hand of regular polish.  It takes a little more for glitter.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as i got it and it works good. i received it extremely fast. i would def buy it again!</li>
    <li> Just started doing my own gel mani/pedis at home and I use this for nail polish removal. Good as expected.</li>
    <li> Works great with the Graham Hands Down Soak off wraps. Apply this and wrap for 10 mins and the gel comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> It does remove my nail polish for sure, but also the cheapest thing in Wallgreens does, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I &#x27;ve come across very bad stuff, but the difference between a medium quality nail polish remover house brand and the O.P.I Expert touch is very minimal, what bothers me is the price you pay for it, almost 4 times !, girls it&#x27;s not worth it. I also had some trouble removing very dark nail polish, not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool.Very fast and easy to remove nail lacquer. It&#x27;s my first time using it. I plan to continue use this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Good deal, large size last me a long time. Nice sent, not too strong. Works fantastic takes glitter nail polish off easy...</li>
    <li> Works great for even glitter gel polish! I soaked a 1/4 of a cotton ball with this then did the foil technique. Only took about 5 minutes then I was able to scratch the rest off. If I had waited longer there probably would be no need for scratching but I am impatient .</li>
    <li> This works pretty good at breaking down tough nail polish such as some glitters and liquid sand type finishes and is AMAZING at taking off normal everyday creme polish. So much softer on your skin and nails then using a pure acetone remover but works just as great. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering this. The smell isn&#x27;t so bad either. Definitely a manageable smell for someone who is using it multiple times a week.</li>
    <li> This remover is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; - not any better than Sally Hansen, which is a fraction of the price at the drug store. Worst of all, the bottle leaks terribly - it ruined my closet carpet, and my dresser. I finally just threw out the product because the bottle wouldn&#x27;t stop leaking. I really like OPI polish, but I&#x27;d never buy this remover again.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews here I was hesitant about buying this product because it IS more expensive and if it didn&#x27;t work well then...I wouldn&#x27;t be happy.  However I am VERY pleased as this stuff seems to work more quickly and removes ALL of the gel polish rather than leaving bits and pieces behind.  I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it for others who use gel nails...</li>
    <li> I had a pedicure few weeks back and wanted to get rid of the nail polish they applied. The regular liquid I bought in target didn&#x27;t work, but this product worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I used the first bottle with excellent results and not that much rubbing to get the polish off, however I had to pour it into a yellow jackets nest hole to drown and kill them rather than spend $350 on a service. Alcohol is a cheaper option at $1, but I was out of it. This is my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> I love the product. OPI is the best . I really like the nail polish remover. Love opi. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product! I have gel nails, and this polish remover is amazing; super gentle on both nails AND skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product as a sample. After I used the sample a few times I knew I Had to have it. the best remover I have ever used. The size is such a great value too. I only use OPI nail polish, so I knew it would be a great product. I recommend it to everyone that wants a fast, no stain left kind of remover. They deliver super fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nail polish remover. It&#x27;s a little stronger than cheaper nail polish remover, but I don&#x27;t think enough to make me buy this again. I wanted this for gel nail color. It did take it off, but not after several attempts.</li>
    <li> BEST BRAND OF NAIL PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD. I LOVE THEIR STUFF. GOOD PRICE AND FOUND JUST WHAT I WANTED. ONLY THING IS THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE A GREAT COLOR SELECTION FOR NAIL ENAMEL AND ITS THE BEST THERE IS. DOES NOT CHIP AND FLAKE AND THIS PRODUCT TAKES OFF THE ENAMEL EASILY AND NO MESS</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is the best ever.  I use a favored shade of OPI nail polish and top it off with OPI Lacquer - but had a hard time using other polish removers.  I found this through Amazon and it does the job in no time at all.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Wow! Instead of scrubbing the polish off my nails, it comes off in an easy swipe. It can&#x27;t be good for you, but neither is the polish and some things are worth the small risk!</li>
    <li> This works very well- it takes off layers of polish in one to two swipes if you let it rest on your nail for a few seconds. I can remove the polish off both hands with one cotton pad usually too. So much faster and easier than the drugstore brands. And it smells better!</li>
    <li> great, no complaints, came on time, The rest of this message is to fill in the 20 character requirement, sorry.</li>
    <li> good performance although a regular with acetone would do it</li>
    <li> This may be a hair more expensive than your drug store polish remover, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I wear darker polish and with this stuff, it comes right off.  Only two cotton balls and I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> It gets the nail lacquer off fast and doesn&#x27;t dry my cuticles.  This 16 ounce bottle will last a long time.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish remover, thorough yet gentle on nails! I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Nothing special or faster then pure acetone.</li>
    <li> This remover is used to take gel polish off it works good, but when it was mailed they did not tape the lid and about half of the liquid spilt out.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish remover but for the price I will go back to my beauty supply and see if they will carry this product. Very expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great, but could have purchased just non brand name stuff to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best nail polish remover I have ever used. I won&#x27;t ever buy anything else. The smell is easy to deal with and not strong at all.  SO many polish removers have your house smelling like the remover forever but this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to get my nails done with gel polish but I don&#x27;t always have time to go back and get it removed so after reading reviews I decided to buy this and I&#x27;m thankful I did. I received it just in time because I wanted to remove my gel polish.  I used this with Shellac Remover Wraps and 10 minutes later I was able to get the gel off easily.  Then I decided to try it on my toes, which had just regular polish on them, and it worked great - the polish came right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is - this works great for regular or gel polish removal!!! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Works well on enamel nail polish.</li>
    <li> No matter how little you use - its the most economical! Can remove even BLUE polish...</li>
    <li> Works fast and even removes the hard to get pesky corners with ease. This is a must have for anybody that does their nails.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nail polish remover that wouldn&#x27;t make my nails brittle and dry and this one does the job.</li>
    <li> This removes shellac and lacquer much quicker than using acetone alone.  I use it on my toe nail polishes and it removes the polish in one or two swipes with a cotton ball.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Only remover i use for my gels. i do add heat to my removal makes it easier to get the polish off.</li>
    <li> Save your money! This nail polish remover is not any faster or more effective than  drugstore products even for gel polishes.</li>
    <li> This Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover removes nail polish better than any brand I have found in local stores.  I do not have to use a lot at all to take off my polish and it comes off a lot easier than with other polish removes.  I have only used this to take off regular nail polishes and have not used it with any gel or shellack polish so I cannot speak for that, but I can say if you are looking for a good quality nail polish remover that makes the job a little easier and won&#x27;t damage your nails then give this OPI product a try.</li>
    <li> The is the best nail polish remover ever... I read some reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work on their gel nails, but I have to say that they must have had gel topped acrylic or something because I have had no problem removing any brand of gel I have had on my nails... I just rough up the surface with a coarse file and then use cotton balls and foil to soak them for 10-15 min. Then I use a scrapping tool to get the left over off and it works great, even better than the nail salon using acetone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used on regular polish and it took only two cotton balls, one per hand... Awesome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the smell and damage to your hand is minimal... My fingers are not a dry and scary after using and the smell is mild...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is expensive, but think about the money and time you will save removing your gel nails at home, or only using two cotton balls! Plus your fingers will be less damaged and you will no longer need super expensive cuticle oil or lotion to repair them!</li>
    <li> This remover is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve shared this product with my coworkers and everyone agrees that we would never go back to using the drug store brands we previously used.  This size seems expensive but it is the best value and you use so little to remove the most stubborn polishes that it is well worth it.  One satured cotton ball will remove all ten nails easily.</li>
    <li> For two years, I have used the Gelish remover to soak off my gel manicures. I wanted to try something new after removal had become increasingly difficult. This has a much less harsh odor, and almost has a pleasant scent to it. The removal time was quite quick and didn&#x27;t seem to dry out my cuticles as much.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail polish remover,. It removed this really thick polish I just bought (and hated) with just one wet cotton swab for each foot. Did not leave my cuticles looking dry either.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish remover I have ever used - however, it is a bit drying but worth it because it gets every last bit off (no tinge of color left from darker colors) and I use half the amount of cotton balls/time getting it off!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase and container is a good size.  Removed polish easily and very quickly.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with delivery and how well the product worked.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of everything OPI &amp; this product is my go-to nail polish remover. I paint my nails every week &amp; this is consistent very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bigger bottle size &amp; would definitely purchase again :)</li>
    <li> Works fast and efficient. Great product. Would recommend to anyone. Works well with all other opi products and nail polishes!</li>
    <li> The only problem for gelish nail is removing them.  I once used very cheap remover and it damaged my nails a lot, so I changed to this one.  I guess this one is a little more soft than my previous cheap one, but it still hurts, damages my nails even though it&#x27;s better than my old one.</li>
    <li> Works great and it leaves my nails in great shape. Very economical size.</li>
    <li> After using the drugstore brands and being totally frustrated by their poor performance and rising prices, I decided to give the OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is more expensive, but it is in a much larger bottle.  Enough is dispensed on your cotton round that you are not constantly tipping the bottle back and forth to get the round wet as with other brands. Ultimately, you use less product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes polish easily without an offensive odor.  Discolored polish dried residue from the past also gets picked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simply a superior product!</li>
    <li> works like a dream.  I refilled my daughter&#x27;s and my bottles and it&#x27;s better than buying 2 new small bottles.</li>
    <li> I managed a salon for a while and while we bought acetone by the gallons, it was very drying. I love this product because it works beautifully. As soon as it touches my nail color it comes right off. It&#x27;s even takes off glitter polishes with ease and although I haven&#x27;t removed my own gel or shellac with it, I&#x27;m confident that it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> The best nail polish remover.  Doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.  Takes off the polish cleanly.  Worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> I have not used anyother polish remover since using OPI Remover, it&#x27;s fantastic and does not dry out your nails at all, its a must!!</li>
    <li> The OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover does a great job! works fantastic particularly removing the gel out of my nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many drugstore brands, this one was superior to anyone of them!  The only gripe, I have, is the way it was packed for delivery--unsealed (you could strongly smell the remover) before opening it.  Also, a portion Pfizer product was missing.</li>
    <li> Daughter says: Best nail remover ever. You should totally buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff works great at removing gel nail polish. It does it quickly and easily. A good purchase.</li>
    <li> This polish remover works exactly like you&#x27;d expect it to, but what sets it apart from the others is the smell.  It&#x27;s very nice and not chemically-- sort of like a creamsicle, orange and vanilla-y.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Opi nail lacquers are arguably the best nail polish around, but you can only remove this nail polish using this product. Since two soaking cotton balls are all that are necessary for the ordinary manicure, this bottle will last you forever. Fortunately, it is worth having around that long!</li>
    <li> This is very good for removing all the layers I have on my nails after one week of applying strengthener. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it to soak my shillac nails and remove the gel.  It works fast.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> I met my expectations fully!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It definitely works better/faster than my other removers.  Makes taking litter polish off a little less tedious! Not a miracle but definitely faster!</li>
    <li> I had always used the stuff you can get at WalMart and one day I realized that it took a lot of work to get the red polish off. NOT ANYMORE!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> Removes polish without scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Obviously more expensive than regular drug store brands, but for me, worth it. I have a few polishes that were difficult to remove. This remover solved the problem. It&#x27;s a definite buy!</li>
    <li> This nailpolish remover is really amazing. Every nailpolish disappears so fast. Glitter, liquid sand, pixdiedus, you name it. I never use another nailpolish remover again. Maybe it&#x27;s not cheap, but it really works.</li>
    <li> This polish remover is excellent! I generally use China Glaze or OPI polishes which are great polishes that tend to not ship off. That means they&#x27;re hard to get off. I change my color weekly and normal polish remover just doesn&#x27;t do the job well. It used to take me forever and a lot of cotton pads to remove my color. I just got this remover and used it right away. Totally amazing how quickly it removes the polish! I read some say it stinks. I think it smells exactly like the polish removers you can get at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> I really like this remover</li>
    <li> Great smell and does an excellent job at removing nail polish!!  Does not leave your nails feeling \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; of all oils!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and even went online for tips to make this stuff work. I tried soaking my nails in it, putting it on a cotton ball and letting that sit on my fingers for awhile and nothing.  Granted, it would really really well for normal polish. It works too well on regular polish actually, you need to make sure you wash your hands and nails thoroughly before you try to put new polish on after using it otherwise the new polish will just smear off.</li>
    <li> I ran out of this once and had to use Mabeline.  Nope.  Never again.  I bought the economy size bottle this time.  I&#x27;m not going to run out again.  This stuff is AMAZING, it dissolves polish almost instantly without sticking or causing contact dermatitis. Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage to your nail and remove polish well.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is what I needed but it is - It arrived quickly and worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never wrote any comment but for this one I really wanna share to all who&#x27;s looking for the gentle smell + easy remove . I&#x27;d been tried many of products, even the good brand from the mall. I absolutely like this OPI remover.</li>
    <li> Wonderful..really takes the polish off so that you don&#x27;t have to pay the nail salon to do it. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works really well and the smell is not overwhelming.  Would not use anything else and highly  recommend it to everyone..</li>
    <li> very hard on your nails.  don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> I think this remover removes polish fast and the scent is okay though it has acetone in it. Love it.</li>
    <li> This remover works well for the gel polish products.  Buying it in this size bottle is more cost effective than the smaller bottles available locally.  It is much more kind to your nails than using a pure acetone product.</li>
    <li> Best product, hands down, for removing polish...5 stars !! I have tried many removers and none have worked as quickly or as thoroughly as this product, and my nails have remained strong !! Love it and recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Received this item fast. The bottle is big and will last a long time. It takes gel polish off and doesn&#x27;t have that strong smell others have.  Def worth buying.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It ate through the gel polish and I was able to slide the old polish right off my nails. I use the nail salon method where I wrap my nails with the soaked cotton ball and tinfoil, and it took about three minutes to get the job done. It&#x27;s kind of scary how well it works actually, it must have jet fuel, devil spit or some other evil things in it to work as well as it does, as fast as it does.</li>
    <li> This stuff takes the toughest gel polish off with ease!</li>
    <li> This product works faster than regular polish remover, but it seems a bit harsh on my natural nails when removing gel polish.</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon to take off my gel polish anymore. It&#x27;s super easy to do.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this, but received it as a free gift, so all I am reviewing is the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, a couple of days after my wedding, my nail polish was finally too chipped to wear. I was returning to work for the first time in almost two weeks, and I had a panic moment when I realized that my usual cheap nail polish remover got mixed in with my sisters-in-law&#x27;s stuff like so many other things! Finally I remembered my tiny bottle of this stuff and gave it a try. I was in a bind, having lost time trying to dig and find my other remover, so I must say I was blown away with how well this stuff works, and I believe I saved a lot of time in using this rather than my cheap-o stuff. I had multiple coats of polish since I got them done at a nail salon, and OPI Expert Touch whisked it all away. It didn&#x27;t smell as bad, and worked much better, than any remover I&#x27;ve ever had. FYI-I was using a cotton pad with only a small dab of remover per long fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works great and leaves your nails feeling conditioned.</li>
    <li> Great value, the best remover on the market</li>
    <li> Great price was great.</li>
    <li> Works faster and more consistently than any other acetone nail polish remover I&#x27;ve tried on my lacquer polished nails.  A must have for Lacquer polish!</li>
    <li> I recently got the sephora by opi gel nail kit and I was looking for a good acetone. A lot of the brands I researched seemed extremely harsh, and being that my nails are weak and brittle to begin with, I didn&#x27;t want to make them worse. I really like this nail lacquer remover. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other brands, but the quality is great, can&#x27;t go wrong with opi, especially through amazon!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and they say that it works on Gel nails, hence I was eager to try it out. I soak a cotton ball and wrap it in foil. It took only a little off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side is the remover does not have a very strong acetone smell.</li>
    <li> This is the only nails list remover I will ever use. The smell doesn&#x27;t stink up the whole house, nor does it give me a raging headache. It takes off stubborn glitter polish or dark, staining polish easily without drying out my nails or fingers. Get the big bottle and decant into a smaller bottle for every day usage.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Take the gel polish off better than the pure acetone I ordered.</li>
    <li> OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover is wonderful, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it remove the lacquer very easy.</li>
    <li> What a total waste of money.  Because it is labeled &amp;#34;Expert Touch Lacquer Remover&amp;#34; I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; that it removes nail lacquer.  WELL it does NOT remove nail lacquer.  What a disappointment.  It doesnt have any impact on the lacquer ... the lacquer is good as new even after soaking in this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just two cotton balls of this remover will completely clean 3 coats of OPI lacquer off of all my fingernails AND toenails. With the drugstore brand I used to use, I would need at LEAST 4 or 5 to do that job. This remover leaves the nails clean without drying them out, and without leaving a greasy residue. Now that I&#x27;ve tried this remover, I will never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. I had been using regular nail polish remover to take off my OPI Polish, what a hassle. Using this is a breeze and it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad.</li>
    <li> I liked the smaller one so much I got the larger size. It works fast no matter how dark the polish. Even with multiple layers  of color.</li>
    <li> Big size , very gentile on my nails have nice smell&lt;br /&gt;and remove very easy any color , gel or glitter nail polish</li>
    <li> Product as described, No complains</li>
    <li> exceeds the quality of drug store brands, price is good.  i&#x27;ve tried a lot including butter london, zoya, etc...this works as good or better and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> 30 seconds or less to get the gel/nail polish off! ANNNNNNNNNND the smell is so mild. ANNNNNNNND it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails. Good product, will order again.</li>
    <li> I only use OPI Lacquer Remover because it is quick and does not damage my nails.  I misplaced my refill bottle and had to use another brand...never again!  The other brand simply cannot compare to OPI!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite polish remover! I apply a coat of Nailtuques 2 over my polish every other day. This product removes the many layers in no time. My 85-year-old mother also loves the product.  My beauty store only sell the 6 oz size. Buying the 16 oz size from Amazon is a better financial deal.</li>
    <li> Great product but I find that the polish remover in the drug stores is just as good as this product and I find that I can stock up on more product that buying online.  That is hard for me to say because I buy a lot online.</li>
    <li> Effective removal of nail polish. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I have a couple bottles of different removers and this is the only one being used now.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome....  Gets glitter off and conditions your nails. Doesn&#x27;t strip them.  I get the 32 ounce and refill this size with it using a funnel.</li>
    <li> I like polish lacquer better</li>
    <li> Bought this to remove my shellac as I am normally not patient enough to let it soak off and normally peel it off and ruin my nails.  This worked great I put some on a cotton ball, wrapped in foil and with about 5 minutes I took them out and it just scrapped off.</li>
    <li> Works great. Low odor.  Non drying.  Definitely recommend for a lil more money well worth it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, light smell and conditions nails.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Very fast and with very little effort.  I tried the 4 oz. to see if it worked, because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than Cutex.  Works great!  Buy the 16 ounce size and save money.  It will probably last me for a few years.</li>
    <li> The price went up since I bought this but it is a big bottle so it will last me a long time. (aside from the fact that I will need to get another bottle for my other home as I can&#x27;t take this on a airplane) I am not happy about the price increase but I really do love the remover. It makes my nails not smell and it not as harsh on my hands. Takes everything off really fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I love OPI products and when I have a choice it is all I use. The bottle will last you a really long time and IMO worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This work great and very well priced. Using OPI nail colour you definitely need their nail lacquer remover. I will be ordering again.</li>
