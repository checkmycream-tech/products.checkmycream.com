      <li>, I repeat had beautiful hair until now!</li>
      <li>I bought this product and used it about a month ago - followed every direction perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about six years and , for me , this is the best hair straightening I ever used.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>Thinking that maybe prime members ought to have better deals even though we get great deal on shipping.</li>
      <li>In April 2011, I scheduled my first appointment for a Brazilian Blowout and the results were so incredible that I received two more: one in October &#x27;11,</li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Processing times differ so be sure to consult the directions.  </li>
      <li>you use this straightener correctly on healthy hair</li>
      <li>This worked okay after about 2 or 3 uses or so.  </li>
      <li>you may have to use it more often.  </li>
      <li>love to have.</li>
      <li>After many leave in conditioners nothing will be able to restore the damage that this product has done.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist is amazed at how healthy my hair is.  </li>
      <li>I found that it works better if you finger comb the product through your hair in the manner</li>
      <li>It is about $50 every three months, but I feel that it helps me to work better on my job.  </li>
      <li>You will see results, maybe more on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I suggest it for fine hair (it will decrease your volume though).</li>
      <li>In the 70&#x27;s I used a product called curl free.  </li>
      <li>After treating my hair with this product I see frizz free results for 4-6 weeks, an amount of time that I consider to be an accomplishment when using a drugstore</li>
      <li>for one am very thankful for this affordable product that has saved me so many hours of straightening with the iron and that has made me a lot more comfortable with my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way it came out nice and straight, for the first time in my life</li>
      <li>Have had curly hair all my life (loose curls) and would see ladies on tv with nice flowing smooth hair and think why didnt God bless me with that kind of hair, used a straightener before and my hair was like straw.</li>
      <li>After using Ogilvie, I just had to make sure it dries straight by brushing it...</li>
      <li>The product is great and really worked for my wife not for just a week or two but for the entire summer.</li>
      <li>Everyone looks better with their natural texture, anyway!</li>
      <li>When I use a straight iron it stays smooth even when it is humid.  </li>
      <li>I have found that each time I use it, the processing time changes and since the product is good for up to one hour, I will process for 5-8 minutes the first time, let my hair dry</li>
      <li>Right now, it has been 3 days since I straightened my hair</li>
      <li>I followed all of the instructions exactly as they were written, but in the end my hair is about twice as frizzy and not straightened at all.</li>
      <li>my hair is still pretty curly.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly, leaving it on for the minimum amount of time.</li>
      <li>but my hair looks only a tid bit better.</li>
      <li>At that point in time I had already tried all of the drugstore brand straightening treatments and had had mediocre, at best, results.  </li>
      <li>I would love to grow my hair longer, but everyone knows whose grown hair long, you get those in-between stages where you absolutly cannot do anything with your hair.  </li>
      <li>I get better results from John Frieda Straight Answer Shampoo (warning: the shampoo does DRY the hair).  </li>
      <li>and if it isn&#x27;t as straight as I prefer, then do the process again for another 5-8 minutes</li>
      <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t make my hair completely straight it takes away the bushy, out of control</li>
      <li>My hair seems to get knotted much easier now</li>
      <li>My hair is curly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry and very delicated.</li>
      <li>very please.</li>
      <li>Since my hair is very frizzy and curly, I did not expect my hair to end pin straight, but I did hope to see some improvement.</li>
      <li>The cost of a Brazilian Blowout, however, soon became too much - I just could not justify spending $250+ to have my 4\\&quot; below shoulder length, wavy, coarse hair free of frizz and more or less poker straight for 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I am really happy because I only take a bat and do not have to use the iron, only towel dry then comb and my hair stay as straight as I allways</li>
      <li>My hair is completely straight when I get out of the shower, but once it dries, it is wavy (curls are much looser) and the frizz is completely gone.  </li>
      <li>The creme itself is thick and applies easily; use the provided comb to comb the product through your hair, making sure it stays as straight as possible.  </li>
      <li>Now I am keeping my hair short to quickly grow out</li>
      <li>you would normally wear your hair.  </li>
      <li>I follow the directions on the product except I don&#x27;t comb the hair straight as it suggests because your hair will dry exactly like you combed it straight which goes against your normal way of styling your hair.  </li>
      <li>Other thing I like is that now my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Hairs in my back that had grown to the middle of my back was trimmed off my a professional at Fantastic Sams ...</li>
      <li>My hair fell out and since I have short hair I don&#x27;t have much to cut off.</li>
      <li>With a BB I was able to wash my hair each morning, blow dry or let it air dry and encounter the same results:</li>
      <li>I only lost a little bit of hair during the actual \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; process, but I will lose a lot more now if I force a brush through.</li>
      <li>and I would like to color it and get rid of major blond and gray streaks, but am concerned about the hair dye causing the straintener to come undone.</li>
      <li>Thought will try this one time on sides and back that way if falls out will have some on top, seriously.</li>
      <li>but you need to make sure you do not comb too long and too hard as you will lose hair at the scalp.</li>
      <li>Now I can feel a lot of short stubble if I run my hands through my hair near my scalp.</li>
      <li>But nothing worth the trouble of brushing on the product, washing it and brushing, etc.. etc... etc.  </li>
      <li>My hair seems slightly straighter, but it did absolutely nothing for the frizz.</li>

<li> I have straight hair that is medium (not fine or coarse).  </li>
<li> /&gt;Not long after I made the decision to stop the BB, I came across Ogilvie&#x27;s Hair Straightening for All Hair Types while browsing my local drugstore.  </li>
<li> I find I can just keep my hair pressed flat with my hands once the product gets sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Step one is to shampoo your hair, towel dry and apply a moderate amount of the (provided) leave in conditioner.  </li>
<li> (it&#x27;s long</li>
<li> once to my shoulders and then about 1 to 2 inches long all over my head:...</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make sense to grow my hair long as it shrinks and kinks when it dries</li>
<li> How I managed to skip over this treatment for so long</li>
<li> You WILL need help if you have long hair!    </li>
<li> And the application is a pain in the butt for very long hair like mine.  </li>
<li> It tends to dry the ends up.  </li>
<li> and my ends are dry and damaged (going to have to cut them off soon).</li>
<li> I lost so much hair and what hair i have left is either broken off or severely damaged.  </li>
<li> So far the one I order online through Amazon...uses all organic products and my hair has grown in the past couple of years or so that I have been on the product.  </li>
<li> I have not had any issues with hair loss or damage but do notice a small amount of dryness which I ensure I deep condition on a weekly basis and use the Infusium 23 leave in conditioner daily.  </li>
<li> I did notice damage but not much of anything else.  </li>
<li> When you use it, be careful on the ends.  </li>
<li> So tell me why I would waste shipping charges to almost double my cost?</li>
<li> Also leave in the minimal amount of time.  </li>
<li> in mind that when using this product you cannot wash your hair for 48 hours but unlike other products, you CAN wet your hair.  </li>
<li> From the other reviews, it sounds like this product will work for some people, but it did not for me.</li>
<li> I realized that once the product starts to dry, STOP COMBING!!!  </li>
<li> I have thick, coarse and frizzy hair which gets kinkier</li>
<li> Laid down, slept on it and got up</li>
<li> I have been using this product for about 4 years and it does wonders for my hair which is thick, coarse and naturally tightly curled.  </li>
<li> since i had previously permed hair, i was terrified to leave it in for longer than 5 minutes</li>
<li> I can get this product at Wal-mart for a little over $8.00.</li>
<li> I pull tight on the areas I want to be straighter which is usually at the nape of the neck area.  </li>
<li> Otherwise your hair will begin to stretch and break, usually at the scalp.</li>
<li> I use this product every 3-4 months for the past 3 years.  </li>
<li> This was so quick(but very messy)</li>
<li> To me, the smell was not as bad as many people say; just about as bad as any hair coloring kit smells.</li>
<li> I used this kit to try to at least get some of the frizz out of my hair.</li>
<li> Sometimes I am in rush and always was late for that reasson.</li>
<li> It was too difficult to put it on ... just not worth it.</li>
<li> I also cannot understand why my hair is growing so slowly!  </li>
<li> All it did was make it stink really bad, Damaged my ends, made my hair really dry and stripped the color out of my hair!!!!</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product should be taken off the market!!!!! I had, I repeat had beautiful hair until now! I am devastated! I lost so much hair and what hair i have left is either broken off or severely damaged.  I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product once. I did it by myself but I don&#x27;t see any difference from the way it was before. I have short curly hair. I was nervous using it so I probably didn&#x27;t use enough of the product in my hair because I had a lot left over. I may give it a try again later.</li>
    <li> This worked okay after about 2 or 3 uses or so.  Then my hair broke off.  Hairs in my back that had grown to the middle of my back was trimmed off my a professional at Fantastic Sams ...once to my shoulders and then about 1 to 2 inches long all over my head:...The burn did not affect my scalp(/  Now, I use Keratin straightener which was advised through a former co-worker through University of Phoenix Online.  So far the one I order online through Amazon...uses all organic products and my hair has grown in the past couple of years or so that I have been on the product.  It is about $50 every three months, but I feel that it helps me to work better on my job.  Curly hair can do some styles.....</li>
    <li> I used this kit to try to at least get some of the frizz out of my hair. Since my hair is very frizzy and curly, I did not expect my hair to end pin straight, but I did hope to see some improvement. To me, the smell was not as bad as many people say; just about as bad as any hair coloring kit smells. I followed all of the instructions exactly as they were written, but in the end my hair is about twice as frizzy and not straightened at all. I also cannot brush my hair because the brush will not go through parts of my hair without ripping out the hair. I only lost a little bit of hair during the actual \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; process, but I will lose a lot more now if I force a brush through. From the other reviews, it sounds like this product will work for some people, but it did not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it about a month ago - followed every direction perfectly. My hair seems slightly straighter, but it did absolutely nothing for the frizz. My hair seems to get knotted much easier now and my ends are dry and damaged (going to have to cut them off soon). But the worst part is that it made me lose A LOT of hair. When I was using the product, I noticed a lot of hair falling out. Now I can feel a lot of short stubble if I run my hands through my hair near my scalp. Obviously the product made lots of my hair fall out or break off. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I use it regularily. But sellers need to get a grip. I can get this product at Wal-mart for a little over $8.00. So tell me why I would waste shipping charges to almost double my cost? Thinking that maybe prime members ought to have better deals even though we get great deal on shipping.</li>
    <li> This product damaged my hair badly. I followed the instructions exactly, leaving it on for the minimum amount of time. Now I am keeping my hair short to quickly grow out all the split ends. I think that women should just accept their hair the way it is. Everyone looks better with their natural texture, anyway!</li>
    <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT ON SAT. NITE BY SUN. MORNING MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT BY THE HANDFULLS!!! WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six years and , for me , this is the best hair straightening I ever used. My hair is curly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry and very delicated. So I need a product that could&#x27;nt deteriorate my hair and this is the ONE. In PR I could&amp;#34;nt find a place to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it so I went to Amazon. Two weeks ago I used the product and Iam very please. I recomend it !!!!</li>
    <li> This product damaged my hair. My hair fell out and since I have short hair I don&#x27;t have much to cut off. A friend told me about this product. I think it should be removed forever. I followed the directions properly and wish I never used it. After many leave in conditioners nothing will be able to restore the damage that this product has done. I literally bought a wig to wear until my hair grows out. Do not buy</li>
    <li> este producto resuelto mi pelo abundante y rizado,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0009XAHV0 Ogilvie Hair Straightening Treatment for All Hair Types 1 application]] en el principio era más gruesa,&lt;br /&gt; luego se lava con 2 días, mejor. Me gustó mucho.&lt;br /&gt;seguir comprando.</li>
    <li> Hi! Maybe 3 wheeks ago I bought theOGILVIE HAIR STRAIGHTENING because my hair is so curly and freezze, after washing I have to use iron and was so damage. Sometimes I am in rush and always was late for that reasson. Now I am really happy because I only take a bat and do not have to use the iron, only towel dry then comb and my hair stay as straight as I allways love to have. Other thing I like is that now my hair is smooth and shiny. The product is very easy to use and only take me 10 minutes, is excellent!!  Ann Villalobos</li>
    <li> In April 2011, I scheduled my first appointment for a Brazilian Blowout and the results were so incredible that I received two more: one in October &#x27;11, the second in April &#x27;12.  The cost of a Brazilian Blowout, however, soon became too much - I just could not justify spending $250+ to have my 4\\&quot; below shoulder length, wavy, coarse hair free of frizz and more or less poker straight for 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long after I made the decision to stop the BB, I came across Ogilvie&#x27;s Hair Straightening for All Hair Types while browsing my local drugstore.  At that point in time I had already tried all of the drugstore brand straightening treatments and had had mediocre, at best, results.  How I managed to skip over this treatment for so long I will never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it provide BB results?  No, it doesn&#x27;t.  With a BB I was able to wash my hair each morning, blow dry or let it air dry and encounter the same results: no frizz at all for a time span of up to 10 weeks.  However, Ogilvie&#x27;s treatment is absolutely similar.  After treating my hair with this product I see frizz free results for 4-6 weeks, an amount of time that I consider to be an accomplishment when using a drugstore product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is extremely simple.  Step one is to shampoo your hair, towel dry and apply a moderate amount of the (provided) leave in conditioner.  Comb hair, divide into 4 sections, put on the (provided) gloves and apply the straightening creme.  The creme itself is thick and applies easily; use the provided comb to comb the product through your hair, making sure it stays as straight as possible.  Processing times differ so be sure to consult the directions.  Rinse hair for 7 minutes then apply the neutralizer.  Let this remain on your hair for 5 minutes then rinse for 5 minutes.  Viola!  You&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that when using this product you cannot wash your hair for 48 hours but unlike other products, you CAN wet your hair.  I do so each morningand evening, after which I apply the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a drugstore brand, definitely give this product a try!</li>
    <li> I used this product maybe two months ago.  I have straight hair that is medium (not fine or coarse).  I wanted to use it to remove frizz and the necessity to straighten it (it&#x27;s long so it dries in waves).  I did notice damage but not much of anything else.  I get better results from John Frieda Straight Answer Shampoo (warning: the shampoo does DRY the hair).  After using Ogilvie, I just had to make sure it dries straight by brushing it... but my hair looks only a tid bit better. I also cannot understand why my hair is growing so slowly!  I always have a haircut once a year and this year I have no need for it--- the straightener was the only thing that changed in my hair routine.      When you use it, be careful on the ends.  It tends to dry the ends up.  And the application is a pain in the butt for very long hair like mine.  You WILL need help if you have long hair!    I will not use it again.  It was too difficult to put it on ... just not worth it. :)  Now I am looking for a product to get rid of the damage.    You will see results, maybe more on fine hair.  But nothing worth the trouble of brushing on the product, washing it and brushing, etc.. etc... etc.  I suggest it for fine hair (it will decrease your volume though).</li>
    <li> Have had curly hair all my life (loose curls) and would see ladies on tv with nice flowing smooth hair and think why didnt God bless me with that kind of hair, used a straightener before and my hair was like straw. Thought will try this one time on sides and back that way if falls out will have some on top, seriously. This was so quick(but very messy) so have some plastic for under your chair. I love the way it came out nice and straight, for the first time in my life I love my hair, hear you can buy this at Walmart but got it cheaper here. Laid down, slept on it and got up it looked the same. I read the review where the one person said chunks fell out but I process my hair, do the roots once a month so I would just say don&#x27;t leave in overtime. And I have nothing to do with these sellers.</li>
    <li> I use this product every 3-4 months for the past 3 years.  I have thick, coarse and frizzy hair which gets kinkier the longer it gets.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to grow my hair long as it shrinks and kinks when it dries so cute haircuts disappear.  I follow the directions on the product except I don&#x27;t comb the hair straight as it suggests because your hair will dry exactly like you combed it straight which goes against your normal way of styling your hair.  I found that it works better if you finger comb the product through your hair in the manner you would normally wear your hair.  I pull tight on the areas I want to be straighter which is usually at the nape of the neck area.  I have found that each time I use it, the processing time changes and since the product is good for up to one hour, I will process for 5-8 minutes the first time, let my hair dry and if it isn&#x27;t as straight as I prefer, then do the process again for another 5-8 minutes but I never exceed the recommended 20 minutes.  If you are concerned with damaging your hair, use Infusium 23 leave in conditioner prior to using the product. I have not had any issues with hair loss or damage but do notice a small amount of dryness which I ensure I deep condition on a weekly basis and use the Infusium 23 leave in conditioner daily.  My hair stylist is amazed at how healthy my hair is.  My hair is completely straight when I get out of the shower, but once it dries, it is wavy (curls are much looser) and the frizz is completely gone.  I would love to grow my hair longer, but everyone knows whose grown hair long, you get those in-between stages where you absolutly cannot do anything with your hair.  This product can help eliminate that, but....you may have to use it more often.  Right now, it has been 3 days since I straightened my hair and I would like to color it and get rid of major blond and gray streaks, but am concerned about the hair dye causing the straintener to come undone.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t work well for me. since i had previously permed hair, i was terrified to leave it in for longer than 5 minutes (this is the box&#x27;s specified time). my hair is still pretty curly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years and it does wonders for my hair which is thick, coarse and naturally tightly curled.  Though it doesn&#x27;t make my hair completely straight it takes away the bushy, out of control feeling that I always had before.  When I use a straight iron it stays smooth even when it is humid.  When my hair was longer I did have a bit of damage, but only once.  I realized that once the product starts to dry, STOP COMBING!!!  Otherwise your hair will begin to stretch and break, usually at the scalp. I find I can just keep my hair pressed flat with my hands once the product gets sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I for one am very thankful for this affordable product that has saved me so many hours of straightening with the iron and that has made me a lot more comfortable with my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is great and really worked for my wife not for just a week or two but for the entire summer.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product it did not straighten my hair!! All it did was make it stink really bad, Damaged my ends, made my hair really dry and stripped the color out of my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> In the 70&#x27;s I used a product called curl free.  The ingredients in Ogilvie are virtually the same.  This product works well but you need to make sure you do not comb too long and too hard as you will lose hair at the scalp. Also leave in the minimal amount of time.  One of the ingredients is still used today to remove hair from animal hides in leather processing.&lt;br /&gt;The chemical softens the hair and hair shaft and changes the texture.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this straightener correctly on healthy hair you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.  Do not use on overly processed, brittle hair or you will lose some.  It does tend to lighten the color a bit as well.</li>
