<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and have bad reactions to Purell and other brands of hand sanitizer.  This stuff has not given me any skin issues so far BUT I really don&#x27;t like the smell!  It smells like eucalyptus and thyme, in a bad way.  I would NOT order this scent again.</li>
    <li> I cannot really say a lot about this product except that I liked the whole idea of it being all-natural and the price was excellent for the amount of product that I got.  I actually sent this product with several others out to Utah to the Best Friends Sanctuary.  They are a no kill animal sanctuary that takes care of all animals including many dogs and cats.  The work they do is wonderful and they sent a &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34; list out with their newsletter and they needed hand sanitizer and this seemed the best because they needed something without fragrance and would be kind to their hands and to the animals.</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer and the fact that it is natural.  I know some reviewers are complaining about a chemical type smell but this is a foam cleaner much different than the typical gel. There is a faint odor which disappears in seconds.  One bottle lasts very long time so it actually is a value.  I recommend giving it a little shake on occasion which seems to keep it more foamy</li>
    <li> Very strong &amp;#34;medical/bitter&amp;#34; smell</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer!  I used to buy it at a major health food store, but haven&#x27;t been able to buy it lately.  I&#x27;m glad to have found it here!</li>
    <li> The product is gentle and good but the pump broke pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I love that this hand sanitizer is foamy. It makes it nicer to rub in. I keep this in my bathroom because my kids are much more likely to use this than to wash their hands (although I encourage the latter, but I&amp;#34;ll take what I can get).</li>
    <li> Works great, just wish they had their citrus sent in these larger pumps.</li>
    <li> I am really very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  Lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice natural hand sanitizer.  Very strong odor but I do not mind it.</li>
    <li> I liked it but then found out that there are some chemicals in Clean Well products. Its taughted as natural. The soap has petrochemicals in it too. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> smells good and no chemicals. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really getting rid of bacteria the way purel does, really I have no way of knowing that. But it&#x27;s chemical free, so, no harm done. i keep one in my car and one in my bathroom and use it after hand washing for a little extra clean.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my car and use it frequently. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue or have an unpleasant smell like some other products I have used. I love using this on my kids&#x27; hands instead of the alcohol sanitizer (which I still carry with me, but dries out our skin if used too much) or the chemical-containing wipes (which I do still use sometimes). Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> +Great for daily use&lt;br /&gt;+Easy dispense&lt;br /&gt;+Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside? It has a very strong lemon scent.  I prefer odorless sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Cleanwell hand sanitizer is phenomenal! It&#x27;s got a fresh clean scent, does not dry out your hands and has no sticky or slimy residue. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the portable hand-spray from Cleanwell (we also use the organic one from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as well). I use this in my 5th grade classroom - where I only distribute organic candy as rewards, and use Method, Cleanwell, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and Seventh Generation products for cleaning and sanitizing.    This product is a bit runny and it seems like your hands will be wet (much wetter than traditional hand sanitizer), but it does dry after about 10 seconds. I just told my students they have to wait 10 seconds instead of 1 second.     Still, I prefer the hand-spray from Cleanwell, but I will probably continue to get both, since the hand pump is much more convenient for cleaning up a lot of hands after a science lab.</li>
    <li> With new babies at home, we definitely wanted to put hand sanitizer in prominent locations around our house.  In fact, we have a sign on our front door asking our visitors to clean their hands immediately upon entering our house.  My wife and I now clean and sanitize our hands a lot for our newborns&#x27; sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this much usage, alcohol-based sanitizers were just not going to work for us.  Even the ones that claim to have \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; in their formulation seem to dry my sensitive skin quickly with use, and here it would get a lot of use!  We also like the foaming type product, so we looked for a product that is both alcohol-free and foaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one met our requirements well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some here have commented on or even complained about a smell from the product.  This is not something that I had noticed, so let&#x27;s see.  Yup, there is some sort of smell to it.  I don&#x27;t find it at all objectionable, though.  I might describe it as a faint \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; or \\&quot;pine\\&quot; type smell, but would stop far short of calling it any sort of odor - in a way, it just smells clean.  Which is good after dispatching yet another fully-loaded diaper into the [[ASIN:B001BMWABI Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t enter into the ongoing debate about the natural chemicals used to sanitize in this and similar alcohol-free products.  I read these debates and did my own research prior to purchase, and still bought this product.  If you prefer to sanitize with alcohol, those products work quite well also and I would expect that you would not have read this review anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3-pack of these came in really handy in our house.  We have one right inside our front door for visitors to use, one with our downstairs diaper-changing area, and one upstairs in the nursery right on the changing station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these run out, we&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> good stuff.  effective and \\&quot;green\\&quot; and better for your skin and body, et al than the \\&quot;usual\\&quot; stuff purchased at walgreens, walmart, etc.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Cleanwell brand and use their soaps and spray hand sanitizer regularly. This was my first hand sanitizer foam pump purchase. It does the job as far as I can tell, but the only drawbacks for me are: scent and the occasional pump that sprays really far past my hands. I got the unscented version to be safe for hands holding a new baby, but it still seems to have some type of odor that&#x27;s not super great. Overall it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to quit using it, but I might purchase a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> I love Cleanwell products. Ever since I found them more than a year ago, I&#x27;ve used everything they make, including their co-products with Seventh Generation. I used to have terrible allergies whenever I cleaned anything with chemical cleaners and now they are all gone. My skin is also far less irritated from using Cleanwell cleaners and hand-sanitizers. I even use the hand-sanitizer to clean my makeup brushes gently.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but doesn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
    <li> I love my CleanWell sanitizer! 1-2 pumps and my hands are germ-free but not dried out, thanks to the absence of alcohol. The foam does not leave any funky residue on my hands like alcohol-based sanitizers with added moisturizers. I like the idea that the active ingredients are plant-based. A bottle on my desk lasts for months.</li>
    <li> So says the hubby... he won&#x27;t use it because it reminds him of Thanksgiving and every time I use it... he&#x27;ll say that he smells a turkey... &#x3D;)  I like how it foams and I feel like I&#x27;m getting my hands cleaned.  I don&#x27;t like how sometimes I feel like I need 2 squirts instead of 1.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s me... I feel that it doesn&#x27;t always give the exact same amount every time you press on the pump.  Sometimes, it&#x27;s the right amount, sometimes it&#x27;s way too much and sometimes it&#x27;s not enough.  I gave it four stars because I like how environmentally friendly it is and most important... baby friendly!  I am hoping that they will make the orange scent into this pump format because their sprays suck!  You need to spray your hands like 3-4 times... what a waste.</li>
    <li> I could not use this. It smelled disgusting.</li>
    <li> We use this a lot with a child in the home.  Lots of germs...we feel better using natural thyme to sanitize instead of who knows what petrochemical.</li>
    <li> Product works well enough but the smell is pretty strong.  If you want a product with a woody smell this is for you.  It gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can throw this in my bag or leave it in car. It gives a nice lather for the kids to scrub away at.</li>
    <li> Great product. It cleans with a gentle scent and doesn&#x27;t burn sensitive or cracked skin. Being alcohol free, it&#x27;s great for the kids, too. We have travel sizes for the diaper bag and the big one for the car.</li>
    <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands the way alcohol based ones do. your hands remain pretty soft. this is especially helpful for the winter or if you are handling baby, which I am. (we bought one for the nursery, one for our room and one for the house - the pack of 3 is useful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things you have to get used to. (1) Unlike alcohol based sanitizers, they feel like water on your hands and you have to just let this dry. It helps to keep rubbing.... but t doesnt just evaporate the way alcohol based ones do. (2) the scent/smell. the Thyme is an acquired scent and has propensity to smell like moth balls but it is layered with lemon which takes the blend to a palatable level. I don&#x27;t mind it - it disappears quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as an AFFORDABLE alternative sanitizer</li>
    <li> We  have been using the product for 3-4 years and are happy that it is natural and contains no alcohol.  We are unhappy that the wall mount units are no longer available and that the refills for the units are also not available.  We have about 20 of them installed in our clinic and now have no way of refilling them.</li>
    <li> smells a bit too natural for me, but like the foaming natural antibacterialness</li>
    <li> I like the product, I like that it&#x27;s the foaming kind.  However I do not like the scent,  it really doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong smelling cleaners, you won&#x27;t like this stuff. No one at this house liked it, either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hands soapy,smell bad, or dry out. Great product for the cost. I would recommend this product for any office or home.</li>
    <li> Good product that won&#x27;t burn scrapes and sensitive areas like the alcohol gel.  Good travel companion for motor trips or camping.</li>
    <li> I do not care for this product. The smell is quite strong and not particularly pleasant. Also, it barely foams. I bought three bottles and they all squirt out a liquid, only slightly foamy product. It runs quickly off your hands and is especially difficult for children to use. I much prefer Babyganics foaming sanitizer.</li>
    <li> My kids love using this because it doesn&#x27;t sting their hands  or nose.  I like that there&#x27;s no leftover sticky feeling or residue.  I like the smell too, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering and I&#x27;m accused of being smell sensitive by my husband :)  My mother liked these so much she asked me to buy some for her house!  Would recommend and buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this hand sanitizer! It lasts a long time, dries quickly and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t sting my daughter&#x27;s hands so she isn&#x27;t afraid to use it often. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and non-toxic. I have them all around the house since we now have 2 puppies.</li>
    <li> Wow--this smells really strange--no bad...just strange! Can&#x27;t get used to the smell--would not buy again.</li>
    <li> So, the major caveat for me is that I couldn&#x27;t find any evidence that this stuff actually sanitizes your hands (i.e. 99.999% bacterial death/removal). Assuming that the product works as claimed (yikes!) it is quite nice. The scent is not harsh like alcohol cleaners, just a very mild thyme scent that can only be smelled when your hands are near your face. During cleaning, your hands will be sticky for 30 seconds to a minute or so, but that goes away. Does not dry your hands out. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to alcohol based cleaners.</li>
    <li> I know the thyme is the active ingredient in this hand sanitzer.  I made the mistake of thinking that they would try to cover up that scent.  If you like the smell of thyme you&#x27;ll love this.  I couldn&#x27;t take the smell and gave the bottles away to someone with a less sensative nose.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  We have it in storage at moment and haven&#x27;t used anything out of bottle yet.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does not dry out hands or leave an odor. Perfect for a healthcare setting. Lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible! Package arrived leaky also. I wanted hand sanitizer around the house after having a baby - but this stuff smelled so bad I didn&#x27;t want it used around the baby!</li>
    <li> I have recently switched over to buying all non-toxic cleaning supplies, hand soap, shampoo&#x27;s, lotions, and now non-toxic hand sanitizer. This product has a nice smell and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on your hands. It has not dried my hands out at all. I&#x27;ve made it through the cold season while working in a doctors office with no illness. It works!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite countertop hand sanitizer. We really like the herb-based oil used as a hand sanitizer in CleanWell&#x27;s product line, and this foaming dispenser does its job just right. The foam disperses well without being messy. Just one small little pump is all it takes, helping the contents last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Its a sanitizer but it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. I wanted this larger one for in my car and husbands car. I carry the small one in my purse . This is really great. I showed it to my doctor now he is using it too.</li>
    <li> This seems to last so long.  Love the foam.</li>
    <li> Nice sanitizer - wish it dried a little quicker.</li>
    <li> Love this product. We&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now, and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out like the other stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This smells terrible. I had to wash it off. Sending this back.</li>
    <li> Hands were getting cracked and itchy from alcohol based sanitizer at work.  This does not sting or cause my skin to break down. I keep it with me thoughout my work shift.</li>
    <li> Alcohol-based sanitizers are nice n&#x27; all, but you should really consider switching to this variety to spare your skin from that harsh stringency.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Lasted a long time and just reordered</li>
    <li> It smelling like rotten eggs. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not full of chemicals and has a natural smell plus one container lasts forever.  I don&#x27;t feel completely guilty using this with my infant when I need a quick sanitizer without water.</li>
    <li> Pros: Smells decent (for sanitizer), foam is better for little ones (the gel kind slides off my daughters hands before she gets a chance to rub her hands together), and all-natural (most important)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price can go up and down a lot on amazon, but with subscribe and save it&#x27;s usually a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> Smells clean &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out our hands</li>
    <li> I love this. My 2 and 4 year old love the smell and so do I. Spicy. Love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  It will clean your hands without leaving a chemical smell on them.  Also, it will not leave your hands sticky like some other products.</li>
    <li> Like this all natural hand sanitizer. I use this on the job to sanitize the hands of persons before being drug screened. I like the foam vs the Purell gel. Most people like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Cleanwell Hand Sanitizer has a lovely herbal scent, does its job well, and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve reordered more than once, and will continue to do so. It also comes in a handy purse-sized spray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this is a natural product, but it doesn&#x27;t make me feel clean.  It also has a very strong smell.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but man does this stuff stink. It&#x27;s smells like a dirty hippie water. Price is right and part of the free shipping on Amazon makes it worth it, but the smell, oh the smell.</li>
    <li> Ive done my research (scholarly medical journal publications) and feel confident using this. Smells great. Leaves hands soft!</li>
    <li> I really love this hand sanitizer.  Smells good - natural (smell not too overpowering).  It works great and does not dry my hands out like alcohol based hand sanitizers.  I already reordered more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff. I have my hands on a lot of different keyboards. There&#x27;s no telling what people have been doing with their fingers before I get there. The stuff keeps me healthy. It is clean and fresh smelling. It should be on every household shelf.</li>
    <li> We have this hand sanitizer sitting at both our diaper changing stations in our house and it works great. Definitely has a different smell and feel compared to alcohol based sanitizers, but it definitely makes me feel better when handling our 8 month old. She is teething and chewing on everything (including our hands), and I also nurse her - so having clean hands is a must. I don&#x27;t always have time to wash my hands at the sink after every change, so it&#x27;s really nice to have this option available. It is sort of a lemon-herbal scent. Not bad, but not my favorite either. The foam is nice and it coats yor hands. You don&#x27;t always get that &amp;#34;cool and clean&amp;#34; feeling that typical hand sanitizer produces, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working just the same! Overall, I am glad I found this to use around our baby!</li>
    <li> Product&#x27;s great, would buy from seller again!</li>
    <li> great, but the lid doesn&#x27;t screw on very tight, kind of a cheap design, so you have to watch out for that.</li>
    <li> I usually use the purse sized Cleanwell hand sanitizers and I love them! I&#x27;m not a fan of overusing hand sanitizer and avoid the traditional alcohol based gel sanitizers like the plague, but when we were expecting our little one we purchase a 3 pack of the larger size for the nursery and they definitely come in handy for my husband and I and all the guests that come to visit.&lt;br /&gt;This hand sanitizer is effective, it&#x27;s not harsh on sensitive skin (like mine), smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry skin. We get tons of compliments on it and it been a life saver for us.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling wet.</li>
    <li> I rub down with this sanitizer before jiu jitsu class to help protect from staph and other nasty bugs.  It&#x27;s alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and cause little cracks for junk to get into your skin.  The smell is pleasing due to the witch hazel.  The foam dries quickly after application as well and doesn&#x27;t sweat into my eyes at all either.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Normally, I use a hand sanitizer when I eat out.  This is a bit large to carry in my pocket.</li>
    <li> I teach and constantly sanitizing with alcohol based gels and sprays were killing my hands to the point that they would be cracked and bleed.  So far, this foaming hand sanitizer has passed my tests with flying colors and the smell is wonderful--reminds me of an herb garden and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Will update after prolonged use, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> good price.  nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer. Thymol from the thyme plant gives Cleanwell it&#x27;s antibacterial properties.  This is the same safe ingredient found in mouth washes.  Most importantly, it will not cause your hands to crack and bleed like the standard ethyl alcohol hand sanitizers.  The foam bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s non-toxic and has no offending smell. Works well on dirty hands and paws.</li>
    <li> Bought theses for our office and gave one to my co-workers.  Smells great.  Seems to be working.</li>
    <li> This not inexpensive product gave me hope that I could wean my family off of alcohol-based sanitizers, which have a justifiably questionable reputation. When we began using the product, I was thrilled: the scent was very appealing and fresh, and the foam cleanser rubbed in to one&#x27;s hands very quickly, leaving them feeling soft, clean, and ready to roll!...Unfortunately, after less than a week, the foaming capabilities of the liquid disappeared, and all we get out of the dispenser now is liquid that dribbles out, and gets all over the place. Given that this is happening with all 3 dispensers, we can only assume that the contents react to the atmosphere very soon, and lose their foaming quality. Since convenience is part of the value proposition of this product, it makes it somewhat disappointing.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews of other alcohol-free sanitizers containing potentially toxic ingredients I tried this one.  I cannot use alcohol-based sanitizers because they severely dry out my skin, sometimes to the point that I itch and bleed.  This particular one was almost perfect.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad (to me anyway, if you prefer the scent of roses or rubbing alcohol be my guest).  The only problem I have is with the design of the spout.  It points outward instead of down, making it very easy to shoot out across the table.  Pretty poor design, but the sanitizer itself is great so no complaints there.</li>
    <li> Good value but the smell could do with some improvement</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Okay scent</li>
    <li> The scent is very medical. The pumps are stiff and drip. It&#x27;s a handy product to keep in our cars but we will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> The perfect hand sanitizer except for the smell.  It smells like thyme.  I like thyme in my food but not this overwhelming smell on my hands.  They really need to create another scent like lavender or something better smelling.  After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d be okay with the smell but I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> Love Cleanwell&#x27;s products! Was introduced to them at a Natural Foods convention and received a sample of their product. Glad to find an all natural sanitizer that isn&#x27;t drying. High quality, no harsh chemicals, great packaging.  Will continue to purchase their line of products.</li>
    <li> Smells very strongly of herbs in a bad way</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get some foaming hand sanitizer after using it in the hospital while I was having my twins in labor and delivery.  I looked around but could not find very many options.  The cleanwell had decent reviews and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad so I thought I&#x27;d give it try.  I received the package today and the three containers were put together in a plastic bag.  The pump part on one of the containers came off so the liquid leaked all over.  I washed and dried the containers so that was fine but the pump on that particular container always pops off now which is pretty annoying.  The oregano scent is overwhelming if you are sensitive to smell.  I don&#x27;t mind it too much since I don&#x27;t sniff my hands a lot after using the stuff.  So overall not bad but I&#x27;d like to still look around for other options.</li>
    <li> It works well for kids but it does not smell so great/</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well, and I like that it is natural. However the scent takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> No scent reactions to it, lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t dry your hands. We like this stuff. . . . .. .</li>
    <li> This product was specifically cited by FDA in April 2011 as being ineffective against \\&quot;MRSA, E. coli, salmonella, flu, other bacteria and viruses\\&quot;. So I&#x27;m not sure what are you really protecting yourself from if you buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the FDA study: [...]</li>
    <li> I had to knock it down a star because one of the bottles leaked while in route to my home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alcohol free hand sanitizer- this was not it! It may kill germs &amp; clean your hands, but unless you like the smell of eucalyptus/medicine then don&#x27;t buy this. I found a great one a few days later at the market - Safe Hands smells &amp; works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m clinically obsessive-compulsive when it comes to keeping hands clean, so ever since I discovered Purell I have been regularly stocking them. Most alcohol and gel-based sanitizers have two issues - gel sticks and is horrible if you accidentally happen to say lick your thumb later, and the alcohol definitely makes your hands dry.  I do like the simplicity of alcohol though so not in favor of other products that use Triclosan or benzalkonium-based ingredients even though they might be less drying. I tried the Bath and Body Works and Gold Bond moisturizing sanitizers but they have two problems - a) these strong (non-alcohol) ingredients, and b) greasy enough that once you use these, your touch-screen phone and pretty much anything else that smudges easily will smudge. Did I mention I also like to keep my gadgets streak free? Oh and the B&amp;BW hand sanitizer had another issue - the strong perfume that is probably best suited for the ladies.   Then I discovered CleanWell. Man this thing is nice. Pricey, but nice. It&#x27;s all-natural, foams, doesn&#x27;t dry, and if my thumb accidentally touches my lips, it doesn&#x27;t taste weird.  The only problem I had with this was the first bottle in the 3-pack from Amazon didn&#x27;t foam well, i.e. I got more liquid than a thick foam.   I also tried their smaller spray bottle (instead of foam) but didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> None of the alcohol smell. Goes on light and dries quick. Seems to moisturize rather than dry out hands. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Before i purchased this product, i went through the reviews and took a chance to see how it is.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly people complained about the smell it gives. Some like strong smell and some like light smell so it differs for each and every person. This review is purely base on my use.&lt;br /&gt;Once i apply this product in my hands, very slightly i get this smell and only when i take my hand near my nose, i smell it strongly. (it can differ for others)&lt;br /&gt;Good to have is , could have covered it with some other pleasant smell but its not a big worry factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:&lt;br /&gt;Please first analyze your smell capacity (how much you can accept). Say in perfume if you prefer light smell then this might not be your choice.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand sanitizer that didn&#x27;t dry my hands so badly as does the alcohol-based ones. NO WHERE in the description does it say this has a thyme base!!! My hands smell like Thanksgiving dinner! I&#x27;m a medical professional and it&#x27;s not a good idea that I smell like I just made a turkey!  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> No alcohol &#x3D; no dry skin! Great smell too, though its a little earthy at first.</li>
    <li> As a new mom I was looking for a gentle hand sanitizer and I am very happy to find this one. This one is natural and alcohol free, I am using this sanitizer since my daughter was born 18 months ago. Love it and would recommend it. It smell good and not alcohol.</li>
    <li> Cleanness: it&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;Smell: it&#x27;s not as good as other brands. maybe I am not used to it&lt;br /&gt;Value: kind of expensive comparing what you get&lt;br /&gt;Quality: leaking when shipped. maybe from the cap</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Only hand sanitizer we will ever use at our acupuncture clinic</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  One in my truck and one on my desk at work.  And you can use it all day and your hands won&#x27;t feel like sand paper.</li>
    <li> It is a personal choice. I prefer the liquid Sanitizer than the foam. Guess i bought the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;No refreshing smell. So a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have a bottle in the car, a bottle on the kids car seat, a bottle at school, a spray bottle in my purse.  I can&#x27;t image my life without it!  My kids are always on the go, so naturally they snack in the car a lot, it doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin and they can still use it if they have cuts on their skin.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of these. My boyfriend purchased it and we like that it foams up, but it just has a weird smell to it, like it came from a hospital storage room. We haven&#x27;t used it since &#x3D;\</li>
    <li> My family has been using Clean Well hand sanitizer for the last 8 years, and it is awesome.  I was SO bummed when Clean Well discontinued the 4 oz. spray, because that was our go-to product that we kept one of everywhere (desk @ work, purse, car, diaper bag, etc.).  Since then, we have been using this.  My only complaints are that this isn&#x27;t as portable as the old 4 oz spray (and I find the 1 oz spray just too small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We always have one of these in the cup holder of both cars, in the diaper bag, at the changing table, at our desks at work and any other place we can think of.  Everything about this product is great - it works, smells great, feels light, does not dry out your skin or leave it feeling slimy, and - best of all - it uses all natural ingredients, so no toxic chemicals and it is safe for kids and babies!  I have used this on my kids hands since they were infants, it is that gentle and natural.  Anyone I have introduced to this product loves it.  You will never go back to alcohol-based, grody gel sanitizers if you try this.</li>
    <li> Great product. thanks :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is safe: benzlkonium chloride free. The smell isn&#x27;t as nice as Babyganics product, but it is all natural and safe to use.</li>
    <li> I adopted a puppy and she sort of smells. I was washing my hands many times each day and ultimately this hand sanitizer combined with normal foaming hand soap removes the dog smell without stripping my skin&#x27;s oils. I like the citrus scent; it works to cover odors but isn&#x27;t too noticeable. The 3-pack is great since I can keep one in the car, one at my desk, and one in the kitchen (where having a natural hand sanitizer is quite nice).</li>
    <li> I brought this to work and my coworkers hated the smell. I also thought it was a very bad smell but use it anyway because it is all natural haha!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to alcohol based hand sanitizers. The stuff seems to work (havent got any colds/flu..), but it smells. I wouldnt say it smells bad, but it has a distinguishable smell that isnt exactly pleasant. I can see this hand sanitizer could annoy the people around you. Keep that in mind if you share an office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint is the opaque bottle. It&#x27;s difficult to tell how much you have left.</li>
    <li> I am kind of germophobic when it comes to my hands specifically. But I have cats and I get cut a lot playing with said cats, and normal sanitizer burns badly. I&#x27;ve actually been taking more steps to take care of myself lately and these were the first sanitizers I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, they work extremely well. This is a pack of three and I keep one on my end table, one on my nightstand and one in my office. I use it several times a day and love it. The smell is actually quite nice (very foresty, pine kind of scent) and I&#x27;ve found it works really well to keep my hands clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and it sinks in very fast. Smell lingers for a little while, which I like. Will be buying again once these run out (none of the three have run out and I purchased over four months ago).</li>
    <li> Stinks to high heaven.  Worst smelling product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The chemicals in other hand santizers are very bad for you. I love that this is all natural. The price for a 3 pack is great. It&#x27;s a big bottle and lasts a while. I keep one at home in the car and at work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s ability to kill germs, but all I can report on this is that it really stinks.  I bought a whole bunch for the office, and people refuse to use it.  I tried to give it away, but people won&#x27;t even take it home for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I ordered too many and didn&#x27;t return them in time.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck.</li>
    <li> I like it as it uses natural substances. But I&#x27;m not sure how much germs it can kill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a RN, so I wash my hands a lot. This stuff works and feels better than most other alcohol based cleansers, IMO. And it seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> The kids loves foaming hand wash; I want something natural. And this product is a perfect mix that satisfied us all.</li>
    <li> i enjoy the earthy scent of this alcohol- and preservative-free hand sanitizer. they make an orange-vanilla scent but i feel that will dry out my hands due to the citrus oil so i will stick with this one. the foam dispenses nicely and i only need one pump per application. wish it was in a more slender container so i could store it in my car door cubby like the usual germX bottle. they make a pocket-size spray that i haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
    <li> Has a strange, almost pine tree smell to it. Ended up putting it in the guest bathroom and using the Babyganics for ours.</li>
    <li> we feel this type of sanitizer is better for our skin and our grandchildren&#x27;s  skin.. the  cost $$  is  more, but it does seem to go along way. it feels much better than the other alcohol base stuff .</li>
    <li> It stinks!  My kids always cringe when I use it because of it&#x27;s vulgar smell!  I wish it told on the bottle what precentage of germs it REALLY destroys.  Most sanitizer will advertise the percentage of germs that it fights against!</li>
    <li> Love this for using after diaper changes so I am not constantly washing, and therefore drying out, my hands. I love that it uses natural essential oils instead of harsh ingredients to sanitize.</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer.  The pump/foam is great and easy to use.  It rubs in easy and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell, residue or any sticky feeling.  Way better than the alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!!!  I purchased this for my desk in my office, as I believe that the regular hand sanitizer can leave your hands feeling dry.  Not to mention I have heard that regular hand sanitizer can be toxic (I have no knowledge to confirm or deny this fact).  I work in healthcare, so we use a lot of this stuff - I have purchased this for every one of my staff members as this was such a hit!  This does have a strong scent - but we all agree that we like it.</li>
    <li> Great product! No alcohol and not tacky after applying. Some people seem to not like the smell, I actually like it!</li>
    <li> The active ingredient is taken from the common thyme or garden thyme which is used as an ingredient in cooking and as an herbal medicine. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but that is no reason to avoid the product because the scent quickly dissipates. I never even smell it unless I deliberately put my hand to my nose and sniff. I is a safe alternative to using hand sanitizers with alcohol and various chemicals. It is also easier on your hands than chemical based sanitizers. It is certainly quicker and easier to use than hand washing with soap and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as washing with soap does. I also use the pocket version whenever I am out of my home, the orange / vanilla scented wipes, and the spray for cleaning around the kitchen and bathroom.</li>
    <li> not so great strong odor-otherwise does leave hands soft and ok</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I had ordered. I have used this product before and its a great hand sanitizer. Cleanwell is a good brand and i love the fact that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t feel all \\&quot;medical\\&quot;. They also do not dry out your skin or make your skin feel tight like some other products do. Amazon had the best price that I could find! It was shipped and received within a week.</li>
    <li> Cleans well. Nice foam. Nice smell. Keeps your hand feeling nice And clean. Also like I because it&#x27;s mor natural.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. I have even used it around the mouth when great auntie gives kisses while she is suffering from a cold. Didn&#x27;t irritate the lips or taste really horrid. This is something I&#x27;d never do with alcohol sanitizers. Keeps us germ free withouts any harsh or hazardous chems. The pump formula lasts forever, you can throw some paper towels in the car to turn them into wipes with this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. It locks so little hands don&#x27;t pump out all it&#x27;s contents too.</li>
    <li> I prefer this over alcohol-based hand sanitizer because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands.  The scent takes some getting used to, but I don&#x27;t find it objectionable and it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> Has a very, very strong odor to it.</li>
    <li> works for me and no side effects on my hands.</li>
    <li> Received 3- 1 oz. mini (probably free samples) bottles of \\&quot;Cleanwell All-natural Foaming Hand Sanitizer\\&quot; supposed to as depicted in photo as well as written description 3 - 8 (EIGHT) ounce pump foam bottles, have pictured depicted on my page, no explanation, no reason, just BAIT AND SWITCH, terrible business practices!!! And was not cheap either, could have bought 6 oz. bottles in dollar store!!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Did finally get a full refund</li>
    <li> This was purchased for use in the classroom for the classroom pet, a bearded dragon, because it does not have alcohol. This was an amazing price when I purchased it and it should last the entire school year. The students do complain that it smells funny.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and this company.  Great to have an all-natural alternative for a hand sanitizer! I wish more people knew about this product.</li>
    <li> I use a ton of hand sanitizer. I love foaming hand sanitizer a lot more then the other types.</li>
    <li> Love this sanitizer, use it all the time and sometimes just for the smell because it smells like delicious herbs.</li>
    <li> its smelly, and in a bad way. thus, the hands dont feel clean after applying it.</li>
    <li> I have 5 of these around my house. The smell is very herbal but clean. The best part is they seem to last FOREVER. They make your hands feel fresh and clean, without making your hands feel dry/tight like an alcohol sanitizer would. Natural, and effective. Buy it! I love this brand, they really make a great natural product.</li>
    <li> This smells light and fresh. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hands unlike other sanitizers...</li>
    <li> I hate the scent but it does the job! Hands are clean, doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out. a plus side it makes my wedding rings look really clean.</li>
    <li> If you like thyme, you&#x27;ll love this product, made with thyme oil.  Works well, dries pretty fast and the herbal smell is just great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural alternative to sanitizer.  Much kinder on the skin.</li>
    <li> Having a brand-new baby in the house, we placed a few of these strategically about and everyone loves the simplicity and also the fact that the foam is all natural.  No extra chemicals on the baby.</li>
    <li> Bes hand sanitizer ever! Doesn&#x27;t leave that gross film on your hands, gentle even for people with sensitive skin. Smells good. Doe&#x27;t build up on your hands. Mild and pleasant smell! Only hand sanitizer I will use</li>
    <li> As much as I would love to believe this group of products - please know that all of them are under FDA warning, specifically that the Cleanwell sanitizer makes unproven claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken directly from the FDA website -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Some hand sanitizers and antiseptic products come with claims that they can prevent MRSA infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe them. These statements are unproven, says the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a bacterium that can cause severe—even life-threatening—infections that do not respond to standard treatment with the antibiotic methicillin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm251816.htm</li>
    <li> smells strange. Wish they would add an essential oil so it does not smell so bad.</li>
    <li> I am so glad i found this foaming sanitizer. Happy with the  Natural ingredients. No greasy feeling like what i have with purell. I keep this at my desk at work. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product for indoors. When I use it outdoors it attracts bees!!! I usually give my 18 mo old son his lunch at a park, recently we had to move several times ( from bench to bench) because an unknown amount of bees was following us. Only a few days later I realized that the second I get the bottle of this hand sanitizer out - bees surround us. Luckily they do not attack but they are way to close, literally in mine and my son&#x27;s faces. Otherwise a great product! :)</li>
    <li> Love this foaming hand sanitizer! Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your hands, and has a very light scent. Alcohol-free is also a plus! Nice to have in different rooms around the house, especially when you have babies and little kids around.</li>
    <li> We keep one of these pumps in the car. Very handy especially after pumping gas or the grocery story. Its a much gentler scent than most other hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Would like to purchase a product that was GMO free- certified (No corn alcohol) Kid&#x27;s are now required to use these in school and I don&#x27;t like the fact that it isn&#x27;t certified.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a residue on the hands and has a earthy smell. On the plus side my hands do not dry out when using it daily.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible! Using this makes me want to wash my hands.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for customers and employees in our medium-sized office.  After a month, almost nobody will use them anymore because they can&#x27;t stand the smell.  I don&#x27;t know if they work as well as the non-natural sanitizers, but I do know they won&#x27;t work if people won&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help combat the flu season this year as I am expecting a baby any day now.  I&#x27;m sure it will work fine at sanitizing, but it leaves a funny smell around.  not my favorite but I like the flu even less.</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle, light foam, lovely scent... but unfortunately studies show that this type of product is inferior to alcohol-based hand sanitizers.  I bought a few of these before reading that, and ended up just using the alcohol products since I know they work.</li>
    <li> I wish all stores that carried regular hand sanitizer would also carry this product. It&#x27;s simply the best hand sanitizer I have ever used. It&#x27;s much, much easier on the skin than alcohol based products and it has a pleasant, natural smell rather than a strong artificial fragrance. Its cleansing power comes from all natural thyme oil. You would have to use a lot before it dries you out. I keep one next to the diaper station, in the car, by the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, and in my purse. Surely this makes me sound like I have OCD, and maybe it&#x27;s true, but I run a clean ship and I love natural products that help me do so! It&#x27;s even safe for use with kids!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff and affordable for a natural product. My only gripe is that it smells like citronella.</li>
    <li> The product smells horrible.</li>
    <li> this does not smell good at all!  Yuk!  It&#x27;s worse than what they use in the hospitals.  it smells way too medicinal!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s school requires hand sanitizer without alcohol, and this is the best we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This seems to clean well and has a mild scent. (I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but atleast it&#x27;s not very strong).</li>
    <li> We keep this in our house and use the travel size for on the go. I love that it&#x27;s safe for kids and easily absorbs.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the purpose of cleaning my hands after changing my baby&#x27;s diapers.  With a wriggly baby, I didn&#x27;t feel safe leaving him on the changing pad while I went to wash my hands real quick.  I know I could have put him in his crib or bouncer first before washing my hands, but then that would mean touching him with dirty hands when I put his clothes back together.  This way, I could sanitize my hands quickly after handling his diaper and before I put his clothes back on.  Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t rely simply on this if I had gotten poop on my hands, but handling just a wet diaper I felt was safe enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to pump foam one-handed while holding the baby down with the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;- Dissolves quickly and it doesn&#x27;t take a full pump to completely cover hands.&lt;br /&gt;- The bottles last forever.  We&#x27;ve had these for 4 months now, using it multiple times a day, and the bottles still feel almost full.  We have one on each floor of the house and a third for the car.&lt;br /&gt;- Alcohol free means no stinging dry hands after use.  Dry hands seems to be part of the package with a baby after washing bottles several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;- The foam doesn&#x27;t stain if it gets on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell takes a little getting used to, kind of like an herby scent.  I found it pleasant enough, but my husband isn&#x27;t a big fan.&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes the foam likes to squirt out across the room.  I just learned to push down halfway, but my husband tends to push it down real fast and get foam all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and leaves hands soft, not dry, which I very much appreciated!</li>
    <li> All of the cleanwell products smell terrible, like burnt plastic and cheap vitamins. This product in particular is kind of sticky.</li>
    <li> Like the product but was upset because the bottles did not come in a safe proof package. Unfortunately, all three bottles busted leaking half of the solution to run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this hand sanitizer for my father who had become too weak to get up and wash his hands.  I read the reviews, but I like the smell of thyme and didn&#x27;t think the smell would be a problem.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used the cleanser then ate chocolate ice cream and found it to be a really offensive smell when you are eating something that you wouldn&#x27;t cook with thyme.</li>
    <li> The  foulest, most off-putting scent ever.  The oregano is super pungent.  I&#x27;ll take an alcohol smell over this any day.</li>
    <li> I love that u have no alcohol, no smell taking ur breath away or a newborns. The downfall for everyone else is the smell. Its oregano..reminds me of spaghetti, I like it. It didnt linger that alcohol smell around, didn&#x27;t burn cuts on kid hands, &amp; seemed to work for us protecting a newborn during flu season :) if u like natural u will love this ;)</li>
    <li> I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t make my sons hand have a bad taste. If I put it on his hands and he eats something-- his hands don&#x27;t taste bad. It smells like thyme-- primary ingredient. We will continue to use this and see if it has an effect</li>
    <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is really a lot safer than ones that are in the grocery stores.  this sanitizer helps with killing the bad bacteria and It&#x27;s safe for kids too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot safer to use than the hand sanitizers that have a lot of chemicals in them,The Clean Well sanitizer is more natural.</li>
    <li> nice fragrance.  the problem is this:  both pumps became non-functional after 1 week of use.  the main reason we tried this was because of the pump.  so convenient.  maybe we received 2 defective bottles.  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Not at all drying like the alcohol based sanitizers. Clean fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I tried this product thinking it was a good value, but my hands never really felt fresh or clean like other products made them feel. After using half a bottle I chunked it and went with germ-x instead. This product may sanitize a little, but I don&#x27;t believe I was getting as sanitized as other products.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Sanitizes without harsh effects of alcohol. Easy to use. I keep a bottle in each bathroom &amp; the kitchen. Affordable and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought to use this in my office before lunch, but smells too strongly of thyme. You can&#x27;t eat immediately after using this; you don&#x27;t want this over powering smell in your face. It might work fine if you are using in a playground etc.</li>
