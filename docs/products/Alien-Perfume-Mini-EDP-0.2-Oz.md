      <li>I love this perfume!  </li>
      <li>gorgeous bottle, packed in original box, great experience with the vendor,</li>
      <li>Which was awesome,  exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>This had a nice feminine scent without being over powering</li>
      <li>But it is nice.</li>
      <li>This is a very warm, cool weather or evening scent.</li>
      <li>so I was able to transfer it into that.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>rating has more to do with the product&#x27;s description.</li>
      <li>More of an earthy smell</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance anyway</li>
      <li>My favorite</li>
      <li>love both.</li>
      <li>and it is surely evaporating since the top is not airtight any more.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>This is a nice one and it lasts pretty well.</li>
      <li>Beautiful fragrance, albeit &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;......arrived on the 3rd day after ordering.....</li>
      <li>On the positive side, it&#x27;s a really warm and snug fragrance.</li>
      <li>but this is a perfect small bottle and a very pretty.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I had an atomizer</li>
      <li>My ultimate favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>But overall I love this perfume...</li>
      <li>Just be aware of the bottle issues.</li>
      <li>Looks better and bigger online.</li>
      <li>It was open and the item fell out and hit the tile floor when I opened it, breaking off the top.</li>
      <li>Great long lasting smell!</li>
      <li>I actually really like it!</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this scent by&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells great once aired out a little bit.</li>
      <li>I got 2 samples of this perfume for free and instantly fell in love with it the second it was on my skin.</li>
      <li>the smell is strong though which is the only con.</li>
      <li>Other than i love the scent</li>
      <li>I love woody oriental and spicy, musky scents like Guess, Black Cashmere, Nu, Euphoria &amp; Lola.</li>
      <li>the top of the bottle broke off after a few times of me opening the bottle.so it leaked all over.</li>
      <li>I sprayed it on one of my shirts, then wore it for a day and put it in the wash, and you could still smell it clearly!</li>
      <li>Alien is a winter fragance which along with Midnight Poison make my top two scents for the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too heavy for an easy breazy afternoon.</li>
      <li>Wow......</li>
      <li>If you are young and like fruity and floral fragrances, I would recommend one of the juicy couture perfumes like couture</li>
      <li>One of my favorite fragrances in a small affordable vial!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much less heavy than euphoria and more intense and mature than Guess.  </li>
      <li>and I was curious but not enough to buy a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>Quite powerful and long lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a warm, long lasting, common winter fragrance, then this is for you.</li>
      <li>Different high and low notes!</li>
      <li>This perfume sortof reminds me of Cher&#x27;s perfume Uninhibited, very rich, a little goes a long, long way.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, it doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>

<li> In other words, if you&#x27;re planning to take the mini bottle for a trip, chances are it will spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I made a big mess, and wasted some.  </li>
<li> In it, it&#x27;s omitted that what the consumer will end up getting is a bottle with no spray mechanism, meaning that after turning the head to open the bottle there&#x27;s nothing but a small opening.</li>
<li> A little difficulty applying with such a small bottle and no spray.</li>
<li> It should of been less than 7.99.</li>
<li> A little dab will do ya!</li>
<li> Alien is sutle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Alien and I  had not hear of</li>
<li> so I started off small.</li>
<li> in my person in was the perfume without the pump and really small.</li>
<li> I think it was too small for what I paid for it.</li>
<li> Although, on the negative side, everybody wears it!</li>
<li> That said, I agree with the other reviewers that the bottle is awful.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;cork&amp;#34; was deformed which made it impossible to close.  </li>
<li> I like this perfume but was very unhappy with the packaging it was in.</li>

    <li> the top of the bottle broke off after a few times of me opening the bottle.so it leaked all over. Other than i love the scent</li>
    <li> This had a nice feminine scent without being over powering</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorites</li>
    <li> A little dab will do ya! Smells great once aired out a little bit. More of an earthy smell</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance, albeit &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;......arrived on the 3rd day after ordering.....Wow......gorgeous bottle, packed in original box, great experience with the vendor, R.Island !!!</li>
    <li> Instead of putting .2 it should have said 0.2 I was unaware that I was going to receive a perfume bottle the size of a quarter.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances in a small affordable vial!  Good size for sampling.  The shipping charges may be prohibitive however.</li>
    <li> This is a very warm, cool weather or evening scent. I love woody oriental and spicy, musky scents like Guess, Black Cashmere, Nu, Euphoria &amp; Lola. This is a nice one and it lasts pretty well. It&#x27;s much less heavy than euphoria and more intense and mature than Guess.  It&#x27;s too heavy for an easy breazy afternoon.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Always did. A little difficulty applying with such a small bottle and no spray. But it is nice.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. My favorite</li>
    <li> My item actually came earlier than expected!  Which was awesome,  exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this fragrance and this was the perfect opportunity to do that. My husband had told me about it and I was curious but not enough to buy a full size bottle. This was perfect. I actually really like it!</li>
    <li> Great long lasting smell! Different high and low notes!</li>
    <li> This perfume sortof reminds me of Cher&#x27;s perfume Uninhibited, very rich, a little goes a long, long way.  When I&#x27;m in the mood for a tantalizing scent, I go for this.</li>
    <li> My ultimate favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I got 2 samples of this perfume for free and instantly fell in love with it the second it was on my skin. On the positive side, it&#x27;s a really warm and snug fragrance. It also lasts very long. I sprayed it on one of my shirts, then wore it for a day and put it in the wash, and you could still smell it clearly! Although, on the negative side, everybody wears it! I could smell this out from a mile away. One time I was at a restaurant and smelled it on a girl who was 4 tables away!!!!!!!! I also only see adults wearing it, like people in there 40-50s. For a teen like me, only have I seen like 2 people who wear it. If you are looking for a warm, long lasting, common winter fragrance, then this is for you. If you are young and like fruity and floral fragrances, I would recommend one of the juicy couture perfumes like couture la la or viva la juicy.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance anyway but this is a perfect small bottle and a very pretty. I like to switch around and larger bottles last for ever.</li>
    <li> Looks better and bigger online. in my person in was the perfume without the pump and really small. i know it said mini but damn... for $20 i could have bought another brand of perfume. the smell is strong though which is the only con.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  Deliciously passionate, almost grape or wine scented. To me, if royal purple had a scent, this would be it.  That said, I agree with the other reviewers that the bottle is awful.  The &amp;#34;cork&amp;#34; was deformed which made it impossible to close.  I made a big mess, and wasted some.  Luckily, I had an atomizer so I was able to transfer it into that.  Still, good purchase.  Just be aware of the bottle issues.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume but was very unhappy with the packaging it was in. It was open and the item fell out and hit the tile floor when I opened it, breaking off the top. It didn&#x27;t spill but I can&#x27;t travel with it and it is surely evaporating since the top is not airtight any more. I sent another review indicating this and rec&#x27;d no response whatsoever. Apparently, it doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Alien is a winter fragance which along with Midnight Poison make my top two scents for the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3-stars rating has more to do with the product&#x27;s description. In it, it&#x27;s omitted that what the consumer will end up getting is a bottle with no spray mechanism, meaning that after turning the head to open the bottle there&#x27;s nothing but a small opening. In other words, if you&#x27;re planning to take the mini bottle for a trip, chances are it will spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sellers need to disclose such information if they wish to build a good clientele base.</li>
    <li> Quite powerful and long lasting scent.  It doesn&#x27;t develop successfully on me.  As always, I would suggest that people try scents for themselves.  They go so different on differnt people.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but I&#x27;ve gotten compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, she mentioned this perfume so I started off small.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance !!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I think it was too small for what I paid for it. It should of been less than 7.99. But overall I love this perfume...</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this scent by&lt;br /&gt;a stranger who I asked \\&quot;what perfume is that?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;She said Alien and I  had not hear of it.&lt;br /&gt;I did however know Thierry Mugler because of&lt;br /&gt;Angel.&lt;br /&gt;I love both. Alien is sutle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments. It&#x27;s a small&lt;br /&gt;bottle but you only need a dabe.&lt;br /&gt;Very good Amazon...</li>
