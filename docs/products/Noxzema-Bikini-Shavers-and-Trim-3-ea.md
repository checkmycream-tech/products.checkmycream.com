      <li>sorry noxzema,  would be best if it showed you how tiny the razor surface is.</li>

      <li>The pink ones are great, but I received the green ones even though I ordered the pink ones.</li>

<li> The pink would get 5 stars from me, the green not so much.</li>

<li> I suppose it was my fault for maybe not reading the description properly but these razors are so small</li>
<li> But other than that I would recommend it for all beginners in need of products like this.</li>
<li> They have a narrow blade head and allow me to shave where a standard  blade does not fit.</li>
<li> /&gt;and was not worth the money.  </li>
<li> Came in green instead of pink purple.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these little razors forever in the stores, but with no luck.</li>
<li> I have the green ones.  </li>
<li> These little razors are small and functional for what they are designed for.  </li>
<li> I have a hard time finding them in some stores</li>
<li> These were a lifesaver this past summer!</li>

    <li> These were much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> very tiny razor and slippery in the show.&lt;br /&gt;and was not worth the money.  sorry noxzema,  would be best if it showed you how tiny the razor surface is.</li>
    <li> I love these. The angle and size work great for the area. I have a hard time finding them in some stores so I&#x27;ve stated purchasing them on here but aside from availability, they work well. They last awhile and get the job done. For jobs like this though, it comes down to personal preference so there is always a chance this may not suit everyone. Worth a shot though.</li>
    <li> I love these there perfect were ever you use them....they never cut you</li>
    <li> I love these little razors.  They do the job!  Hate the stopped carrying them in stores, but happy to find them here.</li>
    <li> I have the green ones.  I just want a razor blade to shave, not trim.  the guard on it seems to prevent actual shaving.</li>
    <li> The ones I got were green not pink. I hope they are the same. I really wanted the pink ones.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from these razors so my expectations were kind of low. However, they exceeded my expectations in every way. They work SO well! Definitely going to order these in bulk.</li>
    <li> I would order again. Great&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Works well with finishing up the details of my mustache... even though it wasn&#x27;t intended for that. LOL</li>
    <li> Came in green instead of pink purple. But other than that I would recommend it for all beginners in need of products like this.</li>
