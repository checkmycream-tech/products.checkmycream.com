      <li>Everything else was in good condition but this brush holder was beat up and there was a huge crack in it!</li>
      <li>Holds all my brushes and keeps them nice and organized.</li>
      <li>However, they did and I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay because it still looks nice and gives me a place to store all my makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great idea and would be very functional and nice looking if it arrived in one piece.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice finish to it and its really strong.</li>
      <li>I love this for all of my brushes.</li>
      <li>I love these brush holders from elf.</li>
      <li>Love the e.l.f.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I can find my brushes so much better now and it keeps them organized, I also keep all my lip liner in it too</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>After purchasing a 32 brush set off Ebay, I realized I needed a cute storage items to readily be able to use the brushes as I apply my makeup each morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t the shipping because they had placed air bubble things in the box.</li>
      <li>However, if you have all fat handled brushes, they may not work as well for you because then you won&#x27;t be able to fit as many.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and super satisfied.</li>
      <li>All my brushes fit, I have about 50 btw, and I can fit more.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty okay in my bathroom and makes my countertop much more organized.</li>
      <li>though there was no way my brushes could all fit.</li>
      <li>Overall, really happy</li>
      <li>Looks great on my vanity and now I need to purchase a couple of the smaller one.</li>
      <li>this hold everything and is very eye catching....</li>
      <li>Very worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so so excited to put all my brushes collection in here.</li>
      <li>Best $15 i&#x27;ve spent and seems very durable.</li>
      <li>Overall, the organization of the makeup brush holder is good.</li>
      <li>Real technique sizes and down would be best suited in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This e.l.f brush holder holds all my brushes and allowes me to be super organized.</li>
      <li>The style  of it is a nice matte black and is easy to keep clean by wiping.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister while I was giving her a bathroom makeover, and I loved it so much that I now want to buy a second one for myself.</li>
      <li>I was not expecting much, but it was larger than I anticipated and was surprisingly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also purchased the darice bean bag filler to help the brushes stay up right.</li>
      <li>Be careful and wait for holidays for promos offering better deals!</li>
      <li>currently have most of my makeup brushes in this holder.</li>
      <li>I love this holder for the brushes I use every day and I access regularly.</li>
      <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to use this to put my curling iron, flat iron, etc.</li>
      <li>I love this brush holder so much that I bought 2 of them and am planning on getting a third one.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy, and looks exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>The only downside is the strong chemical odor it has when you take it out if the packaging.</li>
      <li>The holder is large with 3 compartments.</li>
      <li>After reading some reviews on several sites about how nice and big this holder was, I knew that it would be my first choice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too noticeable in dim light, but for $15 I expect a little better quality.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t matter much to me.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t package it very well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for my brushes, like its intended for, and it works very well</li>
      <li>Thanks elf . .</li>
      <li>I like this product to much.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected!  </li>
      <li>Use this item filled with the little white beads to store all my make up brushes and keep them close and organized, always able to see which one I need.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return and to receive a new one</li>
      <li>Lucky me, this actually arrived promptly with NO damage at all.</li>
      <li>I suggest you wash it out with a mild soap detergent and leave it outside for a day so the smell can dissipate.</li>
      <li>I most likely will order another one for my future brush overflow.</li>
      <li>I do have a few more brushes I intend on buying, so this may not hold them all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a complete waste of time and it defeats the whole purpose of the quick service ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to the smell</li>
      <li>However, soon after purchasing this product on Amazon I received an offer directly from ELF offering all products on its website at 40% off, including this brush organizer.  </li>
      <li>if you want to have your cosmetics organized and have that professional look</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s holding my brushes quite well.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s doing its job, but I&#x27;m still torn about the quality you get for the cost...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just received this in the mail and was excited to open it only to find a big crack in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is really sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Holds long brushes as well as short.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I have recently ordered some new brushes, and found myself in need of a holder.</li>
      <li>Unlike the negative feedback my brush holder was clean and brand new.  </li>
      <li>It was the same as the one i bought directly from elf.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is amazing...very sturdy and durable!  This is a must have that I should have had long time ago...this hold everything and is very eye catching....if you want to have your cosmetics organized and have that professional look well this is a must have for your vanity....</li>
    <li> Just received it a couple of days ago and I love it!! Didn&#x27;t realize it was some sort of suede material when I ordered it but that&#x27;s okay because it still looks nice and gives me a place to store all my makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. This is great for all my brushes. I have alot of brushes and I needed something big enough to hold them all and have them at my fingertips. I keep it setting on my vanity table and I love it.</li>
    <li> It holds just about all the brushes I have. I actually divide all the makeup brushes according to face and eyes. I also use it to store my eyeliners. Overall, the organization of the makeup brush holder is good.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I purchased!  Very worth it. Has plenty of room for make up brushes and keeps them organized! I also purchased the darice bean bag filler to help the brushes stay up right. Both work together perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much, but it was larger than I anticipated and was surprisingly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I currently have most of my makeup brushes in this holder.</li>
    <li> I do not like E.L.F. products - so I was worried it would be flimsy but it is really sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Holds long brushes as well as short.&lt;br /&gt;You can put beads in the holder to keep brushes upright.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great idea and would be very functional and nice looking if it arrived in one piece.  This was a Christmas present so we were VERY disappointed that it was broken.  It&#x27;s not worth the hassle or shipping to return.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I can find my brushes so much better now and it keeps them organized, I also keep all my lip liner in it too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so scratched and beat up on the inside and has scratches and peeling on the outside. It&#x27;s not too noticeable in dim light, but for $15 I expect a little better quality. I bought two and the quality was not that great in both. It looks pretty okay in my bathroom and makes my countertop much more organized. I&#x27;ll probably stick with other ways of storing my brushes and make up if this doesn&#x27;t hold up. So far it&#x27;s doing its job, but I&#x27;m still torn about the quality you get for the cost...</li>
    <li> I love this holder for the brushes I use every day and I access regularly. The construction is not cheap and very durable and weighty. Looks great on my vanity and now I need to purchase a couple of the smaller one.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my brush holder in the mail, but was absolutely APPALLED by how it arrived! The sides were all scratched up like it had either been used before or they had just let it get banged up around the warehouse. I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t the shipping because they had placed air bubble things in the box. I&#x27;ll try to upload pictures of the horrendous appearance of this product when I get the chance. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return and to receive a new one so I&#x27;m just going to keep it but BE AWARE that they might send you a really poor quality holder! That aside, it&#x27;s practical with 3 compartments. I really like it; I just wish it hadn&#x27;t looked like it went through World War III before getting to me.</li>
    <li> ITS AWESOME BUT $11 CHEAPER ON EYESLIPSFACE.COM THIS IS A RIP OFF GO TO THE ACTUAL WEBSITE AND BUY IT THERE!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! must have for any person with makeup!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and the smaller version to hold my make-up in my drawer. I was sick of using the round cups b/c they don&#x27;t maximize space. I love these. They are big and deep and hold a lot. I&#x27;d say my only complaint is that they are tall for some of my smaller brushes and products.  Thinking of adding some beads to reduce the depth for some of my &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> When I got it, it looked small and I though there was no way my brushes could all fit. However, they did and I&#x27;m super happy with it. It has a nice finish to it and its really strong. However, if you have all fat handled brushes, they may not work as well for you because then you won&#x27;t be able to fit as many. Real technique sizes and down would be best suited in my opinion. Overall, really happy I got this half off on the site.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister while I was giving her a bathroom makeover, and I loved it so much that I now want to buy a second one for myself. It is the perfect makeup accessory holder!</li>
    <li> Better than I expected!  I&#x27;m so so excited to put all my brushes collection in here. Thanks elf . .</li>
    <li> I had to wash the item on arrival the inside was covered in black dust from the material it was made. Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a brand new item and it arrived dirty and dusty as if it wasn&#x27;t new at all. Besides it being dirty, I like the product. It was just gross to receive it like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a late bloomer to the makeup world and have been building a decent stock of items for my vanity. After purchasing a 32 brush set off Ebay, I realized I needed a cute storage items to readily be able to use the brushes as I apply my makeup each morning. Each compartment seems equally sized and I store my brushes in the order shown on the holder: eyeshadow/eye liner brushes in the space above &amp;#34;EYES&amp;#34;, lips and misc brushes in the space above &amp;#34;LIPS&amp;#34; and foundation/blush brushes in the space above &amp;#34;FACE&amp;#34;. Best $15 i&#x27;ve spent and seems very durable.</li>
    <li> Love the e.l.f. brush holder. Not much to say but that it does the job on holding all the brushes that I have. Very sturdy, and looks exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I like this product to much.</li>
    <li> I love this brush holder so much that I bought 2 of them and am planning on getting a third one. I do freelance makeup and sometimes work on several girls at once so I need to have multiple brush sets. This e.l.f brush holder holds all my brushes and allowes me to be super organized. Both brush holders fir perfectly in my seya makeup case. The style  of it is a nice matte black and is easy to keep clean by wiping. Mine did come with a few scratches but it didn&#x27;t matter much to me. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought. I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to use this to put my curling iron, flat iron, etc. in but it&#x27;s just a tad bit too small for that. I&#x27;m using it for my brushes, like its intended for, and it works very well</li>
    <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s actually bigger than I expected. This is great and looks nice.</li>
    <li> I expected a bigger brush holder</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Good size. Fits everything. I like the labels on the box especially that they&#x27;re not too obvious but subtle. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I knew when ordering this item I was taking a chance. I have recently ordered some new brushes, and found myself in need of a holder. After reading some reviews on several sites about how nice and big this holder was, I knew that it would be my first choice. The price made the decision even easier. The one thing that DID bother me was that there were quite a few complaints about damaged products being received. This was on a few websites. This almost discouraged me from buying this item, but alas it was the right size and price, so I took a chance. Lucky me, this actually arrived promptly with NO damage at all. I was so thrilled! So far it&#x27;s holding my brushes quite well. I do have a few more brushes I intend on buying, so this may not hold them all. The holder is large with 3 compartments. The compartments are about 2 3/4 inch wide squares that are 3 inches deep. I most likely will order another one for my future brush overflow. Now I just have to cross my fingers again and hope that I get another undamaged one.</li>
    <li> wanted to leave feedback.  Unlike the negative feedback my brush holder was clean and brand new.  It was the same as the one i bought directly from elf.  I love these brush holders from elf.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I had other things shipped with it as well. Everything else was in good condition but this brush holder was beat up and there was a huge crack in it! They didn&#x27;t package it very well and I am very disappointed. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND.</li>
    <li> This is great quality. I love this for all of my brushes. I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received this in the mail and was excited to open it only to find a big crack in it.&lt;br /&gt;It was big enough that a person like me who almost never return anything had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed. Amazon should check their products before they send it out.&lt;br /&gt;It is a complete waste of time and it defeats the whole purpose of the quick service ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to drop this off at a UPS and wait for another one to come.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to give this product one star but I had to to submit a review.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this!! Totally recommend it. Holds all my brushes and keeps them nice and organized.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Is bigger than what I expected. All my brushes fit, I have about 50 btw, and I can fit more. I&#x27;m in love and super satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great brush organizer!  However, soon after purchasing this product on Amazon I received an offer directly from ELF offering all products on its website at 40% off, including this brush organizer.  Be careful and wait for holidays for promos offering better deals!</li>
    <li> Shocking this looks high quality on a low budget. My expectations of this weren&#x27;t that high considering it is usually a drugstore product. But when I received it, it was gorgeous! It goes with my vanity perfectly. The only downside is the strong chemical odor it has when you take it out if the packaging. If you are sensitive to the smell I suggest you wash it out with a mild soap detergent and leave it outside for a day so the smell can dissipate.</li>
    <li> Very good brush holder</li>
    <li> I liked how big it was to hold all my brushes and when I opened it ,it was broken :( they didn&#x27;t packaged it well !!</li>
    <li> Use this item filled with the little white beads to store all my make up brushes and keep them close and organized, always able to see which one I need.</li>
