      <li>Would def buy agsin! :)</li>
      <li>I really love this product much more than I thought I would.</li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I may have to buy 100 more tubes</li>
      <li>love the scent</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>This had more vanilla than the vanilla one that we got.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also the most moisturising lip balm I&#x27;ve EVER tried.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many balms from this company before, but this has put me off a bit.</li>
      <li>But the smell dissipates quickly, which is good because it&#x27;s very sweet.</li>
      <li>butter cream frosting has just a hint of sweetness to taste, and then it makes your lips feel amazing, leaves me with soft supple lips... perfect for kissing ;)</li>
      <li>A great product I highly recommend. :)</li>
      <li>It smells great and the large size makes application so easy.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special.</li>
      <li>It feels great on and makes my lips stay moist and very soft.</li>
      <li>They have a nice light scent, but very delectable and they moisturize wonderfully, best of all the ingredients are all natural.</li>
      <li>Not tested on animals &amp; have great natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It smells great and keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
      <li>this is an amazingly moisturizing lip balm its 100% natural and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I am a lip balm junkie and this by far is the absolute best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Get some natural lip balm from etsy or make your own; it&#x27;s smooth and smells delicious, and is ten times more creamy and moisturizing than this.</li>
      <li>You get zero color on your lips from this product, which is fine, but its described as tinted.</li>
      <li>The moisturizing properties works fine which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one.</li>
      <li>It is huge so not convenient to bring out.</li>
      <li>the tube is huge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s huge</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>but i suppose some people can handle, or even enjoy that.</li>
      <li>My lips are moist and comfortable.</li>
      <li>This lip balm smells fabulous</li>
      <li>The fabulous smell is gone and it&#x27;s no longer a pleasure to apply.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic, but it doesnt seem to moisturize my lips as it claims to.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice gentle shine on my lips and stays on.</li>
      <li>If I were to buy it again, its only because of how great it smells.</li>
      <li>This made my lips absolutely smooth, hydrated and perfectly plump within VERY FEW DAYS.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use this balm because it smells really nice and leaves my lips very soft and smooth, but I bought it specifically because of the claim that it is tinted.</li>
      <li>balm.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is cloyingly sweet and synthetic smelling, like cheap plastic baby dolls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I will continue to use this balm because it smells really nice and leaves my lips very soft and smooth, but I bought it specifically because of the claim that it is tinted. Maybe if you have extremely pale lips or cake the product on you might see some tint, but none was visible on me (I am light-complected Caucasian). The size of the tube makes this a good value, so I would recommend this, but if your intent is to purchase tinted balm, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> i love cupcakes and i love lip balm ( no, not to eat..... )    if a cupcake and a lip balm had a baby this would be it!!! this is an amazingly moisturizing lip balm its 100% natural and smells amazing. I hope Treat never ever ever discontinues this product! I will be buying more of these for gifts and also for myself love love love this lip balm its magical!</li>
    <li> Reminiscent of childhood days because of the jumbo tube, this lip balm will make you smile for many reasons.  Smells like butter cream frosting has just a hint of sweetness to taste, and then it makes your lips feel amazing, leaves me with soft supple lips... perfect for kissing ;)</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very moisturizing and smells so great.  I use it at night to help keep my lips from getting so dry.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It&#x27;s huge so I can&#x27;t lose it and it gives my lips a soft petal pink sheen to them. It is scented but very subtly so it&#x27;s not overwhelming. Can feel greasy if you use too much but this will last me forever!</li>
    <li> the packaging itself makes the balm look like a gluestick, which is good i guess because you get a lot of the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it really just seems like an average lip balm to me, except one that smells 10x sweeter. i already feel a little bit nauseous from the smell but i suppose some people can handle, or even enjoy that. i bought this because of its excellent reviews, but i&#x27;m disappointed that there is next to no tint in this lip balm. i will use it though, because it does a good job of moisturizing my lips, but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again because of its lack of color and overbearing smell</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm junkie...when I&#x27;m down, a lip balm is an inexpensive way to lift my spirits. This lip balm smells fabulous -- I feel like I&#x27;m in a bakery when I put it on. But the smell dissipates quickly, which is good because it&#x27;s very sweet. The ingredients are simple and natural, except for some coloring because this balm is tinted, which is another thing I love. It&#x27;s a very soft color, not very noticeable, which is great if you want to keep reapplying this (as I do) because you don&#x27;t end up with silly, bright pink lips. This balm is also huge, so it&#x27;s a great value. Now I want all of the Treat flavors!</li>
    <li> It tastes really good. Lol it also works great. It leaves a nice gentle shine on my lips and stays on. You also get a lot of it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> One of my fav lip balms! This makes your lips feel so soft an it has a perfect buttercream smell to it. Lasts a long time too. Would def buy agsin! :)</li>
    <li> I really love this product much more than I thought I would. It smells fantastic. It keeps my lips feeling very soft and subtle. I use it during the day and at night as a treatment and it has kept my lips in great shape. There is a slight pink tint to this version which I love!</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm junkie and this by far is the absolute best I have ever used. It not only keeps my lips soft and moisturized but taste heavenly!! I am addicted to it :)</li>
    <li> Kandee Johnson from YouTube highly recommended this so I tried it. This balm smells amazing, just like pink buttercream. It is made so well. I don&#x27;t feel excess residue after applying it either. I will be buying 2 more: 1 for my makeup bag and another for my nightstand!</li>
    <li> I love both the pink and vanilla buttercream lip balms sold by Treat!!! They have a nice light scent, but very delectable and they moisturize wonderfully, best of all the ingredients are all natural. The pink is a little sweeter smelling and tasting than the vanilla but they are both amazing! Never overpowering, just sweet enough; in fact my boyfriend even likes them and he doesn&#x27;t like many of the balms or glosses I wear because of texture, smell or taste.  I loved them so much I did buy a ton as presents for a bunch of my girl friends and had a hard time giving them away because I love them so much haha, but I love the huge size-- it will last forever so that&#x27;s how I was able to let the others go :) I think the huge size is cute and love showing it off when I use it! I keep one at my office, one in my bag and one on my nightstand so I can use it before I go to bed at night and it keeps my lips moisturized until I wake up! I also just want to say that this doesn&#x27;t get a fishy smell or lose scent over time and the consistency of the balm doesn&#x27;t change over time either, even after I&#x27;ve left one in my car overnight. Lastly, I want to mention that some lip balms have broken me out around my mouth and this does not give me any acne and does not leave a gross, greasy, or sticky feeling. I JUST LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TOO!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other balms and products sold by Treat! Thank you Treat!!!!! :)))))</li>
    <li> great moisturizing balm.&lt;br /&gt;i really like this and i do not have to re-apply this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;the coconut oil makes my lips feel moisturized even after i dont have the product on my lips anymore!&lt;br /&gt;love this!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FORGET TO SCRUB YOUR LIPS WITH A LIP SCRUB AT NIGHT AND THEN APPLY A GOOD AMOUNT OF THIS.&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL HAVE AMAZING-SOFT-MOISTURIZED LIPS.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have EVER purchased. It&#x27;s completely worth the price and I will never go back to regular Chapstick. It smells great, it&#x27;s adorable and my lips are just perfection. I am in LOVE with it. Thanks to Kandee Johnson for the recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY. BUY THIS. I may have to buy 100 more tubes so I can give them to everyone.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this per Kandee Johnson and I do love it! It will definitely be a must have from now on!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  I rated this only 4 because the tint is not really a tint in my opinion.  I have the regular (non-tint) one, which I would rage 5. The balm is moisturizing, softens, and tastes nicely.  Big tube for the price.  Will definitely be ordering the other flavors soon.</li>
    <li> I love this company, but this was the most disgusting scent. It smelled and tasted like play-dough. I have purchased many balms from this company before, but this has put me off a bit.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Just bought the marshmallow &amp; I highly recommend them. Apply it every night before bed. Not tested on animals &amp; have great natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This smells good but didn&#x27;t help my dry lips at all . it is very big !</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this from the actual TREAT website, but I wanted to review it, so:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good lip balm! It smells sweet, like a vanilla candy cake. It&#x27;s also the most moisturising lip balm I&#x27;ve EVER tried. However, it&#x27;s not tinted whatsoever. I even swatched it on my wrist (which is unbelievably pale), and not the slightest tint showed. Overall it&#x27;s a great lip balm, the jumbo size is fantastic, but if you purchase this with the intension of having a tinted balm like me, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> OMG this is the Holy Grail of Lip Balms.  The texture is phenomenal and the flavor even better.</li>
    <li> I put this on every night before bed. It smells great and the large size makes application so easy. It&#x27;s just one of those pleasant, quick, go-to items, and makes the normal size lip treatments seem less appealing. I have 10 in my drawer but I&#x27;m bummed if I can&#x27;t locate this one!&lt;br /&gt;My sister even took a picture of it while visiting me, so she could get one for her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-Fall 2014&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I ordered this again and hate it. The fabulous smell is gone and it&#x27;s no longer a pleasure to apply. Treat-what happened?! It&#x27;s like a nasty, old stick of glue now. It never did have a tint for me, and I&#x27;m very fair, but now there are no redeeming qualities at all. How disappointing!!</li>
    <li> After 4-5 uses I noticed that my lips were looking softer.  It isn&#x27;t the least big sticky like so many lip balms.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little sticky, not like chapstick</li>
    <li> My daughter also ordered one and we both love the Lip Balm.  I was trying to order another one and was already sold out.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. I ordered it because I had heard about how soft it could make your lips and I have horribly dry lips so I jumped on this. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was so big lol. It smells great and keeps my lips soft and moist. I love the look on peoples face when I pull it out of my bag :0 lol. I would highly recommend the is product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this balm exceptionally amazing and the tint is non existent so that is a bit annoying since it is marketed as tinted. It is most definitely clear. I even swatched it on clear paper and its clear. The tube is definitely JUMBO so don&#x27;t expect it fit cutely into your pocket or anything. The smell is fantastic but that is the only stupendous thing about this product. It smells just like cake mix/cupcakes.</li>
    <li> I have tried all lip balms on the market, cha...pst..k, bli...x, bur....bees, niv...ea and all the rest on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Most caused additional drying. Non actually helped to heal my lips. This lip balm is unique, it actually started healing the dryness. My lips are moist and comfortable. Minimal ingredient list, natural and made in the USA. The tint is so beautifully sheer along with a delicious buttercream taste. The tubes are the perfect size (larger than most). I can&#x27;t say enough about this lip balm. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best we&#x27;ve found for moisturizing lips!  Lasts longer than others too. Big size is easy to apply, harder to lose :-)  This had more vanilla than the vanilla one that we got.  We like the scent.  The pink isn&#x27;t enough to color lips pink.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and HUGE!!! It makes my lips moisturised. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the smell is too strong. ( I like the smell, just that \\&quot;too much\\&quot; of it makes me dizzy) When I apply it, I will just stop breathing for a few second. I can continue to use but I will not put it near my nose and smell. It is huge so not convenient to bring out. Not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product purely to make up the difference on my order as a &#x27;filler&#x27; for the $25 free shipping (before I had Prime). I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie and have almost everything under the sun. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very moisturizing, definitely on par with the ChapStick and EOS lip balms, which are my go-to products for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the novelty factor (over-sized), which I kinda like. It makes it a lot easier to find in the bottom of your bag ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent, I don&#x27;t in any way find it over-powering, which I noticed in a couple of reviews. You notice it on your lips for a few minutes and that&#x27;s about it. I am, however, addicted to smelling it. Its sweat, kinda like a cupcake, but not sickly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative - and reason for 4 stars, not 5 - is that I don&#x27;t notice it being tinted at all. It gives a slight sheen, like any lip balm, but there&#x27;s no possible way to build up any sort of color. Compared to drugstore brand&#x27;s that have specific tinted lip balms, this is no different to a clear balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of my last point, I would still repurchase this item and recommended it to friends. Its become a fast favorite.</li>
    <li> This one is amazing!! The texture is smooth and the flavor is subtle but tasty. I will be purchasing many more of these!!</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  It is not tinted at all and I noticed after a couple of weeks of daily use it did not help lips from becoming chapped.  It tastes ok but not very strong,  I probably won&#x27;t use any longer i&#x27;ll stick with my strawberry Chapstick it&#x27;s only $1 and it really protects my lips and actually has more color than this &#x27;tinted&#x27; lip balm.  Sorry Treat I really wanted to like you :(</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get a lot of people asking you why you&#x27;re using a glue stick on your lips. Just tell them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;mmm....!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;MMMM...hmmmm..MMMM&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like this but mainly use it at night to keep my lips moist (especially when I have a cold and have to breathe through my mouth).  The size is large and not as convenient for carrying in a purse that&#x27;s why I use it at home.  The smell and flavor are quite good.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a little pricey until I received my order. The tube is big enough that the lip balm will last a long time making it one reason it&#x27;s worth the price. I have to say it is the best lip balm I have ever used. It feels great on and makes my lips stay moist and very soft. I&#x27;m constantly trying to keep them moisturized and soft with no luck until now. I keep one in my night stand and put it on before bed as well as when ever through out the day. I even put it on with my one flip sticks and lipgloss and it looks and feels great either way. A great product I highly recommend. :)</li>
    <li> Great lip balm, ordered another one before the first ran out. It is a very big tube, good value.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to list the number of different products I have tried.  I had very flaky, peeling lips and they HURT.  This made my lips absolutely smooth, hydrated and perfectly plump within VERY FEW DAYS.  I very much dislike unpleasant tasting products.  I want something that tastes yummy...a little treat for my sweet cravings without reaching for candy or desserts.  This is YUMMY.  THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST OUT THERE.  I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS.  I AM HOOKED.  I don&#x27;t go out of my way to post reviews.  I did for this stuff, though.  It&#x27;s just that great!</li>
    <li> To me, the scent was sickenly sweet.  I can tolerate sweet scents and I suppose I am not the bigggest fan of them...but this I just gave away.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing about it from a youtube guru. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of hype and wanted to know what it&#x27;s all about. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special. It moisturizers fine and of course lasts forever due to its size. It just wasn&#x27;t worth the hype for me. There&#x27;s nothing terrible to say about it, I just won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Leaves a residue on my lips, and it not very smooth or creamy - as you would expect from a buttercream.  Used it once, threw it away!</li>
    <li> Yummy super moisturizing, non greasy balm. Generous amount too the tube is huge. Love the natural ingredients and no petrolatum.</li>
    <li> Unlike the lip scrub, Treat really got me hooked with this one. The sweet vanilla-buttercream scent is just strong enough for me(Or someone within kissing distance... oo-la-la!) to notice, but not overpowering at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell like an artificial version- My mother is a baker, and this is what her vanilla-buttercream frosted cakes smell like. Not to mention, my lips are softer than they have ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, love it, buy them all!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels and smells so good... It makes you lips feel amazing and my hubby loves how it feels when we kiss. Thats really all i got...</li>
    <li> Handy and it works great.  I am elderly with dry mouth and lips.  I never have to worry about my lips anymore.  Fits in pockets and small hand bag easily yet is big enough you won&#x27;t miss your lips and can get the job done with one swipe</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic, but it doesnt seem to moisturize my lips as it claims to. If I were to buy it again, its only because of how great it smells.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received and old one or what but it smelled like Play-Doh, only worse. No yummy pink buttercream at all. Then tube was twisted up a little as well so there tube wasn&#x27;t actually full. Definitely would not repurchase nor recommend.</li>
    <li> This lip balm reminds me of yummy cupcakes and I love the packaging. The smell is wonderful without being over powering and the consistency is smooth. I don&#x27;t see any color on my lips from the product so I don&#x27;t think it is tinted but I really don&#x27;t care. It works so great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer and she said she liked it a lot.  She would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this chapstick!! It makes your lips feel so soft instantly. I put it on at night right before I go to bed and I woke up with wonderfully soft, supple lips. Even my husband uses it!!! Definitely want to buy again, thinking about the coconut cream this time!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but it is not tinted. You get zero color on your lips from this product, which is fine, but its described as tinted. Feels nice.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands of lip balms and glosses, from the ultra-highend boutique brands to drug store lip balms... I was hoping to like this one, because vanilla buttercream! How can you go wrong??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a pic of this balm next to some other brands for size comparison. This tube is definitely bulky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re expecting tinted lip balm, you will be disappointed. There is zero noticeable color from this balm.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is cloyingly sweet and synthetic smelling, like cheap plastic baby dolls. Yuck! I had to wipe it off because it was making me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got old expired stock or what (there&#x27;s no date printed on the tube), but the texture is &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;, like the oils are separating. It does eventually melt smooth, but it&#x27;s not a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy several tubes from My Lip Stuff or Lush, the quality is far superior to this mediocre lip balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. With all the hype this gets I thought this would be amazing. People who love this must never have tried a quality lip balm. This has hard tiny bumps in it. It&#x27;s very grainy; not smooth on the lips. The moisturizing properties works fine which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one. If you can get past the grainy texture and the fake-sweet taste then it&#x27;s a perfectly average lip balm. The large size also makes it tricky to apply well. Will never repurchase or recommend. Get some natural lip balm from etsy or make your own; it&#x27;s smooth and smells delicious, and is ten times more creamy and moisturizing than this.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it I love it.  It smells great and last for a long time, useful for dry lips.  It&#x27;s a daily necessity.</li>
    <li> Smellllssssss DELICIOUS  keeps my lips soft thought  out The  Day and i dont even have to apply alot Thank  you !!!!!!</li>
