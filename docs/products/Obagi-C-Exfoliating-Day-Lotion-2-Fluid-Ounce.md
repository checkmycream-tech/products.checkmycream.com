<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion works great to keep my face smooth; it even controls oil on humid days. My dermatologist did not suggest I use&lt;br /&gt;this but even she noticed an improvement in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> I have used many day lotions and really like this one.  It is not to heavy and does not cause breakouts.  My skin feels very smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> first time i use this, i usually use obagis exfoderm. But i perfect for summer time, soft and smooth and use this after i use obagis C vitamin serum in the morning</li>
    <li> Sticky, I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to purchase this for her to help in her dry skin. She has tried most of the other available skin lotions/creams on the market with little help. Finally, it was alternating with this as well as baby oil that she&#x27;s not peeling any more. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product! Obagi is superior to all other skin care regimes in my opinion. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those other products. As an esthetician, I have seen actual results from my own experience as well as my clients. It is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> At this point I&#x27;m about to place a second order for this product.  I really like it so far but mainly at this point for how it feels to use.  I like the thickness and richness and really like the container...you squeeze it and the cream pops up.  very user friendly.  I have dry skin and I do love the way my skin feels all day with this lotion.  so far, I can&#x27;t say much else after a month of use...i just love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product regularly and absolutely love it! My skin is radiant and glowing, a must have! Quick shipping and quality product! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Does wanders for my aging skin!</li>
    <li> I have used Obagi products for years and I am 50.&lt;br /&gt;It must do wonders cause no one can guess my age.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is flawless.  I began using C products&lt;br /&gt;about a year ago and love them even more than the&lt;br /&gt;original Obagi line.  It keeps your face looking&lt;br /&gt;young and keeps wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Delivered quickly and as promised. Good quality product and less expensive than in the dermatologist&#x27;s office. Worth the extra $$ compared to drugstore fair.</li>
    <li> Its a great product for my skin type which seems to be on the sensitive side. My face looks very fresh and glowing after applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer followed by Revision Intellishade Broad-Spectrum SPF 45 Tinted Moisturizer. And, the price at Amazon is half what I&#x27;ve been paying at the dermatologist office.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now.  I first purchased it at a skin specialist&#x27;s office and now see it marketed in my local hospital which, in my eyes, gives it more credibility. I really like it and I use it every morning.  My skin feels soft and moisturized, but not greasy. It is also gentle and non-irritating.  Also, just a small dab goes a long way. I get ample coverage with less than a pea size. So, the 2oz bottle lasts me about 3 months, making it an ecomonical choice for me, as well. Try it, I think you will really like it.</li>
    <li> Light lotion for my combination skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years now and a bottle lasts for approximately 3 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> have been using for about 6 months. it goes on well but still feeling, for my skin type, a bit oily.  like the product though so i use a matte finisher as well. Would like to see it with some level of SPF.</li>
    <li> This is a great product from a great store. I never have any prob ordering or with the product. Obagi C is the best stuff. It keeps my face gloowing and really helps prevent break outs.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin softer and clearer and I am on my 3rd bottle now. Not too strong and irritating on the skin.My skin is more glowing and seems firmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion to go under my regular lotion in the morning. I absolutely love this product as it gives my skin a youthful glow. It is great a moisturizer by itself as well. I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product has a strong smell.  Not a bad smell, but a strong florally, rosey smell which gives me a headache.  The ingredients list shows fragrance.last on the list.  It should be first as this is the first thing you will notice about the product. It might work great, but I won&#x27;t know.  The smell will keep me from using it any longer.  My eyes are burning as I write this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice basic day product to use under make it during the winter months in MN. I like the feel and finish of Obagi and will definitely look at the other products offered by this company.</li>
    <li> Love Obagi. Keeps my skin clear and moisterized. Would definately recommend it to anyone. Especially if  you have roseau, [sp].</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference using this lotion.  I love the other Obagi products, but this lotion sort of dries out my skin.  It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep skin young.  Very concentrated so it lasts for a long time.  I definitely recommend to use.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this day lotion!  I use it each day after washing my face.  It smooths my skin, works very well as a sunscreen under makeup, and smells wonderful.  You hardly have to use any, so the small container lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Obagi Pore Therapy Saliclic Acid 2% and they have cleared up my post menopausal acne like nothing else has.  I&#x27;ve tried weekly facials, laser facials, microdermabrasion, prescription topical medication from 2 different dermatologists, and nothing has worked like these 2 products have.  I now use them religiously.</li>
    <li> All of obagi products have made me look five years younger. I looked young before. But now. My pores are smaller and I have a youthful glow. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I had no idea this product had multiple parabens - do not use this. It should be banned. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> After wonderful recommendations from friends, I had high hopes of being able to use this product. However, I am very disappointed in the  exfoliating day lotion. It caused a burning sensation and rash on my face.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.  Lotion is light and smells good.  I&#x27;ve used it everyday for the last 2 weeks and havn&#x27;t seen any difference in skin texture or clarity but I&#x27;ll keep using it because Obagi is a very good line and it was recommended to me by my esthetician.</li>
    <li> I had NO results....just a bland moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I still get the regular Obagi #4 but alternate between it and the Obagi C Day Lotion. My skin appreciates a little variety!  For night time, I use the Obagi C Night Crème and a small dot of Retin A.  I go two days on, one day off with the Retin A. This routine keeps my face looking fresh which is pretty cool for a 63-year-old guy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nu Derm Gentle Cleanser, Toner, C Exfoliating Day Lotion and the Hydrate Moisturizer. I used these products for a week before I saw my aesthetician. She told me my skin looked REALLY great! I literally noticed a difference after the third use. I AM using the products together. Cleanse, tone and moisturize morning and night. I use the C exfol in morning before moisturizer. At night I use MBI Renewal Lotion PF before moisturizer. This combo is def doing work right now! Of course I had head of Obagi but never used it. Totally impressed. Skin is SUPER clear, dewy and toned.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product several times. I use this in my daily facial routine. After running out, I attempted to eliminate it from my daily regimen but found my skin didn&#x27;t feel as soft and nourished. Have added this product back and within a few days, I can already tell the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I need more obaji products.  In particular I need obaji night cream and obaji tretinoin cream 0.05% as soon as possible</li>
    <li> If you have had any treatments or not this is a good product for skin care. does not cause my sensitive skin any problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week, but noticed that it keeps the oily shine to a minimum.  It does exfoliate and tighten the skin.  No visible reduction of hyperpigmentation, but it might be too soon to notice.  I&#x27;ve used Obagi Nu-Derm&#x27;s full line with prescription tretinoin followed by the blue peel. This regime was excellent for reduction in fine lines and hyperpigmentation, skin tightening and lightening.  Part of the process required that exfoliation occur so your skin will dry and peel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for aging and oily skin.  You need only a little bit and it gives moisture without being greasy.  It is light and  little goes a long way.  I have used many, many products and this one exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. This small bottle lasts almost a whole year. You only need a very small amount each time you apply it. Ordered and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I have been using for about two months. Got it from a skin company that does it all. I am 40. Been searching for years for a product that makes my skin bright and evens tone. This works right away! I do NOT wear foundation anymore because of this stuff. Makes my skin radiant!  I put it on...it tingles.. and instantly looks smooth and bright. Take it from someone who has tried everything! LOVE! smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best cream although it is quite expensive.....But if it works , Its all about Beauty at my age.....Right!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years. I keeps my skin moisturized and exfoliated. Whenever I go to long without using it I notice my skin builds up and I have more break outs. My regime consists of this day lotion and SPF 30 every morning. Most people think I&#x27;m at least 5 years younger than my actual age.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I purchased this product and I love it and would recommend it.  A little goes a long way, it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling, however, my face does feel hydrated all day long.</li>
    <li> love the smell but for the price not worth it it just cause my face to break out. I don&#x27;t get some break out in a while. I just want to exfoliate and reveal a newer layer of skin, sadly OBAGI doesn&#x27;t work for me. VERY PRICEY too</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  It feels perfect, smooth, non-greasy and pleasant fragrance.  Just wish it came in a larger portion.  I would like an 8 oz.!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years- it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face and seems to do what I want it to do.  Will stick with this product!</li>
    <li> cant live without this moisturizer. i have oily, hormonal acne prone skin and this does NOT break me out (dont get the spf one, that breaks me out!) and moisturizers my skin. it leaves it extremely dewy afterwards but thats ok because i put powder on anyway before i go out. has vitamin c in it so even better! good stuff and im on my upteenth bottle already.</li>
    <li> The best day lotion that I have used, Obagi products are top quality!  I&#x27;m 50 years old and many people that I meet think I&#x27;m much younger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on and off for 3 years.. it does the trick! I love it.. you have to follow instructions for it to work properly if you are a lazy person and expect an over night miracle this is not for you.. get surgery or blue skin peel..</li>
    <li> I have been using this Obagi C-exfoliating Day Cream for about 2 years now.  It has 20% glycolic acid and really helps to slough off the dead skin from my face.  I get many compliments about how nice my skin looks and at 70 years of age, I&#x27;ll take the compliment.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a BAD OBAGI PRODUCT! ALL GREAT PRODUCTS AND DIFFERENTLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON YOUR FACE.  My problem is where I have to get them since I live in Key West FL, Amazon have SAVED MY FACE! and my purse.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> The product was sent in a timely manner and the seller has reasonable shipping charges for multiple items to Canada.  The product itself has been amazing for my normally fair dry sensitive skin.  It has not irritated my sking at all and has provided a lovely \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin as an added bonus.  All in all this product delivers and I have been a cosmetic guinea pig and have tried everything under the sun in the quest for skin perfection!</li>
    <li> I used the Obagi \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; that included cleanser, balancing toner, serum, day lotion, and night lotion for about 2 weeks and my skin ended up extremely dry. I&#x27;m 43 years old and was hoping this product would provide some aging reversal.  I felt like I needed to reapply moisturizer to my face about midday.  I guess you need to consider this system is \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; your skin to even out the pigmentation.  The dryness effect seemed to create wrinkles rather than help as indicated.  Product is not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product as always</li>
    <li> I use with the complete line of Obagi C.  This is very light and non greasy. No odor at all unlike their night cream that has an odor I do not care for.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi products for years and I love all the products. This moisturizer is great for dry weather really does the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while.  It&#x27;s a good product.  I would definitely recommend it friends.  It&#x27;s a five stars for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any lengthy experience with this product as today was the first time that I have used it.  The smell is why I gave if four stars. It is highly perfumed, and it is almost overwhelming, so I won&#x27;t be able to use it everyday. The minute I put this on my skin it seemed to give great results, and my skin looks dewy, and the texture is really nice. It is not too greasy, and leaves a soft feel to your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion after the C-Serum. Love this product! The bottle is small enough that you can travel with it which is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Obagi products are all around the best by far.  Does what it says and is worth the money. Great stuff</li>
    <li> This is an excellent day lotion.  Not at all greasy or heavy, and absorbs very quickly.  I use this with the other Obagi C products and find my skin is very soft and balanced.  It does exactly what it says, exfoliates, so you will notice flaking every now and then.  With continued use that does go away.</li>
    <li> item arrived in a few days. packaging was good. price was fair. so far not seeing any diffrence with the product but gonna give it some more time. this product was recommended by dr. oz so gonna give it a try</li>
    <li> I am new to using Obagi line. The exfoliating lotion works well with my skin. I didn&#x27;t feel any burning or tingling as soon as I applied it on.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m 38 have tried TONS of moisturizers....from Avon ($5) to Estee Lauder ($100).  I would describe my skin as \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; and flaky at times.  I was afraid to try this due to my sensitive skin and the word \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot;.  However, this stuff is amazing.  Some reviews say \\&quot;glowing skin\\&quot; and that is the exact effect that it had on my skin.  Totally moisturized throughout the day (uncommon for me), makes my makeup look amazing, no stinging or irritation and most importantly, no breakouts.  I just ordered two more bottles.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it...which means it&#x27;s probably going to be discontinued.  That&#x27;s how it works for me.  If you can&#x27;t decide whether or not to order it, you should.  Give it a try and hope that it remains on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I  have been using Obagi products for at least 5 years and feel that I get great results.  A little goes a long way which helps make them more cost efficient in the long run.</li>
    <li> This product makes skin absolutely glowing. If I could have only one Obagi skin product, this would probably be it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Sealed and price was a definite savings. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a fair evaluation</li>
    <li> Great product.  Vendor was prompt and product fresh.</li>
    <li> Love the price and great product, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, Ive been using it for years. This is the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi for 2 years and love their product.  I use their whole line and my skin looks incredible.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use the other line of products because they are really strong.  I have been using this line for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is next in line to the TNS serum as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I know it says it&#x27;s a day lotion but I sometimes toggle between using this and the TNS serum.  I wake up the next morning feeling like my skin is tighter and it is more vibrant looking.  I highly recommend to anyone:-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Great on any skin type. I use twice a day.  My face is better than I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I have had nothing but GREAT results with the entire Obagi C RX system.  This lotion is light, absorbs well, and has a nice light scent.  I have extremely sensitive skin and I have no problems with the C RX system. My skin looks so much better. Sun spots and freckles have faded and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I recommend this product as part of the whole system or at the very least along with the night cream (although I understand it has temporarily been taken off the shelves). I have fair skin and like I mentioned, very sensitive skin.  I have been using this product for almost 5 years now.</li>
    <li> I got my first bottle of this cream from my doctor. I get complements on my skin all the time so I&#x27;m hooked! Just use a pea size drop for your whole face.</li>
    <li> best skincare product i&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s better than having a peel every week! amazing results very quickly with daily use</li>
    <li> I have been an Obagi user for years and this is an easy to use product that helps keep this mature face look fresher.</li>
    <li> Once you start using this cleanser, you cannot stop. Your skin feels so clean and it does not dry it out either.  I have been using the Obagi C RX system for about 4 years now after first being introduced to it by my demonologist.  I was buying the products through their office but they were very expensive.  I find that this is less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi Clenziderm for about a year.  Since my skin has cleared up from acne.  I wanted to try a product that would tackle my aging skin (dark marks, enlarged pores, dryness, wrinkles).  I&#x27;ve used this product, with the C RX cleanser and the serum and I am so happy with the results so far.  My skin looks healthier, the pores are a lot smaller and less visible, and there is a glow to my skin now.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a couple of weeks ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, and i definitely see the difference in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother, pores are more refined, and it&#x27;s much more glowy! I won&#x27;t use another day lotion again.</li>
    <li> I AM AN ESTHETICIAN AND REFER PATIENTS TO THIS PRODUCT DAILY. ITS AMAZING TO SEE THE SKIN AFTER ITS USE.</li>
    <li> My wife really a fan of Obagi  and she loves this product. She told me it works great on her.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to using this product but the first, I don&#x27;t like the smell and the second, I&#x27;m getting outbreak on my face.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates well.  I like the texture of it and how it looks on my skin,  would recommend.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot at one time.</li>
    <li> my beauty secret: makes me look 10 years younger</li>
    <li> Did not really like this product. Did not realize there were over 4 different Parabens preservatives in the product and it caused a lot of irritation.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for some time.&lt;br /&gt;Its a wonderful facial product and definitely gives great results after regular use.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. It smells good, it is not slimy, and it absorbs right in. A little goes a long way. The only problem is that the plastic dispenser on top of the squeeze bottle consistently falls out after owning the bottle for more than a month. It is seriously annoying to try to pour a little onto your fingers only to pour half the bottle onto your hand after the little plastic thing falls out.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by this, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.  Perhaps it&#x27;s not as effective on my skin any longer?  Either way, my skin never looks worse after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells amazing and healthy. Always makes my skin look refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi exfoliating lotion for years. Can&#x27;t seem to find anything else that works any better for me. Keeps my skin looking good.</li>
    <li> My skin already seems to be healthier and smoother.  My sun spots seem to be lighter as well.  Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Not sure it is effective in my skin...will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is my holy girl face cream it makes my face looks so much brighter and youthful.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff, truly works.  but SOOO expensive!</li>
    <li> Same product lower price! Love it! I use to buy from a doctors office but won&#x27;t anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Obagi is my favorite product of all time.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi products and this even helps keep an older face moist. Yes I would recommend to every man or woman.</li>
    <li> I have had to stop using this product after some research I found that this product was going to be banned.  Too many chemicals and warnings for me.  I am going all natural these days.  My skin thanks me for it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for 2 weeks, but what I do like about it so far is that it goes on and is not greasy. I use in conjunction with the obagi Sunscreen.  It is an extension of the monthly Microderms/Laser treatments I get.  I personally think it needs to be used along with other treatments and/or Retinol A.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I have been using Obagi cleansing and day lotion for 5 years. At 65 years old I continue to get compliments on the great complexion Obagi has given me. I specially like that it has sun block. Go with this one. Its topical and feels great.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi products to begin with (can&#x27;t go wrong with Obagi) but this one smells sublime.  I don&#x27;t see any specific improvements with this product over other Obagi products, however - they&#x27;re all good but weigh costs.  If you can find 4 for less, that works just as well for tightening.</li>
    <li> I used this exfoliating lotion for just few days and my skin started to feel dry and irritated. I stopped and gave myself a break .  Then I tried again, but did not feel any better, so I stopped using it.  Maybe. my skin is just sensitive to this lotion.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was not authentic as I have seen no results whatsoever. I have used the original Obagi C in the past and the results were amazing from the start. Next time I will spend the extra money and buy straight from an Obagi retailer.</li>
