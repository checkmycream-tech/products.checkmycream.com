      <li>I give It five stars all the way, and believe that I doesn&#x27;t give five stars to any Item very easily.</li>
      <li>It couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
      <li>very sweet, Buy It.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag (ouch) and very easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>super product.</li>

      <li>but it should be able to survive an occasional drop.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>It works great and cuts close but not too close to end up cutting you.</li>
      <li>It bent it to the point that it was scraping against the casing making a terriblly loud noise.</li>
      <li>Its more expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>Can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful!!!</li>
      <li>Just a normal drop but enough for it to bend the blades inside to the metal trimming head.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a decent nose hair trimmer.</li>

    <li> Worked until i dropped it &amp;#34;once&amp;#34; on the bathroom tile floor. Just a normal drop but enough for it to bend the blades inside to the metal trimming head. It bent it to the point that it was scraping against the casing making a terriblly loud noise. It did do a great job before I dropped it but it should be able to survive an occasional drop. I mean its not a chicken egg.</li>
    <li> works great! super product.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I do wish the motor part wasn&#x27;t quite as bulky as it is. It would have been nice if the batteries that came with it actually worked.</li>
    <li> I tried a couple of different nose hair trimmers before finally doing some checking online and ordered this one. Very glad I did. This one actually cuts the nose hairs and does it painlessly. Its more expensive but worth it. This should be the last one I will buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he said it is the best trimmer he has ever had. The battery lasts forever and the trimmer actually cuts instead of plucking.</li>

    <li> Just what I wanted. Works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this model about 3 Yrs ago and it still works great. Seems to run forever on a battery.</li>

    <li> great piece of machinery, easy to clean and works great</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.  It has an irritating plastic cap though with a poorly thought out pocket tab.  Who puts a nose hair trimmer in their pocket?</li>
    <li> excellent product&lt;br /&gt;It operates is great</li>
