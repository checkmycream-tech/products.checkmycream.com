      <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied.</li>
      <li>LOVE this curling wand.</li>
      <li>More than when I get my hair done at the salon.  </li>
      <li>she waits for the new one to warm up then good to go using both heads</li>
      <li>Love this, its so easy now to curl my hair.</li>
      <li>The temperature reaches 400 and it does the job, but I found that a lower heat worked better for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It seemed like using a curling iron might not be the best solution based on video tutorials (although I am still curious to try).  </li>

      <li>The barrels are easy to remove and place back again, it heats up beautifully</li>
      <li>I use it, but it definitely gives me that beautiful wavy, but not curly look.</li>
      <li>Overall, it makes your hair look great.</li>
      <li>It does take time getting comfortable with it.  </li>
      <li>the tempurature settings make me comfortable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a good product thus far.</li>
      <li>It takes forever and a day to use and the body I get looks neither good nor natural.</li>
      <li>This arrived exactly as it was described!!</li>
      <li>However the barrel both taper quickly and causes the hair to easily slip to the skinny end while curling.  </li>
      <li>Super easy and fun!</li>
      <li>The wand becomes very hot very quickly.</li>
      <li>So far I have been very pleased with this product.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s great for long hair!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It heats up very fast and I love the auto shut off button as well as the fact that you can so quickly change from tighter curls to more large wavy curls.</li>
      <li>Loved it  and MUCH better than expected!  </li>
      <li>I use my exhaust mechanic gloves so she doesnt have to wait for it to cool</li>
      <li>Also I don&#x27;t like that a full glove was not provided.  </li>
      <li>and the adjustable barrels are cool to experiment with.</li>
      <li>If you need a glove I suggest buying a full one instead of using the 3-finger glove provided.  </li>
      <li>I was able to curl my hair with a straightener for a bit, but it was very time consuming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a novice when it comes to curling and my hair curls pretty easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product!! Totally ditched the curling iron. I have more control over my curls. And my curls never held for very long with a curling iron, with the wand they last all day.</li>
    <li> This arrived exactly as it was described!! I love how my hair looks after using this curling wand, and it is very convinient that it had two barrel sizes! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Curls stay in so well</li>
    <li> The way the roll goes from thick to thin makes it hard to make the curls because they keep sliding to the smaller side. Maybe my difficulty using this product was due to my lack of experience and if so, I would not recommend it to inexperienced users.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new to it but it is really time consuming unless you know how to use it. I went to retail stores and just one barrel was the price of 39.99 and here online is the same price for 2! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the tempurature settings make me comfortable i know i&#x27;m not burning my hair.</li>
    <li> I looked up a video on youtube to learn how to use it, and it worked, its perfect. Curls stay very nice for at least 2 to 3 days. I didnt even use spray until the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It perfect, I am in love with it and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I like that the wand has two sizes of barrels that you can interchange and that it heats up quickly.  However the barrel both taper quickly and causes the hair to easily slip to the skinny end while curling.  Also I don&#x27;t like that a full glove was not provided.  It only covers 3 fingers and you can not use it with your left hand.  I use both hands for curling so my left hand is left unprotected.</li>
    <li> Every woman on planet Earth should have this curling wand. I wont lie I was a bit apprehensive about ordering a curling wand off of Amazon, but I trusted my gut and went with it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. The barrels are easy to remove and place back again, it heats up beautifully and I love the fact that they give you the three-finger glove. It doesn&#x27;t get in the way, however it saves you from getting burned. I love the results I get, cute little spiral curls that last all day!!! Also don&#x27;t be afraid to use this if you have short hair, I&#x27;ve read so many reviews from women stating that the wands don&#x27;t work on my short hair. First off, you can&#x27;t just use any type of barrel if you have shorter hair&#x27; ummm DUUHHHHHHHH! Get it together people! You also have to know how to use a wand. Practice makes perfect. Go watch some tutorials on YouTube and get the stick out your butt. Overall, this is a great, great  product and you will definitely be satisfied if you purchase. I hope this helps</li>
    <li> Perfect! Easy to use and does exactly what it says! It takes a few tries to get used to it but it&#x27;s all worth it once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> My name is Jennifer and I have been wanting to try a curling wand for a long time now and can&#x27;t afford the expensive ones used on a lot of  beauty youtube videos , so, I went looking and researching them on the net.  I decided giving this one a try because it came with two size barrels, the barrels taper, the barrels don&#x27;t attach with clips, and the price was right.  Those were the only factors of the purchase since the other features that this wand has a lot of other wands have those same features.&lt;br /&gt;  This package arrived quickly and was packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;  I was amazed at using this curling wand for the first time.  The curls came out looking amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t take long to do this hair style since it heats up to  450 degrees.  I would suggest using a heat protector spray so the extreme heat wont damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I only gave 4 stars because it would have been nice to have a full glove given with this wand instead of a 3 finger one.</li>
    <li> We are still learning to use it!!! Seems pretty good!!</li>
    <li> I found it very difficult to use.  I bought it for my 12 year old and she has trouble using it</li>
    <li> Because its better than the rest! :D Also, it very easy to use. HANDLE FOR THE TANGLE! Whoop Whoop Whoop!</li>
    <li> Not getting the curls I was hoping for as quickly as I was hoping…I don&#x27;t think I have the time or patience to use this device.  not ideal if you have children or need a quick style fix.  not the item&#x27;s fault….i should have known better.</li>
    <li> After having struggled for years with traditional curling irons I finally found something I can manage!  I have tried both barrels and am extremely pleased with the resulting curls.  Sometimes hair does slide down when you are trying to wrap it around the barrel.  (I have long hair so there&#x27;s quite a bit to wrap)  I find that holding the barrel a little more horizontally until I have all the hair wrapped helps.  The glove that comes with the curling iron is not really functional.  The idea was nice but it&#x27;s a 3 finger glove that makes styling your hair harder.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Conair is the brand I most often buy and I am new to this wanding idea of curling my hair.  The fact that I could get 2 sizes in the same package for the least price mad my decision for me and I am happy with both for different reasons.  Great buy</li>
    <li> My hair constantly slips on the wand, making it difficult to keep the hair spaced for a wider curl. Also, I never received the protective 3-finger glove. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> So I thought I wanted the smaller barrel size, but I wasn&#x27;t sure... So happy I discovered this combo pack on amazon!!  Turns out I like the bigger barrel better, but I still use the smaller one when I want a tighter curl.  My hair would not curl with an iron, but it curls every time with the wand and it wasn&#x27;t too hard to learn how to use.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this for a couple weeks now and am kinda irritated at how my hair keeps sliding down the curler making it harder to curl from top to bottom. I think I just need to get the hang of it because I have seen others on youtube use it without that problem.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift.  The person receiving it loved it.  She is still using it and says is just what she wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like the interchangeable wands. Heats fast and works great! Don&#x27;t even need hairspray to keep curls all day!</li>
    <li> Given to a 13 year old who wanted it.  It is replacing a worn out curler and had it recommended to her by friends.  So far she is very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a novice when it comes to curling and my hair curls pretty easily. I always have issues with ceramic devices so I either overlooked that this is ceramic or it wasnt listed. I think the taper makes the curls fall faster and makes it slightly harder to curl the ends. I. Dont have the same problem with straight barrels. Also, my hair got really frizzy with this wand, with both barrels I tried.</li>
    <li> Received my wand about 2 weeks ago, it&#x27;s very easy to use and curls look perfect! The wand becomes very hot very quickly.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted the normal or big barrel and this had both! Curls/Waves come out amazing. Super easy and fun!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have this quite down yet, not as easy (or as fast) as a curling iron. Still working on it.</li>
    <li> Never worked. Parts didn&#x27;t click, tops fall out. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I had an old crappy curler and in comparison this one does wonders.  This is the first curler that curls my hair without product and actually stays.  I love it and it instantly smooths and give me a bouncy curl.  The larger barrel is huge and my hair that goes down to my middlish back doesn&#x27;t really work with it but the smaller works wonders.  I have also used it on family who have above shoulder hair and the smaller barrel works great for them too.  I would suggest buying a better glove though if you think you&#x27;ll need one because the one that comes is for left hands only and is pretty crappy.  I am comfortable using my bare hands but if you&#x27;re not I&#x27;d buy a nicer glove.  Overall this product is fantastic and I would definitely buy it again for its price and quality!</li>
    <li> First couple times it just didn&#x27;t curl. It heated up, though. But now it works very good, heats up fast, cools down in normal speed and it has very convenient auto- turn off.   Curls are wonderful, still lil bit dries up hair. \\&quot; Half-glow\\&quot; is not inconvenient: constantly slides off fingers. Put 4 stars only because of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a clap curling iron for years and bought this set just to see if there was a difference, let me tell you there is! The larger wand gives bog beach waves and with some root lifter and spray it lasted all day.  The smaller wand just needs rootlifter and it lasts for about two days. The temperature reaches 400 and it does the job, but I found that a lower heat worked better for my fine hair. It was hard to get used to the change between clamp and no clamp, and the three finger glove is useless, just learn it without the handicap. Overall I like the pair of wands.</li>
    <li> Love it, I use the larger barrel more often. It&#x27;s been a good product thus far.</li>
    <li> Best purchase for myself, love this wand and have been using since it arrived. Haven&#x27;t tried the smaller barrel but the big one that came attached has put nice curls and body in my hair that lasts a good time.</li>
    <li> its fast and love big curls. but im always buring my ear lol love it though. and i like that it comes in 2 sizes</li>
    <li> I have found this a little difficult to use, especially when you are right handed &amp; have to hold with the left hand when you do the other side. I think it would be easier if you didn&#x27;t have to hold it upside down, very awkward when trying to style the back as well. If you are the one styling someone&#x27;s hair it would be great. I think using a regular curling iron is easier than using the styling wand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas because it is what they asked for.  They were quite happy with it but you really have to be careful with it because it gets really hot. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it for a young child.</li>
    <li> Awful. I so wanted this to work, but it doesn&#x27;t. Particularly with layers. It&#x27;s too slippery and achieving the desired curl is practically impossible. I was hoping the learning curve mentioned in other reviews was the issue. It&#x27;s not. It takes forever and a day to use and the body I get looks neither good nor natural. I also accidentally turn the want off multiple times per use, as the on/off switch is a poorly positioned place and easy to hit. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This wand is fantastic, the two sizes are prefect!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, the option to have two sizes is great</li>
    <li> My favorite wand ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use the bigger barrel to curl my hair and get tons of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH IT. and the adjustable barrels are cool to experiment with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am not able to figure how to use this or if it just doesn&#x27;t work. Whenever I try it on my hair I end up looking like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket while doing the ice bucket challenge.</li>
    <li> I got this item earlier than expected which was a great surprise! I used it the same day for a party that I was going to that evening. It was so easy to use and curled my hair perfectly in no time at all. I am so happy I made this purchase. I have naturally medium to thick long wavy/frizzy hair and this wand just helped define my waves and tame all the frizz. I love it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing. My curls bounce back even after running my fingers and BRUSH through them. Don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray. It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> We gave this to our daughter for Christmas &amp; it is just what she wanted to make her hectic life just a little bit easier!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling wand combo! I have very thick, straight hair. Curling irons do not hold curls at all. I was able to curl my hair with a straightener for a bit, but it was very time consuming. With this curling wand, I&#x27;m able to curl my entire head in under 30 mins, and it lasts well over 24 hours. I actually prefer using the larger barrel, sleeping on it, and letting them loosen up. Easy to use, minimal burns in one year of having it (only because I&#x27;m clumsy), the glove is useless -- just be careful. People frequently ask if my hair is naturally curled after I use this wand. It takes some practice to get the technique down if you&#x27;re not used to wands, but you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> After a bad experience getting my hair blown out, I was determined to learn out to create my own wavy look.  It seemed like using a curling iron might not be the best solution based on video tutorials (although I am still curious to try).  I&#x27;ve only used the wand about 4 times so far, I and keep getting better and faster each time.  I agree with many people who said it&#x27;s difficult to keep your hair from falling off, and I seem to have more of an issue on my left side than right side, but I am getting better.  I just have to make sure it&#x27;s at a specific angle that I can hold it tightly on there when wrapping (I seem to do it naturally on my right side, just not on my left).  It&#x27;s also easier to keep your hair from slipping on the smaller iron.  Initially I pulled out a lot of hair when it got stuck in the crevice where the iron snaps on.  I have super long, somewhat fine hair so I do need to use a little hair spray afterwards, and I use a heat protectant with a light hold in it to start (redkin) - it works great and stays all day.  I think I&#x27;ll like it the more and more I use it, but it definitely gives me that beautiful wavy, but not curly look.</li>
    <li> The curl stays in all day.</li>
    <li> i love this product it gives me amazing curls whether just for day to day or for a night out</li>
    <li> The stitch is very thick, even the thinner one, so don&#x27;t buy it if you have short hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;I think the seller should remind the buyers.&lt;br /&gt;Other features are very neat, the price is decent, so I will save it to give my friends, but I will buy another curling wand that is good for my short hair.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves it. she said the curls are perfect, and its easy to use. She is recommending it to her friends.</li>
    <li> Curls stay for days!  It is awkward to use at first, but a couple days practice and I didn&#x27;t need the glove any more.  It does take time getting comfortable with it.  For those that rate it bad because their hair didn&#x27;t turn out as they wanted- don&#x27;t rate the tool poorly if you don&#x27;t have the patience or skill.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for a photoshoot. It was great because of the interchangeable barrels.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron. My daughter has an instyler which was almost 3 times the price of this. So far I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling wand. It was my first time switching from a normal curling iron to a wand, so I did some research and ended up deciding on this one after reading some reviews and watching some Youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy that I did and I dont think I&#x27;ll be going back to the regular curling irons anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very fast and I love the auto shut off button as well as the fact that you can so quickly change from tighter curls to more large wavy curls. The glove that they give you in the box was pretty useless and only covers three fingers, so it&#x27;s constantly falling off. I decided it was too much of a pain to keep the glove from sliding off my hand so I stopped using it. Luckily no burns yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 months with great results!</li>
    <li> This was great!  I liked that I was able to purchase a 2-in-1 item.  I really like the curls that it gives my hair.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and makes perfect curls and waves. It only took me  5 minutes to curl my long hair. I&#x27;m so satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had to return this item as I have shorter hair and it will only work on really long hair....The description was hard to figure out exactly what I was purchasing.</li>
    <li> dont listen to the bad reviews people dont know how to work it or they are stupid.... Girlfriend uses it daily and you get that salon quality with some practice of course but you will get it within two-three times using it.... (be careful too!!!!! you will burn yourself at least once when you try to minipulate it for the first few times the glove works just trying to work the hair and holding the wand right takes getting used too) the other bad comment I dont like was about swapping heads and they are retarded if you cant figure it out dont make the product sound bad just return it if your too dumb to use it..... you twist it lefty tighty and righty loosy if i remember right easyly swapping heads....... I use my exhaust mechanic gloves so she doesnt have to wait for it to cool I grab it hot put the other one on she waits for the new one to warm up then good to go using both heads gives her hair depth/ makes it look like she paid for it and I like how she goes from tight curls to bigger poofy ones you can be an artist so have fun.............</li>
    <li> I bought this product to make those big sexy waves that are so fashionable right now. It works great, but it is a little tricky to use. The hair easily slides to the ends of the wands making it hard to hold in place since the barrels are slick. Overall, it makes your hair look great.</li>
    <li> The wand works great but it takes a bit of practice to wield. The glove only has three fingers and was a bit difficult to use. I just did without it but be careful because it&#x27;s hot. The temperature setting  is great, I used the lower too because the higher settings almost fried my hair.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of Conair but this iron works. Takes some technique but gets really hot. You can&#x27;t beat the price either. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The curling wand works great! I love the different heat setting and different sized wands. It&#x27;s easy to switch between the wands and the little glove that comes with the wand is very helpful to prevent burns</li>
    <li> i have to say that i was scared bc i read pretty bad comments but my hair was mission impossible to get curl but this curly iron is doing miracles!! God Bless!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this iron!! Still going strong after 6 months</li>
    <li> Loved it  and MUCH better than expected!  The two wands will spoil you and you&#x27;ll never go back to just one size again.  Allows you to style your hair in a multitude of very fashionable ways.  Arrived ahead of time, which was very appreciated!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought these new barrels were better than the old curling irons.  I will say it heats up fast, stays evenly heated, and is easily interchangeable.  The glove provided is pointless and awkward.  If you need a glove I suggest buying a full one instead of using the 3-finger glove provided.  Also, there is no mechanism to prevent the hair from sliding down the barrel.  Furthermore, since I have to hold the hair, I can&#x27;t achieve a curl to the end of the hair, so every curl has a straight end.  This can be OK sometimes, but I would like more variety.  I give this 3-stars merely for the functionality and not the quality.  If you like clip-less barrels, this was a good buy for the money.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to regular curling irons in the future.</li>
    <li> Get a smaller barrel size if your hair does not hold curl well.</li>
    <li> Item worked great a few times and then quit working all together.  If I&#x27;d bought it at a physical store, I could take it back, but Amazon won&#x27;t take it back. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for long hair!</li>
    <li> Love this, its so easy now to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> I just used it for the first time yesterday. It works great.</li>
    <li> This wand is great and really easy to use.  I like both sizes equally.  The larger size gives more beach waves and still looks really good the next day.  The smaller size gives a more polished look, but it doesn&#x27;t look as good as the larger barrel the next day.  I&#x27;ve definitely recommended this one to friends.</li>
    <li> Pro:  Two different sized barrels  The barrel heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Con: My ringer finger has fallen victim to the 3 finger glove.  Changing barrels is a little tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t picked up a curling iron since high school (we&#x27;re talking 80&#x27;s) so there was a learning curve on my part.  After three attempts, I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.  Used the smaller barrel on my 8 year olds (long hair), who were thrilled with the results.  Recently used the larger one on my own hair (shoulder length) and received raved reviews.  More than when I get my hair done at the salon.  I&#x27;m sold on that fact alone.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!! I could never curl hair in the back with a traditional curling iron. I have very long straight hair and I can curl it in about 15 minutes and it lasts all day!!!</li>
    <li> very popular with 20+ daughter!</li>
    <li> This is awesome  and heats up very quickly!</li>
