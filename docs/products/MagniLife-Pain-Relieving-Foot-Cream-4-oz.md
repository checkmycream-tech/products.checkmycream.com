      <li>Best $20 you will spend for quite some time!</li>
      <li>Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t lose its effectiveness over time but for now it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for myself!</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s worth more than words can express.</li>
      <li>This stuff certainly isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
      <li>/&gt;He said to tell everyone this is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a very good cream for pain due to arthritis.</li>
      <li>but in the end figured with so many positive reviews I&#x27;d give it a whirl</li>
      <li>This is glorified foot massage cream, does not do anything special, will not re order</li>
      <li>not totally but makes it more bare able, with a good foot message.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a true pain relieving foot cream on this planet.</li>
      <li>Although this doesn&#x27;t completely take away my hurting legs and feet, it does a pretty good job at night helping me get to sleep.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>but I compared a competing product in my local pharmacy and suddenly this looks like a great price!</li>
      <li>It smells great and not &#x27;mediciney&#x27;, works instantly and really lasts.</li>
      <li>got here quick too.</li>
      <li>I bought this produce because of the strong positive reviews.</li>
      <li>It allowed me to sleep for the first time in months, and even to begin walking again!  </li>
      <li>Magnilife working OK so far.</li>
      <li>I could not find it on the shelves of WallGreens or Rite Aid where I had purchased it before, but, I saw it on Amazon and purchased it right away.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because this is the first time in 2 years my husband&#x27;s feet feel great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Burned my sensitive skin on first (light) application; had to return</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad that I bought it for her.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why they keep the price high!!</li>
      <li>i could buy ice hot or any over the counter cream probably would work just as well an smell as they do</li>
      <li>Really works!  </li>
      <li>Only they make more money from selling it as &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Also, my skin is so much softer!</li>
      <li>Was skeptical about this cream but seen more good reviews than not so bought it</li>
      <li>I was very skeptical but decided to give it a try and am very happy I did, from the very first day I started using this</li>
      <li>To be honest I was very skeptical purchasing this despite the good reviews.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to try and dilute it with another lotion since it&#x27;s a bit pricey and the jar is not all that large, one of the pitfalls of the product</li>
      <li>When it showed up in the mail I instantly slathered it on my whole foot and waited with baited breath... and felt cool relief withith 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>It feels good during application but that dissipates quickly as it&#x27;s rather thin</li>
      <li>This stuff really works</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s $14.88 at my local Walmart.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Amish formula.</li>
    <li> I tried it and used it every day, no results for me.</li>
    <li> It helps but to expenceive to keep up.</li>
    <li> Like all the reviews say.....this stuff works...i was getting stabbing pains from my neuropathy and wasn&#x27;t getting a good nites sleep.  I bought this and omg it really works and i was skeptical.  Thank you for making a product that helps with the pain of neuropathy.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a whim, with no expectations at all.  Wow, was I surprised!  I felt relief within moments of rubbing it into my feet.  It allowed me to sleep for the first time in months, and even to begin walking again!  Don&#x27;t like the smell, but its a small price to pay for relieving my burning pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price here on Amazon is not reasonable.  Get it at Walmart</li>
    <li> This stuff really works</li>
    <li> Great product, my husband uses it on his feet.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I have bought a number of creams for my neuropathic disease called RSD.  It is very painful, all of the time.  I have bought many creams.  They work okay for awhile also.  I would have to say for the price, this works the best.  And you get more.  It seems do deaden the pain for awhile.  I would definety recommend.  Feeling relatively pain free is priceless.</li>
    <li> not much help.... but maybe just not for me</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Will probably order again.</li>
    <li> I like it it works I well buy more good price of hank you</li>
    <li> The product does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to help. It only makes me feet feel hotter than normal and doesn&#x27;t reduce the foot pain.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works for him. Some days he only uses once a day instead of twice</li>
    <li> This cream is very good. I do wish the price would come down though. Its why I only give it 4 stars. There is nothing on the market like it to relieve foot pain. Magnilife knows it. That&#x27;s why they keep the price high!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and so far it seems to reduce my neuropathy pain.</li>
    <li> I had foot surgery 4 weeks ago and as I have healed, I have developed the worst nerve pain I have ever felt! Picture this: your foot is &amp;#34;asleep&amp;#34; and is just starting to wake up and it&#x27;s painful to move or touch from the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; pain... that&#x27;s my foot all the time now! I desperately searched the Amazon archives for help and this cream popped up on top of the search list. When it showed up in the mail I instantly slathered it on my whole foot and waited with baited breath... and felt cool relief withith 5 minutes! The actual cream is white, thick, and kinda smelly. The smell is similar to icy hot and vicks mixed together and I definately wash my hands after use. The nerve pain definately is eased when I use this cream but not 100% gone. It works just enough to give me relief and I follow the &amp;#34;gooping&amp;#34; with an ice pack on my foot to add to the relief. 2 Weeks later, I still use it twice a day to help the nerve pain and I&#x27;m hoping one day I will be able to stop using it...</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream for pain due to arthritis. It has also worked on my knee pain due to surgery. I have given it t several people to try and they also have be buying this product</li>
    <li> Having diabetes and the accompanied foot neuropathy I get plenty of that lovely shooting pain in my feet / toes. To be honest I was very skeptical purchasing this despite the good reviews. (Gotta give Amazon creds for its reviews! It&#x27;s what I like most about Amazon. People helping their fellow shoppers by taking the time in sharing their experience is so beneficial. I&#x27;ve even searched reviews when having issues with a purchased product looking for tips and usually find great advice from other reviewers.) Back to the review... I was honestly doubtful a cream would have much of an effect on nerve pain, just seems odd to me. I did see some reviews which gave a little of the science behind it but in the end figured with so many positive reviews I&#x27;d give it a whirl and I&#x27;m happy I did! This is my 2nd jar and it certainly does work! While it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate all the pain it is a BIG improvement! Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t lose its effectiveness over time but for now it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for myself! My feet look and feel better. I started using it every day but found I get good results using it every couple of days as well. It does have a strong smell (Smells like Vicks vapor rub) this doesn&#x27;t bother me but will get the attention of others in the room when applying it. This stuff certainly isn&#x27;t cheap but I compared a competing product in my local pharmacy and suddenly this looks like a great price! If you or a loved one has foot neuropathy, buy this now. Best $20 you will spend for quite some time!</li>
    <li> I bought this produce because of the strong positive reviews. I guess I expected too much. I have diabetic nerve damage and it does nothing for that. It is a good moisturizer that I put on at night but it does nothing for the pain and I should not have expected that. There is no magic bullet.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a true pain relieving foot cream on this planet. This is one of those creams that makes promises it cannot fulfill.</li>
    <li> Have neurothropy foot leg pain and thos stuff works . Within after a few minutes of application the pain leaves</li>
    <li> Magnilife working OK so far.</li>
    <li> i could buy ice hot or any over the counter cream probably would work just as well an smell as they do</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> best pain relieve product I.ve used on my feet  saw some relief first time I used within 1 week use very seldom  On my 3rd jar takes very little and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This cream was a very, very pleasant surprise for me it works so well I was even able to go without it for a couple weeks before the pain returned. It does smell a little like the old-fashioned BenGay but  you don&#x27;t mind because it works so well.</li>
    <li> After using this product and not thrilled with the results, a friend of mine recommended &amp;#34;SIMPLY KOOL&amp;#34; foot cream in health &amp; beauty on EBAY.  I read all of the reviews first and found nothing negative, all positive.  It is reasonably priced in comparison to other products and I must say that it works really well.  I can now sleep through the night. I have Diabetic Neuropathy and Gout in my feet. So much pain and burning that I could hardly walk or sleep through the night.  I would recommend &amp;#34;SIMPLY KOOL&amp;#34; to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was for my sister!  She loves it!  I am going to buy her the Leg cream now!  I recommend!</li>
    <li> My mother is diabetic and has neuropathy and with this cream the pain is none existent. Thank you so much Magnilife keep up the Exceptional work.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months with great pain relief, the best part is it&#x27;s not another pill. I could not find it on the shelves of WallGreens or Rite Aid where I had purchased it before, but, I saw it on Amazon and purchased it right away.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever purchased.  Not only does it work excellent but I have been a return customer and will continue</li>
    <li> its good to help with neuropathy pain my husband experienced after chemo therapy. helps to treat the pain associated with it.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this is the first time in 2 years my husband&#x27;s feet feel great.&lt;br /&gt;He has had pins and needles and stiffness and aches and burning.&lt;br /&gt;He said to tell everyone this is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend MagniLife Pain Relieving Foot Cream to anyone who has diabetic foot pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana S.</li>
    <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t completely take away my hurting legs and feet, it does a pretty good job at night helping me get to sleep.</li>
    <li> Great feeling after rubbing on my feet.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Burned my sensitive skin on first (light) application; had to return</li>
    <li> Bought this at the request of my elderly mother. Although it didn&#x27;t work for the neuropathy in her feet she uses it for arthritis in her hands and says that it works wonders. She puts it on her hands like it&#x27;s a hand lotion at night and it has provided her with relief through out the night. Overall I&#x27;m glad that I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> Provides temporary relief of pain in my feet  from my neuropathy.  Will continue to buy more when this is used up.</li>
    <li> I read reviews carefully on all of the products that make claims to help diabetic neuropathy before deciding to purchase this for my husband.  He started using this immediately after we received it and said it really does help.  It&#x27;s not a cure, but it&#x27;s something to help tolerate the discomfort to some degree.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this 3 times, it is great to ease the pain .</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my sister who suffers from diabetic neuropathy and pain in her feet.  She found this product to be very helpful in relieving the pain she has.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone suffers from nerve pain associated with diabetes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any online yet but will. I got some at Wal-mart and love it. It helps with the stinging and burning in my feet and helps&lt;br /&gt;soften my feet and stops the peeling. I will definitley by this.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not as good the magic socks with a TENS device. Not close really.But took the edge the weird tinglilng and numbness and aches before I knew I was a diabetic with neuropathy. As a moisuturizer the cream isn&#x27;t so bad. Not like perfumed, silky stuff you pay a lot more for, but a dual purpose product it&#x27;s nice added bonus.</li>
    <li> works great use it every nite and makes my feet feel better ..  love dealing with amazon and your orders come quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on Gabapentin  3 times a day and the pain was still so awful I couldn&#x27;t walk. I constantly had a severe&amp;#34;frostbite&amp;#34; feeling and stinging along with that feeling of your feet being made of wood and numb at the same time. I used a very small amount of the cream over both feet for the first time today. That was hours  ago and it still is working. It doesn&#x27;t take all the pain away but it makes a BIG difference in the pain level. I love this stuff.For the first time in years I have gone about the day without trying to endure the nerve damage and sitting down.</li>
    <li> After three weeks the nerve pain in my foot remains the same.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  It&#x27;s a temporary relief, about an hour, but for those who suffer from neuropathy in the feet and hands even an hour of relief sometimes makes all the difference. When I wake in the middle of the night from the pain it allows me to relax and bit and sometimes get back to sleep!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to try and dilute it with another lotion since it&#x27;s a bit pricey and the jar is not all that large, one of the pitfalls of the product but I have not done this yet.  Guess I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t work as well and I am so thrilled with the relief personally I&#x27;m OK with the price.</li>
    <li> Works but not as shown on site.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Save your money.</li>
    <li> great cream it has been worth every penny . I use once a day right after my morning shower and do not have pain unless I do something abnormal then I will put a little more on and it works again.</li>
    <li> I like this foot cream.  It smells a lot like Ben Gay, but it works well.  I rub it on at night before bed and put on a white sock.  It definitely relieves the pain.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My 92-year old mother has neuropathy pain in feet and legs.  She said this did nothing to relieve the pain.  Topricin is the only cream that helps.</li>
    <li> Really works!  Great to sleep through the nite without pain/stingling of my feet….Wear socks after I put on the creme and massage my feet...</li>
    <li> Skeptical, I ordered it for foot nerve pain, following back surgery.  Did it stop the pain ?  No, but  it sure helps. I use it at night, &amp; put a sock over it to get a good nights sleep.  I&#x27;ve bought it a a local drug store twice since my original order.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of feet problems, but my heels start to ache and feel a little numb at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream in the morning and night for a week straight, and I do feel like there&#x27;s been an improvement.  Also, my skin is so much softer!</li>
    <li> I have peripheral neuropathy and it has helped with my foot pain to some degree. I have found it cheaper in the store when I can find it.</li>
    <li> I am currently in the opening stages of very painful foot neuropathy. While waiting to get to the doctor I was in dire need of some releif and sought whatever offered that. This product does work. It&#x27;s not a cure all but it is effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my husbands foot after reading the reviews. He lost all of his toes in an accident and has considerable nerve pain. After using this once in the morning, the pain recedes for the remainder of the day. He&#x27;s been using it for about a month and I just ordered more as it&#x27;s still working.</li>
    <li> This seems to be helping the Nerve Damage in my feet, so will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Thus product really helps with the pain of neorpathy</li>
    <li> Can not tell that it is helping at all but my neuropathy is from chemo not a diabetic problem.</li>
    <li> This is glorified foot massage cream, does not do anything special, will not re order</li>
    <li> It made my feet feel comfortable and soft but did nothing for the actual pain.</li>
    <li> Pleasant odor. No problems since I started using it. I will be certain to keep an extra jar on hand. Works on calves, also.</li>
    <li> Encourages one to massage area in pain.  Didn&#x27;t note much improvement in pain level several minutes later...</li>
    <li> I really wanted this cream to work but it&#x27;s not long lasting as I anticipated. It feels good during application but that dissipates quickly as it&#x27;s rather thin and it never feels like it&#x27;s penetrating. Very short term lasting.</li>
    <li> I believe I already posted an awesome review, but wanted to share something amazing that happened this morning.  For those with severe neuro in the feet, sometimes you get a phantom itch.  One you cannot scratch (like you just want to stab a knife in your foot).  Well, it happened today.  I took a makeup sponge (that way I don&#x27;t get it on my hands) and put a nice dollop where the phantom itch was.  Within 5 minutes, the pain was gone.  5 minutes!  The pain was radiating up my spine, I itched my foot with a hairbrush to no avail.  Seriously - this stuff is a godsend.  I&#x27;ve already gone through 1/2 a pot and will have to order more.  Thank you MAGNILIFE!</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price as usual!  Thank you.  Expensive, but one of the few that works.</li>
    <li> relives the pain in my feet</li>
    <li> It is good but like all other foot creams for neuropathy, it has sporadic success.  I will buy it again, however.</li>
    <li> tried it once and it looks promising... smells like Vicks</li>
    <li> Consistent in quality; helps keep neuropathy pain under control, especially when applied at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from Diabetic Neuropathy for 3 years now, I&#x27;ve been on Gabapentin which only caused severe ankle swelling and Tramadol which seemed to have no affect and then my Neurologist put me on Lyrica (100mg 3xdaily) which finally gave me some relief. Before I knew it they had to increase my dosage strength because it quickly became less and less effective. That was within months of being diagnosed, fast forward to today and I,ve now been taking 300mg 4xdaily and sometimes that isn&#x27;t even enough to make the pain bearable. At these high doses though the side effects are very bad so believe me when I tell you I have tried a lot of Herbs, Pills, Creams, Patches, etc... Over the last few years and have not found anything that has helped, that is until now thanks to Magnilife. I was very skeptical but decided to give it a try and am very happy I did, from the very first day I started using this I have cut my Lyrica in half and I can&#x27;t express how happy that has made me. I know this might not work for everyone out there but I am living proof that there is hope. It does not eliminate the pain 100% but it calms the nerves in my feet better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried and when you have to live with constant burning, tingling, stinging in your feet all day, everyday when something like this comes along and helps you get back a little better quality of life it&#x27;s worth more than words can express.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t touch my nerve pain.  The only one I&#x27;ve found so far that noticeably works is NERVANA.  I sure wish it had worked.</li>
    <li> ONLY WORKS FOR A SHORT TIME. NOT VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t actually help with nerve pain in my feet. I have neuropathy and the product just didn&#x27;t do the trick</li>
    <li> Apis Mellifica is not &amp;#34;derived&amp;#34; from honey bees. It is a plant commonly called Veronica. Look it up. Gnaphalium is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. Common name is cudweed. It is not &amp;#34;derived&amp;#34; from daisies. Gelsemium is a genus of flowering plants belonging to family Gelsemiaceae. The genus contains three species of shrubs.  Gelsemium is UNSAFE. All parts of the plant are very poisonous. Even small amounts can cause serious toxicity. All and all, this product is just another homeopathic remedy, equivalent to snake oil... Only they make more money from selling it as &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from peripheral Neuropathy.  I have used different creams, medical tape, whatever I could find.  very little help.  I have also spent $50 per pair for socks which are a help, but this is so much better.  And cheaper!  I have even had to darn one of the socks!  If you are looking for help with your neuropathy I recommend you give this product a try.  Also by the way, MagniLife has a cream for Restless Leg Syndrome,  Another maddening problem.  It does the job!</li>
    <li> smell made me ill I take komo cant stand strong smells</li>
    <li> No apparent pain relief. Softening qualities are so-so. Would not buy again, but will use up this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell -- no relief yet.</li>
    <li> It really does work. Haven&#x27;t found anything even close to it. I will be ordering much more, because I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shari Land</li>
    <li> I suffer from poor circulation and a weak heart. It has been really hard to keep my feet moisturized as a result. My brother asked the pharmacist about the best cream for this and she suggested this. It is totally miraculous. It smells great and not &#x27;mediciney&#x27;, works instantly and really lasts. I could feel its healing qualities right away on all of the areas near knuckles and places where the foot naturally folds. Best foot cream I ever used - and I have used many.</li>
    <li> I use it on my Mom who has diabetic neuropathy.  She says it brings her comfort.</li>
    <li> does what it says. I will order again. got here quick too.</li>
    <li> It helps some, but is too expensive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good, but does give some fairly good relief for awhile.</li>
    <li> Before I tried magniLfe I could not sleep due to my feet burning .&lt;br /&gt;After I used MgniLifr I have not had any problem with neuropthy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husbands feet as he has shooting pains in his feet due to being a diabetic.  Was skeptical about this cream but seen more good reviews than not so bought it and it does relieve his foot pain, not totally but makes it more bare able, with a good foot message.</li>
    <li> it seems to do the trick</li>
    <li> I have Diabetic NEUROPATHY in my feet, which is very painful.  It bothers me more in the winter, so I have used this foot cream every year. I put it on at night time, then put socks on, because it is very greasy. It only take very little cream to do the job.  If you have never used it before, it takes about 4-5 days for you to feel the difference. It really works to dull the pain.</li>
    <li> Does help relieve foot pain.</li>
    <li> Great for diabetic neuropathy pain.....</li>
    <li> Great relief! ........says it all</li>
