      <li>I use a 30% salicylic roll on more than 3x a day and don&#x27;t wash it off and don&#x27;t even peel from it.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feel and am working up to longer times on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Mostly.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing, removing the outer layers of the skin to encourage more growth.  </li>

      <li>This Pumpkin Peel is EVERY BIT as strong as what you will get at any office offering peels.</li>
      <li>It was more of a reaction to the peel than true burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it definatley helps with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to peels and thought I&#x27;d be fine to leave it on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> works better than going to the spa.  if you have sensitive skin, try 10 minutes on.  i did the full 20 and it burned a little bit more.  make sure you apply a neutralizer and accompanying cream with it.  Overall, it works for me. save me money</li>
    <li> Love this peel. It is quite strong so  I feel you should start slowly with this. Seems to continue working even a few days later and I had a mild peel from it. Would definitely order again</li>
    <li> This a great product, It lasts along time and will do many facials, start with a short amount of time till you know how your skin reacts, keep in the fridge between uses.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  Works as good as any I&#x27;ve had professionally.</li>
    <li> This peel is really great. I was a little concerned with how my face would react to it but I had no problems. I use it once a week and once it peels my face feels smooth and refreshed. I have even started to see some dark spots I have lighten up.</li>
    <li> Just be VEEEEERY careful when using this. You will damage your skin if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing ( I almost did).</li>
    <li> Works great, natural but strong.  Must search for instructions before use - can burn if not used properly - must neutralize skin after the peel</li>
    <li> wow!!! very effective - be careful, will be a little strong for most people</li>
    <li> This works. It really does. I did, however, learn first hand that you have to follow the directions. I&#x27;m used to peels and thought I&#x27;d be fine to leave it on. It burned. A lot. That has never happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and it is a great product. It smells soooo good!!</li>
    <li> this worked amazing for me &amp; I loved it! def a must buy for anyone who wants beautiful healthy looking skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like writing a review, but feel it is a must on a product such as this because I know I wish people were more detailed about their use &amp; results from products such as this. First off, let me say; I am not a professional and this is just my experience using this product... It may not work the same for you. Also, I purchased mine from eBay (made a bid so was cheaper) and I believe it is the same product (looks the same and by epidermal peel but seller is chemical peels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this Friday and took it off within 5 minutes. I then used again Saturday (because I saw a review that said they used it 3 days in a row, so I wasn&#x27;t so worried) but this time I left it on 10 minutes. Sunday I only had 3 little brown areas but I did have dry-like patches on my cheeks. (So I know the product was workingand doing it&#x27;s job.) Sunday and Monday I gave my skin a break. Tuesday, since I saw no adverse reaction and figured since I  prepared my skin for peels (I used  [[ASIN:B000052YM7 Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion 10 percent Glycolic AHA -- 6 fl oz]]a month prior), that it would be ok to use again avoiding areas that was already flaking. I started applying to the hyperpigmentation on my cheek and a cut scar area I had, that&#x27;s been healed for years, then the rest of my face. I left it on for almost the full 20 minutes. Woke up the next day with slight flaking on cheeks. So I am hoping by Sunday (when I apply again) I will see the start of smoother skin. I will update in a month to say weather or not this did anything for smoothing out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Oily, Acne-Prone (under control), Large Pores, and even though no whiteheads or pus-filled type of acne... My skin isn&#x27;t smooth mostly on one side of my face. If this doesn&#x27;t work, I will move up to the Skin Image TCA gel and use this as maintenance. Fx (Fingers Crossed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Scar is a little smoother (Less indented) and face is brighter in a weeks time. So that alone makes this a good purchase for me, I just will update if I end up having more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this product had light peeling all over but added a picture to show the area that seemed to peel deeper by the eyebrow. Check it out in customer images. (Woke up to it Monday, 6 days after leaving it on longer.)</li>
    <li> This is a very unsteady peel wouldn&#x27;t use on anyone&#x27;s face! It did work good for feet callus</li>
    <li> Be careful when using this peel it&#x27;s very strong. So don&#x27;t go over 2 minutes if you don&#x27;t know how your skin is reacting to a face peel. And follow the instruction carefully. I use it every other week now and leave it on my face for 2 minutes it works for me. I will recommend this peel to my family and friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now and after going back to look at this product again I notice many reviews stating that they ended up with burns on their face.&lt;br /&gt;This does not actually surprise me, considering the majority of them didn&#x27;t seem to follow the directions word for word and/or didn&#x27;t keep in mind that they have sensitive skin and needed to reduce the time they left the peel on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this peel for 2 MONTHS as often as I can (within reason/directions) and have only gotten up to leaving it on for 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used peels with glycolic acid, not 30%, I had to start off lower to build up to this one.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED A PEEL BEFORE,&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT&lt;br /&gt;I REPEAT DO NOT START WITH THIS ONE, YOU WILL BURN YOUR FACE IF YOU USE THIS FOR YOUR VERY FIRST PEEL.&lt;br /&gt;Before this one i started out with the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;PUMPKIN Face MASK Spa Treatment AHA 12 Glycolic Acid Chemical Peel Facial 2.66oz\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good start, however READ THE DIRECTIONS, you can still burn your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for all the warnings but it seems as if many people are not taking this stuff seriously when you can really harm yourself by assuming the longer you keep it on, the better your skin will look.&lt;br /&gt;Besides all that, this stuff is amazing; a little goes a long way, It has helped clear up acne and made my skin so much smoother, you just need to be careful.</li>
    <li> The smell of pumpkin can&#x27;t mask the insane burning from this stuff. I emailed twice for guidance to make sure I was do everything correctly. My face scabbed, like I had been dragged behind a Jeep going 4x4ing thru a field of cacti. It burned even after the the stuff was off. The baking soda mixture, which was supposed to neutralize the burn, for some reason, created a nuclear reaction on my face, splitting atoms, and recreating a miniature Hiroshima across my cheeks. I considered going to the ER, but felt like an idiot. It took several days to heal, but since the reply email from the company was that they would &amp;#34;talk me through the first peel,&amp;#34; I assumed I had made a mistake and I tried again when the skin was healed. It was an exact repeat of the first episode. I may as well have put a blow torch to my face. And as for the &amp;#34;rewnewed skin cells?&amp;#34; Nothing. Nada. Same old face as before this weapon of mass destruction was put to it.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, how is this even allowed outside a laboratory?</li>
    <li> I only use it once every few months but it definatley helps with fine lines and wrinkles.  It made my skin dry for a few days but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> So I hate,hate, hate this product. I left it on for 15 minutes (jar says 20 minutes for deep peel), and suffered second and third degree burns.  While I&#x27;ve tried other products out there, I must have had an allergic reaction given the swelling I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, take it to a professional.  Or don&#x27;t do it.  If I could upload pictures to prove my point, I would!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Going to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;All who&#x27;s tried just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Send more asap</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Did wonders for my skin. Give it  try, you will love it too! Clears up skin conditions and tightens the skin!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that actually helped with brown spots. It does burn and sting. The first time I used it I left it on for 5 minutes and burned myself. Follow the instructions!</li>
    <li> It was far better and stronger than I thought it could be.  I did not expect it to be so strong and left it on a little too long so I had a lot of redness to heal.  But the Pumpkin Peel is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> actually it burned pretty bad. i only left it on half the recommended time and it left sores on my face. even after neutralizing it with baking soda. It burned holes in my face. I use a 30% salicylic roll on more than 3x a day and don&#x27;t wash it off and don&#x27;t even peel from it. I don&#x27;t know. The pumpkin peel smelled good. For devil in a jar. It&#x27;s been about 30 days since I danced with the devil and I&#x27;ve healed. Mostly. Bottom line: This stuff is no joke. Be careful.</li>
    <li> If you have breakout problems and have tried everything on the market, this is your answer! I have had horrible cystic acne, adult onset and have been battling it for almost 9 years since I was 21. Nothing would help until I started using these products! Now I have clear skin! I only buy from this seller now. All of the masks, creams and washes are amazing. I am in love! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Read the great reviews for this product, so I opted to try it and it really does work wonders in a very short amount of time.  My complexion glows much more vibrantly now and retains a very silky smooth texture or feel to it, with a nice evenly distributed skin tone.  I can&#x27;t see any dark blemishes or red spots anymore either, they just disappeared and faded away within one week&#x27;s time.  Sometimes a product really does work as advertised and this is surely one of them times, so glad I finally found a wonderful peel that really makes me look and feel my very best !!</li>
    <li> Tried quite a few different types of at home peels and this one is the best ever. It clears, tightens, tones and leaves skin lovely.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what is says it will.  I can only keep the peel on for about 6 minutes, it does sting!</li>
    <li> This peel definitely put burn holes on my face, 2nd degree burns. It is ridiculous,  I just want to hide my face in a box. This peel is no joke, I put it on for 5 minutes to get a deep peel, but I instead put huge holes on my face. Think twice before buying...</li>
    <li> I love this pumpkin peel enzyme. It smells so good. I was afraid to use it at first, but wrote to the seller and asked questions, and then gave it a try. I could feel the effect of the product while it was on my face, but it did no harm to my skin, which is sensitive. I think that it will take several uses to notice a big difference, though, and plan to use it weekly.</li>
    <li> This is a serious product! The reviews that are lower because of reaction are most likely due to not following instructions and warnings that come with a professional strength peel. If you are not used to professional peels from a qualified aesthetician, this is NOT the product for you. Try the lower strength to start with. But do try this product line!!!!!! The ingredients are pure and high quality. The owners and employees care about their products and how they work.&lt;br /&gt;How do they work??? I am in my early 40&#x27;s. I have strong oily/combo skin that can be acne prone if I&#x27;m not taking care of myself. I also have sun damage from not protecting myself when younger. I went to a very good aesthetician every five weeks for three years and alternated a peel with really good facials and/or microderm with a vitamin A treatment after each one. I had gorgeous skin...at a cost of about $150-$250 per month plus high quality products and the best mineral makeup in the market today. I moved away a year ago and have not found a good spa here so my skin began to suffer a bit. I always benefitted from vitamnin A and from the benefits of pumpkin as well as acid peels. Because this peel contains all three of the best acids for my skin, I knew it was worth a try. I saw incredible results from the first treatment. It is SO important to follow the instructions and learn from your reaction. I did the three day in a row treatment the first time, but I have strong skin that is used to acids. Now, I do a biweekly treatment and it has kept my skin in great shape with a good cleansing routine and the use of the pumpkin enzyme cream from this company. Because they are professional quality, you do not need to use a lot of product. They will last quite a long time.  I have NO acne and the sun damage/brown spots are faded to the point that I really don&#x27;t have to wear makeup at all. When I do use my mineral base (with spf), my skin is almost airbrush flawless. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;So...buy this pumpkin peel and make sure to also buy the pumpkin enzyme cream to use as serum/moisturizer. It is SO worth it. I am saving thousands of dollars a year with this routine. In addition, the company is EXTREMELY responsive and helpful. I really cannot say enough about these products. P.S. The smell is the best of all the pumpkin treatment I&#x27;ve tried (at least five other product line through spas and my own research)!! It&#x27;s hard not to want to eat it!peel and make sure to also buy the pumpkin enzyme cream to use as serum/moisturizer. It is SO worth it. I am saving thousands of dollars a year with this routine.

    <li> This saved me hundreds of dollars ! My dermatologist uses this as a treatment and I finally found it ! A must have for all skin issues, this is the strongest pumpkin peel on the market!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to getting clinical peels and this one is very strong. Use as directed or you will burn your face</li>
    <li> I found tremendous success with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am a 35 year old woman who has struggled with uncooperative skin. Acne dry oily dull ... It seems that it is always something.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried benzo products, other washes, scrubs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I daily, or every other day, I mix a small amount with my facial lotion and apply. Be mindful of eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best, it works, I am so happy...</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Its the best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used.  Painful (needles) when applied to the skin, but very effective.  I recommend using it once a month.</li>
    <li> Works great,Careful if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this peel. My skin is anything but sensitive, and even i could barely leave it on for 10 minutes, because it burns really bad, but thats what we want right? It gives me a decent peel when i use it 3 days in a row (about 10 minutes each time). The peel lasts for over a week. I only did it twice so its too soon to talk about results. Also i apply it for two mins twice a week and really like it, my face feels so fresh and smooth. This small jar will last for ever too, you only need a little bit each time you use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this peel.  I only leave it on for about 10 mins.  Be careful because it is strong , and it will make your face peel.  It does leave your skin soft, after your skin peels. I use it every 2 weeks. It smells just like pumpkin.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is strong stuff, I have used three times so far so I can&#x27;t tell too much about it but I have noticed that it helped for my whitehead problem. This is seems little jar but I think it will last for a year for me. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have never considered my skin particularly sensitive, but it&#x27;s been 20 hours since this peel and my face is severely discolored. I broke out in hives after the peel and am considering visiting a dermatologist now to intervene with the after effects of this peel. It could just be me, and I don&#x27;t want to make an unfair judgment about the product, but if you think there&#x27;s a CHANCE you might have sensitive skin, stay away.</li>
    <li> burnt my skin immediately.  I had a pimple tried to leave it on a lil longer and burnt my skin... ugh hole there.</li>
    <li> It certainly activated after I placed it on my skin, used a very thin layer, but applied an extra dab on the 11&#x27;s between my eyebrows. I kept it on for 5 min, that was all I could tolerate, skin was glowing after, but the following morning my cheeks feel and look like I got a serious sunburn, one side is getting better but the other is super red, will need to use concealer to hide it. No red sunburn look anywhere else, not even on the 11&#x27;s, only the cheeks. But my skin looks smooth, looks great, no peeling or flaking. Next time I will use for 2 mins.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking I would try this and hoping for miracles....all products that I bought before did NOT work for me. I have to say this is a amazing product and I will buy again from this seller. You will not be sorry purchasing this! High quality!!!! amazing RESULTS!!!!</li>
    <li> didnt do what it said&lt;br /&gt;made my face blood red an burn my face&lt;br /&gt;had to go to hospital will not order no more of this junk again</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Works great.  Love this product.  Works great on my pigmentation issues and wrinkles.  I always keep an extra jar handy to let my friends and family give it try.  I always get asked what product I use and always highly recommend this to them.  Thanks for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> ouch it works but hurts. I mix it with my skin cream for a mild daily peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my miracle product! Works amazing . Never expected such jaw dropping results from any product in such a quick amount of time. .. Immediate results! Simply the best !!!</li>
    <li> it works great for my skin type and condition. I still haven&#x27;t gotten used to how much it stings but it&#x27;s a good product never-the-less</li>
    <li> I worked in high end spas for years in atlanta and had a lot of peels. New to amazon I had no idea I could get spa strength peels without a professional. I was thrilled to find one that had both pumpkin and glycolic together. The feeling of the peel was just the same as the spa peels I&#x27;ve received in the past. My pores are smaller and the dead gunk is gone. My face hurts now but it is my own fault. I left it on longer then I should have for the first time use. Argan oil helped out with the burn. The consistency is good since it is not too liquidy and stays where I apply it. It smells great too. I will purchase peels from this company again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. I waited to use it because of the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;First use I let it stay for TWO minutes and have very mild discomfort no redness at all. Then after couple days pass my skin peel lightly. Nothing major to be concerned, not noticeable peeling or redness.&lt;br /&gt;Second use was week ago and I let it to stay for full 3 minutes. No redness noticed. Peel was a little more noticeable with huge pieces.&lt;br /&gt;My lips peel too. No major results yet just my skin glow. My friend told me you look very relax.&lt;br /&gt;My advise is start slow and move on the next level. that&#x27;s what I did and like it</li>
    <li> I ordered this peel knowing what a pumpkin peel is like. I have had many professional P Peels as well as other chemical peels including Jessner. I left mine on for 4-5 minutes an it burned something fierce!!!!! My face turned really red and my cheeks had a reaction. They swelled a little, were hot and looked majorly burned! Thankfully they were&#x27;nt. It was more of a reaction to the peel than true burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day two the redness was down 50%. By day 3 the redness was gone and the peel was really starting to shape up! I was flaky, dry and I could finally see the peel do it&#x27;s thing. I feel certain that by day 6-7 I should be on my way to great skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, follow the directions and don&#x27;t leave this on for more than 2-3 minutes your first time using it!!!! I am what is know by professionals as having tough skin. My skin can usually take twice as long a peel than most people. With that said, this peel burned the crap out of me day 1 into day 2. Be careful!!!! It does work but is very strong!</li>
    <li> excellent product. I&#x27;ve used alot of peels, professional &amp; @ home, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Burns like crazy, made my face scabby and rough, but did not remove dark spots or fine wrinkles or blemish scars. It certainly did not peel like the women in the picture. It was more like rough skin flaking off. For the amount of down time associated with it and the lack of results, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. I used it three days in a row like instructed, the first day for 5 minutes, the second day for 8 minutes, and the third day for almost 10.</li>
    <li> I use 50 % glycolic rx strength peels up to 5 min home I built up to over 2 years and this peel did nothing on firsrt use for 2 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt no sting nothing. Second time I used it 5 min 26 seconds on stop watch and did not burn or Peel my skin in any way. Of course my skin has gone through any and all old sxkin shedding from stronger peels this I guess ill use 2 x  week for a glow of clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use AHA souffl&amp;eacute; 12% bought here and its night formula that I Swear by , they are super worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 rather deep furrow lines in my forehead I got Botox for over 5 years and stopped 2 yrs ago getting Botox because I bought home microdermison kit, Nu brilliance I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ALSO bought the home Rx strength glycolic peels that are serious STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started at 30% and now built to 50 % ..I could do 60 % but have no spots or  ANY REASON TO USE STRONGER NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks Great to me and we are our owm worse critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont  use /need  makeup and people say I have flawless skin LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tHEY  don&#x27;t know I have worked hard  to get this way plus I drink LOTS OF water a day plus coffee my vice lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For light eye wrinkles I SWEAR BY and will NEVER BE WITHOUT  the SMOOTHIES  wrinkle PATCHES SOLD here ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;along with other  collagen eye patches  ON HERE, made for forehead lines and eye WRINKLE lines to wear over night .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally wake after 3 wks use with ZERO fore head wrinkles any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I immediately do a ice plunge , (fill clean bath sink with ice and cold water and stick my face in it for off and on 5 minutes.

    <li> I have wasted money before on laser treatments, and facial peels at the medical offices. I have paid anywhere from $100 up to $900 for facial treatment. I have hyper pigmentation from treating my face and not wearing sunblock, only makeup. I now wear sunblock SPF 50 over my moisturizer and under my makeup. This Pumpkin Peel is EVERY BIT as strong as what you will get at any office offering peels. However, we are not doctors. So use this peel lightly, and slowly, or you will burn your skin. It will scab up, but it could scar a little. So, be patient and the peel will do its job. I am happy with the results I have in 30 days. My skin is smooth and soft. There&#x27;s still some light brown spots I cover with make up. I can totally tell in under 1 more month I will be able to leave the house without cover up for the first time in a few years! Thank you! Thank you! I will always wear sunscreen now, because brown, dark sunspots are hard to remove, but are almost gone, wow!</li>
    <li> Works terrifically. Cant wait to order again</li>
    <li> Ah fooey on the bad reviews!  I have extremely sensitive skin and took a chance purchasing this product.  I initially tried it out for the first three days exactly as written in the instructions.  I was also very careful to have the baking soda standing by.  It does burn slightly at first but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing, removing the outer layers of the skin to encourage more growth.  After the initial treatment I could see some sloughing of the skin (started peeling a little bit)  I left it alone and gently washed my face.  I love how it makes my skin feel and am working up to longer times on the skin.  The baking soda feels &amp;#34;fizzy&amp;#34; when you put it on but that goes away quickly.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, DO USE SUNSCREEN when using this!  Remember you don&#x27;t want sun damage and this product is making your skin even more sensitive through the healing process.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this tiny little jar to pack such a punch. I applied a thin layer and left it for 5 minutes when I first got it. The next day my skin felt a little dry so I sprayed some Hyaluronic acid and went my way. The day after this....MAJOR peeling. My face looked like I was shedding from a spa facial. I was annoyed at first but then impressed. I only use it every two weeks now due to this but, it leaves your skin feeling and looking awesome. I will continue to buy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember not to scrub or wipe your face harshly for a few days after a peel or you will damage your skin.</li>
    <li> Never really noticed much difference in my skin when using this Pumpkin Enzyme peel .Nothing bad nor good happened .</li>
    <li> I know a lot about peels and this is just a total waste of my money. It did not do anything for my face except to sting when I put it on. It did nothing, I mean absolutely nothing for my skin. I hate to leave such a review but it&#x27;s the truth.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It is worth every penny. My skin is acne prone and it helps exfoliate that layer of dead skin that builds up and causes pore blockages. It does help even out my skin tone and make my face look brighter and fresher. It just feels better after I use this mask. I tend to leave it on longer than 20 mins, more like an hour (YMMV, I worked up to this, do not try it on your first time!) it does cause peeling spots when I leave it on for longer periods of time. This is my favorite mask to use when my skin is feeling dull, clogged up and greasy. I wash my face, dry it and apply a thin layer. It doesn&#x27;t sting unless it gets too close to the delicate skin near the eye sockets but it does itch a little bit as it dries. Make sure to rinse off very well and don&#x27;t get it in your hair, as it can damage your hair. I follow up with witch hazel toner and a good moisturizer. They sent me a sample of pumpkin face cream and it smells delicious, like a pumpkin pie dessert. The mask itself smells like pumpkin pie dessert too, it smells so good! It&#x27;s a fun mask to do anytime but especially in the fall when the smell fits the timeframe.</li>
    <li> First time I left it in my face for 6 min and it did burn my skin so bad. I had red face for 2 days. After that I do 2 minutes once a week. My face gets red for at least one day. But My skin is so soft and after a few times I noticed acne scars are fading. My skin tone is more even and I have no pimples.  Worked really well in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used it four times leaving it on for 20 minutes and did not peel or see any difference, It came very watery out of the jar, kinda like soup. I was very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to use this product since I have used so many chemical peels in the past and had no results to brag about. 6 years ago I had a facial and the esthetician scarred my face, badly. Since then Ive tried to reduce these scars by many means.  I&#x27;ve also had a laser peel 4 years ago ( this time I had a dermatologist ) and loved the results , and this II would say is equivalent to the laser, except the cost is a fraction! I just couldn&#x27;t afford the 5 more laser treatments she suggested.  The first day of the peel I left it on for 10 minutes, and yes it burns! I followed the peel with coconut oil as a moisturizer and turned on my humidifier that night and every night since. The  Second peel was the  following night and I left it on for 20 minutes,and again coconut oil that night and through out the day. It seemed my skin couldn&#x27;t get enough moisture. A lot of flaking, so I do know that The peel is working. The 3rd night another application and all I could take was barely 7 minutes because the burn was quite intense. I didn&#x27;t see any remarkable results, and actually started to regret the peel. until 5 days later when my skin began to recover and wow! Im impressed,&lt;br /&gt;. My sister looked at me and said for the first time in years what are you doing to your skin, it looks great! She is now ordering the peel! Give it a chance, it works.</li>
    <li> Great customer service.  I used the product for 2 min only and it made my skin glow.. week later and it still looks great. I have acne and I have some dark spots. So far I have only used twice and it has helped for only 2 min tops at a time. My skin burned a bit but went away after 5 min or so. The amount of product you receive will last a long time. The product is smooth and goes on evenly. I will recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Use it wisely and when in doubt ask the seller.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! It works great to Clear up blemishes, small scars, freckles, wrinkles, acne etc. My wife and I tried this to see if we could find a product to help us look younger. We have been amazed at all the things it actually does. You have got to try this product! It works miracles.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product and I would not order it again. Very harsh and  not buffered, poor visual results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product ! I have an auto immune disorder which makes my hormones out of whack. It leaves me with horrible acne and hyper-pigmentation. My acne cleared up almost immediately. After the first use, my complexion was GLOWING, my skin wasn&#x27;t dried out from this peel either. I think it&#x27;s the lactic acid that helps the skin retain the moisture. If you apply it one per day for 3 days, you will get a pretty decent peel which helps with dark spots. I have done this and now I use it weekly to control fine lines and acne. AND, this jar will probable last me at least a year, if now more using it on a weekly basis. I literally shake it, open it, then use whatever is on the inside cap, a little goes a very long way. I have let 2 of my friends use some and they just bought a jar for themselves! Literally, a much have for everyone ! From teenagers to elders !</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Love this company!</li>
    <li> thank you for having this product.  i feel that it works</li>
    <li> Amazing but really strong.</li>
