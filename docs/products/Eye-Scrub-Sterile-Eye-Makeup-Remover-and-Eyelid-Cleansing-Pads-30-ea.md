    <li> I have been using EyeScrub for a few years now. A wonderful product. Found good prices and easy ordering on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product was originally suggested by an optometrist who specializes in contact lenses. It&#x27;s a great product and with the Amazon order the Eye Scrub always arrives quickly. Job well done!!</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without them!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor and has really helped prevent styes and chalazions.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for Sephora. They are individually wrapped and sudsy but not at all irritating. They&#x27;ve been a good substitute, probably better because they&#x27;re sterile.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using it since I had an eye ulcer right before having Lasik surgery in 2009. The surgery had to be delayed until that cleared up and these helped do that.  As soon as my doctor okayed me to start using it again I did, and have been using it daily since. I have tried other brands and they are just not the same. I sure hope they never change it. It is great as is!!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day for a medical issue with my eyes.  I&#x27;m so appreciative for this solution to the problem!</li>
    <li> Best in the business!!</li>
    <li> I have used these pads for years. I have sensitive eyes which react to any irritants that aren&#x27;t removed at night, such as traces of eye makeup. These easily remove makeup or any residue in my lashes without stinging.</li>
    <li> These are recommended by my optometrist and not all Pharmacies stock them. They are great, non irritating and remove eye makeup beautifully. The order arrived in a timely manner and was packed professionally.</li>
    <li> My wife will only use this product.</li>
    <li> and product is better than any others. soft gauze, not at all stinging the eyes, and very good for my crusty lashes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my eyes.  Doctor recommended and have used it for over 4 years.  I have bad allergies which affect my eyes and this product helps to alleviate the redness and itchiness.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and as a facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s very mild.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry eye and a resultant disease so have been looking everywhere for relief.  I think I&#x27;ve purchased just about everything on the market to use along with the medications my doctor prescribes.  These pads are the very best I&#x27;ve found.  They thoroughly remove my eye makeup and the pad is rough (but not too rough) enough to use as a scrub after I&#x27;ve applied moist heat for several minutes.  No stinging, no bleary eyes after each use and no irritation.  What&#x27;s more, my eyes feel better since I began using them in my daily routine several weeks ago.  They now have a permanent place in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> These eye scrubs are the best. I&#x27;ve tried others that are either too abrasive, or too dry. These are not cheap, but they&#x27;re by far the most comfortable and do the best job.</li>
    <li> These sterile moistened towelettes are simply the safest way to remove eye-makeup. If you do tight-lining and apply mascara down to the lash roots, you need this to cleanse the follicles, where trouble can set in if there is build-up.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Amazon because I have purchased many things from Amazon and I&#x27;ve always had a good purchasing experience from navigating the site through merchandise receipt.  I was very pleased with the product which was recommended to me by an optician for removing eye makeup.  It does a very nice job and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> There is no better way to remove eye makeup available. I noticed Alcon acquired the company from Novartis and I hope they continue to make the same quality product. I used to buy them at Walgreen&#x27;s. They no longer carry them and the other brand is not as effective and far more irritating to the eye. I am so happy Amazon carries this product. It is worth every penny! They remove all eye makeup even waterproof completely and do not burn or irritate eyes at all. I am a contact wearer and oily residue from other products made contacts a nightmare. This is the best product I have ever used to remove eye makeup.</li>
