      <li>works well smells good ...</li>
      <li>This one has a good 8 hours than the rest.</li>
      <li>I put on in the morning and it still works and smells good when I undress at night.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the daisy scented one &amp; it smells good too.</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant is good</li>
      <li>It smells really good too.</li>
      <li>This does smell wonderful, though, and truly, you can get a fresh wave of fragrance every time you move.  </li>
      <li>Great to be able to just add it to my order.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant!</li>
      <li>Love it always use it!</li>
      <li>My favorite!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I could put this product through a better test!</li>
      <li>But this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>HOW NICE IT SMELLS</li>
      <li>It may not smell the best, but it works better than the gel ones and lasts so much longer.</li>
      <li>excellent antiperspirant deodorant, motion sense sheer powder</li>
      <li>Love this scent.  </li>
      <li>AND I JUST LOVE</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a wee bit better in price on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Plus points to this because it lasts longer than most.</li>
      <li>, my aunt love it</li>
      <li>Awesome - leaves on white marks.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent.</li>
      <li>Its a great deodorant smooth and not irritating</li>
      <li>arrived very quickly</li>
      <li>I think scent is strong</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Nothing special I&#x27;ve had better</li>
      <li>, I tried to wear it lightly</li>
      <li>Overall though Degree makes great deodorant.</li>
      <li>Daughter uses this on a regular basis and it was a great buy too.</li>
      <li>Scent lasts all day and keeps my armpits feeling fresh!</li>
      <li>We live in a really hot &amp; humid climate &amp; this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good especially the more you use it.</li>
      <li>This deodorant smells nice, but it sticks to your skin like glue, and the next morning when you shower, you will need a strong dishwashing scrubber to take it off.  </li>
      <li>I smell good, stay dry</li>
      <li>Better go with a different softer lighter yet strong deodorant.</li>
      <li>(I think it is the same as Rexona her in Australia) but this product feels superior and is much cheaper, even with shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Long lasting &amp; this smell is great.  </li>
      <li>I first used this brand when on holidays in the US</li>
      <li>Has helped me so much!</li>
      <li>Works very well!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dry and smooth and I like that, too, so 4 stars for it!</li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.  </li>
      <li>I still keep it in my purse because it makes me feel more secure and less self conscious.</li>
      <li>Very dependable.</li>
      <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>Thanks anyways Degree</li>
      <li>Lasts a whole day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my original sheer powder deodorant.</li>
      <li>really works to keep my dry and fresh, even on hot summer days.</li>
      <li>I did not care for this particular scent.</li>
      <li>Oh, and I live in Florida.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;d be fine if it were a little stronger.</li>
      <li>With my old deo</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin to anti-perspirants and a lot of them irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the particular smell that I got (I&#x27;m not big on the powdery scents).</li>
      <li>Although I tend to use natural, aluminum-free deodorants on a daily basis, I needed to get a stronger deodorant for when I do Crossfit.</li>
      <li>I usually sweat a lot and had never found the right deodarant</li>

<li> Goes on dry, no noticeable odor.</li>
<li> and it does help keep me dry all day.</li>
<li> Exactly as I expected</li>
<li> Other reviews mention an overpowering scent, but I don&#x27;t find it this way at all.</li>
<li> I spend equal amounts of time running around like a crazy person, over a hot stove cooking something and out front where I need to not look like I&#x27;ve been running around like a crazy person or dancing up and down a hot kitchen line.  </li>
<li> no chalky mess.</li>
<li> but I do usually use Unscented.</li>
<li> If you can&#x27;t take it off, which you probably will have a hard time doing, all you&#x27;ll be doing in adding another layer of deodorant to the existing one.</li>
<li> but ive honestly never had to reaply through out the day.</li>
<li> i used to have to reaply at least 2 times.</li>
<li> It is not as invisible as dove or secret Unscented.</li>
<li> I seriously sweat like crazy.</li>
<li> I sweat like crazy and this stuff works!</li>
<li> I am very frustrated with losing the scent after 3 hours of applying it to my skin.</li>

    <li> Plus points to this because it lasts longer than most. I am very frustrated with losing the scent after 3 hours of applying it to my skin. This one has a good 8 hours than the rest.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant! Scent lasts all day and keeps my armpits feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> I smell good, stay dry and it&#x27;s a wee bit better in price on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Awesome - leaves on white marks.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good especially the more you use it. I did not care for this particular scent. Also, it doesn&#x27;t bead up. Lasts a whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the particular smell that I got (I&#x27;m not big on the powdery scents). Overall though Degree makes great deodorant. Although I tend to use natural, aluminum-free deodorants on a daily basis, I needed to get a stronger deodorant for when I do Crossfit. This definitely does the trick. I don&#x27;t smell and I don&#x27;t get deodorant crud on my pits. Next time I&#x27;ll opt for a different scent though....</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> REALLY WORKS WELL AND I JUST LOVE HOW NICE IT SMELLS</li>
    <li> Nothing special I&#x27;ve had better</li>
    <li> I used another brand for years, but I prefer Degree.  I like the scent and it does help keep me dry all day.</li>
    <li> It may not smell the best, but it works better than the gel ones and lasts so much longer. If you like fruity smells like me, you might not like it, but it does work!</li>
    <li> great product best deodorant I have found that lasts</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Wonderful.  Degree A-Ps don&#x27;t work for me though, which is not necessarily Degree&#x27;s fault.  My daughter likes it.  It just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.  The only A-P that works for me is either clinical strength anything, OR in non clinical strength, Ban solid or Lady Speed Stick.  Mitchum doesn&#x27;t even work for me, so it must have something to do with body chemistry.  This does smell wonderful, though, and truly, you can get a fresh wave of fragrance every time you move.  It&#x27;s dry and smooth and I like that, too, so 4 stars for it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
    <li> Goes on dry, no noticeable odor. Very dependable.</li>
    <li> Its a great deodorant smooth and not irritating but it&#x27;s way to scented to me, I tried to wear it lightly but I noticed I can smell it even within a hour outside taking care of business or inside of my house. I&#x27;m sticking with my original sheer powder deodorant. I just gave it to my mom. Thanks anyways Degree</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells nice, but it sticks to your skin like glue, and the next morning when you shower, you will need a strong dishwashing scrubber to take it off.

    <li> Can&#x27;t be beat pricing &amp; home delivery.</li>
    <li> works well smells good ... no chalky mess.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. I sweat like crazy and this stuff works! I can even skip a day or two. I&#x27;m happy to have found a brand to replace the one I used that they stopped making.</li>
    <li> excellent antiperspirant deodorant, motion sense sheer powder, my aunt love it</li>
    <li> Great product. I first used this brand when on holidays in the US (I think it is the same as Rexona her in Australia) but this product feels superior and is much cheaper, even with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works to keep my dry and fresh, even on hot summer days.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> My favorite! I used to use my husbands deodorant but a friend recomended i try this. I seriously sweat like crazy. Its gross. But this stuff is amazing. I keep a stick in my purse as back up when I leave my house but ive honestly never had to reaply through out the day. With my old deo i used to have to reaply at least 2 times. I still keep it in my purse because it makes me feel more secure and less self conscious.</li>
    <li> I manage a restaurant.  I spend equal amounts of time running around like a crazy person, over a hot stove cooking something and out front where I need to not look like I&#x27;ve been running around like a crazy person or dancing up and down a hot kitchen line.  Oh, and I live in Florida.  I don&#x27;t think I could put this product through a better test!</li>
    <li> Other reviews mention an overpowering scent, but I don&#x27;t find it this way at all. In fact, I&#x27;d be fine if it were a little stronger. I have sensitive skin to anti-perspirants and a lot of them irritate my skin. This one does not.  And it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> great product, works well.  Its a sold white deodorant, so careful with the tank tops ladies</li>
    <li> I think scent is strong but I do usually use Unscented. I got it for $2 with amazon coupon so I thought I would try. It is not as invisible as dove or secret Unscented. The antiperspirant is good</li>
    <li> Works well. I put on in the morning and it still works and smells good when I undress at night. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Daughter uses this on a regular basis and it was a great buy too.</li>
    <li> Love it always use it! Great to be able to just add it to my order.</li>
    <li> I usually sweat a lot and had never found the right deodarant so I decided to give this one a try. I absolutely love it! Has helped me so much! I will definitely continue buying it. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> it wouldn&#x27;t even work the twisty thing at bottom was stripped or something. had to toss</li>
