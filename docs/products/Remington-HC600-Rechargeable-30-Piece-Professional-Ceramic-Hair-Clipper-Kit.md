      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $.50 on this product if I had to buy it again.</li>
      <li>1\ Soild elegant build and design.  </li>
      <li>and I learn more with each cut.  </li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing an additional unit, since it seems like Remington has stopped manufacturing these (I don&#x27;t see it listed on their official site any more).</li>
      <li>I use this to shave my head every couple of days, mostly in the shower.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d give them 5 stars if the documentation was better and more informative.</li>

      <li>good purchase for not a lot of money I&#x27;d say, well worth it.</li>
      <li>I love it, I would recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d give them 5 stars if the documentation was better and more informative.</li>
      <li>I would buy this again as it has many extras to make sure you can cut any type of hair style you want.</li>
      <li>Everything you might need to cut hair and the quality is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad we purshase this.</li>
      <li>You can use it to clean up your own neck &amp; it can be used for a child&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>good quality for a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Works great, nice solid no slip grip, just wish it held a longer charge.</li>
      <li>i have used this unit four times - cut my own hair in a semi crew style, it works fine, holds a charge for the haircut and finishes with lots of power left over, has a nice selection of hair length tools - a good value for the money</li>
      <li>Great feel and has lasted her about a year so far!</li>
      <li>The most accurate is the one for the product sold by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I bought these as they were from a respectable brand (which I have purchased before) and relatively cheap.</li>
      <li>full charge, or plugged in, they are powerful, and do a good job.</li>
      <li>Very fast,very good battery...excellent price...</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>After reading many users&#x27; reviews on products, I chose the Remington kit because of the ceramic coated cutter and a full set of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does a average job at best when it is fully charged.</li>
      <li>Concept is good but product doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
      <li>I have used it once and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>I am guessing that the blade is made of some cheap material that becomes blunt very quickly.</li>
      <li>When purchasing it originally I was hoping I could use it for 3-5 years easily.</li>
      <li>The look and feel are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I finally bit the bullet today and bought another one of these great clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
      <li>The manufaturer compensated for this by including the free trimmer.  </li>
      <li>but if they come available again I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
      <li>After retirement this year, I have more time to check into hair cutters on internet and was surprised to find so many brands and people trimmming hair themselves.  </li>
      <li>take the time to clean them as they tend to jam up</li>
      <li>Powerful clipper and being cordless makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>I had read mixed reviews on this product, and I decided to buy it anyway because it seemed like a good bargain.</li>
      <li>The batteries lasts about 3 minutes with a full charge.</li>
      <li>This product is good for only emergency short-term use.  </li>
      <li>3\ Adequate accessories.</li>
      <li>When we plugged in it smoked and got very hot.</li>
      <li>The feel of them lets you know they are very well made and fit into your hand and the fact that you can cut with and without the power cord is 1st rate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned this hair clipper for approximately 2.5 years now and have used it every three weeks to shave my head with great results!</li>
      <li>This is hands-down the most useful hair clipper I&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
      <li>The old model must of had a better battery</li>
      <li>I love this product so much I have returned back and re ordered it 2 more times.</li>
      <li>This tool kit seems to be right for me</li>
      <li>Worked well right out of the box with the cord.</li>
      <li>That should count for something right?</li>
      <li>But overall price is good, product visually looks great, performs average.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use this to shave my head in the shower.  Only problem I&#x27;ve ever had was the battery eventually dying after more than a year of weekly use. Waterproof enough to run it under the shower head.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job, allows me to trim my own hair easily, is rechargeable, and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has plenty of other attachments like length guards, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine keep getting broken when I travel but that is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase for not a lot of money I&#x27;d say, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hair clipper for approximately 2.5 years now and have used it every three weeks to shave my head with great results! The blades have stayed sharp and never seem to have trouble cutting through my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past month or so, the battery has finally started to not keep its charge as well as it used to. I finally bit the bullet today and bought another one of these great clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The new clipper that I just received doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the old one. Also, the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the new attachments are further apart than the old model and feel a little sharper on my scalp. Because of this, I&#x27;ve removed a star from my rating and changed it to 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this is one great clipper.  it is bigger than all the other brands (cordless) but it makes it up with quiet operation and it cuts better than all the other brands i have had over the years.  Battery life has not been an issue at all with it.  And i love the fact you can wash in off in the shower and don&#x27;t have to worry about screwing it by getting it wet.    just one great clipper!!!</li>
    <li> The clippers could not be adjusted to cut below a few millimeters, and became very hot with regular use.  The mini trimmer became inoperable after only a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  I charged it for 2 days prior to using it the first time, and it died within 10 minutes of using it.  I then charged it for another 2 days, but again it died within the first 10 minutes of using it.    It isn&#x27;t very reliable, but it cuts well when it does hav a charge.  It is also really lightweight.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $.50 on this product if I had to buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best clippers ever. I got them for field haircuts and they exceeded expectations. I haven&#x27;t used them as a recharge yet, with the cord they cut my thick hair easily and completely. The carrying case was unexpected plus to keep everything organized.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have occasionally tried to trim my hair with a hair trimmer that I bought without much research; trimming was difficult without any acccessories and instructions.  After retirement this year, I have more time to check into hair cutters on internet and was surprised to find so many brands and people trimmming hair themselves.  After reading many users&#x27; reviews on products, I chose the Remington kit because of the ceramic coated cutter and a full set of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting it from Amazon (quick delivery, thanks), my first try was interesting and much less problems than what I had been using my old hair trimmer.  This tool kit seems to be right for me and I would be doing much more self hair cutting from now on.  No problem so far; I especially like that the cutter can either work in plug-in or cordless modes.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington Rechargeable, I had the previous model and this model is definitely an improvement.  The motor is stronger and the battery life is greatly improved. I use this to shave my head every couple of days, mostly in the shower. At the time of this review I have had the shaver for nearly two years and it is still going strong. Only bad point is that the lcd indicator is no longer accurate when displaying battery life and the charging terminals need the corrosion rubbed off them every now and then. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> This was a defective unit from the time I opened the package. Motor runs slow, Will not hold a charge, Cumbersome to handle. Not worth the return shipping fee to exchange and would not want another one anyway. I will use it as a plugged in razor until I choose my next razor purchase which will not be a Remington.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems and it cuts my hair just fine. I got it to replace the Wahl rechargeable that broke. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the battery, but I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for a long time and it only takes me 3 to 5 minutes. The motor has a lower pitched sound than the Wahl, or other clippers I&#x27;ve used so that it sounds like the battery is low, but based on how it cuts, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I&#x27;ve had so far a just nit picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The different sized guide comb&#x27;s are listed in inches and mm rather than by being numbered 1 through 8 like others I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ll get use to that as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The other problem is the lack of documentation, or instructions on a couple of the included attachments. I can see how the the fade comb might be useful if someone is cutting your hair for you, but I find it hard to use when cutting my own hair. There are two combs called the Medium Texture and Large Texture combs that have no explanation and I can&#x27;t see a use for. The neck liner attachment probably works well, but again, there are no instructions that explain the best way to use it. All of the instructions on the website seem to be for other clippers. Maybe they think the attachments are self explanatory and I&#x27;m sure people who cut hair professionally know what all of the different attachments are used for, but I would just like some instructions included with the attachments explaining what they&#x27;re for and how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.In the description of the product features on Amazon, it says there is a \\&quot;Taper control lever for maximum versatility\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t see a lever anywhere on my clippers. I don&#x27;t miss it because I&#x27;ve had clippers with a lever before and to me, they were just a pain and always moving without my noticing it until I had already cut my hair to short, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it in case you&#x27;re expecting this particular clipper to have a taper control lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a small detail trimmer that works very well and better than a lot of others I&#x27;ve had that I paid for. Figuring out how to open it up to install the battery is a bit tricky and again, I can&#x27;t find any instructions for doing it, so it&#x27;s also a learn as you do process. Just so you know, you turn the on off switch at the base to the right to turn it on and turning it all the way to the left past off lets you pull the base off to install the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m very happy with these clippers and how they cut and I&#x27;d give them 5 stars if the documentation was better and more informative. If anything changes I&#x27;ll update this review.taper control lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a small detail trimmer that works very well and better than a lot of others I&#x27;ve had that I paid for.

    <li> Great value for the price, but for us there is an overabundance of attachments.  I guess it depends on what the user needs are.</li>
    <li> This is a good looking clipper. Brand new, lightweight,easy to handle. I like not having to worry about the cord wrapping around things when cutting my hair. Good cutter.</li>
    <li> Hardly had a year and battery not holding a charge and Remington won&#x27;t replace.  ALSO attachments make angle hard to use.  Concept is good but product doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this didn&#x27;t have an adjustment lever for half-lengths between the different sizes, but I am thrilled with it anyway. The battery holds a charge well, and the clippers cut through thick hair without any tugging at all.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the most useful hair clipper I&#x27;ve purchased so far. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a while now, and used to use Wahl&#x27;s Self-Cut kit. Compared to Remington&#x27;s model, I find Wahl&#x27;s build quality rather pathetic. In contrast with Wahl&#x27;s product, the chrome finishing is uniform and without distortions, the unit feels a lot sturdier, and the seams and edges are high quality. The Wahl clipper blade head unit&#x27;s spring clasp broke a month ago for no apparent reason (I&#x27;ve never dropped it, for example). This lead me to purchase Remington&#x27;s HC 600 washable clipper.    The build quality is excellent, and the design, well-executed. The greatest feature is that the device is water-tight. What that means is that annoying hair clogs can simply be washed away in the sink, with ease. No more dirty carry cases due to stuck hair within the unit. Besides, being able to use a soap-cleaned clipper on the hair and beard each time, is wonderful.  The head doesn&#x27;t swivel (contrast with the Wahl Self-Cut), however this isn&#x27;t a feature that will be missed.     Lastly, the accessory included that helps trim the neckline, is a miracle of design. Cutting the hair behind the neck was the biggest pain to handle while self-cutting ones&#x27; hair, and this accessory brilliantly eliminates that problem.   The fader comb was another plus, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it, so far.      Great product, and I will be purchasing an additional unit, since it seems like Remington has stopped manufacturing these (I don&#x27;t see it listed on their official site any more).</li>
    <li> I got the product but i can only one time completely shave. At second time the battery ended in the mid of the shaving. Third time did the same thing so now i am returning it. I don&#x27;t advise to buy it.</li>
    <li> cuts very well. I don&#x27;t feel that the battery last very long though. by the end of your haircut it will be dead</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery would only recharge a few times. We now have to use the unit when plugged in which defeats the purpose of buying a rechargeable item. Very disappointed as it is a name brand item.</li>
    <li> Quality built, excellent feel, well balanced (weight), and surprisingly quiet.  This is the best hair clipper I have ever used. …Did I mention it is cordless too? WOW!</li>
    <li> the battery died within 1 minute of using after haven charged it overnight. so I ended up using it a wired hair clipper. it gave a good shave</li>
    <li> i have used this unit four times - cut my own hair in a semi crew style, it works fine, holds a charge for the haircut and finishes with lots of power left over, has a nice selection of hair length tools - a good value for the money</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery is worthless, although the clipper does work when it is plugged in. Ceramic cutters are wonderful with no oiling required.</li>
    <li> The clippers them selves seem to be well made and a quality product.    The plastic used in the Guards and other accessories is somewhat cheap,  They haven&#x27;t broken yet, but are made of the type of plastic that will dry-out easily over time and become brittal.    I was hoping the battery pack of the main clippers would be standard AA rechargable batteries or something like that, that could be easily replaced over time when they loose their ability to hold a charge.  They are not, instead it is a custom battery pack that you do not have the ability to replace over time.    The unit has a Red \\&quot;charging\\&quot; LED, but it does not ever turn green to indicate a full charge, the manual says \\&quot;you can not over charge\\&quot;    Overall: decent product for home use.  Not what I would consider a commercial grade product.    I have owned this product about 2 months and based on this believe It will last me 2-4 years, using it on one individual once a week.  When purchasing it originally I was hoping I could use it for 3-5 years easily.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl clipper , so noisy that could raise the dead. After 3 uses that I threw it in the trash, I didn&#x27;t expecting too much when I purchased this one but it did wonderful job. Easy to use and very quiet. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> If you are buying this for the cordless feature, don&#x27;t. The batteries lasts about 3 minutes with a full charge. I tried it several times with full charge then returned. It also cannot be used in the shower as some reviews claim. It is not made to get wet, only to be rinsed off. It clearly says that in the manual.</li>
    <li> It is a great product once again I am not regreting using amazon.  I love it, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Brand new out of the box I plugged in the charger and the next day i turned it on and it was slow and died after 30sec.  Reconnected to charger and left to charge for 3 days! Die dwithin 4-5mins. Maybe mine was defective or maybe the engineering is faulty. In either case, I cannot recommend this product.  Why  risk it when you can get any other brand for the same money?</li>
    <li> The listing says:  Taper control lever for maximum versatility  but there is no blade lever on this.  It evens talks about it and shows it in the enclosed brochure with instructions how to use.  Can&#x27;t believe it doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for 60 days now and I would say long term these will not hold up.  Already having charging issues w/ the cable. But overall price is good, product visually looks great, performs average.  I only use the product about every two weeks and I would guess it&#x27;ll be 1-2 years before I have to replace, which is typical for this pricepoint and product.</li>
    <li> This model is very much like the one I used for several years.  I have been elected to do the hair cutting on our hill and I used almost every week.  It handles good and I learn more with each cut.  I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought these as they were from a respectable brand (which I have purchased before) and relatively cheap. The product looks good and a comes with a lot of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks can definitely be deceiving!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is terrible, the blades gets clogged easily and by the 3rd use they were near useless. Actually, beyond useless as they started to ruin my hair. I do have thick hair, but I used wired version of these clippers in the past with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the battery in these clippers is useless. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Powerful clipper and being cordless makes it easy to use. The case is a nice feature and the over quality is very good. The clipper is quiet and easy to grip. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as close as my old one. Otherwise it works good. That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.</li>
    <li> This product does not work, the charging light never endsand battery charge does not work, can get my money back?</li>
    <li> Everything came in the kit. Worked well right out of the box with the cord. worked just as well without the cord after charging. Only improvement would be to add a tray or something to organize the attachments,</li>
    <li> Worthless.    Charged for over a day and a half, the charge light never was any other color than red.    Used to trim my head and it didn&#x27;t even last long enough.    Awful product, returning.    Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Works very well and charges quickly.</li>
    <li> I am the recipient of generations of male pattern baldness, so i use this once every 3 days to shave my head.  That said, this sturdy beast cuts close and lasts long.  I&#x27;ve had it for years and just keep it in my shower when i need to shave my noggin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly got my bucks worth and continue to.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
    <li> bought 2012 used very little maybe 5 x per year would hold charge 20 min max. battery toast now does not charge runs only when being plugged in. discontinued model don&#x27;t buy cant replace batteries even if you can find them.&lt;br /&gt;bought Conair pro cordless now</li>
    <li> The remington hc-600 comes in a decent quality carrying bag. Accessories included are as described in the manufacturer&#x27;s description section.  I would like to draw the attention of potential buyers and the Amazon website moderators to the following:   1\That there are two description pages for this product with conflicting specifications. The most accurate is the one for the product sold by Amazon.  2\The clipper is misrepresented as being ceramic (which doesn&#x27;t require oiling) and titanium coated but actually they are only titanium coated which requires oiling regularly and that&#x27;s a big disadvantage for me.  3\lubricating oil is not even included with the clipper.  4\ Clipper becomes hot during use after continuous operation for about 10 minutes wich can b quite uncomfortable if you are cutting a 4 year old child&#x27;s hair.  5\ Clipper blades cannot be adjusted.  6\ Cannot be used to cut very short hair. The manufaturer compensated for this by including the free trimmer.  7\ Short AC-adapter cable.    PROS of the Remington HC-600  1\ Soild elegant build and design.  2\ Battery life as advertised (the initial 14-16 hrs are a must for futre battery life).  3\ Adequate accessories.( Old remington models e.g HC353 used to ship with a plastic shaving towel and a styling video!!!)  4\ Reasonable price.    I have been using Remington Hairclipper Model HC-353 for the past 7 years (which has actual ceramic self sharpening blades. Corded and cordless operation. I bought this HC-600 for my son expecting at least the same quality, but I was disappointed to discover that my seven year old hairclipper is much much better.    No of times hairclipper used: 5 times</li>
    <li> Very fast,very good battery...excellent price...the best for every man!I recommend this profuct buy it now +++ +++ +++ +++ +++</li>
    <li> good quality for a reasonable price! We only forgot about the difference in electricity: in USA 120 and in Europe 220. When we plugged in it smoked and got very hot. With my old adapter it worked out fine.</li>
    <li> I had read mixed reviews on this product, and I decided to buy it anyway because it seemed like a good bargain. I charged it for 2 days, and it only held it&#x27;s charge for less than 30 min. Both of my sons complained that the clipper was pulling their hair. It didn&#x27;t seem to cut well either (one has coarse hair and the other fine). I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for family members for 20 years and this was the first time I ever had to return a clipper.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because I have been the one shopping for the past few years for my husband.  He shaves his head and has gone through three other brands and finally this Remington has made it to the number 1 slot.  My husband says its an even and nice shave (I can even notice the difference between razors).  Motor works great and has had no issues.  I like the option that it&#x27;s rechargeable as well and ours came with a mini trimmer.</li>
    <li> now Im a hair styler !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;awsome product !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after some cuts you got the practice , now I cut my own hair without help only using it , the mirrow on the wall , and a small mirrow to see on my back . Easy</li>
    <li> this product put lines in my hair. seriously. the 1/8\\&quot; blade is so flexible and second-rate that when applied to the scalp it bends in all different directions, allowing the cutting blades to get too close to the skin. the result? the side of my head looks like vanilla ice. pass on this.</li>
    <li> it is my second one, after i lost first one. the best manufacturer ever, if you ask me. a small trimmer that comes with it is the best thing i&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m doing my own haircut for already 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing!</li>
    <li> Works great, nice solid no slip grip, just wish it held a longer charge. The old model must of had a better battery but this is definitely a nice buzzer.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about the quality of these clippers but when I got them I am very impressed.  The look and feel are fantastic.  Not a light weight device either,  It does have some weight to it. Very quiet running and efficient.  It also comes with a small trimmer that runs on a single AA battery (battery not included) that I did not know about.  It too is a great product.  The whole thing is packaged in a nice semi-hard shell carry case with combs, scissors, tons of clipper guards of various depths, charger, and manual.</li>
    <li> This was such a failure.  Worked for ONE haircut.  Second haircut, found no battery charge.  Charged it overnight and then found it will not hold a charge.  So, it has to be used while plugged in!!!</li>
    <li> Could have been better if it had remained with its lever to move the blade up and down like its predecesor the Hc 364</li>
    <li> I received this today to open it and I found 29 pcs... Now 30 why? Because the only thing I didn&#x27;t get was the clippers themselves. How ammo to use this without the included clipper? I do expect a refund. Hit don&#x27;t waste your time honestly.</li>
    <li> This is the worse buy i ever made. The batery just die in minutes. The advantage is the wireless  s*** but i does not work so....</li>
    <li> After less than 10 haircuts, it is no longer able to cut. The blades move, but they just pull the hair instead of cutting. This happens regardless of being on battery or connected to the power outlet. I am guessing that the blade is made of some cheap material that becomes blunt very quickly. I&#x27;ve had several clippers of different brands and this one is by far the worst. Terrible quality!</li>
    <li> Best set of clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase for this item. It&#x27;s a quality clipper which I use to cut my own hair, (buzz cut)</li>
    <li> It works but i would like it to get closer cut. Also buzzes a little slow, and kind of heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair forever. This is the best clipper set I have ever owned and for the money it&#x27;s just plain unbelievable!!  Everything you might need to cut hair and the quality is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for ten months. Though we cleaned it with each use, it stopped working a month ago. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> When you hold this clipper if just feels like the quality is good.  The materials seem solid and firm, not cheap or plasticy.  The first time I used it, I dropped it on my tile floor.  The clippers were not damaged at all by the drop.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts nicely.  The fact that it is washable is nice.  I&#x27;ve always done that whether or not recommended by the manufacturer, but it&#x27;s nice to know that it&#x27;s safe to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I like the neck liner.  I have an 18&amp;#34; neck &amp; it works well, but it seems to possibly be intended for a smaller neck.  You can use it to clean up your own neck &amp; it can be used for a child&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;Con&amp;#34; is that the moustache trimmer is a little on the cheap &amp; flimsy side and it is &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery powered, not compatible with the clipper charger.</li>
    <li> Does not hold a charge. Does a average job at best when it is fully charged. This is not what your looking for.</li>
    <li> Unit showed up in terrible package. Opened the box up and of course it would not hold a charge. When I plugged it in it worked for about 2 seconds then  stopped. I thought that it was just low on charge, so I left it plugged in over night. Went to turn on and still does not work.</li>
    <li> I like the design and the convenience of the cordless feature but the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I expected. However, it has been used once a week for almost a year so it&#x27;s really hard to complain about this product.</li>
    <li> just received my 1st hair cut with the hair clippers. The feel of them lets you know they are very well made and fit into your hand and the fact that you can cut with and without the power cord is 1st rate. I would buy this again as it has many extras to make sure you can cut any type of hair style you want.</li>
    <li> The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a few weeks. I had to leave it plugged in to use it. It also doesn&#x27;t have any adjustment to the blade gaurd, so it&#x27;s hard to fade the sides of a haircut. Get one with a lithium battery, not this.</li>
    <li> i have had no problems so far. I have used it once and it worked fine. It was a brand new piece too.</li>
    <li> I did buy this product and I am happy with its performance and the price was in line for watt I wanted to pay..Al</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I have returned back and re ordered it 2 more times.One time was because I went on vacation to renew my vows and brought it along for my husbands haircut and the second time because the puppy chewed the wire in two pieces. So now the 3rd one stays put up where it belongs. haha. You never have to oil these clippers. They stay sharp and dont pull the hair. which means everything when you are the person getting your hair cut. I even cut my daughters hair with these clippers and she gets compliments everytime i cut her hair. And no i am not in any way a cosmotologist. But my last name is BARBER. That should count for something right?</li>
    <li> Not the best clippers I have ever owned, yet not the worst by far.&lt;br /&gt;At full charge, or plugged in, they are powerful, and do a good job. On battery power, I feel as though the power drains quickly.&lt;br /&gt;always take the time to clean them as they tend to jam up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that all being said, if you keep them clean and charged, these clippers will last you a while, and do a pretty good job cutting hair.</li>
    <li> the battery goes dead. I have to keep the cord plugged in. it works good with the cord plugged in.</li>
    <li> A collector&#x27;s item. Equipped with enough parts to cut and style hair in many ways. I especially like that it can also be used by battery power. Making it possible to use any and every where without having the problem of needing a power source to plug into. Also do not have to worry about power cord being in the way while cutting hair.</li>
    <li> The baterry stoped working after one month and I can only use with the wire now. This is not a good option</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift. But, love the rechargeable , no batteries, no cord. Easy to use and looks great too.</li>
    <li> I enjoy saving money so this is an excellent product for the price, and the cats don&#x27;t mind being trimmed with it as well.</li>
    <li> Yes they&#x27;re &amp;quot;rechargeable&amp;quot;,alright-they hold a charge for about 10 minutes. While in the midst of cutting hair, it dies. Keeping the blades oiled, they got dull after about five haircuts.  This product is good for only emergency short-term use.  Do yourself a favor, prepare to spend money on a quality product, not this one.......</li>
    <li> It cuts much better than the typical $30 clipper you can pick up at the Wal-Mart.  However, within an year, it started cutting very poorly.  I&#x27;m not sure what part went wrong, it was just catching hair and not really cutting it.</li>
    <li> Is not too heavy, the price is right. It did the job. I&#x27;m glad we purshase this. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, who is a hair stylist. She loved it! She thinks the battery should last a little longer but to make up for it keeps it charged in between haircuts. Great feel and has lasted her about a year so far!</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver but I&#x27;ve had two cease to function after a very short while. First they no longer charge then they stop working entirely. I changed to a Conair clipper but, sadly, it is nor as good quality as the Remington. The Remington is solid, metal and cuts close for us bald guys. The Conair is a piece of plastic that rattles when you use it. They are now out of stock but if they come available again I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
