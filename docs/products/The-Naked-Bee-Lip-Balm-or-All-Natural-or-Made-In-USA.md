      <li>I use it daily, very smooth and smells great.  </li>

      <li>I have to keep my lips moisturized, especially in the summertime and The Naked Bee is very good.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>And I wanted something more natural.</li>
      <li>I prefer other lip balms instead, such as EOS and Perfect Organics Shea Butter.</li>
      <li>I found this in a little local shop; it&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love the Naked Bee products and the lip balm is no exception!</li>
      <li>I love this product and all the Naked Bee Orange Blossom and Honey line.</li>
      <li>I love Naked Bee lotion</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, and the hand/body lotion goes on evenly with no greasy feeling on your hands or body, yet a very silky and effective lotion.</li>
      <li>If you have dry chapped lips you will love this.</li>
      <li>It would get very &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; in my pocket.  </li>
      <li>but I find it very neutral in both.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing and stays on very well.  </li>
      <li>I did not care for it too much.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>VERY MOISTURIZING...</li>
      <li>The Naked Bee Orange Blossom &amp; Honey Lip Balm makes your lips feel so smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>So much better than the other lip balms - smooth, silky and has moderate taste appeal.  </li>
      <li>realize some of the other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and my son hates all chapstick so there is no such thing as a good scent.</li>
      <li>Better than expected!</li>
      <li>Think it is the better product than the other &#x27;Bee&#x27; items out there because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cake&#x27; on the lips.</li>
      <li>What more can I say other than it is extremely soft and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is MADE IN THE USA and that it has so few (all natural) ingredients.</li>
      <li>Love their other products especially the hand and body lotion.  </li>
      <li>Smooth , but has an odd flavor to it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the fragrance, and didn&#x27;t find it soft enough for my liking.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is that it tends to travel beyond your lips if you put too much on.</li>
      <li>I would not order this again as it smells like spoiled old oil.</li>
      <li>I originally tried Naked Bee because of the ingredients, as I am very careful of what I put into or onto my body.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very well, is not greasy and does not have any of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that actually dry your skin.</li>
      <li>It seems to work pretty well as a lip balm, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips like some other products with SPB.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;ll only usually let me do two swipes before he throws a fit</li>
      <li>Body heat would make it soft and then when I went to use a big chunk would come off of the product on my lips.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is that if you use too much it has a bitter taste.</li>
      <li>does not dry out you lips</li>
      <li>Only have used this for a few days now and to my surprise my chapped lips healed .This isn&#x27;t like the typical chap stick they goes on dry,this goes on so smoothly  and keeps my lips moisturized through the day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love that it soaks right in and isn&#x27;t greasy..it is pleasantly orange scented.  The product lasts longer than others and you can use a smaller amount than usual.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Both my husband and I use it.  Goes on nice and smooth and not greasy.  Has a pleasant soft scent, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I did not care for it too much. It leaves a sort of a bad taste in your mouth. Surely there must be better choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garyl</li>
    <li> This is great lip balm.  It&#x27;s not getting 5 out of 5 because it is a little bit waxy.  But all in all very good.</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty well as a lip balm, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips like some other products with SPB.  But I hate the scent, and the taste is almost nonexistent.  I prefer other lip balms instead, such as EOS and Perfect Organics Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. I found it quite by accident in a little out of the way gift shop. There was a display on the counter with a bottle you could sample. One whiff of the amazing fragrance and I was hooked! It absorbs very well, is not greasy and does not have any of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that actually dry your skin. I put this bottle on my nightstand and I use a little on my hands and arms every night..it is aromatherapy heaven!</li>
    <li> I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but it contains something I am allergic to. The swollen lips are not a bad thing, but the whole rash thing is not so attractive. I love that this product is MADE IN THE USA and that it has so few (all natural) ingredients. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t to sure about purchasing this with mixed reviews but sure glad I did.Only have used this for a few days now and to my surprise my chapped lips healed .This isn&#x27;t like the typical chap stick they goes on dry,this goes on so smoothly  and keeps my lips moisturized through the day.The best part is this is all natural With organic honey,orange peel extract,organic olive oil,green tea extract along with other ingredients.As far as some reviewers that wrote the smell is horrible I did not find that,In fact I found this to be the best of all the brands I have used .I would recommend this Lip Balm  to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lip balm. I can not find it in any stores, so I stock up when I purchase it and share.&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry out you lips, it smells like honey and feels like heaven.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this chap stick and I can&#x27;t find it in stores. Smooth and not greasy for a man.</li>
    <li> I like to apply it before my lipstick. It tastes great and keeps my lips moist. It is also a good idea to apply it before going to bed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, keeps lips soft and moist. I also purchased the Hand &amp; Body Lotion and the Hand &amp; Cuticle Healing Salve, and all 3 of these products are wonderful! I have dry skin, and the hand/body lotion goes on evenly with no greasy feeling on your hands or body, yet a very silky and effective lotion. The cuticle salve is great also - really helps my dry, splitting cuticles. Will definitely buy these products in the future, and will try some of the other Naked Bee products in the future. I like that their slogan is \\&quot;all of the good stuff, none of the bad.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the product was not SPF 15 as pictured.  I have since found out by calling the Naked Bee Company that the Orange Blossom Honey lip balm is no longer being produced with the SPF 15 since 2013.  The person from the Naked Bee Company told me that in order for the product to be USDA Organic it could no longer have the SPF 15 included.&lt;br /&gt;Please correct your photo as this is misleading to the customer, as I was.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Rosie Yacono&lt;br /&gt;(keeping everybody honest)&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I paid $5.25 for a product that I already had, thinking that it would be SPF 15.</li>
    <li> I received this and it has no mention of SPF 15 in the package that I received :(.  I got it to protect my lips from UV.</li>
    <li> Goes along with the rest of the Naked Bee Orange Blossom Honey products I ordered and gave away.  Sorry I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great to keep your lips moisteded.</li>
    <li> It would get very &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; in my pocket.  Body heat would make it soft and then when I went to use a big chunk would come off of the product on my lips.  Also it was like putting a thin layer of oil on my lips what would be gone 30 seconds later after it never absorbed into my lips.  Not impressed.  Also tasted not so pleasant.  I will stick to Burt&#x27;s bees.  I will have to say the Naked Bee lotions are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use it daily, very smooth and smells great.  It has kept my lips from cracking in this lousy winter weather we are having.</li>
    <li> It has an extremely bitter taste.  Love their other products especially the hand and body lotion.  Don&#x27;t know where the bitter comes from.</li>
    <li> So far the best lip balm ever, it keeps my lips moisturized under normal conditions.  I am a dental hygienist and recommend this to all my patients!</li>
    <li> Very smooth balm.  Not overly perfumed which I like.</li>
    <li> LOVELY SCENT! VERY MOISTURIZING...WORTH BUYING!! CHAP LIPS THAT ACTUALLY HEAL....WONDERFUL PRODUCT..TOP QUALITY !!</li>
    <li> I love Naked Bee lotion so I tried this and it is equally awesome. I originally tried Naked Bee because of the ingredients, as I am very careful of what I put into or onto my body. After a ton of research I landed on this brand. Both the lotion and the lip balm moisturize the driest my skin and lips have ever gotten, and I have chronic peeling chapped lips, and my hands can get so dry from constant washing (I work with toddlers and preschoolers) that dirt actually gets embedded in the cracks of my skin - I know, it&#x27;s gross. Nothing else worked and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of lip and skin moisturizers. These products are creamy and not oily.</li>
    <li> I love the Naked Bee products and the lip balm is no exception! This was a gift for a friend and I haven&#x27;t used it but she loves it!</li>
    <li> So much better than the other lip balms - smooth, silky and has moderate taste appeal.  Think it is the better product than the other &#x27;Bee&#x27; items out there because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cake&#x27; on the lips.</li>
    <li> This is great lip balm. Unlike others, this one does moisturize without the waxy build up! I keep it with me all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm thinking it would smell and taste just the fantastic lotion. Nope. It has a waxy texture with a strong disgusting flavor. I put on the lipbalm before bed and was still tasting it during breakfast. Disgusting.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son, who hates chapstick but his lips get super chapped during the winter. And I wanted something more natural. He&#x27;ll only usually let me do two swipes before he throws a fit and I can say that even that little bit helps keep his lips from being chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize some of the other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and my son hates all chapstick so there is no such thing as a good scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm as a birthday gift along with other items, and the receiver was happy to get it.</li>
    <li> it glides on smooth and moist. it doesn&#x27;t have that dried out waxy feeling that most lip balm i&#x27;ve tried do. and the orange blossom scent is divine.</li>
    <li> I have to keep my lips moisturized, especially in the summertime and The Naked Bee is very good.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that if you use too much it has a bitter taste.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a nice refreshing lip balm, but once I applied it, it smelled very chemically and made me nauseous. Had to throw away the stick after two uses due to my extreme dislike of the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the VERY BEST Lip Balm!! The Naked Bee Orange Blossom &amp; Honey Lip Balm makes your lips feel so smooth and hydrated. I really think you will like this one for sure, I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it day and night. I spend a lot of time outdoors and need the protection it provides. Others mentioned they did not like the scent or taste but I find it very neutral in both.</li>
    <li> I used this once and didn&#x27;t care for the smell (it smells chemically compromised).  While it feels nice on the lips, it&#x27;s going in the trash.  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This is the only product I could find without petroleum in it.  Thank you Naked Bee!</li>
    <li> Better than expected!</li>
    <li> I love this brand. Their products are always great quality, affordable and I appreciate the fact that they&#x27;re cruelty-free. I recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> in love with this balm.  leaves me lips moisturized and smelling great.  will definitely be purchasing more products from this company!</li>
    <li> I hated this lip balm.  I found the smell and taste to be terrible!  Had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Since I love the feel and smell of the matching potion I thought I would love this. The smell is lacking the taste awful, and it did not make my lips feel soft.</li>
    <li> Smooth , but has an odd flavor to it. Covered my lips well. Not sure that I&#x27;ll use it again, due to the flavor...maybe the olive oil in it?</li>
    <li> I love trying new lip balms and so I was excited to try this one.  I don&#x27;t much care for the fragrance, and didn&#x27;t find it soft enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Nice lotion.</li>
    <li> While I like the balm the smell is kinda gross.  I would not order this again as it smells like spoiled old oil.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this.  Goes on nice and smooth and stays on.  So glad this was available to purchase here.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing and stays on very well.  I love this product and all the Naked Bee Orange Blossom and Honey line.</li>
    <li> What more can I say other than it is extremely soft and moisturizing. Bought 3 for xmas presents after I tried and loved it myself!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! If you have dry chapped lips you will love this. It is also fantastic at the beach when in the sun!</li>
    <li> I found this in a little local shop; it&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried. It feels silky and smells incredible - I have a problem with most fragrances.</li>
    <li> Goes on really smoothly and moisturizers well. The only problem I have is that it tends to travel beyond your lips if you put too much on. Otherwise the best lip balm I have ever used</li>
