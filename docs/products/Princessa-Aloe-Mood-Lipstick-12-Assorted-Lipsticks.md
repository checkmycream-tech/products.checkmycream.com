      <li>waxy aloe in a nice moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price and cheap packaging fool you, this is still a great product for adults!</li>
      <li>Really pretty packaging and the lipstick feels very good on lips.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product..not great either.</li>
      <li>There is no smudging, no feathering, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on skin, clothing, etc but will wash off very easily.</li>
      <li>I bought these mostly for my own amusement</li>
      <li>It is so nice to be able to put my lipstick on and not have to touch it up until lunch time.  </li>
      <li>I have loved this lipstick for years and glad to see it is still available at an affordable price.  </li>
      <li>I was really happy to get this, shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>Upon the first use, I noticed it had this great, floral/fruit smell.</li>
      <li>A good value for a cool product.</li>
      <li>The color stays on pretty good and it has a nice moister  to it with the alo vera in it</li>
      <li>However, I think it&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s fast and easy to use, comforable to wear, and gives me a touch of color when I&#x27;m at home and don&#x27;t feel like doing make-up but would still like to look nice.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always touching and biting my lips</li>

      <li>Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in any store, I thought I&#x27;d try these.</li>
      <li>I would say more of a lip balm that leaves a shade of color.</li>
      <li>being said, I was hoping for more variation between shades.</li>
      <li>So excited to order more!</li>
      <li>Much better than using a lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this type for years and have not been able to find it here</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looks better with a lipgloss for a glossy &amp; shiny effect.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>These colors are really bright and fun looking.</li>
      <li>They are more like stains instead of lipsticks but you can build them up depending on your preference.</li>
      <li>Love these, use them all the time.  </li>
      <li>I have  been give so many compliments on this lipstick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not a bad product..not great either. all the colors (at least on me), seem to be the same, and the color doesn&#x27;t last all that long. Yes, they are moist, and yes, they all are pink. I have found that putting a white lipstick type concealer under the product, seems to help with the lasting effects. You can use this trick for any lipstick. By varying the amount of white you use, you will also effect the finished color. If you really want a lasting color--this is not the product.</li>
    <li> All colors are the same (pink) on your lips...guess I&#x27;ll give em away as Christmas or birthday gifts...</li>
    <li> I bought these because I thought they would be fun.  They go on the color advertised, but the only mood color they change to is red.  I thought there would be ore to it.  Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These make my lips pink up. I thought that each color would make them pink differently but the change seems the same.  They work like the fifteen dollar Tangee lipsticks.  Now I have enough to last forever.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift -at first I didn&#x27;t know what to think when I saw all of the bright colors, but as soon as I tried it on I was happy with how soft and smooth it was on my lips, how quickly some color showed up, and how long the color lasted.  Now, I admit that I don&#x27;t get the point of the different shades other than cuteness, as they do all seem to produce the same color on my lips (a sort of hot-pink shade). However, I think it&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s fast and easy to use, comforable to wear, and gives me a touch of color when I&#x27;m at home and don&#x27;t feel like doing make-up but would still like to look nice.  I&#x27;ve got young children and very little free time, so I am always looking for things that will make me look like I put some effort into a nice appearance with very minimal time, and this fits the bill!  I have decided to keep a tube in my purse, but this is something I will mostly wear at home to give some color to my lips, which don&#x27;t have a very vivid color without lipstick...I will probably occasionally wear this out, or under other shades of lipstick (still need to experiment with that) it&#x27;s just that the shade isn&#x27;t exactly what I usually go for to match my eye make-up and clothes, generally I like deeper shades or softer pinks for going out. That having been said, I do recommend the product, it made a nice gift.</li>
    <li> these were horrible. Some of them came melted.</li>
    <li> perfect and very hard to find.</li>
    <li> My mom loves these lipsticks. She only has a lil bit left and i say a lil bit cus she has top stick her pinky in the bottom to get the last thing that remains and she refuses to trow it away. i know she is gonna squeek in happiness :)</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING...Beautiful packaging. it was an Excellent experience and I will be purchasing more products in the future! These mood lipsticks go on so smooth and stay on all day. BUY IT you have nothing to lose! Im a darker complexioned girl and they look great on me I get compliments all the time!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for the \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipsticks--no other kind has their staying power.  These are not bad, but they don&#x27;t work as well as other brands I&#x27;ve used.  They are colorful and fun, but the tubes are very loose so applying the lipstick requires more-than-normal holding.  It is fun to have so many colors.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for a set of 12 lipsticks, especially something as juvenile sounding as &amp;#34;mood lipstick&amp;#34;. But I remembered mood lipstick from when I was a kid, the reviews seemed good enough and I was looking for a long lasting lip stain that wouldn&#x27;t rub off on my baby when she touches my face or sticks her fingers in my mouth. This is it! I was very pleasantly surprised. This is really a great product. I apply it once in the morning and it lasts through the entire day, most days. Maybe once a week I will have to reapply in the evening or night for touch ups only. It will make it through meals looking untouched and never comes off on my silverware, glasses or straws. There is no smudging, no feathering, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on skin, clothing, etc but will wash off very easily. This is a great alternative if your looking for a lip stain that won&#x27;t transfer after applied. Please note that the colors do provide a slight variation when applied. The lighter colors are more of a bright/hot pink and the darker colors are a bit darker pink. One coat is enough, just give it a minute to change colors. If you add a second coat when you apply it will be an even brighter color. I find one coat is plenty for my taste. It always turns the perfect shade of pink for my skin tone. I usually pay much more for lipsticks/glosses than this but I&#x27;m impressed since it serves my purpose nicely. Don&#x27;t let the cheap price and cheap packaging fool you, this is still a great product for adults!</li>
    <li> Princessa Aloe Mood Lipstick 12 Assorted Lipsticks is really a good product. And for a good price too. It looks very natural when I wear it. I am using it daily and I don&#x27;t have any problem with it. It&#x27;s looks better with a lipgloss for a glossy &amp; shiny effect. But using it alone looks nice too. I really recommend this to all women who loves to see their lips alive with their own natural lip color.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. I wish it was a bit thicker but the stain it leaves is great and lasts about 5-6 hours before needing to reapply. even when you drink it does not come off onto cups ect.</li>
    <li> Ive used mood lipstick for years...I finally ran out and ordered a multi pack from Amazon...each one theoretically should produce a slight shade variation...but this is not so with this product...all of the mood lipsticks in the multipack all produce the same exact shade.</li>
    <li> THIER not very good but THIER cute</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks soo much! :( I don&#x27;t know why they are not available anymore :(I bought them because they totally remind me of Mexico! I remember they were super popular when I was little. It is a classic in MX. hahaha... and  it amazed me how they looked one color and then when you put them on they were bright pink! :) I had the hope I could find them on Amazon and I did! They are more like stains instead of lipsticks but you can build them up depending on your preference. For some reason I don&#x27;t really like lipsticks. I try to wear them but I feel like they don&#x27;t look good on me and I&#x27;m always touching and biting my lips and they get messed up 5 minutes after I apply my lipstick. I guess I&#x27;m not a lipstick kind of girl. But these are awesome. Since they are more like a stain, they stay for so long and without drying my lips (You know how some stains and long lasting lip stuff dry up your lips &#x3D;S  These are moisturizing enough. Depending on the lipstick and your natural lip color they can look really natural. I find the orange one to look pretty close to my natural lip color and if I apply a little bit it almost looks like my lips are just naturally bright and pink :). Some reviews say that all lipsticks come out the same shade and they just look different, but they are definitely different shades!. I don&#x27;t know if other people got different ones but there were 6 different shades in my kit, 2 of each shade. The picture showed here is actually not what I got which is better because the picture just shows 4 shades and I got 6 :D... I&#x27;m going to try to take pictures to show the lipsticks and the different shades... I hope they become available again. For now I don&#x27;t worry too much because 12 lipsticks are gonna last me forever! I love them :)</li>
    <li> Awesome lipsticks for this lipstick lover!! Surprisingly long lasting, Many compliments after only a few days wearing these. Honestly wasn&#x27;t setting my expectations high for 12 lipsticks for less then $7 but wow was I pleasantly surprised. Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  I have no idea if it is like the mood ring.  I watched her apply the blue (told her, her lips were turning blue like that brat on Willie Wonka).  But seriously, I noticed that her lips initially turned pink then turned into a darker pink the longer it was on.  I am pleased with this.  It was not too bright, too dark, and very far from being trashy.  It is subtle and appropriate.</li>
    <li> I bought these at my local beauty supply but they are the same brand. On my lips they all apply the same color; hot pink or fuschia. They is no other shade. Plus side is the formula is moisturizing and staining</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail a couple of days ago, and I was excited to try it out... Well, I was extremely disappointed. I read the reviews first and thought overall it may work for me, but it didn&#x27;t. It also had like an oil base to it which I didn&#x27;t like. I am a freelance make up artist, and this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I actually gave it to my little cousin to play with. Save your money by not getting this product.</li>
    <li> I love it.it make my lips smooth and the color lipstick last, long time on 👄, love it</li>
    <li> 12-pack with colorful lipsticks, change color for mood and temp.  Grate value for money.</li>
    <li> I think these lipsticks are great, especially if darker lip colors are what you are looking for, or need--they are pretty colors, and the lipstick itself is long-lasting and smooth and fairly moisturizing--but, I found they are just way too dark on me, so I have to add a lighter color on top--and, I found that I can also use them as cheek blusher, since they are dark enough, and long-lasting enough, for that purpose--all in all, if you like darker lip coloring, then these are really fine for that--I just want to add that, the blue lipsticks turn a purplish-reddish shade on your lips--purple shades and me simply don&#x27;t get along when worn on or near my face, though, so it&#x27;s not my favorite among the colors--but, purple might be a tough color for anyone to wear up on or near their face--if it works for you, though, you might very well enjoy this particular shade--and, all the shades differ from one another to some extent, and are really just fine--and, they do change once applied.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and my daughter loved them. Only drawback is they don&#x27;t really change any other color but a medium pink.</li>
    <li> i was looking for it and found it.  all are pink to dark pink same hue about.  mixes with your chemistry.  mood lipstick.  mine fades lighter not darker near the end of a 7 hour day  some are darker when you first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;the waxy aloe in a nice moisturizer.  use it as a base to other lip sticks or by itself for a natural look.</li>
    <li> Excellent very creamy and soft on my lips and it lasted a few hours before I had to reapply... the shipment came quickly will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> They all are the same color on me, just a little darker or lighter</li>
    <li> Stop at blue! after that i cannot see the real differences in the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like the ones from the nineties...&lt;br /&gt;Great as a gift for young girls</li>
    <li> Hate. It makes you lips pink or pinker waste of my damn money</li>
    <li> I have  been give so many compliments on this lipstick. It is a perfect color each time. It always makes me look fresh</li>
    <li> I have used this lipstick for years and it is the best I have ever used. It is long lasting and the Aloe keeps you from having to use Chap Stick and other such products.  The different colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like only one shade</li>
    <li> I just had to have these when I saw them. I love the colors, they are all so pretty! I just wish they lasted on longer... I have to reapply throughout the day... They are kind of sheer so you have to layer and layer and layer if you want it to look full on your lips.</li>
    <li> Hey out there in cyberland, this lipstick is really great, it stays on a long long long time and won&#x27;t creep up into those little lip lines we all have but don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to admit! I payed 8 dollars for 1 tube of the new Revlon lipstain and these lipsticks have got Revlon lipstain beat all to heck! Hey just give it a try I know you will love it! I had in the past (10 years ago) purchased this or a similar product and 4 tubes have lasted me for 10 years, I kid you NOT! Save money on those other lipstains and get this 12 lipstick set instead!!! You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I barely use this. It goes on clear, ok. And then it automatically turns to this odd pink color that i could easily purchase for less if i even wanted it. Its not worth having 12 of the same color, nor is it worth the amount of $$. The only reason I didn&#x27;t return is i tossed the original packing... I had a bit too much confidence in this item. My friend and i argued after i put it on her. No color change. I guess that is why there isn&#x27;t a chart to tell you the color-mood association.</li>
    <li> I have loved this lipstick for years and glad to see it is still available at an affordable price.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my granddaughter.  She wanted any color except pink lipstick so I thought there was enough of a variety of colors to please her.  All colors were pink on her which the seller says is her mood color.  Really?  What is the point of having yellow, green and blue colored lipstick if everything is the same color when applied?  They seller won&#x27;t take it back even though she only applied it to her hand.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> these are so creamy and pretty colors and will definitely buy again.  For the price they are awesome!!!  Truly awesome</li>
    <li> Each lipstick provides different shades! My personal favorite is the blue one. I get tons of compliments when I wear that. However, it does not last all day, at least for me. I have to re apply a few times. But no big deal for me! Still love these!</li>
    <li> I have used this type for years and have not been able to find it here so  I was very happy when i saw it at Amazon .I order enough for a long time.</li>
    <li> Its good if u LOVE RED all the lipsticks turn red none of them are the color you expect they all come out red cute red bt i was expecting yellow orange etc. not red on each lipstick</li>
    <li> They do look pretty cheap. I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction to them and I have been wearing the green one for about a month. All of the seem to be changing color to the same red shade on my lips. The red it&#x27;s very pigmented and it lasts hours. I gave it 3 stars because the plastic tube feel very cheap and they all turn red on me.</li>
    <li> These mood lipsticks are very cute and the shipping was quick and perfect. I tired them first on my arms because they are all supposed to be slightly different colors in reaction to your body chemistry. I found that they were all similar shades, but there was some variation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one big complaint I have is that there isn&#x27;t actually aloe in these lipsticks, which annoys me because that is one of the reasons I purchased them in the first place. The first five ingredients are castor oil, lanolin, oleyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, and beeswax. None of these are particularly bad ingredients, but I&#x27;d expect there to be aloe. Unless it is Princessa Aloe (like a name). If that is the case,  you have some sneaky and clever advertising. Otherwise I&#x27;d change the title.</li>
    <li> I gave these to my nieces. Talk about fun! They loved them because they changed color. You thought you were putting on green lipstick and it would be pink on your  lips.  Fun item for such a cheap expense.</li>
    <li> I think these lipstick should be a lip stain because the color stays on, and not even lip stains stay on my lips too long, but these stay put 25 hours. The price is very nice, and the colors don&#x27;t look that much of different once applied. I have dark lips and lipstick is always a different depending on you lip color. So the other colors my show on a pink lip. I would buy again. Happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> As other raters said, these come out close to the same color no matter which one you use- bright pink!</li>
    <li> I love these! They are great. Colors are all perfect for my skin tone and they&#x27;re great to share. Gave some to my best friend and they were a hit with her too.</li>
    <li> ALL of the lipsticks are the same ! There is no particular shade to them at ALL. Might as well they be chapsticks ! I&#x27;ve never left a negative review before but this product certainly warranted one !</li>
    <li> Colors are all the same. Made my lips color dark and I don&#x27;t like it that way. I am looking for the old ones but can not find them</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and they loved all the colors that you receive are bright and hard to remove. The one thing I found confusing was that the colors all can out the same safe of pink when you used them on your arm. Like testing them out.</li>
    <li> these are fun, feel good on, and do last very well.  the only complaint i have is that they all look very vividly fuschia type pink on me, but man does it last super long!  your friends will demand you share with them.  keep the yellow ones for yourself; i think that they are the most fun.  this is perfect for sweating to death in the summer heat.  also recommend cover girl exact liquid eyeliner for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I used to use lipsticks like these before - used to buy them from the 99c stores. They were very good &#x27;cause they lasted for a loooong time and they went on smoothly. Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in any store, I thought I&#x27;d try these. I didn&#x27;t try all of the colors yet, but the one I did try did not stay on for nearly as long as I had hoped. It was gone after I had a cup of coffee.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like about this lipsticks. When I saw the picture, I was expecting more of a tinted gloss than an actual lipstick. But these are definitely not glosses. They go on smoothly and keep my lips smooth and soft, but they also has a ton of color payoff, almost like a lipstain. The packaging is bright and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was hoping for more variation between shades. Almost all of these are fuschia on me, with varying degrees of purple to the hue. Also, I needed to go over the same area with about 4-5 swipes to really get the color to really show. When I put them on my lips, there seemed to be a bit more variation between colors... but not that much, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for the price, they&#x27;re well worth it, in my opinion. They&#x27;re fun, if nothing else.</li>
    <li> Fun!  And an amazing value.  Would make great favors at any girl party.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I got it in the mail just yesterday, and I was super excited. Upon the first use, I noticed it had this great, floral/fruit smell. And unlike other lipstick, if you accidentally lick it, it doesn&#x27;t have a gross, waxy taste. I applied the lipstick, and it glided on smoothly, at first a clear, but eventually settling on a lovely magenta. The last thing I was expecting after 8 hours was to go into the restroom and see that the lipstick did not need to be reapplied!!! Love this stuff and if i ever run out after 12 tubes, I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> have used this product for many years and love  this mood lipstick feels good on, lip color last for hours on, even if wipe  will still stay on just a great product that use everyday</li>
    <li> Everything turns red and not an elegant red color. Delivery was fast. May look on someone else body color .  One has try to find out.</li>
    <li> Love them they where what I expected.....just wish the colors where more different then each other but they was great :)</li>
    <li> The place I normally purchased these lipsticks no longer carry the,  I looked in numerous retail stores for these lipsticks. I get compliments al the time.  They feel good, not sticky or waxy.  Color lasts all day.  I will never buy name brand lipsticks again.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are just beautiful and soothing with aloe vera.They come 12 in a pack with two of each color.I split them with my mom and she loves them as well. Great value! The color lasts about 6 hours.I will be back for more.Thank you!</li>
    <li> Even though they are so cheap, they do a really good job.&lt;br /&gt;The final color in your lips will be red or hot pink all the time from all the colors except the yellow one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product as expected. No complaints. It looks exactly like the picture. Goes on soft and smooth.Of course the full application as with most inexpensive lipsticks wear out during the course of the day, however it leaves a lasting stain on the lips,you can choose to wear it like that a simple reapplication would fix it right up. Item arrived on time.Very delighted when i received this product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product as it&#x27;s soft on the lips and seems to stay on longer than most lipsticks.  The different colors usually turn out about the same when they are on.</li>
    <li> I liked the colors of lipstick much because it is smooth and stay long and do not cause dryness often recommended</li>
    <li> No matter what the color on the tube  they are all pink on me.  That&#x27;s a lot of pink lipstick!</li>
    <li> Every color turns pink&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the pink&lt;br /&gt;What happened to the red and purple?</li>
    <li> These are a hoot &amp; a half. I&#x27;ve never used &#x27;mood&#x27; lipstick before but bought these on a whim after I read an article about them, The lipsticks themselves are very lightweight, not glossy or sticky. It&#x27;s more like wearing &#x27;tinted lip balm&#x27;, or a lip stain than actual lipstick. (Which I prefer) And the aloe makes my lips very soft and feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;They do all turn pink on my lips, but the shades vary from bright pink, to &#x27;pinky-coral&#x27; to &#x27;purpley-maroon&#x27;. I kept one of each color for myself and took the rest to a party to gift to my girlfriends as sort of &#x27;party favors&#x27;. And we had a blast. And the color change can be very different on different people. The green on me becomes BRIGHT pink, but on my ginger-headed friend turned a really deep red.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t the highest quality lipsticks but were well worth the money in my book. A+ would buy again. For the price these might also be excellent party favors for a birthday party or bachelorette party.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and this product stays on so long! At least a couple hours with eating and drinking! I love these and have them in my purse at all times!</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks! The colors looks great on me and most importantly they stay on longer that most high brand lipsticks! I will forever keep purchasing these items!</li>
    <li> I only gave this review of 2 stars because I like the colors but was disappointed that it did not last very long at all. Years ago I had this type of lipstick and it stayed on all day. This only stays couple of hours. I&#x27;m still looking for the one that stays on longer.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I didnt realize that these lipsticks went on the same color, I thought they would be different colors.</li>
    <li> So inexpensive and long lasting color! Everybody should give these a try! They beat their higher priced competition easily! I love them!</li>
    <li> I thought there would be red and light pink but its all hot pink or purple shades. it feels good on lips and it more like a stain! i still love them but its just not what i was expecting.</li>
    <li> Really pretty packaging and the lipstick feels very good on lips. Unfortunately the colors were all extremely similar practically the same. Although the color they come out as is pretty it wasn&#x27;t worth buying all of these for one shade.</li>
    <li> Yes it does change colors. But that&#x27;s the only thing that works. It doesn&#x27;t even have any different shade than pink. Also, it smells terrible. I tried one on and I couldn&#x27;t even bear to wear it longer than a minute. I have to scrub and wash my lips. I even gave one to my mom but she too did not liked it. So I now disposed the whole thing. It&#x27;s not even worth it. Please think twice before buying.</li>
    <li> I use these lipsticks all the time exclusively.  They are the only lip stick that stays on my lips the longest.</li>
    <li> I was obsessed with this lipstick as a child, I honestly never thought I would see it again. I recently bought this pack and gave away the duplicate colors as Christmas presents--everyone loved them! The color is sheer, usually a pinky tone such as coral, rose, or berry once it oxidizes, and the aloe is very moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t go on thick, and doesn&#x27;t feel like clown makeup. A good value for a cool product.</li>
    <li> ANY color from these lipsticks turned out pink i tried it on my lips and even on my hand all it did was turn pink i hated it</li>
    <li> These are more like lip balm, not lipstick.</li>
    <li> These colors are really bright and fun looking. The packaging Is honestly to die for as well. They don&#x27;t dry out your mouth and the color of the actual lipstick when applied is pigmented. All the colors will change to some shade of pink once they are on but the shade of pink differs. Personally pink and orange are my top favorite. Lastly, they stay on for forever! You don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying. I am in theater and I wore these as stage makeup and I got through 2 entire performances without constantly reapplying. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. Plenty to choose from</li>
    <li> I like the lipsticks not smell like candle or wax.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, turns a shade of pink and last 8 HOURS AT LEAST!!!!!  I have been looking for these for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;Have been wearing these lipsticks for over 15 years as they REALLY DO LAST ALL DAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish that they would offer only the colors that I needed, instead of ordering all the colors I don&#x27;t like or need</li>
    <li> very good for the price,</li>
    <li> Used to get these in the 70&#x27;s. I love this stuff. Each as applied is a different shade but last all day.</li>
    <li> The color stays on pretty good and it has a nice moister  to it with the alo vera in it</li>
    <li> These were on my 16 year old daughter&#x27;s Christmas list.  I never would have purchased this otherwise. Who would have guessed?  Anyway, the package looks exactly like the picture.  There are two of each color.  Despite all of the gifts she unwrapped, she immediately opened these.  She put on the red and it looked nice.  She loves them. She said it makes her lips soft.  She is always complaining of dry lips. Now she is happy.  She organized her makeup table with one of each color in her lipstick container.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Love these. It&#x27;s like putting on Chapstick with a lasting color. Much better than using a lipstick. I use a swipe of this and a swipe of pearlized lip gloss and have soft tinted lips for hours and hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how I got this lipstick or who gave it to me, but I LOVE IT and am so happy amazon carries an entire pack!!!!! I have the orange color and it goes on like a deep bright pink. It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t bleed past your lip. It&#x27;s a nice tint and the color stays on your lip long after you&#x27;ve applied it. It&#x27;s the PERFECT lip stain. So excited to order more!</li>
    <li> Order was a week late being delivered. Product arrived in good shape and was exacly as ordered. this was a gift for my mom, and we can not find it anywhere around were we live. This is the only lipstick that she likes so i was very glad to find it. I will be ordering on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My wife said it goes on the same as her expensive lipstick, but it does not last all day, so she&lt;br /&gt;has to carry it with her all day.  but who cares  cost dictates our lives.</li>
    <li> I was honestly hoping that the colors would come on as they looked. But each one comes on clear and than forms into a pink color which you can barely see. I gave them to my 8 year old daughter they are very hydrant. I would say more of a lip balm that leaves a shade of color.</li>
    <li> I bought these lipsticks for my mom. When I was little, I was amazed to see how her blue lipstick could turn red! One day, she looked at her last tube and said \\&quot;If I knew back then how good this is, I would have bought a case\\&quot;. She likes the variety of colors and the moisturizing part (hey, it&#x27;s aloe!) I grabbed the tube one day.&lt;br /&gt;I could barely see the \\&quot;Princessa\\&quot; label. I jumped on Amazon to find it. I never thought they were mood lipsticks!!! I bought a 12-pack for a ridiculous price!!! Shipping was ultra fast (I received my package within a week or so) Now, my aunt is jealous so I have to place another order!!!! There are not enough words to express how I felt when I handed the package to my mom!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I am in a job where I am in the public eye all day long.  It is so nice to be able to put my lipstick on and not have to touch it up until lunch time.  It&#x27;s moist and the colors suit my cool pallet.</li>
    <li> the lipstick is very nice however when i got it i was disapointed at the fact that all of the colors were PINK not blues and greens and all the other colors next time i will be sure to read more reviews because now i have 12 pink lipsticks! i really wish that the colors were the ones that i bought</li>
    <li> Great value, though on me the color range only includes shades of pink or rose, regardless of the tube color.</li>
    <li> This lipstick tastes a little chemical like. Worried it might be unhealthy to use</li>
    <li> very moist and colors are great.  Used it for years!</li>
    <li> wife loves them and the price is great, flea markets sell for 8-$10 each. Good fast service also like they advertise.</li>
    <li> Love the lipsticks ♡ brings me back to my childhood.</li>
    <li> Have used these lipsticks for years. Was glad to find out where I could buy them. I told my sister and she ordered some as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these mostly for my own amusement but now I&#x27;m happy I did! The colors are distinctly different on different people as I gave my friend one of each color. We both did tests on our arms and her colors were slightly dark than mine (we have the same skin tone but I&#x27;m always hot and she&#x27;s always cold). The colors last a really long time! It was almsot impossible to get the swatches off of our skin even with an exfoliating soap. That being said, the color lasts all day on lips and makes them feel super soft without being heavy and gross. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> these are really fun and they are all different shades, mostly some sort of shade of pink, but they are a little different and different on everyone. some are almost purple, some are more coral</li>
    <li> First time iused lipstick,it broke off in tube.Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Kinda Sucky product... Even though the lipstick quality itself was good, they were all the exact same color. I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the bright pink it turned out to be was nice but.... It was ALL that bright pink shade. I liked the product, the advertising just seems like its different colors when its not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this- you&#x27;ll end up with 24 of the same lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I got 12 colors that are all the same when you put them on the yellows pink the Green is pink the pink is pink they&#x27;re all pink</li>
    <li> I was really happy to get this, shipping was very fast. The product itself was a HUGE let down. Every color looks the same! They&#x27;re all a very hot pink. Im not too mad about that, just disappointed. Overall, they do their job, the color last for a very long time (and even stains a little). These also smell and taste really bad. If you&#x27;re looking for 12 tubes of the same color for very little money, then these are great. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the world, so I&#x27;m okay with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a different mood lipstick I buy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, does not even show up on lips!</li>
    <li> Love these, use them all the time.  Thanks for fast delivery and a great product.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting and moisturizing. The colors all turn out a little darker than I&#x27;d like, but they&#x27;re pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I finally got these mood lipsticks.  After reading a bunch of reviews, I realized they were likely going to be all the same color.  Come on do we really believe these can &amp;#34;sense&amp;#34; what color to turn.  I have tried each color several times now and they all seem the same to me.  But I don&#x27;t mind.  What I love about them is how long the color lasts and how moisturizing they are.  Some seem to glide on better than others, not sure what the difference could be with that.  I find the pink colored lipstick is the one I reach for the most often because it glides the best.  I knew what I was getting as I already had one I&#x27;d bought on vacation and I like it a lot.  Wish I did notice a little color variation, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  The cases for these are a  bit flimsy, so I&#x27;m careful to handle them carefully.  I do notice if a reapply too often, it cakes up a bit, but that&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;d buy them again, but that will  be awhile since I have 12 lol.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/14/15&lt;br /&gt;I decided to update my review because now that I&#x27;ve been using these for a while, I find I love them more and more.  I&#x27;ve also learned how to wear them better.  By that I mean that I start out with a couple of thin layers.  It takes a few seconds for the color to set.  Then it looks great.  Before I was going over and over my lips too much which resulted in caking, over depositing of color, and bleeding after a minute or two.  Now I&#x27;ll wait until the first application sets nicely and then leave it.  After a couple of hours, it wears off a bit, but leaves behind a pink wash of color that is even more desirable.  Once that wears off in another hour or so, I reapply a couple of thin coats again and so on.  I think the reason this mood lipstick lasts is the waxy nature of the colors.  Rather than being like a balm or moisturizing lipstick that wears off almost immediately, the wax holds the color to the lips longer, at least until you eat a meal.  Even after a meal, you may still have enough color left to look good (I typically don&#x27;t).  The other thing I noticed with practice is that there are subtle differences in the colors.  Depending on the color of your natural lips, you may notice more or less differences.  I was a little surprised to find the Purple mood lipstick is my most flattering (I have pale, cool tone skin) shade.  But I actually like all of them depending somewhat on what I&#x27;m wearing.t to look good (I typically don&#x27;t).

    <li> Great.... Loved it perfect match for my lips, and my daughter!</li>
