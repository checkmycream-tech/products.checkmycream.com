    <li> It was just tulle on a comb nothing fancy and even the cut at the end was uneven and ragged. It was a last minute veil and luckily my husband re-cut the end to get rid of the ragged cut and we used our own combs. You are better off going to a local fabric shop and buying your own tulle and you can do what you want.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Very basically cut but good quality and can&#x27;t beat the price. We plan to add rhinestones for a little more wow factor. Overall very happy with this veil.</li>
