### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Remington Xr1350 is one of the best, if not the best, electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Where Remington really impressed me was with their Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology.</li>
      <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer is excellent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a very good shaver for the price that works well.</li>
      <li>In fact, I have not changed the blades once in the 7 years I have had the Panasonic unit and it still works great.  </li>
      <li>It would be great for travel as well as home/office use.  </li>
      <li>A great close shave.  </li>
      <li>Since a really great rating was given to this razor by a woman, I may opt to take it as \\&quot;mine\\&quot; to shave legs with.</li>
      <li>For cleaning the razor, it often creates an issue when the razor parts keep coming out and the plastic feel isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
      <li>Remington makes great shavers and this is one of their finest</li>
      <li>/&gt;First up, this razor has a great set of features.</li>
      <li>under $100, this is a great value.</li>
      <li>He likes this shaver because of the great trimming capability,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps the best feature is that this can be used in the shower or under running water, gotta love that for time and convenience&#x27;s</li>
      <li>If you want the best shave, go with a Gillette Trac II (no typo, I like the Trac II and wish I could get more for when my stash runs out …) when used with Edge brand gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I blow and wipe it out, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
      <li>It is good and lightweight, for shaved.</li>
      <li>I have had a fair number of electric shavers in my life.</li>
      <li>, if you want something like this, it&#x27;s good quality for what it is</li>
      <li>Good luck finding a business that will allow you to try out a razor before you buy</li>
      <li>It was not quite as good as my razor, though.</li>
      <li>I blow and wipe it out, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
      <li>, if you want something like this, it&#x27;s good quality for what it is</li>
      <li>/&gt;overall a good, mid-priced option.</li>
      <li>The flowing design provides a perfect blend for the total shaving experience and it does an excellent job  - when I prepare correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was consistently OK, but not as great as my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was consistently OK, but not as great as my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Remington razor has a nice sleek design and feels good in your hand.</li>
      <li>He wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it either.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice charge indicator that works in about 20% increments.</li>
      <li>This Remington has a nice feel.</li>
      <li>sellers will kindly allow you to try on a pair of shoes before making a purchase.  </li>
      <li>, I refuse to climb into a warm shower with any type of electrical device even if it is OSHA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well (particularly along the jaw line) and has excellent battery life.  </li>
      <li>The charge time makes it seem like it is an ideal razor for men who shave in all kinds of funny places like their cars and offices.  </li>
      <li>This is not as good as a regular razor but for electric razors it is the best I have had.</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver - flexible and easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>He says that it will be very easy to keep in his dopp kit while traveling, too.</li>
      <li>Although electric razors will almost never shave as closely as the cheap throwback plastic safety razors, the floating heads do a good job of maintaining close contact with the skin.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quite compact and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Its very comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>Decent electric razer and good for traveling, but not as good as the top end panasonics.  </li>
      <li>It charges easily and travels nicely,  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to hold, the switch to turn it on is in a good position and it is easy to hold onto it.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight, easy to hold, and has some rubber-like material on the handle that allows you to keep a good grip on it.</li>
      <li>What I like the most in it is its softness and ability to adjust to any angle on the face in order to avoid irritation.</li>
      <li>After cleaning it I learned why-the shaver heads are much more elaborate.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those who have crevasses range on the Crevasse Scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being The Grand Canyon and 1 being baby dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better still, I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>For those approaching the \\&quot;chimney brush\\&quot; categories, shopping around and test driving might be the best advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would spend more and get a top of the line panasonic for home use</li>
      <li>This shaver is comfortable!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is not a onfience inspiring thing and it is not as convenient.</li>
      <li>So, I tried it out in the shower, per instructions, using my favorite Edge gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is not a onfience inspiring thing and it is not as convenient.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
      <li>The three rotary heads float on a top that adjusts to the grooves and angles of your face and neck as you shave.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review again if I do have any more insight to share on this Remington shaver.</li>
      <li>It did shave better when I used shaving cream or gel with it.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review again if I do have any more insight to share on this Remington shaver./&gt;oh</li>
      <li>and I think it does a slightly better job</li>
      <li>Most achieve a better shave than this one.  </li>
      <li>The Xr1350 shaves are much, much better</li>
      <li>things considered, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use as a daily razor.</li>
      <li>Okay-</li>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve concluded for myself (your mileage may vary) is that if you want the most convenient and portable shave, go with an electric.</li>
      <li>I was originally very excited to receive this shaver to review.</li>
      <li>I gave it an honest effort, but a truly clean shave just wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  </li>
      <li>This is a stylish and easy to hold shaver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level which is good to have.</li>
      <li>overall this is a very good, Mid-Priced</li>
      <li>More importantly (for most), the Remington gives a close and comfortable shave, the features function as they should (e.g., the trimmer, the battery use indicator, wet/dry shaving, etc.), and placed where you&#x27;d expect them&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this one surprised me, it gives a very nice shave when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the more preparation that is required - and preparation is the key to being a happy</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still have a baby smooth ankle but to be honest, the pain isn&#x27;t worth the results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does shave OK and does it fairly quickly, which of course is the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may suit guys with fine hair in their beard, though</li>
      <li>Now I have sparse hair on my legs, and it&#x27;s also comparatively fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Performance is fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, this would seem fine, but remember the reason I started using electric instead of my razor was convenience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, this would seem fine, but remember the reason I started using electric instead of my razor was convenience.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t care about getting a super close shave, then this one is just OK.</li>
      <li>Its also easy to clean as well.</li>
      <li>Xr1350, however, is extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s comfortable to use and to shave with.</li>
      <li>This is a nice razor at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>whatever makes you comfortable.</li>
      <li>But if you’re looking for a cheaper option, or something you can throw in your travel bag and know that it will last a week without charging, this is a great option.</li>
      <li>Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine</li>
      <li>The Remington is easy to clean as well.</li>
      <li>My Panasonic model gets me baby smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall I could not get a good shave, no matter how many times I tried it.</li>
      <li>My original review is written below.  </li>
      <li>The successful completion of any job requires that 90% of the total job will be in the preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also like the charge stand, which looks original.</li>
      <li>I dare not go over these areas too many times because I received a cut over an acne the first time I used the shaver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Decent electric razer and good for traveling, but not as good as the top end panasonics.  Also does not come with a good stand for home use (the way it plugs in for charging is this awkward cradle that doesn&#x27;t stand up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would spend more and get a top of the line panasonic for home use, this is decent for a cheap travel one.</li>
    <li> Had to toss it after a month...horrible product!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I ordered the shaver. It did not meet my expectations, I have to finish with a blade razor.</li>
    <li> The Remington Xr1350 is a nice rotary shaver for those of us with light to moderate daily growth who just want to keep things under control.  For those of us that enjoy an excess of man face, however, it can bog down like a lawnmower in a ...bog.  I tend to stick with Remington models anyway due to their generally superior battery life (great for camping) and weird 23rd century ergonomic designs, and the Xr1350 sticks up for itself in both categories.  The problems arose when I moved it into twice daily use, a necessary shift since my Homer Simpson-style beard regrows itself every few hours like some sort of bristly Middle Eastern insurgency.  After just a few weeks of this, the internal rotors had gummed up significantly, and the shaver heads in fact began to emit a moist odor when used after showering.  Female friends and passersby began to accumulate on my doorstep at odd hours, suggesting this odor was not entirely disagreeable to the ladies.  Nonetheless, I have man things to do, and sending a knot of them pinballing off my porch every morning as I burst the doors open and leaped into my 4X4 was growing tiresome and probably legally actionable.  I ended up going back to an earlier Remington model that had deeper head wells that gathering my beard trimmings without brewing them up into some sort of love potion.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s got some tough competition; my Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor (&amp;lt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GQYSGO&gt; ASIN B006GQYSGO) is cheaper (currently $50 on amazon) and is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington is OK, but so far with just a couple of shaves, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything better than my Philips Norelco one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weird bad thing is that you have to charge this with a special base unit. The base unit is advertised as \\&quot;displaying\\&quot; the shaver. But it falls over! it just will not stand up straight because the weight tips it over backwards. So I have to lay the shaver down flat, in the base unit, looking like a weird little alien bobsledder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that also means you can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s plugged in, because the plug only goes into the base unit. The shaver only has 2 little bumps that make contact with the base unit, to recharge. So if the battery&#x27;s completely dead, unlike most other shavers where you can plug it in and begin shaving immediately (or at least after waiting 30 seconds), with this one you apparently really have to wait 5 minutes for its (not so) \\&quot;quick\\&quot; charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another weird thing compared to other shavers like my Philips Norelco is that the 3 metal shaving heads are kind of recessed, flush with the face of the shaver. On my Philips Norelco they stick up and flex all around, but here in the Remington they are flush and maybe even recessed a bit, which seems pretty weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does shave OK and does it fairly quickly, which of course is the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the heads got rather warm, even hot, after just a couple of minutes of shaving, which is surprising and uncomfortable. My Philips Norelco heads will get hot occasionally, but only after shaving for a long time, like 10 minutes or more, like after I&#x27;d let my beard grow for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and apparently you can shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, in the shower, with this Remington. I&#x27;ve never done that and I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;d want to, with an electric razor (not talking about a blade and shaving cream here of course!); I will try it sometime to see if it is any different than the usual shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review again if I do have any more insight to share on this Remington shaver./&gt;oh and apparently you can shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, in the shower, with this Remington.

    <li> This is a nice razor at a reasonable price.  It works well (particularly along the jaw line) and has excellent battery life.  It can’t compete with Norelco at the high end of the market as it just isn’t as robustly built and doesn’t shave quite as well.  But if you’re looking for a cheaper option, or something you can throw in your travel bag and know that it will last a week without charging, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding an electric shaver that pleases everybody is as easy as finding a pair of shoes that pleases everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most sellers will kindly allow you to try on a pair of shoes before making a purchase.  Good luck finding a business that will allow you to try out a razor before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this razor feels natural on both my face and in my hand. The flowing design provides a perfect blend for the total shaving experience and it does an excellent job  - when I prepare correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a rule from the old school of outdoor construction that also applies to shaving.  The successful completion of any job requires that 90% of the total job will be in the preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation is an art form that requires extra time that most don&#x27;t take or have but it makes all the difference in the world in the quality of your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between a blade and a rotary shaver and often go a week between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer the duration the more preparation that is required - and preparation is the key to being a happy shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are approximately 7.131 billion different faces in the world with uniquely different shapes, curves and oddities of features, some natural and some not. About 50% of these faces need some sort of shaving implement at least once a year whether they use one or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have beards range on the Beard Scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being steel wire on a chimney brush and 1 being baby fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have crevasses range on the Crevasse Scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being The Grand Canyon and 1 being baby dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known men who should be going to a big box hardware or lawn and garden store for their shaving implements and have a utility trailer to bring them home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the type of beard tested for the review really helps. Are we testing face hair on Big Foot or the E-Trade Baby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a scale of 1 to 10, I&#x27;m about a 5 on both the beard and crevasse scale and this razor does everything I want it to do. For those approaching the \\&quot;chimney brush\\&quot; categories, shopping around and test driving might be the best advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the product information page and reviews, there&#x27;s nothing much left to add. Well, maybe one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lithium batteries are the only way to go. The extra cost is justified. I&#x27;ve struggled with NiCd and NiMh batteries for decades. If I have an option, Lipo it is. A Lithium battery will hold a charge for close to two years. Try that with NiCd and see how it works out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been knocked down from a few explosions in Nam and rendered unconscious from a lightning bolt at home, I refuse to climb into a warm shower with any type of electrical device even if it is OSHA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do whatever makes you comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a stylish and easy to hold shaver. What I like the most in it is its softness and ability to adjust to any angle on the face in order to avoid irritation. It has no sharp angles and is easily adjustable. Also, it can both dry shave and and wet shave in shower with gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level which is good to have. However, the shaver must be charged for twenty-four hours before its first use and at thus at first the electronic indicators aren&#x27;t as accruate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s comfortable to use and to shave with. I also like the charge stand, which looks original.</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hyper Flex&amp;#34; technology is a bit gimmicky sounding, but it&#x27;s basically a version of the floating rotary heads found on other electric razors, notably the Norelco &amp;#34;Senso-Touch&amp;#34; system.  Some Don Draper type really used indulged in his or her imagination for this hyperbole , but it&#x27;s really no worse than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;c comparable to the Norelco as well.  Although not quite as sleek looking, you may prefer the monochromatic greys and black to the flash of Norelco&#x27;s iridescent blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is fine.  Although electric razors will almost never shave as closely as the cheap throwback plastic safety razors, the floating heads do a good job of maintaining close contact with the skin.  Still, you may find that you  spend a lot of time on, say, your neck, only to discover that a cheapo BIC razor does it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, there is a plastic feeling, but my personal lab technicians feel that&#x27;s quite possibly due to the plastic used.  If you want to spend $200, you can probably get away from this.  More importantly (for most), the Remington gives a close and comfortable shave, the features function as they should (e.g., the trimmer, the battery use indicator, wet/dry shaving, etc.), and placed where you&#x27;d expect them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, it feels balanced and light in the hand, with a solid grip.  It&#x27;s cleaned with water, although a brush is provided as well. Some of my vast staff (not their weight, but how far-flung across the country they&#x27;re located) felt that the charger/holder was *not* so intuitive, but others didn&#x27;t have a problem.  In any event, you might want to test whether the balance of the razor when charging it inside the unit; you wouldn&#x27;t want it tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good shaver for the price that works well. It would be great for travel as well as home/office use.  And no, I&#x27;m not a beard for Remington....</li>
    <li> My last few electric shavers have been the ribbon kind. This is the first tri blade I&#x27;ve tried. As far as comfort the shaver is pretty good. I have a Panasonic shaver and I think it does a slightly better job but your mileage may vary. One thing that gets me is that my Panasonic cost almost 3 times as much as this shaver and the shave the panasonic offers is only slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be used wet or dry. With shaving cream or gel. Cleaning up is a snap thanks to the detachable top. Pop it off, rinse, let it dry, and it&#x27;s good to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $100, this is a great value.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver - flexible and easy cleaning. I love the fact that I can use it in the shower. About 10 years ago I would have said if you have a choice between Remington and Norelco, definitely go with Norelco. I believe Remington is very close to Norelco&#x27;s rotary shavers these days, if not at the same level. Where Remington really impressed me was with their Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology. That shaver is cheaper than this one, and I actually prefer it even over the Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> This is like the XR1330 in every way except that it holds a charge for as long as 50 minutes and has a digital readout to show how much it is charged.  No one in my house used either of the razors for 40 or 50 minutes even though I tried to get them to.  The charge time makes it seem like it is an ideal razor for men who shave in all kinds of funny places like their cars and offices.  Why do they do that?  You never see women whipping out a razor and shaving her legs while she is driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used it to trim his sideburns and around the lower side of his full beard but was not able to use it effectively for trimming his beard.  He said that it was comfortable and easy to use although it felt a little lightweight.  He really likes the look if it.  He says that it will be very easy to keep in his dopp kit while traveling, too.</li>
    <li> My original review is written below.  This is an update to that review, after I decided to try this razor for myself.  My husband had complained about this razor&#x27;s tendency to pull at hairs but I must confess.  I thought he was just being overly critical.  So, I took it and shaved my legs with it.    Well not really \\&quot;legs\\&quot;.  More like one small portion of one leg.  I put my foot on the edge of the tub, turned on the razor, and started at the ankle.  I think I made it about three inches before my brain communicated the frantic message to my hand that I needed to stop NOW.    Now I have sparse hair on my legs, and it&#x27;s also comparatively fine.  I also am not diligent about making sure its shaved off regularly.  It was kind of long.    I won&#x27;t have to worry about it now for some time.  The razor didn&#x27;t shave it off, it plucked each hair out by the roots!    I still have a baby smooth ankle but to be honest, the pain isn&#x27;t worth the results.  We&#x27;ve dubbed the razor the Mother Plucker after I relayed my tale of horror to my daughter &amp; son in law.      I also foolishly thought that if it plucked the hairs from my ankle efficiently, I&#x27;d try it to get those sneaky chin hairs that post-menopausal women spend inordinate amounts of time trying to eradicate, this time in one fell swoop.    It wasn&#x27;t a swoop, but it did get a whoop of pain.  Apparently, those stray hairs have a lot in common with steel, and have roots buried somewhere in my spinal column.  They refused to yield, resulting in agonizing pain without results.    Overall, the Remington razor was not a big hit with me, although it has provided my entire family with ample room for laughter over my attempts at using it.  I&#x27;d think it was just operator error, but I&#x27;ve long preferred men&#x27;s razors for shaving legs and never had anything like this before.  It wasn&#x27;t my first rodeo, but its the last one Remington has gone on.    Original Review:  I got this for my husband who has a thick coarse beard, but shaves it once every week to ten days, due to sensitive skin and skin problems.    As his wife, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the shave this razor gave him, which might be partly due to operator error.  (One side of his face was very stubbly even immediately after shaving.)    In his opinion, he has had other Remington shavers that would walk all over this razor.  He wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it either.  The trimmer only rated as \\&quot;okay\\&quot; as well, as he trimmed around his goatee.  It didn&#x27;t cause undue skin irritation, so the sensitive part was better than some razors.  In this particular case, he didn&#x27;t think that this razor lived up to the Remington name though.  He also did not think he would want to use this razor daily to stay clean shaven--it would not achieve a desirable shave reliably, and he would have to resort to removing a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow-like stubble with a traditional razor after shaving with this one.    We&#x27;ve bought a number of under $100 razors in the past few years.  Most achieve a better shave than this one.  Even so, there were features that he liked, such as the ability to use it on a wet face (he doesn&#x27;t try to shave in the shower) and the fact that it is cordless.    At the same time, if we had traveled to an event with this razor and he had shaved to go to something formal, I would have been very unhappy with the shave it delivered.  We would have ended up with a frantic trip to a store to buy a disposable razor &amp; shaving cream to make up for its deficiencies.    Even if the results he got were due to operator error, he can normally achieve a much better shave with his old electric razor or a cheap disposable razor &amp; shaving cream than this razor delivered.  Since a really great rating was given to this razor by a woman, I may opt to take it as \\&quot;mine\\&quot; to shave legs with.</li>
    <li> After using this and my Braun 5610 shaver, I feel the flat shavers seem to give me a closer shave. They&#x27;re both waterproof and is good for wet and dry. The Remington is easy to clean as well. Just pop off the plastic panel over the foil and you can rinse it through. It comes with a plastic cover so you won&#x27;t accidentally damage for shave head when not in use. The battery seems to hold the charge for a long time. Please note the instructions tell you to charge for a full 24 hour before the first use. I have to say the charging stand is a little annoying (to me). I&#x27;d prefer the charger to plug directly into the shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent electronic shaver. For shaving, it does an adequate job but the biggest issue is that it doesn&#x27;t quite shave properly. I often had to do it 2-3 times to get a proper shaved feel. For cleaning the razor, it often creates an issue when the razor parts keep coming out and the plastic feel isn&#x27;t all that great. At the price they are offering I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver to be my son&#x27;s first shaver.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s extremely smooth, it works when it&#x27;s wet or dry. It charges easily and travels nicely,  it&#x27;s quite compact and very comfortable. And most importantly,  it gives a really close shave.  He says he would get it again.</li>
    <li> The Xr1350 shaves are much, much better that what I got from my previous shaver. After cleaning it I learned why-the shaver heads are much more elaborate.</li>
    <li> The Remington Hyper Series Rotary Shaver has a lot of features to make it into a supreme shaver but it falls short of the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up, this razor has a great set of features. The charging base is nice adds a touch of &amp;#34;tech&amp;#34; to this. The head does move quite well and adjusts to the face, especially around the jaw line. The trimmer cuts well but it is small so it will cover less space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone with sensitive skin and I am always a little wary of newer shavers. I always need a pre-shave to avoid any razor burn and red skin. I&#x27;ve tried the Remington Hyper Series Rotary Shaver several times and honestly, I&#x27;ve been left with the worst case of razor burn I&#x27;ve ever had. This is even with generous portions of pre-shave. I cannot avoid razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this is a bad shaver as it did give me a close shave but at the cost of red, irritated skin all day long.</li>
    <li> This Remington razor has a nice sleek design and feels good in your hand. It is light weight, easy to hold, and has some rubber-like material on the handle that allows you to keep a good grip on it. Its rechargeable lithium ion battery lasts thru about 15 shaves for me. It has an easy-to-read indicator that shows how much of a charge is left, so you do not have to wonder. The three rotary heads float on a top that adjusts to the grooves and angles of your face and neck as you shave. You can also use it for wet or dry shaving.  Its design allows you to get it all wet in case you want to use it in the shower. The head pops off to allow you to clean it with running water, and the rotary heads are color-matched to their attachments. There is also a stand that can be used to store the razor and/or charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble with this razor for me is that when shaving, it does not cut much of my stubble. I do not know if it is because I have coarse hair in my beard or because it is not made well. It did shave better when I used shaving cream or gel with it. Overall I could not get a good shave, no matter how many times I tried it. It may suit guys with fine hair in their beard, though but I do not recommend it for everybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed in rotary shavers in the past, most of the ones I&#x27;ve previously used were too slow and prone to missing spots but this one surprised me, it gives a very nice shave when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other electric shaver is a Panasonic 8228 foil shaver, which was their highest end model circa 2007.  I&#x27;ve been using it off-and-on (I also use Merkur DE safety razors and occasionally the shick Hydro5) for the past 7 years and it gives great results although it does have a few flaws: namely that it is very loud and has poor battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington on the other hand is super quiet and has exceptional battery life.  When used dry, the Panasonic gives a much better shave than the Remington but when used wet the results are almost equal.  I would still say the panasonic is a tiny bit faster and gives a closer shave, but the results are very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the energy efficiency of this unit is that it relies on having sharp blades to cut the hairs efficiently, whereas the foil shaver relies more on the shearing force created by its loud and powerful motor so it does not require the blades to be very sharp.  In fact, I have not changed the blades once in the 7 years I have had the Panasonic unit and it still works great.  I have not had this Remington unit long enough to assess how frequently the blades would need to be changed but I don&#x27;t think they will last anywhere near 7 years, probably more like 1 year at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you do need to change the blades more frequently, the price of this unit is pretty low and the performance is good as long as you are using it wet, so I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Remington Xr1350 is one of the best, if not the best, electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;d never tried a triple head type shaver before, only the flat, rectangular shaped heads, but after trying this I can see the edge this design has over the competition.  The three heads flex more than the rectangular types, and since they&#x27;re independent of each other, this allows for more flexibility while shaving around the chin and other angular areas of the face.  It gets closer shaves on the sideburns and just feels so much smoother than the old, rectangular style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the ergonomic design of the handle, it fits snugly and effortlessly in my hand, plus it&#x27;s quite lightweight so it&#x27;s not a chore to hold it for longer periods of time.  The charge time is really fast, it looks stylish and the blades are clearly sharp because I haven&#x27;t caught any hairs in the blades to get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best feature is that this can be used in the shower or under running water, gotta love that for time and convenience&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside, and it is a minor one, with this shaver is that the red charging light on the bottom is really hard to see/read, unless the lights are low or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the motor feels a bit weak, could definitely use a little boost in power, but this isn&#x27;t enough of a con to downgrade it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  The charging station is small and easy to use, which makes it ideal for traveling.  Remington makes great shavers and this is one of their finest, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband. The trimmer is excellent. It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not as close as a Norelco shave. The blades are not as durable&lt;br /&gt;as they should be. He likes this shaver because of the great trimming capability,&lt;br /&gt;but otherwise, it delivers a &amp;#34;passable&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> I used it as recommended: in the shower with a gel shaving lotion.  On the whole, it worked better than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I got a fairly clean shave, but there was definitely still some stubble when I was finished.  I gave it an honest effort, but a truly clean shave just wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  Once I got out of the shower, I cleaned it up a little using my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I found that the design allowed me to hit all the necessary spots.  Better still, I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation.  On the downside, I found the whole cleaning process a little annoying, but then I guess that&#x27;s the case with any electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Remington has a reputation of not being the best, and lets be honest, shaving sucks especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hair or you get a 5 a clock shadow just minutes after shaving (exaggeration but it does feel like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to how much shaving sucks, its important to get the most bang for your buck and overall this is a very good, Mid-Priced Option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare this product, This remington is more solid than the typical Remington shaver and on a par with similarly priced Norelcos. Its very comfortable to hold and you can get a good grip with wet hands (it can also be used as a wet shaver). It does a good job of following facial contours even on the jawline. Works best with a thin layer of a gel-type shave cream. The ergonomics of the handle suggest that this shaver was designed for right handed individuals (going counter-clockwise can results in red spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the instructions tell you to charge for a full 24 hour before the first use. Its also easy to clean as well. Just pop off the plastic panel over the foil and you can rinse it through. Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a good, mid-priced option.</li>
    <li> I was originally very excited to receive this shaver to review. I have had a fair number of electric shavers in my life. Norelco/Philips rotaries, Braun foil shavers, etc. I&#x27;ve also used the usual complement of multi-bladed razors and various shaving creams and gels. What I&#x27;ve concluded for myself (your mileage may vary) is that if you want the most convenient and portable shave, go with an electric. If you want the best shave, go with a Gillette Trac II (no typo, I like the Trac II and wish I could get more for when my stash runs out …) when used with Edge brand gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all background to say, I was hoping that this super looking new tech electric would come very close to my razor experience with less fuss, and make me feel like my various Norelco/Philips rotaries are pass&amp;eacute;. It turns out, this is not the case. They are, in my opinion, all about the same when used dry. I actually read and followed all the instructions! This Remington has a nice feel. It is decently well made. The charging and charging stand work well. It has a nice charge indicator that works in about 20% increments. However, when I use it for a dry shave, it comes out about like my others, with two minor advantages: 1. the head is a little more flexible and can reach into the creases around my nose area slightly better; 2. It&#x27;s slightly quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i was paying (This was an evaluation unit) I would not have thought it was worth the 2x difference from my Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this does wet shaving, too. So, I tried it out in the shower, per instructions, using my favorite Edge gel. I have to say, it did shave closer than in the dry mode, and it was a comfortable shave. It was not quite as good as my razor, though. The main reason I think it was a bit better than the dry version is that with the wet shave you can press a little firmer and shave over the same area more times without the discomfort that you might have if you did the same with the dry shaver. I repeated this a number of times (five or so) to make sure it felt the same each day. It was consistently OK, but not as great as my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this would seem fine, but remember the reason I started using electric instead of my razor was convenience. Well, if you use this baby in wet mode, you have negated the convenience factor and I felt like I should go back to a regular wet razor. I did, to complete the comparison, and I was left wondering why I&#x27;d ever left for electric! And, the amount of trouble is slightly less than this or any other electric wet/dry because there is less cleaning of the unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to my one actual complaint. On my Philips razors, i push a button and the head flips open for cleaning. I blow and wipe it out, and it&#x27;s good to go. With this one, you have to pull or unsnap the head assembly  and remove it entirely - it is not hinged. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is not a onfience inspiring thing and it is not as convenient. I mean, this is a $100 tool. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want something like this, it&#x27;s good quality for what it is and I think you&#x27;ll like it. However, you should consider what I&#x27;ve written above and be prepared for this to NOT be revolutionary if you had a decent rotary electric previously.ated this a number of times (five or so) to make sure it felt the same each day. It was consistently OK, but not as great as my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this would seem fine, but remember the reason I started using electric instead of my razor was convenience.

    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  I have dark course black hair and I always have a lot of trouble finding an electric razor that can do a decent job.  This is not as good as a regular razor but for electric razors it is the best I have had.</li>
    <li> Does not shave close enough. No matter how long I work, I still can feel the stubble. My Panasonic model gets me baby smooth. This razor is definitely inferior.&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice in the hand, and it is easy to open up for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about getting a super close shave, then this one is just OK.</li>
    <li> Wow.  A great close shave.  Better than a more expensive one from another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I did not like this shaver at all. I can feel it pinching when I&#x27;m shaving longer stubble. The shave isn&#x27;t very close at all. I also get tufts of stubble around acne and other uneven areas of my face. I dare not go over these areas too many times because I received a cut over an acne the first time I used the shaver. My face also feels raw after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have these problems with the [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY foil-type Panasonic shaver]] that I&#x27;ve used for the last 2 years. I cannot recommend this shaver, especially if you have acne prone or uneven skin.</li>
    <li> Shaves very smoothly and quietly.  It is comfortable to hold, the switch to turn it on is in a good position and it is easy to hold onto it.  I honestly haven&#x27;t tried enough different brands of shaver to be able to compare it well to other brands, but I am very pleased with this shaver, which replaces one that was damaged going through airport security when they threw my bag.</li>
    <li> It is good and lightweight, for shaved.</li>
    <li> Remington makes some great razors, and even though the head is kind of large, it shaves well with only a few passes. My neck requires a bit more work, and some days (especially hot ones when my skin is a little moist) I have to give up and use a blade. But, this is pretty standard with every razor I have used, and I guess your experience will vary depending on your particular skin type. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it with longer stubble after a few days of growth. It&#x27;s best to use as a daily razor.</li>
    <li> Quiet, flexible, and mostly effective. I still prefer my braun shaver, because I can get a little closer shave in some areas and this gave me some skin irritation.  That said, I think that will probably be a personal facial shape and skin sensitivity thing.  This feels pretty good to hold, but ultimately it will has become my backup shaver.</li>
    <li> If it were up to me, I would rock a low stubble my entire life, using just a trimmer and nothing more. Alas, as a married man who wants to please his sensitive-cheeked wife, a close shave has become a requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver (also a Remington) got a really close shave but as a result, yanked facial hair our of my skin ruthlessly and made for a painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Xr1350, however, is extremely comfortable. It&#x27;s like running a baby&#x27;s butt over your face--a butt that takes your facial hair off. Okay- that&#x27;s a little weird, but you get the drift. This shaver is comfortable! My first shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the previous model, but subsequent efforts have made for a happy face and a happier wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update- it appears the hair yanker effect happens with all Remington products. If you let the stubble go too far, this thing will be brutal. Definitely clean after each shave and trim before the shave (this shouldn&#x27;t be necessary), and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
