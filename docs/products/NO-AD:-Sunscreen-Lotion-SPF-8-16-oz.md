      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>and it smells good!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely happy that I did.  </li>
      <li>but the lotion went on well and provided great protection.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and the price/quantity ratio can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I have never used this brand before but have to say I love it!!</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>The smell is very nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and was pleased to have it mailed so promptly.</li>
      <li>Good sun protection, great price</li>
      <li>and it does a great job and smells good and is not greasy</li>
      <li>GOOD ALL AROUND....</li>
      <li>The good: NO-AD spf 8 did keep me from getting burned in the Keys in 80+ bright and sunny weather.  </li>
      <li>Good ITEM&amp;#60;</li>
      <li>GOOD SHIPPING&amp;#60;</li>
      <li>Excellent smell and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>and it was inexpensive, worked great, and the bottle has twice the amount as most lotions.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
      <li>Smells like a nice lotion not sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Besides excellent SPF protection, having aloe &amp; vitamin E really helps my skin keep healthy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF&#x27;s, I bought those too!!</li>
      <li>What more could you need?</li>
      <li>I love No-Ad tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>more for the summer.....</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using No-Ad for years and love the product.  </li>
      <li>I returned with a lovely, even tan that spelled \\&quot;vacation!\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Sun protection is mandatory if you are resident of any locale where solar damage can occur to your skin all 12 months of the calendar, and I  have found over many decades that No-Ad is simply the best suntan lotion or cream you can buy.  </li>
      <li>For whatever reason, I get a burning sensation with most sunscreens when applied to my face.</li>
      <li>Love this sun ran lotion</li>
      <li>I tan really easy but still want some protection</li>
      <li>This is eminently sensible, safe and successful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for many years of pain free tanning- at a very affordable price!</li>
      <li>It is water proof, lasts a long time and smells good!  </li>
      <li>Best suntan lotion, hands down!</li>
      <li>and fortunately I did not burn at all.  </li>
      <li>I am relatively light skinned</li>
      <li>originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  </li>
      <li>This was the first time we tried the NO-AD line and were pleased.  </li>
      <li>I was worried about burning because of the low SPF but was so happy that I didn&#x27;t burn at all in the hot sun!</li>
      <li>Helps me get a good even tan even though I didn&#x27;t want all the extra protection.</li>
      <li>It works just as well (or better) than the high priced brands!</li>
      <li>This is the best price I can find for an ever increasingly difficult product to fine in stores!  </li>
      <li>I love that it smells like bananas instead of the normal sunscreen smell.</li>
      <li>I am fairly light skinned and if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  </li>
      <li>Big bottles, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>Fourth, I&#x27;ll rarely work more than 4 hours if it&#x27;s over 100F.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very important to me that seller&#x27;s list ingredients properly.</li>
      <li>When I bought it at Amazon, it was close to $9, a bit higher than retail at say W&#x27; mart.</li>
      <li>They quit carrying it locally so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For more exposed areas (i.e., neck, back, or face), I use SPF-15 or SPF-30, but always, ALWAYS use nothing but No-Ad brand.  </li>
      <li>At first I was somewhat concerned about using an SPF 8.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my logic for not going with a heavier-duty product: First, I wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, pants, and gloves when working in the dirt.</li>
      <li>It helps give a nice slow and easy tan.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken it to very humid SE Asia, too and still had no problem.</li>
      <li>I normally get some burn where I don&#x27;t put on the lotion or it wears off, but this stuff seemed to provide good solid protection for a long time.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper than most other brands.</li>
      <li>So many other sunscreens irritate my skin and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more</li>
      <li>I use SPF-8 for my legs and feet, which never burn, and thereby can maintain a decent semi-tan.  </li>
      <li>Again, no hard proof, but be warned.  </li>
      <li>I use the #8 formula as my main tanning lotion during hot Oklahoma summers while we&#x27;re restoring 127 acres of pasture back to native prairie.</li>
      <li>This has been increasingly hard to find a more retailers aren&#x27;t carrying it as much because of the skin cancer institute recommendations to use #30 &amp; above when out in the sun.</li>
      <li>I have been using No-Ad 8 for nearly 20 years.  </li>
      <li>Second, the sun lands mainly at an oblique angle to any exposed skin.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Add all that up, and a #8 sunscreen works out to the equivalent of less than 15 minutes of actual full exposure, given 4 hours out in the sun.</li>
      <li>There is just about no harder test for a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I had thought I had also ordered SPF 15 but that order apparently didn&#x27;t go through.</li>
      <li>No dry skin.  </li>
      <li>You get twice as much for the same amount of money, vs. other lotions/creams, such as Coppertone, yet the protection is identical.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was the first time we tried the NO-AD line and were pleased.  It has a slightly different odor than the name brands (maybe they are scented and more expensive?) but the lotion went on well and provided great protection.  I normally get some burn where I don&#x27;t put on the lotion or it wears off, but this stuff seemed to provide good solid protection for a long time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I tan really easy but still want some protection so I use this and it does a great job and smells good and is not greasy</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using No-Ad for years and love the product.  It works just as well (or better) than the high priced brands!</li>
    <li> Please update ingredient list.  I am allergic to Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate) so am not able to use the product as it is listed as an ingredient on the bottle.  The family can use it so not a total loss.  It&#x27;s very important to me that seller&#x27;s list ingredients properly. Disappointed as thought I found something I can use.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful that Amazon carries this brand since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere!  I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more, I realized stores don&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  I am fairly light skinned and if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t any smell, it&#x27;s not sticky and I even put it on my face without any problems.  It&#x27;s an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF&#x27;s, I bought those too!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and was pleased to have it mailed so promptly. I have a hard time finding it in a retail store.  I had thought I had also ordered SPF 15 but that order apparently didn&#x27;t go through.</li>

    <li> Great product. Helps me get a good even tan even though I didn&#x27;t want all the extra protection.</li>
    <li> The good: NO-AD spf 8 did keep me from getting burned in the Keys in 80+ bright and sunny weather.  The bad: Before I begin, let me say I have no proof that it was indeed the NO-AD, though, can&#x27;t figure out what else it could be. Put No-Ad lotion on at the beach with my hands, then picked up my pencil to do a puzzle. Within an hour I noticed my pencil was all sticky feeling. Inspection showed the finish on the pencil had dissolved. (Nothing else had come in contact with it.) Also, after using and handling my cell ph, I noticed the hard plastic case on my EVO had shriveled up into a puckered mess. Weird. Again, no hard proof, but be warned.  Comment</li>
    <li> Good ITEM&amp;#60; GOOD SHIPPING&amp;#60; GOOD ALL AROUND....</li>
    <li> At first I was somewhat concerned about using an SPF 8.  However, I didn&#x27;t want to return from Mexico looking as if I had been nowhere sunny so I took a chance and I&#x27;m extremely happy that I did.  I returned with a lovely, even tan that spelled \\&quot;vacation!\\&quot;.  I am relatively light skinned and fortunately I did not burn at all.  I did use the No-Ad Protective Tanning Lotion (SPF 15) on my nose and other spots that are prone to burning and everything went well.  No burns.  No peeling.  No dry skin.  This product is great and the price/quantity ratio can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever. Excellent smell and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I use the #8 formula as my main tanning lotion during hot Oklahoma summers while we&#x27;re restoring 127 acres of pasture back to native prairie. There is just about no harder test for a sunscreen. Here&#x27;s my logic for not going with a heavier-duty product: First, I wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, pants, and gloves when working in the dirt. Second, the sun lands mainly at an oblique angle to any exposed skin. Third, because I&#x27;m moving, only half my exposed skin ever gets sun at any given time. Fourth, I&#x27;ll rarely work more than 4 hours if it&#x27;s over 100F. Add all that up, and a #8 sunscreen works out to the equivalent of less than 15 minutes of actual full exposure, given 4 hours out in the sun. Now, No-AD is inexpensive, non-greasy, and smells wonderfully coconutty. Compare that with Bullfrog #30 Surfer Formula, which I will wear if it&#x27;s over 100F and I HAVE to work outside for 8-10 ultra-sweaty hours. The Bullfrog feels like putting 30-weight motor oil on. So, do the math. Calculate your actual exposure, figure in the Comfort Factor, and you&#x27;ll conclude that there&#x27;s a place for this product in your arsenal of sunscreens.</li>
    <li> This has been increasingly hard to find a more retailers aren&#x27;t carrying it as much because of the skin cancer institute recommendations to use #30 &amp; above when out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Best suntan lotion, hands down!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for a trip to Cancun. I have never used this brand before but have to say I love it!! The smell is very nice. I was worried about burning because of the low SPF but was so happy that I didn&#x27;t burn at all in the hot sun! I would recommend. I used with the NO-AD Hawaiian Style Dark Tanning Oil, SPF 4, 16 Ounces.</li>
    <li> Good sun protection, great price and it smells good! What more could you need? My go to brand for the summer months.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I ever buy. I love that it smells like bananas instead of the normal sunscreen smell. Not very oily, rubs in well. Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper than most other brands.</li>
    <li> I have this in every spf number there is. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time as we have a place on the lake &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using No-Ad 8 for nearly 20 years.  Besides excellent SPF protection, having aloe &amp; vitamin E really helps my skin keep healthy.  I will work dive boats from time to time and will be in the sun all day.  Using No-Ad through out the day I will come home with no sunburn.</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen I will use. They quit carrying it locally so was glad to find it on Amazon. So many other sunscreens irritate my skin and this one doesn&#x27;t. The smell is awesome too!  Smells like a nice lotion not sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the usual store-brand, and it is a reliable product that does protect from the sun without feeling too thick or feeling caustic on the skin.  When I bought it at Amazon, it was close to $9, a bit higher than retail at say W&#x27; mart.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for months.....&lt;br /&gt;It is the best suntan lotion ever!&lt;br /&gt;Need more for the summer.....</li>
    <li> Bought this for a trip to Jamaica and it was inexpensive, worked great, and the bottle has twice the amount as most lotions. It let me get a little sun without getting burned. When it arrived I noticed that it said &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34; and I was afraid that it was the type that dyes your skin, but it was not (presumably tanning lotion just means that it is not a high-spf sunblock lotion). The resort had white beach towels and this lotion seemed to give them a yellow-orange color. I didn&#x27;t notice any discoloration of anything else but I would be careful with white clothes, etc.</li>
    <li> Very good. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I can find for an ever increasingly difficult product to fine in stores!  It is water proof, lasts a long time and smells good!  My skin likes it too!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Does the job well and very little order.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!&lt;br /&gt;Have used No Ad for years, both the #4 and this. Have NEVER had a sunburn despite travelling from ice and snow one day, to Barbados in December. I&#x27;ve taken it to very humid SE Asia, too and still had no problem. It helps give a nice slow and easy tan.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to be a well oiled glistening red bronzed body, this is not for you. This is eminently sensible, safe and successful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for many years of pain free tanning- at a very affordable price!</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I get a burning sensation with most sunscreens when applied to my face. No rash or anything. But his has been the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that does not cause that reaction.</li>
    <li> Living on the Big Island, I spend year-round time at the beach, or fishing, or SCUBA diving.  Sun protection is mandatory if you are resident of any locale where solar damage can occur to your skin all 12 months of the calendar, and I  have found over many decades that No-Ad is simply the best suntan lotion or cream you can buy.  You get twice as much for the same amount of money, vs. other lotions/creams, such as Coppertone, yet the protection is identical.  I use SPF-8 for my legs and feet, which never burn, and thereby can maintain a decent semi-tan.  For more exposed areas (i.e., neck, back, or face), I use SPF-15 or SPF-30, but always, ALWAYS use nothing but No-Ad brand.  It is an unbeatable deal.</li>
