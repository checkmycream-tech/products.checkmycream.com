### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Fir perfectly on my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to Phillips heads for a fraction of the cost!  </li>
      <li>I will happily order these again rather than pay an exorbitant amount for the name brand!</li>
      <li>These work just as good as the brush heads in the store, but for a fraction of the cost!</li>
      <li>Perfect product and amazing price.</li>
      <li>Just like the original!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect fit.</li>
      <li>My wife was super pleased with the product and the price!!!</li>
      <li>My wife and I share one Sonicare toothbrush and just swap out our own toothbrush heads a couple of times each day as we brush our teeth.  </li>
      <li>I think they are as good or better than the Sonicare brand.  </li>
      <li>Work great and WOW what a savings over the name brand!!!!!</li>
      <li>Very cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>I hope I won&#x27;t lose any more bristles...</li>
      <li>I will be buying more for sure</li>
      <li>I have gone back to the genuine Phillips heads which perform flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find replacement brushes for such good price.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit snugly into the shaft but works just fine nonetheless.</li>
      <li>my philips sonicare just fine, comfortable bristle soft-med firmness.</li>
      <li>These replacement heads fit my Sonicare</li>
      <li>price for the genuine product is unjustified...</li>
      <li>will continue to use these on a regular basis as it is a great advantage considering the cost against the &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; brand.</li>
      <li>but once you use them a few times they are perfect!</li>
      <li>The brushes feel softer than the one that came originally with my electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It works for me - and now my wife really likes them :-)</li>
      <li>However, be aware (and warn you spouse before the first brushing) that you will probably get some bristles stuck in your teeth an in our mouth.  </li>
      <li>This has happened consistently to the first 3 heads that we used from the package.  </li>
      <li>I do not have a real high expectations on these knock-off brand brush heads.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the more expensive brand name.</li>
      <li>importantly, they fit properly (don&#x27;t come loose) and clean well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Their hardness is somewhere between the Sonicare blue brushes and the diamond clean brushes and, for me, they are just right.</li>
      <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
      <li>Look like (and is) cheaper version of the real stuff.</li>
      <li>but also I lost couple of bristles at the very beginning of using.</li>
      <li>may or may not be a desirable quality for you, so just keep this in mind, but as I mentioned, they fit snugly and will definitely save you a bundle of money!</li>
      <li>These generic brush heads seem to be of comparable quality to the more expensive genuine Phillips heads except for one important feature.  </li>
      <li>Another replacement package (for the same price per replacement head) that contained 8 replacement heads did indeed have the little rings necessary and were a great buy and work well, unlike these.  </li>
      <li>Now it has been a few weeks and the brush head acts OK.</li>
      <li>and they are contoured properly (which is more than I can say for other knock-off</li>
      <li>Spent so much money on a fancy electric toothbrush to protect receding gums and then I try to find cheaper heads only to worry that they will do more damage than a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>go on with a little effort and stay securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I even tried using the little ring on these that came without them, and even then these replacement heads will not hold on securely.  </li>
      <li>I wish it came with the clear plastic cover that the sonicare brushes have, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>I simply was not going to pay retail for the real McCoy</li>
      <li>like the rest of the reviews, the brush is a little stiff but still a good</li>
      <li>Long enough to reach the back teeth of someone with a mouth as big as mine.  :-)</li>
      <li>This package of replacements came WITHOUT the small ring necessary to hold the replacement head securely on the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Issue goes away after the first half dozen uses - or so...  </li>
      <li>I understand the quality may suffer a little considering it is much cheaper compared to originals.</li>

    <li> I understand the quality may suffer a little considering it is much cheaper compared to originals. But I expect something at least functional. I do not have a real high expectations on these knock-off brand brush heads. But come on, the bristles were so stiff as if someone was poking my teeth! It squeaks on the handle all the time which makes me a joke in front of my wife.</li>
    <li> these work just as well and the sonicare brand, no bristles ever fell out and they lasted about as long as the sonicare. They snap on well and stayed on with no problems.</li>
    <li> Perfect product and amazing price. They are a little tough but once you use them a few times they are perfect!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads fit my Sonicare perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on with a little effort and stay securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit of getting used to the stiff bristles, which is probably because the original heads were intentionally of a softer variety, so I now have to remember to use less pressure when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may or may not be a desirable quality for you, so just keep this in mind, but as I mentioned, they fit snugly and will definitely save you a bundle of money!</li>
    <li> I simply was not going to pay retail for the real McCoy so I bought these.  I think they are as good or better than the Sonicare brand.  Perhaps a little firmer.  However, be aware (and warn you spouse before the first brushing) that you will probably get some bristles stuck in your teeth an in our mouth.  Issue goes away after the first half dozen uses - or so...  It works for me - and now my wife really likes them :-)</li>
    <li> As the other reviewer had stated, the bristles are very firm.  But they soften up some and they are contoured properly (which is more than I can say for other knock-off sonicare heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, they fit properly (don&#x27;t come loose) and clean well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for the genuine product is unjustified... I will be buying more for sure</li>
    <li> Very cheap feeling. Very hard plastic-y bristles. Spent so much money on a fancy electric toothbrush to protect receding gums and then I try to find cheaper heads only to worry that they will do more damage than a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find replacement brushes for such good price. The brushes feel softer than the one that came originally with my electric toothbrush. Not only that, but also I lost couple of bristles at the very beginning of using. Now it has been a few weeks and the brush head acts OK. I hope I won&#x27;t lose any more bristles...</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the brush heads in the store, but for a fraction of the cost!</li>

I really like these brushes. Their hardness is somewhere between the Sonicare blue brushes and the diamond clean brushes and, for me, they are just right.</li>
    <li> Just like the original!!!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to Phillips heads for a fraction of the cost!  Fits snugly on the brush.  A tiny bit different feel for the brush, but not in a bad way.  I will happily order these again rather than pay an exorbitant amount for the name brand!</li>
    <li> Fir perfectly on my toothbrush. I wish it came with the clear plastic cover that the sonicare brushes have, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My wife and I share one Sonicare toothbrush and just swap out our own toothbrush heads a couple of times each day as we brush our teeth.  These generic brush heads seem to be of comparable quality to the more expensive genuine Phillips heads except for one important feature.  The female end of the brush head does not stand up to multiple (i.e. half-dozen or so) installations and removals from the toothbrush motor shaft.  After 5-10 cycles of installing and removing the brush head, the female end of the brush head wears down and no longer remains firmly attached to the vibrating motor shaft.  This is exceptionally annoying when you are brushing and the head comes off.  This has happened consistently to the first 3 heads that we used from the package.  I have gone back to the genuine Phillips heads which perform flawlessly.  If you are the only one using the toothbrush, this may not be an issue for you since I believe the wear comes from the constant removing and re-installing the head.  That is why I gave it 2 stars - probably 4-5 stars for non-sharing application and 0 stars for sharing application.</li>
    <li> the cut of the bristles is too sharp can cut gums</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about amonth now.&lt;br /&gt;And like the rest of the reviews, the brush is a little stiff but still a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these on a regular basis as it is a great advantage considering the cost against the &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; brand.</li>
    <li> Look like (and is) cheaper version of the real stuff. Doesn&#x27;t sit snugly into the shaft but works just fine nonetheless.</li>
    <li> never again pay the unjustified highway robbery price for a stick of plastic with bristles on the end of it!!&lt;br /&gt;fit my philips sonicare just fine, comfortable bristle soft-med firmness.</li>
    <li> This package of replacements came WITHOUT the small ring necessary to hold the replacement head securely on the toothbrush.  Thus it comes off about every 20 seconds rendering them completely useless.  Another replacement package (for the same price per replacement head) that contained 8 replacement heads did indeed have the little rings necessary and were a great buy and work well, unlike these.  I even tried using the little ring on these that came without them, and even then these replacement heads will not hold on securely.  Worthless they are so don&#x27;t waste your money.  roger h</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and la bit longer than OEM head.  Long enough to reach the back teeth of someone with a mouth as big as mine.  :-)</li>
    <li> My wife was super pleased with the product and the price!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Work great and WOW what a savings over the name brand!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive brand name.</li>
