<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are the best clippers but they are NOT cordless.  They do have a cordless model.  But as far as clippers go, these are industrial strength.  Highly recommend, the only reason they got four stars is because they are not wireless.</li>
    <li> Incredible! So worth the reasonable price. Cuts far better than my Wahl clippers and has a nice quiet hum. Love cutting hair with it every day.</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair every week for the past 15 years with a Remington. It broke and could not be fixed so I opted to replace it with a Wahl. The Wahl&#x27;s vibrations were so bad and it was so loud (read my Wahl review) I purchased the Remington Indestructible. The Remington is smooth and comfortable in the hand. It does not have the adjustment on the blade like my previous one (which happens to be the part that broke). I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cuts very smooth and even. Clippers are quiet which is a plus for us so our toddler doesn&#x27;t get scared. High quality low price</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and our two son&#x27;s hair.  She does a great job, and it saves us a fortune...conservatively $720/year.  So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new technology that will make her job easier, and allow her to do a more professional job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past we&#x27;ve used the Andis 18645, then the Remington HC-600, then the Philips Norelco QC5530.  This trimmer, the Remington HC5850, is better than all of them, even though it lacks some of the features the others have.  For instance, the HC-600 and QC5530 are both cordless.  The HC5850 (this one) is not cordless, but it does have a 10 foot cord so it has plenty of reach.  The problem we found with cordless models is that you can&#x27;t do a spur of the moment hair cut because you need to charge it first.  So you end up using it plugged in anyway, and then the cord length is only 5-6 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has plenty of power to handle my very thick hair in one pass, yet it is easily the quietest of the models we&#x27;ve tried.  My wife commented that it is smaller than the other units (probably because they need room for a battery), and is more comfortable to hold.  She also says it is more accurate when she blends hair lengths, and when she trims around my ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when she uses the bare blade against my neck that it is comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t rake against my skin like some of the others, which quite frankly are uncomfortable.  I did notice that the combs were a little sharp on the ends, so be careful when you are trimming a little one&#x27;s hair.  Don&#x27;t come in at a steep angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my hair cut an hour ago, and I feel like the finished product is nearly as good as a professional could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the 4 stars then?  The cape that comes with this kit is very small, only big enough for a child.  If you&#x27;re going to cut adult hair, invest in a good full sized cape.  Otherwise all of the trimmed hair falls neatly into your lap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a nice \\&quot;indestructible\\&quot; hard case, but it is a real challenge to fit everything back into the case when you&#x27;re done.  I would sacrifice the hard case for a soft flexible case that is a little bigger, like the one that comes with the Remington HC-600.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this kit is a winner that I recommend if you want to save a bunch of money on haircuts.  I have even done my own haircut from time to time and it&#x27;s not that hard.destructible\\&quot; hard case, but it is a real challenge to fit everything back into the case when you&#x27;re done.

I have even done my own haircut from time to time and it&#x27;s not that hard.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever owned. They are so light and yet durable, they do NOT cut up your skin when going straight blade and cut through even thick long hair like butter. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Excellent Clippers.  Works much better than the standard ones.  Clean cut, low noise.  Good Job!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clipper. I have tried over 10 different clippers in the past 10 years. Others don&#x27;t even come close to this. I would buy this product again without even looking at anything else. Its hair cutting quality is great and it is powerful. I could not ask for a better product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Lots of extras with the kit.</li>
    <li> okay only.  quality is lacking.</li>
    <li> They work great..Best pair I ever bought</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy haircutter.</li>
    <li> I tried other clippers and none work as well as these. Cuts my very thick hair with ease and works better than any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I like this clipper a lot since I purchased it, it&#x27;s accurate enough that I can shave my hair down to an decent length rather quickly. I do not believe the indestructible label that they placed with this product. It seems to not be built to be indestructible however the lifetime warranty fixes that little issue quite quickly. However I am disappointing in the fact that every time I went to the sight to register my product to qualify for the lifetime warranty the site would not have it in a findable location. So my product is not technically warrantied as I have come to understand it unless I register my product with Remington. This is a shame but the cost of the product is better than most other so it is not a total loss.</li>
    <li> Great product packaging annoying to open</li>
    <li> So I just got these clippers today box seems sturdy when I opened the box to my surprise these clippers were slightly smaller than the average heavy duty ones but I gave it a shot it turns on smooth it&#x27;s not loud has a vary quite hum it took all my hair off as if it was butter the motor did not strain what so ever I consistently have to throw clippers away due to frequent hair cuts for me and my friends I&#x27;m in the military and cut my hair every two days along with the rest of my friends that use it to this is by far the best clippers I have used the clips don&#x27;t fall off in tuff use and it doesn&#x27;t rust easy like others do with cutting hair in the shower I recommend 5 of 5 stars</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. I keep my hair at 1/8 or 3/8 depending on mood. I use it on the kids too. It cuts smoothly and evenly. The motor has ample power and is pretty quiet. It fits nice in the hand as well. This replaced an Oster I bought at Wal-E-World and I have to say I am impressed. I definitely recommend giving these clippers a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be aware of is the detachable blade. It is fairly easy to remove which means you can accidentally remove -at least partially- while cutting. Not an issue with awareness and keeping fingers away from blade assembly. It has not occurred during my operation of it. I just foresee this as a possible issue for some. If it were to occur blades would be disengaged.</li>
    <li> I love this . I would buy this one again. I use it to trim my dog and I do love it.</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair and this product makes me feel like Ina professional. It comes with 8 different length attachments, shears, and the cape is the best part!</li>
    <li> It is an amazing low noise, low vibration, easy clean, easy maintenance, and perfect rubber grip shaver for cutting your hair every week or two.  I took a gamble on them buying them at Walmart without checking amazon reviews and I was more than pleased with my gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging made claims of lifetime warranty, better than Wahl, and indestructible.  I find that good planning and design in the construction of an item making a quality built item usually results in durability.  For clippers, durability is the top priority.  They could easily sell these for twice the price if the market wasn&#x27;t flooded by Wahl and saturated with super low cost crap.  I am amazed what they were able to do for the $20-40 price range these fall into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair guards!! They fit really well and tight.  I was actually a bit nervous about breaking off the plastic tab when I went to remove it because it fits so well.  They are a harder plastic than some others I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> i use it all the time it never misses any spots. It is quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull hair and cuts really smooth. I look like i had my hair professionally cut after i use it but i did it myself and save time and money with this! make sure you oil the blade after every use it comes with the oil and it will last forever if you do that</li>
    <li> Finally a great clipper set! I have two dogs that I shave. One has a lot of medium length thick hair, the other has baby fine medium length hair. I&#x27;ve bought several other clipper sets and spent a great deal more on every one of them. The problem was I&#x27;d only get through one attempt to cut my (thick haired) dog&#x27;s hair before it would stop working. And the baby fine dog&#x27;s hair is so fine the trimmer set wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to grab and cut it. Extremely frustrating. This set has already done both dog&#x27;s hair three times and it&#x27;s still going strong. It also takes a good 45 mins to shave each of them and this doesn&#x27;t get hot!  Huge benefit since my dog&#x27;s won&#x27;t let me come near them with an overheated hot clipper. Also, it&#x27;s by far the most efficient design. SUPER easy to clean under and behind the blade - no screwdrivers or frustrating contraptions. Blade just slides off and slides/clicks back in. Finally , long cord is another great benefit.</li>
    <li> I like this clipper. It comes in a great kit with all sorts of extra goodies that make the haircutting experience much easier. I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to clean up my hair at home or on the go so this guy works great for that. It&#x27;s also really quiet and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> We have went through several other brands over the years, this one cuts better and much quieter, and lighter.</li>
    <li> Like the light weight of the razor, but the hair sticks all over the razor and the heads are not easy to change.</li>
    <li> This little guy is awesome.  Very quiet and smooth.  Just need to get better at buzzing my own hair.</li>
    <li> Not a ton to say other than it cuts as well or better than my previous Wahl Color Pro but it is easier to clean thanks to the blade being removable with just a button push. Long round cable that doesn&#x27;t bunch up and is easy to manage, obviously cordless would be the best thing here but I&#x27;ve yet to find one that cuts anywhere close to how well a plug in clipper does. Feels solid in my hand with its rubberized body and not heavy yet not cheap feeling weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also comes with a lifetime warranty but that doesn&#x27;t actually cover the things they show off, like drops and running it over so that is pretty pointless marketing.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for my brother.  He lets his hair grow for several months, and then gives himself a buzz cut.  He wrote:  &amp;#34;They&#x27;re fantastic!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very nice product. One of the best value for money.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Prior to buying this Remington product I had a Wahl that worked fine for years but finally just wore out.  I hope this new one lasts as long.</li>
    <li> This is a good clippers to use just make sure you know how to use it before you use it! This helps those who wanna save money by cutting they own!</li>
    <li> Owned trimmer for almost a year now and it&#x27;s still working amazing.  Cuts and trims like a dream.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> works great strong and feels great, cuts good- good price, should last longer than the other and work better, some cutters out there are garbage.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
    <li> These are the best and cheapest clippers I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short hair and I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers to cut my own hair for the last twenty years.  They seem to last me about 5 or 6 years which isn&#x27;t bad but not great either.  I most recently bought the Wahl 8500 Professional series for $62 on Amazon in an attempt to buy one that would last a lifetime, but so much for that idea because it came with a defective switch or cord that had to be jiggled to get it to work.  I sent it back, and frustrated by me experience with Wahl quality, I decided to try another brand and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!  This Remington cutter definitely has a stronger motor and either sharper blades or better aligned blades because I just used it and I was in awe of how well it cut my hair!  It is definitely a superior unit and definitely a bargain on Amazon.  I highly recommend it and I can&#x27;t imagine ever imagine going back to Wahl.</li>
    <li> The item matches the description perfectly. The materials used slid. The haircutter itself is very small, fitting in a hand fully - make it perfectly following the hand directions.&lt;br /&gt;All the heads coming in kit are very nice - and include sizes from #1 to #8. And cleaning this item is really easy.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick most electrics just jam up I have gone through half a dozen different clippers and this one really stands out. The term hot knife through butter is very acurate.</li>
    <li> My family has had a lot of these hair trimmers over the years. From really cheap ones to really expensive ones, we&#x27;ve tried them all. This one is definitely the best one we&#x27;ve had. It came in a nice black case to hold all the pieces. Along with the combs and scissors and other things, there was a cape. Which my whole family was obsessed with. Like they had never seen a barber&#x27;s cape! It really does have everything you need. The clippers themselves are very sturdy feeling. Not too heavy that it&#x27;s annoying but heavy enough to feel good and sturdy in your hands. It&#x27;s not slippery feeling at all, so it won&#x27;t be easily dropped. It&#x27;s pretty quiet. I am easily able to give my family fades which I couldn&#x27;t do with other clippers.  It cuts easily and consistently. It never misses a spot or slows down. It delivers exactly as promised. We&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and it&#x27;s still as good as it was the first day. I am impressed and so happy I finally solved the clipper hunt for my family.</li>
    <li> Well made and quiet compared to other electric clippers I have owned. The long cord makes moving around the subjects head and body easy while giving a haircut. These clippers have a nice heft and are sturdily constructed. The large assortment of clip-on attachments for hair length make getting it right easier, and they don&#x27;t have the problem of shifting that some of the adjustable attachments do. I prefer a corded hair clipper so I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries running low or wearing out. The carrying case makes it easy to keep things organized in one place. The Remington HD5850 is easy to clean and comes with a vial of lubricating oil for the cutting head.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Great home haircuts!!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Used it twice and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Light weight, quiet and comfortable are the adjectives that describe this kit.  I only use it to trim the back of my neck to extend the interval between barber shop visits but, if I can eliminate 2 or 3 haircuts a year it will pay for itself the first year.  The trimmer does a fine job and doesn&#x27;t vibrate and make annoying noises like some other trimmers.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this last night for about $50. My husband and my oldest son have seriously thick hair. Any time we go to get their haircuts, their hair always bogs it down and it shuts off. Every.Single. Time! We bought this on a whim to save money in the long run ($10-15 per haircut, 3 cuts, equals $30-$45 each time we go..for a whole years of cuts thats (every 2 months roughly) $180-$270 down the drain!) Anyways, this is a great way to save money in the long run. So we bought this and it is absolutely amazing. We have only had it bog down once on my husbands hair. Not sure if it was because it was thick, or the fact the battery was starting to die since we didn&#x27;t let it charge fully. Either way, once is better than 3-4 times...each haircut lol. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has super thick hair! This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Had these for a few months now and they&#x27;re fantastic and worth the price. Come in a nice case, with plenty of attachments and beats paying $12.00 a shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. Had a con air for around five years That worked Well, But Was able to Get The job done quicker And smoother With This product. Only drawback Is The small case others commented On. I Just took out some of The heads I Don&#x27;t use often to allow easy retrieval And put up</li>
    <li> Got the product from amazon.com (wasn&#x27;t available on.co.uk. this should have been enough reason not to buy). However I bought it reading few reviews.&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived my brother wanted to use it to trim his beard. He started using it and in less than a minute it destroyed itself.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a wahl clippers from uk website.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for the past 18 years, and these are for sure the best I have ever used. Quieter than other kinds, lots of attachments. The cape is worthless. It&#x27;s too small (short) for adults, and when I tried it for kids, the neck part was too loose. But most kits don&#x27;t come with a cape anyway. You will love this kit!</li>
    <li> If it was cordless it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
    <li> Got this to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. Works great. We have used it for about 5 months now. Consistent cut. We use a regular plastic stick razor for those little neck hairs...the blade on this thing does great a creating a clean hair line at the base of the scalp, but all the finer hairs on the neck it does not pick up.</li>
    <li> Love it. Surprised by the quality considering the low price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington electric razors for years to shave my head. I started with one of the silver and black model, went to a smaller rechargeable and have now tried the HC5850. My complaints about past models are that the silver and black one has teeth that are so sharp I regularly scratch my neck, and that the rechargeable was underpowered. Here&#x27;s my quick take on the HC5850.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Rubber surface makes it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the black and silver, or even the weak rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;Very inconsistent shave. I find myself having to go over the same area many times to cut a smooth, even swath.&lt;br /&gt;Rubbery surface attracts hair.&lt;br /&gt;Power switch is in a hard to reach spot, is too small and does not protrude at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> My Fiancé gave me her first hair cut:) worked great.</li>
    <li> I have tried 2 other  (so called) Professional Wahl Clippers at a higher price and the Remongton blows them away. I keep my hair short and this was the only unit that cut evenly. Cuts, better, quiter, light weight, does not over heat like the others. I only wish the had a 1/16 comb attachment as I get a little nervous cutting with the blade only. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did purchasing The Wahl Senior and then the Wahl 8470-500 Professional Super Taper . Which are now just collecting dust. Remington is the best value by far.</li>
    <li> Several months of use and still works like new.</li>
    <li> After years of getting hacked-up haircuts from &amp;#34;trained professionals&amp;#34;, I decided to try cutting my own hair.  I was very nervous, as I am definitely not artistic.  However, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!  Pick a length (I&#x27;m using the longer 1&amp;#34;), and zip the razor over and across your head a few times.  Nice even haircut!  I&#x27;m thrilled, and recommend this product to everyone!  An added bonus is that you pay for this inexpensive razor in one-or-two haircuts.  And yes, I bet it is indestructible!  Finally, seems to be animal-safe and Proposition 65 compliant.  Buy this clipper!</li>
    <li> This product is very good, the construction is very solid but it has only one very annoying problem: when you use just the metal blade (for trimming or working on details) you can burn your skin because it heats itself very very bad in a short time. I used the oil, so you cannot blame me it heated because i didn&#x27;t use it properly.</li>
    <li> I have always had a remington clipper set (circa 1980?). This was the first clipper set I had ordered since then and so far it is great. I have given my husband a &amp;#34;shave and a haircut&amp;#34; and also mu granson now has a goatee and a shaved head. It is so nice to be able to do this once again. Right now everything is sharp and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only someone somewhere would still sharpen blades.</li>
    <li> Enjoy my new purchase. Very durable.</li>
    <li> This haircut is a realy ligh machine and easily to use, is exactly that I&#x27;ve needed. My husband is happy with them.</li>
    <li> After using another brand of clippers we switched. These clippers are incredible! We immediately ordered another set for grooming our dog. My husband has thick hair and the old brand (that we paid more for) would get stopped multiple times in a haircut. Not these clippers! They moved right through! Have used them about 5 times and are still amazed at how well they work!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, not much vibration in hand, cuts great!</li>
    <li> Good hair cutting machine but I need a machine with a powerful motor and fast</li>
    <li> Light weight. easy to use. quiet compared to my old clippers. smooth cut, no jarring stops. quality product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great razor, glad this one has a removable head to really clean it out!</li>
    <li> perfect works great for curly dog grooming  better than pet one</li>
    <li> Started cutting my hair really short and decided to see if I could do it myself. Also have a beard that I&#x27;ve never been able to keep an even length on the sides and in the front. I Bought the Remington HC5850 because it seemed to have the features I needed. It does! There&#x27;s a 3/8 inch fixture for my head, a 3/4 inch fixture for my side beard and a 1 inch fixture for the front. Works like a charm and is easy to clean. Haven&#x27;t been back to the barber since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak highly enough of this product. I have used many different hair trimming and shaving products before, from all the major names, Braun, Wahl, Phillips, etc, even other Remington&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used trimmers that were cheaper and trimmers that were 5x the price. This trimmer surpasses them all. This is by far the best trimmer I have ever purchased. It is one of the highest quality products in general I have ever purchased. It is extremely well made. It even feels like a quality product. Its small, tough, and quiet. I have had other Remington products before that were just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but this product is nothing like those. I cannot recommend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> Good solid pair of clippers the only reason I am stealing a star is because the size adjustments are not exact to my liking and without the size adjustment it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close to the skin as I had hoped but you can tell it is a solid pair of clippers without any doubts or reservations of any kind well worth the scratch you pay for it and the warranty period is unmatched.</li>
    <li> A great little money-saver my wife uses monthly to keep my sparse locks &amp;#34;in trim&amp;#34;.  Have had several hair trimmers over the years and, so far, this is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> Performane haircut machine. Good,and working this product I like to recommend it. Good deal for me. So worth to me, my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love these hair clippers. My 3 year old likes to get his hair cut every two weeks and it costs me 12 dollars each time. I am trying to save money so I decided to purchase these! Well they have so many sizes and they even come with an apron. The only problem is that I do not know how to cut hair.. my son is currently bald but I consider it a baby step.</li>
    <li> GREAT smooth running clippers. These clippers work great next to the skin and have yet to cut or pinch the skin.</li>
    <li> i bought this for 1 purpose. to buzz of all my hair as short as possible. this is a great set of clippers. i cuts super efficiently and is quiet. i have very thick hair and it flies through like butter. completely effortless. only problem is that the clippers do not cut as close as other ones, but i&#x27;m not complaining</li>
    <li> I have always cut my own hair but never liked the bulky weighty trimmers on the market. This set however really packs a big punch for its size. All the tools are easy to use and install and remove. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> This product is listed as heavy duty, but it is not cumbersome, or hard to manipulate.  It has a long thick type  cord, which I need because I don&#x27;t have a lot of electrical outlets, plus it is a thicker cord, than those plasticky ones we have seen imported during the past recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small but powerful.  I actually dropped it twice, and it has worked fine.  It is also quiet, which is great for those little ones, who are afraid of haircuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of Wahl clipper sets over the years and this Remington easily trumps the last basic Wahl set I purchased. It comes in a very sturdy (though hard to organize) case and has more clipper extension options than the Wahl does. The Wahl boasts an adjustable trimmer blade, but the Remington&#x27;s extensive options negates that benefit. When using the bare clipper blade, one really doesn&#x27;t need to adjust it anyway. My subjective opinion is that the Remington slightly is quieter, does not heat up as much during extended use, and cuts hair more easily with less \\&quot;snags\\&quot;.  It also weighs less and isn&#x27;t as bulky as the Wahl, making it a more nimble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it truly \\&quot;indestructible\\&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure about that, but the lifetime warranty is reassuring. Just don&#x27;t drop it. My main gripe is how easily the blade detaches from the trimmer. This makes it very easy to clean, but one can inadvertently remove it too. I&#x27;ve not run into any problems with this while trimming hair yet, but perhaps that is because I&#x27;m aware of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great trimmer set at a decent price. There are cheaper options than the Remington HC5850, but if you compare it to a similarly priced set from Wahl or Conair, it is pretty close. And I do believe the HC5850 is a quality unit that will last and cut hair effectively over time. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for a quality hair trimming kit than buy one that pulls hair and breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> This item does not come with ear guides. What good is a hair clipper without ear guides? I initiated a return 5 minutes after receiving this product.</li>
    <li> These are the worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!  They are worse than the rusted ones I was attempting to replace with a more powerful rotary motor.  I believe the claim these clippers made was &amp;#34;cuts hair even when wet&amp;#34;, let me just say, they clogged up on the first attempt to cut dry hair and missed a lot of the hair (cut very inconsistently and uneven).  So I&#x27;m pretty sure they would never cut hair that was even slightly damp.  I would stick with the Wahl $20 set unless you know something I don&#x27;t about the professional line Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Extremely light yet cuts true and better than my previous hair cutters.  No issues with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short and have had four machines over the past nine years. This one feels stable and long-lasting after the first six months. Excellent value for the money! I only use the machine, no opinion on the other parts.</li>
    <li> This Remington haircut kit comes with a set of electric clippers that are lightweight and very quiet. I like that there are many different attachments that you can use so that the exact cut can be achieved. These attachments, however, are quite cheap in quality and unfortunately the rest of the accessories have that same low quality production. The scissors are a complete joke and you could seriously get an equivalent pair at a dollar store somewhere. The cape is paper thin and again, so cheaply made that it will not withstand heavy use. While I quite like the clippers, the whole kit is not great.</li>
    <li> As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received one for review.  My wife does most of my haircuts, and she says this is more durable and does a better job than any of the other kits we&#x27;ve had that are of similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my part, the guides were a little painful on my scalp.  Sadly, there&#x27;s not as much hair to trim this anymore.  Still it gave me a professional looking haircut and I am happy with the result.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These clippers do a good job, but I would look for cheaper alternatives.  After using Wahl, Remington, and Conair clippers over the past years, there is not much difference in the quality of their cutting ability.  The features that I now prefer are low cost, and light weight.  They all do about the same cutting job and they all get dull after the same number of cuts, so I have found price is the key.  You are going to toss any of these within a year.  I prefer the low price Conair.  It seems to be lighter and when it inevitably starts getting dull and pulling you just buy another one.  My recommendation is the low price range trimmers will do just as good a job.</li>
    <li> I am no stranger to buying a set of clippers an then turning around an using them for my pets. But I think I have finally found a pair that will last for longer then one shave. The handling is smooths an the cut is easy even for people who only want to do a quick trim. Plus they come with a apron so it&#x27;s easy to clean when your done. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after a big sheep shearing, but this, a trim, will have to do for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last haircut was done with scissors because the clippers, by Wahl, were dead after 3 uses. Now it&#x27;s Remington&#x27;s turn to show them up, and that they did!! The clippers are nice and quiet, and the scissors don&#x27;t pull (a major peeve of mine). They are the most important parts to me! The cape is nice, although I wish the storage case were a tad bigger, because it can be a bit hard to stuff everything in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/12/13 We like it even more after a big shearing. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair at all, which makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how indestructible this haircut kit really is- but it definitely is durable. That&#x27;s the best part about it. It comes at a great price, but doesn&#x27;t feel like it is made out of some cheap material. I replaced my trusty old Wahl clippers with this and WOW. I am so surprised how quiet it is. Wish I would have replaced those clippers quicker. The power behind it outdoes my Wahl clippers too. It comes apart easy and is even easier to clean. Great product. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend of mine who constantly has to shave his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The haircut kit comes in a plastic box that looks like a tool carrying box, which is nice because everything fits in nicely but also look silly to carry around by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the machine is a bit smaller than the previous ones I used, but it still feels very solid, the power cable is a bit thicker than my other blades, which is good since it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as often as with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair with 1 swipe and usually had to swipe about 3 or 4 times which is something that I didn&#x27;t like much, but it was better than the previous ones I had used, so its good but not great in that department&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice kit and good for traveling due to its small size.</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift for my husband and after using the Kit he said that the Remington HC5850 Kit was great and has the best set of clippers that he has ever used. The spacers on the clippers stayed tight and there are several spacers to chose from. The clippers are quiet, nice and very sharp. He also liked that the kit came with oil, scissors, a cape to cover your shoulders and a nice long cord!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> We have tried 4 different razor clippers. The Remington is lightweight, a comfortable fit in your hand, quiet, with smooth operation. It does not have the loud buzz some other clippers have. It has a cord long enough that we don&#x27;t need an extension cord to do the job. It has about 2.5 cm with of non-cutting edge on both sides, which makes it less usable for tapering, especially around ears. I compared it to the other clippers, which have the same 2.5 cm non-cutting edges. It may be no difference in that respect. Side burn cutting works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I really like this set up, as it comes with everything you need to give good haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes neatly packed in a very sturdy carry case that provides convenient &amp; safe storage space for the items included.&lt;br /&gt;Which are the clipper, scissors, brush,cutting cape, blade guard, oil &amp; 8 guide combs.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is a simple no nonsense straight forward affair, &amp; so is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Why waste time going to a barber for just a trim when you can do it at home in just minutes?&lt;br /&gt;This will pay for itself very quickly :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I actually got these for grooming my dog. The specialty clippers I&#x27;ve bought before at the pet store wear out so quickly, and cost the same if not more than this set. There are some features here that have really helped with the grooming process - mainly, that they are not too loud (the noise of other clippers has made my dog so anxious!), and that the cord is good and long (my 45-lb dog can get squirmy during grooming, and I need some flexibility in moving around). The blades also seem to be quite durable and precise, and the fewer times I have to clip over a certain area, the faster the whole grooming process goes. I&#x27;m hoping the blades hold up as they are promised, because this could be a good tool that lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> I have gone through Wahl trimmers and their plastic drive system that doesn&#x27;t work properly. I was so happy to see the design, with metal drive parts. It cuts like the pro units I have seen the Barbers at commercial hair cutters use. Cuts Great and was as inexpensive as the Wahl models !</li>
    <li> Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit is an excellent product I find it is far superior to my old wahl. It seems to have more power and is lighter and easier to maneuver.I also like the way it cuts. The attachments don&#x27;t seem to be any worse quality than the ones I had with the old wahl. If you need a good quality haircutting kit this may be the one for you. I love mine !!!</li>
    <li> My husband keeps his head bald and loves his Wahl but this Remington is a lot better in his opinion. The blades are more even than the Wahls allowing for a lot smoother and even cut and less pulling. The entire device itself did get a bit warm but not too uncomfortably. It is a lot lighter and quieter but it&#x27;s the excellent shave that&#x27;s important. Price point is not bad either considering it does a great job! Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> Beefy but doesn&#x27;t cut very close to the head.  Better than nothing. Will have to use on our animals only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 10 years now. Probably around 15 years. I am pretty &amp;#34;hard core&amp;#34; i.e. I use blades only, no combs, and just try to get the closest cut I can. I&#x27;ve also used rechargeable cutters so far just because, well, there&#x27;s no cable so you can be much more flexible about where you use them (e.g. in the bath to reduce mess) and there&#x27;s no annoying cable, but after using these for the last few years I kind of gave up on them because battery operation seems to decrease over the years and unlike, say, cordless drills, it&#x27;s much more complicated to buy a new battery - you might as well just replace the whole thing. So after replacing two of them, i went back to the good old corded cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one because it&#x27;s very plain and simple. Nice design, comfortable rubber grip and simple on/off switch and they say that the whole thing can&#x27;t be broken no matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main thing is how it cuts - and based on just one haircut so far, it seems like it does a very good job. Seems to be as close as the Wahl &amp;#34;ultra close cut&amp;#34; products to me. It&#x27;s also very smooth and relatively quiet comparing to other cutters i had. Build quality looks great but I haven&#x27;t &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; it so I&#x27;ll take their word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that remains to be seen is durability, or in simple words how long will this cutter keeps performing at this level. I&#x27;m hoping it will last forever and there&#x27;s also a lifetime guarantee but note that it does not include the blades. The blades, btw, are removable. Not sure why or if this is a good thing or not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line: had many cutters, this is actually my 6th one if i haven&#x27;t lost count. Some corded, and some cordless. This is so far my favorite one, right up there with the Wahl &#x27;Close cut&#x27; products which I also liked a lot.</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This sheer.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> The shaver is extremely easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, first with a #2 buzz, then with a #1 buzz.  It consistently results in a nice, even cut.  For buzz cuts it easily saves a $40 a month on barber prices, so a very easy decision to get one for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with plenty of length attachments, although I will like only use the #1.  The only negative is that without any attachments on the cut is not that close.  I tried to use it to trim edges of hair on the neck and to trim a beard, but it is not really useful for that.  I can&#x27;t necessarily count that as a mark against the product as I realize that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for, but it would&#x27;ve been nice if it could handle it better.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SAYS IT&#x27;S VERY PROFESSIONAL</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl trimmer that I gave good ratings to but only lasted for about 15 haircuts before falling apart. This thing is amazing so far. It cuts very well and cleanly. The attachments are easy to change out. The blades have a tendency to slide off with the attachments but this is a side effect of the ease of breaking down and cleaning(no screws to remove!). Powerful! Buy this one with confidence!</li>
    <li> Does a great job with hair.  Quiet.  Have used bi-weekly for about a year for guy haircut trims.  Does the job.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are a great set of clippers. They cut right through the hair without snagging or catching on it. They give a very nice close cut and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly the kind of person who needs a haircut kit. I shave my head on a weekly basis, and have only bought clippers from Wahl in the past. My problem with their products is that the clippers tend to die within a year or two and I need to get them replaced regularly. I was excited when the Vine program offered an &#x27;indestructible&#x27; set from Remington, and they arrived right when I needed to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three swipes in the same area, I knew this thing wasn&#x27;t going to get the job done. Again, I know this is a product that&#x27;s aimed more at people who cut and style their hair, which I&#x27;ll get to in a second, but for straight up shaving, it&#x27;s terrible. The shaved hair stays on the blade and you have to keep picking it off, and it lacks the power of the Wahl Chrome clippers and I had to press over the same shaved area an additional two times to get it down to -about- what the Wahl would do. The thinner blades on this thing doesn&#x27;t help either, I&#x27;m sure. I was so disappointed that not even 5 minutes into the shave, I gave up and went back to my old Wahl, which desperately needs to be thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, anyone wanting to cut their hair will get a decent deal here. You get eight different comb guides ranging from 1/8\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s a pretty small and quiet shaver. As others have mentioned, the power cord is longer than usual by about three feet. The presentation of the package is nice, coming in a pretty large military-esque case, and they really sell the &#x27;indestructible&#x27; thing to you on it. I just doubt how strong the clippers are given the thin blades, and the fact that the warranty doesn&#x27;t cover incidents like dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for basic hair cutting, the clippers will do the job when used with the other tools in the kit. I did a friend of mine&#x27;s hair and things worked out ok. Anyone who cuts their own hair shouldn&#x27;t have any problems using the kit. On the plus side, the clippers ARE good when it comes to shaving my arms and legs! Granted, I still have to brush the hair off the blades every time, though the smaller size makes it easier to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around and you&#x27;ll find a better deal, and something stronger. I&#x27;m not trying to praise Wahl or anything when I keep comparing their [[ASIN:B0026IBSVE Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit]], but it hasn&#x27;t let me down.Granted, I still have to brush the hair off the blades every time, though the smaller size makes it easier to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around and you&#x27;ll find a better deal, and something stronger.

    <li> This barber shop grade trimmer is seemingly very well made.  It rests comfortably in your hand, humms along quietly and smoothly, and is stable in use.  There are numerous attachments that are all plastic, they fit reasonably well and none have yet broken in being removed.  The cord is fairly long, certainly plenty long for use in a normal bathroom (if not in an actual barbar shop).  My previous trimmer seemed much flimsier than this; the Remington is built solid and it feels as though I will derive many years of regular and flexible use from the product.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I&#x27;ve saved a lot of haircut money ever since I got it.</li>
    <li> We use the shaver/razor for home use.  I was delighted and surprised at how quiet it was and how quickly and evenly it cut.  It also has an extra long cord.  Great for when we want to do a haircut on little boys outdoors.</li>
    <li> I received the Virtually Indestructible 15 pc Barbershop Kit for my husband to review. My husband said this set is great and that he likes that the cord for the razor is so long; it makes it more convenient when you&#x27;re in a room and need to stretch the cord to reach the chair where our son was sitting down, so that he could buzz his hair. The value of this 15 pc kit is $39.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so awesome about this particular barbershop kit?&lt;br /&gt;- Power Cut Blade system for an ultra smooth and even cut everytime!&lt;br /&gt;- 15 pc set includes: 8 guide combs, barber scissors, cleaning brush, oil bottle, barber cape, blade guard, and durable storage case&lt;br /&gt;- Precision ground blades can cut through all hair types&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy duty rubber grip&lt;br /&gt;- Lifetime warranty&lt;br /&gt;- 10 foot industrial power cord</li>
    <li> Good little razor. It fits nicely in my hand but it does heat up quite rapidly.</li>
    <li> This is for certain a quality product for the price tag. You get a nice amount of attachments in a cool looking package. The only drawback I have had is after a while the blade heats up and I tend to run it under cold water to cool it down. I like the waterproof material and this set has a very long plug which is great for cutting hair anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cheap Wahl clippers and they all had this nasty thing where they would lock up if I held them in a position they did not like. No such thing with this, it works perfectly regardless of how I hold it and move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks very nice and non-cheap. The body is made of a material that is easy to grip. The small(er) size makes it easy to hold and maneuver compared to a Wahl.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Quiet, clean cut every time. Better cut than I ever got with my Wahls.</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper set.  The form factor, easy cleaning, and the case are all good. But it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well when using the guards. Leaves lots of stragglers. I find myself having to make 2-4 passes sometimes to get an even cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 9 years now.  I&#x27;ve always used Wahl&#x27;s comparable clippers, which last about a year before they need to be replaced.  I decided to go with this one for a change, and wow.  Remmington&#x27;s claim of 2x performance seemed true.  I cut my hair quicker and more even than the Wahl&#x27;s did.  Amazing clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Great quality. Use it to have a baldness with a very little hair</li>
    <li> I have always clipped my hubby&#x27;s hair, so when the opportunity arrived to review this set of clippers, I was thrilled. Our previous set was outdated and completely worn out. The buzzing and humming, and the vibrating would drive you crazy by the time you got someone&#x27;s hair trimmed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are awesome! Minimal buzzing and vibrations make this a favorite! And I can only imagine how nice that would be if you were cutting a small child&#x27;s hair! A lot less scary for a child, I am sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent job of clipping with these means fewer mistakes, and a smoother and quicker cut! Love, love, love that with our busy and hectic schedules!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these clippers a big five stars and my thumbs up! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****DISCLOSURE: These clippers were provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.</li>
    <li> Best hair clippers for the price. Work great and fast with no cuts or scrapes. Love the easy clean up as well.</li>
    <li> I almost bought this at Wally World but it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on Prime. It&#x27;s super quiet and cuts like a mofo. I&#x27;ve had nothing but problems with other brand rechargeable units that won&#x27;t hold a charge after awhile. Done with that, sticking with the corded models.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product - and in a sector of products that have traditionally been noted by their poor construction and quality, the only question is &#x27;Why?&#x27;  They probably don&#x27;t need to be this good, but, Hey, why even question it - Just buy these and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my old review (10/13/16) - I bought this set last year and was happy with it right out of the box - the more I use it, the more I like it!  However, recently I started to let my facial hair grow - I&#x27;m not talking about growing a beard, but only keeping my facial hair looking like a 4-5 day growth - and now I&#x27;m super-happy with this baby.  I&#x27;m  using the # 1 guide to keep it looking like &#x27;stubble&#x27; and this is very easy for me to use on myself, which is not true of using the clipper for a haircut (my wife does that for me - I&#x27;d never try to do that on myself).  The more I use it, the more I like it - and if it outlives me, and it probably will, so much the better - than someone else will get to see how good it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for years. I&#x27;m not a professional, but my ex-laws were hairdressers and I learned a lot from them. I&#x27;ve purchased a number of lower-end trimmers and haven&#x27;t been very pleased with them. Then, I got a Wahl clipper for the dogs, and the quality was amazing. So when I saw this compared favorably to Wahl, I decided to give it a shot, and I&#x27;m very happy I did. This clips like a clipper should!  It comes with a lot of different hair-length accessories, scissors, cleaners, etc., even a protective cape, and is packed together nicely, though it&#x27;s a little awkward to get it all in the case. You do need to work with it plugged in, it&#x27;s not wireless, but my experience has been that the wireless ones are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. (Even the excellent Wahl dog clipper is wireless but I use it plugged in as it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.) All in all, I can highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit is perfect for anyone to use. I am an African American woman and I cut the back of my hair off every week, but now I can save time and money and I do it myself perfectly. The clipper guards are numbered and I remembered my barber saying he was giving me a number one and I found that number guard got in the bathroom mirror and got busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with these Remington Clippers because they are light and easy to maneuver. The Remington Indestructible Haircut Kit comes in a case that has all the tools you need from shears, to a cap, and even a cleaning kit so that you can keep your clippers in pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington&#x27;s are easy to clean and the included case makes them even easier to store. I love these clippers and you will too.</li>
    <li> I really like this Remington HC 5850 Haircut Kit. I love the heavy 10 foot cord, it gives you more freedom to move around, especially when I&#x27;m cutting my 3 yr. old grandson&#x27;s hair. I also love how quiet it runs, because there are times when he will give me a hard time with my older clippers, and I know it&#x27;s because they are loud. These run very quiet, and doesn&#x27;t scare him as much. The quality of these clippers are good as well. The clippers are pretty light, so my wrist doesn&#x27;t get tired as fast either. It comes in a very sturdy case, so you can take these anywhere that has an electric outlet. The fact that these have a lifetime warranty is a plus. I would highly recommend this hair cutting kit.</li>
    <li> I can only guess this product is called \\&quot;indestructible\\&quot; because it&#x27;s being targeted towards \\&quot;real men\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve had an electric clipper I&#x27;ve been using to shave my head for several years and It&#x27;s holding up very well. I&#x27;m not sure I need an \\&quot;indestructible\\&quot; clipper.  In spite of the silly name, this kit is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t mention the brand name of the clipper I have, but it&#x27;s a good brand name and a great clipper.  I decided to compare this one to the one I currently use. First, the kit is a really complete kit with a carrying case, scissors (not so great quality though) for trimming), multiple shields to get different length cuts and even a cape.  All in a nice carrying case to keep your kit organized in the bottom of your bathroom cabinet.  The clipper feels good in your hand, not too heavy, not too light.  It has a rubberized feel to it which is great for grip. Since I wear my hair pretty much shaved and I cut it pretty often, I get a lot of very short hairs flying around. They tend to stick to the rubberized grip.  Not a big deal, but an unforeseen drawback to that tacky surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade itself is fixed in position.  My other clipper adjusts from short to super-short.  I like that for trimming my beard.  The problem though is tends to shift while you are cutting.  I think I actually like the fixed blade of this one better. Also this one easily detaches for cleaning- I like that. It doesn&#x27;t cut quite as short as my other one (which advertised super short cutting as one of its features), but I think it cuts close enough for most people&#x27;s purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really good clipper and pretty much everything you&#x27;ll need to do your own haircuts at home. I have saved a lot of money since I started cutting my own hair. This is a great investment.</li>
    <li> While I question the lame marketing term \\&quot;Virtually Indestructible\\&quot; (is that like almost pregnant?), these are well made and feel solid. Lots of decent attachments and a quiet motor make for a very useful kit, and though they get warmer than the Wahls they are still not too hot to hold at all. Plus, that heat will make the blades hotter and with a little oil that means a smoother cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than 40 bucks, and assuming these last at least 3-5 years, which they should, then you&#x27;re getting about 50 haircuts minimum from these, more like 100-500 is my guess. The cheapest cut at any barber is about 10, even with a 6 buck cut (at that price you&#x27;d better tip at least 3 bucks!), so these will save you ten times their purchase price, easily. Maybe 100 times! And that means they offer very good value indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither far better nor worse than the Wahls, they are very comparable, and I&#x27;d be happy with either unit at under 50. These are recommended, along with their chief competitor.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair and that of family since 1987 .&lt;br /&gt;These clippers feel solid and don&#x27;t catch hair like some of the others I have found elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;The only feature that is missing that I like is the side adjustment .  This is clearly not needed and thinking about it probably causes more problems in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;My typical complaint with all clippers are the plastic attachments. The attachments fit well but I know over time the clippers will outlast the attachments.</li>
    <li> This may be a great clipper (I wouldn&#x27;t know), but it is not great for International customers. It ships to Singapore, but when I tried using it in Singapore the first time I heard two loud pops, the clipper stopped running, and I smelled burning hair. On inspection it seems this is meant for 120V outlets, but this was not in the listing, and it&#x27;s not in the documentation. Unless my unit was defective, this is not a safe failure mode for this product, and if it can&#x27;t handle being plugged into a 240V outlet that should be clearly and prominently featured in the Amazon listing and the documented warnings.</li>
    <li> It is still clipping great 2 years on.</li>
    <li> I have only owned a cheap OLD electric hair trimmer, it weighed as much as a brick.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this is at least lighter in weight, I have small hands, I wish it&lt;br /&gt;was a LITTLE smaller, but I know there has to be housing for the motor. There&#x27;s a lot of gadgets and a box to house them that I had a hard time (arthritic hands) opening, it was a bit of a challenge for my fingers. Plus it comes with a little cloth trim cape. It trimmed my husbands neckline ok, but not so sure it would do a great job at really giving him an all over haircut, so can&#x27;t make a statement to that, but for just the neckline, over the ears, it worked fine.</li>
    <li> This Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit is a work of art. The trimmer (which runs QUIETLY!!) comes in a nice, hard plastic case, with all the accessories your hair could desire, plus a blade guard, a nice pair of haircutting shears, an oiler and a good-sized cleaning brush. The enclosed apron is a GREAT thoughtful and welcomed addition to this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enclosed \\&quot;Use and Care Guide\\&quot; is comprehensive and very helpful. I wish they had enclosed a haircutting link on the Remington Site, but as it is, there are already plenty of helpful videos on You Tube, which I will look at to make sure I can cut my hair as well as the sweet Peruvian lady who cuts mine every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see myself getting a good deal of use out of this Haircut kit. The trimmer by itself is smooth and kind to skin - not a single hair rudely yanked out by an errant/burred trimmer blade, whether trimming neck hairs or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this -- no other trimmer I have seen at a price I can afford can offer me all these accessories and an apron and carrying case as well!! Time will tell if the hinges of the carrying case will last for the life of the contents. A small hurdle that can easily be remedied IF this should actually happen in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS a product I am happy to use!!!</li>
    <li> I had never cut my own hair before, but it was something that I had been considering for some time.  The costs of professional haircuts seems outrageous to me, given that what I want is easily achieved with a good set of clippers.  As my hair thins out, I&#x27;ve come to understand that a very short, even haircut looks the best on me, so the opportunity to try these clippers was welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used these, I was in desparate need of a hair cut, so I had my wife do the cut, using the number 8 guide.  Even though my wife had no experience cutting hair, in a matter of minutes, I had the nice even, short hair I wanted.  She finished it off by evening up the back and shaving my neck with the clippers.  I&#x27;ve followed up with weekly trims to maintain the length, and am pleased with the results.  Works great for what I need, which is really all I can ask for.</li>
    <li> These replaced my run-of-the-mill Wahls.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure of the model, but it&#x27;s the &#x27;standard&#x27; $30-40 set you can pick up from Wal-Mart.  I will use these as the benchmark for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERGONOMICS / DESIGN&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one to cut my own hair, so the curved handle was a huge upgrade.  They fit better in my hand and the rubberized grip seemed to offer more control during the hair cut.  These do NOT have the little lever that allows fine clipper adjustment, but I&#x27;m alright with that.  Indeed, I actually like it better since I have a habit of bumping it when cutting my hair.  Likewise, these are much, much quieter than my Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR CUTTING ABILITY&lt;br /&gt;Pretty on par with what you&#x27;d expect from a clipper in this range.  The blades aren&#x27;t overly thick (as one would expect from &#x27;indestructible&#x27; clippers), but they did a pretty good job.  I did notice the &#x27;striping&#x27; you sometimes see in cheaper clippers on my first pass, but it was easy to clean up.  This is the reason for the one-star deduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INDESTRUCTIBLENESS&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest.  I didn&#x27;t really try it out.  That said, I don&#x27;t really buy into these clippers being truly indestructible; the heft and build quality simply aren&#x27;t there.  I wouldn&#x27;t go out building a &#x27;haircut suit&#x27; to hug bears and hope they second as armor or anything, but light-to-moderate home use should have these clippers lasting for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;I really like them.  They seem to fit better in my hands, and the noise reduction is a definite improvement over my Wahls.  For the price, they are an excellent buy and would recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.</li>
