      <li>This product is definitely great for acne prone skin and aids in the evening of skin tone.</li>
      <li>B3 is suppose to be really good for skin.</li>
      <li>I read how B3 powder is good for cystic acne and it evens the skin out as well</li>
      <li>However, had many comments about my skin looking brighter, so results I suppose!</li>
      <li>the shipping was excellent and the product was exactly the way described..</li>

      <li>I had great experience using certain OTC face creams.</li>
      <li>I love products from MakingCosmetics.  </li>
      <li>Need better instructions.</li>
      <li>you:-)</li>
      <li>You should be able to close your fingers around it.</li>
      <li>How many parts per powder to cream do u incorporate together</li>
      <li>It has too many additive, and I had to dump it.</li>
      <li>With vitiligo, your auto-immune system attacks and destroys the pigment in parts of your skin, so I had very significant discoloration.</li>
      <li>I make my own Vit C serum and the MakingCosmetics brand of C dissolves quickly and easily in the distilled water.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Dr. Jonathan Wright and listen to his greenmedicineonline radio show every Saturday.</li>
      <li>Perhaps my skin needs to have more visible lines for this to be useful.</li>
      <li>but so far it is doing a good job of keeping my skin looking somewhat healthier ...</li>
      <li>did more research and found that niacinamide is an ingredient in many of the best selling expensive anti-aging creams and also in acne treatments.</li>
      <li>They have a lot of good information about various ingredients and what they do for skin and what ingredients are included in what products.</li>
      <li>I will buy more of this in the future for sure.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>But - Beware, if you start making your own cosmetics it can be addictive!</li>
      <li>and as I use the cream, I add a little more powder, just to make sure product(s) stay fresh.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, I mixed it in my facial cream and use it  morning and night.  </li>
      <li>The first night I did this</li>
      <li>I suffer with arthritis in my hands and figured I would give it a try and, sure enough, my pain was gone in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I am going to continue this for as long as I think it is doing better and see how it does.  </li>
      <li>I am excited to use this product to make my own skincare products that are natural and without harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>This is sold by \\&quot;Making Cosmetics, Inc.\\&quot; and I highly recommend their website for anyone interested in the science of cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I woke up to much smoother looking skin.  </li>
      <li>I use hylauronic acid moisture cream which is compatible with niacinamide powder, but there is no instructions on how much to use,so i&#x27;m guessing.  </li>
      <li>Which, for me is an absolute miracle as I have had vitiligo for 20+ years.</li>
      <li>I have since started making my own foundation as I had trouble matching my skin color.</li>
      <li>I will continue to order more in the near future.</li>
      <li>dissolve a pinch of this powder with witch hazel or a hydrosol (like rose water) on a cotton round.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It can be layered by putting your acids on first: just apply everything in a well-saturated way, so it&#x27;s completely absorbed before you put the next layer on.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels better, and oddly, I have noticed that my joint pain in my hands has lessened.</li>
      <li>It seems to be working and gives a little more power to the cream I already use.</li>
      <li>The others don&#x27;t dissolve anywhere near as much as this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, I did not get the connection with the niacinamide but Dr. Wright said that topical niacinamide has been shown to fade age spots, so I figured that had to be the reason my skin had started to look so much</li>
      <li>I could use a little more help in caring for my mature skin</li>
      <li>Use a SMALL amount to test on your skin to make sure you are not allergic.</li>
      <li>I have very young skin, with only minor fine lines, but I have yet to see an improvement.</li>
      <li>So, I did some more research and decided to just buy this stuff and add it to my own less expensive lotion.</li>
      <li>so I add just a little of this powder to the top part of cream (when it&#x27;s in a jar, obviously!)</li>
      <li>It clearly does work</li>
      <li>But something else happened that surprised me, my skin tone evened out.</li>
      <li>Hey the product came really early....</li>
      <li>Water alone won&#x27;t break it down quickly.</li>
      <li>and I can tell the difference in texture, decrease I how frequent and how extensive acne breakouts are and improvement with old acne scars</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it directly so can&#x27;t comment on any other formulation, but always get your ph and preservatives right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE be aware that you cannot mix this with vitamin C or any other acid- including tretinoin, retin</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re buying more than one ingredient, the individual shipping costs for this company&#x27;s products is ridiculous.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t the vendors fault, niacinamide apparently doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m on my 2nd batch</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use a SMALL amount to test on your skin to make sure you are not allergic. I had an allergic reaction from putting this stuff on my skin. Be careful. This wasn&#x27;t the vendors fault, niacinamide apparently doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> I am excited to use this product to make my own skincare products that are natural and without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I read how B3 powder is good for cystic acne and it evens the skin out as well so I decided to give it a shot.  I prefer to buy the actual ingredient rather than finding products which contains what I want.  In the end it&#x27;s cheaper and I know what&#x27;s going on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the B3 powder with some water and spray it on my face daily.  The first night I did this I woke up to much smoother looking skin.  Love it!  Since then I haven&#x27;t had a single cystic pimple on my chin.  I&#x27;m getting them on the rest of my body so now I&#x27;m trying to find a way to spray my body with this stuff.</li>
    <li> How many parts per powder to cream do u incorporate together .the directions were never included thankyou. I would appreciate directions &#x27;re vitamin b3 powder</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make a face moisturizer. B3 is suppose to be really good for skin. I make small batches that last 1 to 2 week because I don&#x27;t use preservatives. So far I&#x27;m on my 2nd batch and I can tell the difference in texture, decrease I how frequent and how extensive acne breakouts are and improvement with old acne scars</li>
    <li> Hey the product came really early.... the shipping was excellent and the product was exactly the way described..&lt;br /&gt;I used once in week in the face pack works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;thank you:-)</li>
    <li> They send this to you in power form with no way of telling you how to mix it, use it or anything at all. The phone number on the jar is wrong.  I had to look up there website to get there phone number. What a rip off. I called and the woman told me to use 1/6...... on what, cream, water how the hell do you get it on your skin. I guess I will make up my own recipe . I guess you have to be a chemist to use their product.</li>
    <li> Why I can not mix Vitamin C or Abscorbic Acid with B3? ( Niacinamine?) I have done that do you think it was damaging for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then on the other hand they say to not mix Vitamin C with copper elements but we apply Vitamin C under the suncream that the suncream it contains Copper anyhow.</li>
    <li> I added a little of this product to my regular moisturizing cream for my face.  It has not been 3 weeks yet but so far it is doing a good job of keeping my skin looking somewhat healthier ... lines seem less visible. I am going to continue this for as long as I think it is doing better and see how it does.  I would recommend this product to the ladies!</li>
    <li> Use B3 powder along with k.a. in a D-I-Y skincare lotion recipe.  This product is definitely great for acne prone skin and aids in the evening of skin tone.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out.....</li>
    <li> did not get directions on how to mix and make a cream. need formula. have not used powder yet. help</li>
    <li> I mixed it into a moisture cream and have used it over a month on my legs and have not noticed any improvement in fading brown spots.</li>
    <li> I love products from MakingCosmetics.  They have the BEST Vit C/Ascorbic Acid powder of any that I&#x27;ve tried.  I make my own Vit C serum and the MakingCosmetics brand of C dissolves quickly and easily in the distilled water.  The others don&#x27;t dissolve anywhere near as much as this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And RE: their Vit B3 powder (which is Niacinamide - an ingredient in higher-end and/or anti-aging skin care products) it&#x27;s excellent.  I even add a little bit to my Vit C serum before I add the veggie glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure I could use a little more help in caring for my mature skin so I add just a little of this powder to the top part of cream (when it&#x27;s in a jar, obviously!) and as I use the cream, I add a little more powder, just to make sure product(s) stay fresh.  I recommend this Vit B3 for skin care!</li>
    <li> I use hylauronic acid moisture cream which is compatible with niacinamide powder, but there is no instructions on how much to use,so i&#x27;m guessing.  Need better instructions.</li>
    <li> It has too many additive, and I had to dump it.I ended up using some B3 tablets that I ground myself.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Not sure if working as too early to tell.  However, had many comments about my skin looking brighter, so results I suppose!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying more than one ingredient, the individual shipping costs for this company&#x27;s products is ridiculous. Just go to their website! Lots of great stuff there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE be aware that you cannot mix this with vitamin C or any other acid- including tretinoin, retin a, AHA/BHAs , etc. It will form damaging nicotinic acid. You can use this product (B3) at the same time as B5 or other neutral to high ph (base) ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be layered by putting your acids on first: just apply everything in a well-saturated way, so it&#x27;s completely absorbed before you put the next layer on. Spritzing your face with mineral water or a hydrosol between applications will increase absorption of both layers while neutralizing the skin&#x27;s ph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then dissolve a pinch of this powder with witch hazel or a hydrosol (like rose water) on a cotton round. Water alone won&#x27;t break it down quickly. I&#x27;ve only used it directly so can&#x27;t comment on any other formulation, but always get your ph and preservatives right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 weeks now daily, mixed into my moisturizer. I have very young skin, with only minor fine lines, but I have yet to see an improvement. I will still use this product, as it hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse reactions but it isn&#x27;t the miracle that Dr. Oz has claimed it is! Perhaps my skin needs to have more visible lines for this to be useful.</li>
    <li> I had great experience using certain OTC face creams. They evened out my skin tone, and helped my super-dry skin. But they were rather pricey. I scanned all the ingredients and spent some time researching them, I found that Niacinamide was the one in common with all the creams that worked. So, I did some more research and decided to just buy this stuff and add it to my own less expensive lotion. I put it in my face lotion and body lotion. My skin looks and feels better, and oddly, I have noticed that my joint pain in my hands has lessened. My doctor told me Vit. B can help with that! I will buy more of this in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on Dr. Oz about how this can clear up dark spots on your skin.  It clearly does work but you have to be diligent about it and be patient.  I will continue to order more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I mixed it in my facial cream and use it  morning and night.  Many people say how wonderful my skin looks for a 73 year old.</li>
    <li> This product does contain the niacinamide powder but its much much much smaller than it appears in the picture.You should be able to close your fingers around it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Dr. Jonathan Wright and listen to his greenmedicineonline radio show every Saturday. On one of his shows, he said taking niacinamide supplements (3,000 mg/day) could reduce arthritis pain in about 3 weeks. I suffer with arthritis in my hands and figured I would give it a try and, sure enough, my pain was gone in 2 weeks. But something else happened that surprised me, my skin tone evened out. Which, for me is an absolute miracle as I have had vitiligo for 20+ years. With vitiligo, your auto-immune system attacks and destroys the pigment in parts of your skin, so I had very significant discoloration. At first, I did not get the connection with the niacinamide but Dr. Wright said that topical niacinamide has been shown to fade age spots, so I figured that had to be the reason my skin had started to look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did more research and found that niacinamide is an ingredient in many of the best selling expensive anti-aging creams and also in acne treatments. But since I am on a budget and don&#x27;t want to buy expensive anti-aging creams, I decided to buy some powder to add to the skin cream I normally use. It seems to be working and gives a little more power to the cream I already use. This is sold by \\&quot;Making Cosmetics, Inc.\\&quot; and I highly recommend their website for anyone interested in the science of cosmetics. They have a lot of good information about various ingredients and what they do for skin and what ingredients are included in what products. They also have formulas for making cosmetics. I have since started making my own foundation as I had trouble matching my skin color. But - Beware, if you start making your own cosmetics it can be addictive!</li>
