      <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>

      <li>but they will be good for quick touch ups of things around the house too.</li>
      <li>I love using these to put on my face cream.</li>
      <li>I will buy again when I  need more.</li>
      <li>Even though they are plastic they can easily be used more than one time.</li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re reusable and easily washed (which I do recommend to avoid bacteria build up).</li>
      <li>but they will do fine for what I need.</li>
      <li>These are great to have on hand to scoop out moisturizers or custom mix a makeup shade with foundations of different hues.</li>
      <li>These are perfect little scoopers and now I have a life supply!</li>
      <li>Perfect for reaching into small jars/bottles.  </li>
      <li>I make my own masks, the latest being organic manuka honey and essential oils.  </li>

      <li>Nothing special about these</li>
      <li>These are perfect for my businesses (Jamberry and Younique) because I put samples in little clear plastic cosmetic containers</li>
      <li>The heads are a little smaller than the ones I own already, but they are great.</li>
      <li>They would also be handy for scraping that last bit of lipstick, gloss, or cream from its container.</li>
      <li>I also order them with some type of clear plastic jar (you can find many on amazon).  </li>
      <li>I use these to get the right amount of cream to use on my face.</li>
      <li>Came super fast grear for my kit woth mixing foundations and concealers and depotting lipsticks</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>it was difficult to get product for my hair out of the jar - these were perfect and inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>pretend cooking adventures ;-)</li>
      <li>Not as convenient as silicon spatula, but in general it&#x27;s fine product</li>
      <li>Sometimes I will clean with a little rubbing alcohol and reuse more than once too.</li>
      <li>These little spatulas are handy to have around.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Also my kids love to play with them with their Barbies and other</li>
      <li>Instead of contaminating my face cream jar with my fingers (it&#x27;s my own little theory), I use these!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to have disposable stir sticks for small batches of creams I make.</li>
      <li>Work good for make up, creams, and getting last little bit out of jar.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Though smaller than I expected, they will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Using for resin casting.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived safely.</li>
      <li>I love these little spatulas because I&#x27;m always mixing oils into creams and foundations and otherwise tinkering with my cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>The FULL LENGTH measures 2 1/2 inches long.</li>
      <li>and I want my customers and potentials to be able to get every drop out of the container and not get their hands all messy!</li>
      <li>but these little buggers get lost so easily in my bathroom (also my cat loves to knock stuff to the floor).  </li>
      <li>My daughter is budding makeup artist</li>
      <li>Great little spatula for getting the last little bit of cosmetic product out of the bottle!  </li>
      <li>I needed what the stores use, little tiny spatulas, so I went to what now is becoming my go-to place, Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Buying such a large pack was possibly overkill, but the price is right and we can use them for other things.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>They are strong and don&#x27;t have any rough or sharp edges.</li>
      <li>Something so small yet so useful.</li>

<li> Little shorter than I wanted</li>

<li> Hard plastic.</li>
<li> Have a hard time finding these makeup spatulas, but now I have 25.  </li>
<li> A few of the spatulas were dirty and not sure why.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> Very handy devices and I use them all the time, traveling or at home.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great to have on hand to scoop out moisturizers or custom mix a makeup shade with foundations of different hues. Good value for the price! Sturdy and good length.</li>
    <li> perfect for testing products and making product samples.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sampling lotions at my product parties... so ppl didnt use their fingers in products</li>
    <li> Perfect for reaching into small jars/bottles.  Saves my nails.</li>
    <li> What can you say about these?  Plastic spatula!  Work good for make up, creams, and getting last little bit out of jar.  Keeps cream from getting under fingernails</li>
    <li> I love these little spatulas because I&#x27;m always mixing oils into creams and foundations and otherwise tinkering with my cosmetics.  They are perfect for that.  I also order them with some type of clear plastic jar (you can find many on amazon).  They always arrive on time and in good shape.

    <li> Great little spatula for getting the last little bit of cosmetic product out of the bottle!  Great seller ... will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Because I wear acrylic nails it was difficult to get product for my hair out of the jar - these were perfect and inexpensive.  Even though they are plastic they can easily be used more than one time.</li>
    <li> Came super fast grear for my kit woth mixing foundations and concealers and depotting lipsticks</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! Items are just add described, arrived on time, and well packed. I will buy again when I  need more.</li>

    <li> My daughter is budding makeup artist so these were the perfect gift.  I bunched with a few other things! Great</li>
    <li> Good value.  They are strong and don&#x27;t have any rough or sharp edges.</li>
    <li> The spatulas work well but are much smaller than I anticipated. I would have preferred a larger spatula, but these do the job.</li>
    <li> Too short, did not fit in my make up bottle. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I will order again soon!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about these but I&#x27;m so happy to find these so affordably priced.  You should never put your fingers in jars of skin creams (bacteria) but these little buggers get lost so easily in my bathroom (also my cat loves to knock stuff to the floor).  I also like to work with essential oils, so it&#x27;s nice to have disposable stir sticks for small batches of creams I make.</li>
    <li> I bought these to aid in applying my homemade EO creams and rubs and they fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed. Spatula smaller than expected and plastic is a bit weak but not so weak for use with creams. The FULL LENGTH measures 2 1/2 inches long. The SPATULA itself is 5/8 inch long; 1/4 inch wide at the tip and 1/2 inch wide at the bottom.  Purpose for purchase was to use for scooping face cream and the like out of jars. I suppose I will get used to the small size but would have preferred a little larger size. Vendor shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Not so good quality. Super thin</li>
    <li> excellent product. will buy again</li>
    <li> This was an excellent deal.  Have a hard time finding these makeup spatulas, but now I have 25.  The heads are a little smaller than the ones I own already, but they are great.</li>
    <li> I love using these to put on my face cream. Instead of contaminating my face cream jar with my fingers (it&#x27;s my own little theory), I use these!</li>
    <li> My mom used to use these with her \\&quot;Jafra\\&quot; cream when I was a little girl.  I was looking for something to use with my Origins night cream without getting my fingers in the lotion jar.  These are perfect little scoopers and now I have a life supply!</li>
    <li> Not as convenient as silicon spatula, but in general it&#x27;s fine product</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using them to scoop out moisturizer that comes in jar or tub packaging.  They can be reused a few times, just wash them with soap or wipe with alcohol.  Very handy tool with lots of spares for a great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to avoid getting all of my beauty products under my fingernails!</li>
    <li> Great and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Little shorter than I wanted but they will do fine for what I need.</li>
    <li> Loved giving these to customers with samples instead of popsicle sticks to try their sample packs.</li>
    <li> As I have long fingernails, getting face and body cream out of jars was a mess.  I needed what the stores use, little tiny spatulas, so I went to what now is becoming my go-to place, Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> so nice for testing my products!</li>

Also my kids love to play with them with their Barbies and other pretend cooking adventures ;-)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Though smaller than I expected, they will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Using for resin casting.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived safely. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> These are very handy for cosmetic use. Any time I am using a product out of a jar I like to reach for one of these. Helps keep germs out. Sometimes I will clean with a little rubbing alcohol and reuse more than once too.</li>
    <li> Wish it were a half inch longer for the use of digging a big jar of Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful spatulas.  Perfect for what I needed.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> A little shorter then what I have purchased before, but they will serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for scooping body butters. Hard plastic.</li>
    <li> Something so small yet so useful. These are good.</li>
    <li> These spatulas are very handy. I use them to scoop out hand lotion from a jar. Using them prevents cross contamination and keeps the lotion/cream&lt;br /&gt;free of bacteria.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and purposeful.</li>
    <li> These have been great to get lotion out of a jar without contaminating the lotion in the jar.</li>
    <li> A little small but works</li>
    <li> These little spatulas are handy to have around.  Buying such a large pack was possibly overkill, but the price is right and we can use them for other things.  I already like them for taking out portions of homemade body butter, shave cream, etc. but they will be good for quick touch ups of things around the house too.</li>
    <li> I make my own masks, the latest being organic manuka honey and essential oils.  These are perfect for scooping the manuka honey from the jar, for stirring the mask ingredients together, and then after refrigerating the mask, for scooping it out to use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> A few of the spatulas were dirty and not sure why. Still love the purchase though and the delivery was super fast!</li>
    <li> These will work perfect on my display tables for my lotion testers!</li>
    <li> works great for lots of things, not just makeup</li>
    <li> Amazing. I use these to get the right amount of cream to use on my face. Perfect. I include them with creams I make to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought these to keep on hand rather than using my fingers or hands in creams, make-ups, etc and they work perfectly! They&#x27;re plastic so they&#x27;re reusable and easily washed (which I do recommend to avoid bacteria build up). Will definitely repurchase when the time comes. Love these!</li>
    <li> Thank you. Just what I wanted. Shipped fast. 75 for them for $8.99 is a great deal so it worth it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> It is great for the price!</li>
