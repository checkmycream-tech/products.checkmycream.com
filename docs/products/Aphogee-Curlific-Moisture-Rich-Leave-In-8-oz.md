<li> So far I recommend for moms with curly hair kids who are extremely tender headed that gives not only the child, but moms (dads too) a break!</li>
<li> I say this long to actually give products a chance.</li>
<li> My hair is very coarse and usually very dry because I have low porosity kinky hair.</li>
<li> It felt moisturized after the conditioning in the shower left it lackluster and dry.</li>
<li> Unlike others, this doesn&#x27;t dry or my hair, it does just what it says.</li>

<li> After researching and found this product, I could use a wide tooth comb and de tangle her hair.</li>

<li> It has a slight lemony fragrance that is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> spritzed my hair with a little water and this product.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few months now</li>
<li> It is hard to find a leave in that does not leave my hair feeling like I sprayed hairspray on it.</li>
<li> I know some people complained about the smell, I like it.  </li>
<li> I guess I never noticed this product working before because I wasn&#x27;t using a conditioner that left my hair in bad condition.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I cut my locs 2 years ago and became a product junkie. My hair was not growing(4a). It was also breaking. I tried Shea Moisture that everyone raved about however it irritated my scalp and caused breakage. Something in the ingredients that my hair did not like.&lt;br /&gt;The only staple product that stay consistent was Jane Carter Nourish and Shine. Now I can say that Apogee Curlific is my product I love it and also the shampoo. It is very moisturizing. This product has a lot of slip. I also use the Curlific conditioner and love it also a staple product.&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe it took me two years to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper at Sally&#x27;s supply store.</li>
    <li> This product works so well for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a leave in that does not leave my hair feeling like I sprayed hairspray on it. This leaves my hair feeling moisturized and I continue on with my two strand twist regimen.</li>
    <li> Great but not amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I&#x27;m very satisfied. Unlike others, this doesn&#x27;t dry or my hair, it does just what it says. Try it directly on new growths for persons trying to stretch out your relaxer.</li>
    <li> Really great leave conditioner and luv the smell</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The smell😍</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best that I have tried for my curly, resistant hair. It detangles it very well and it makes it super soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry, coarse, and kinky hair that has trouble retaining moisture.  I bought this from a beauty supply store went home spritzed my hair with a little water and this product.  It makes your hair feel soft and tangle free so you can comb it with a nice wide tooth comb.  I am on day two and my hair is still soft and feels moisturized.  It does nothing for curl patterns, if you looking for a curl enhancer try Hawaiian Silky All in One Conditioner.  I know some people complained about the smell, I like it.  It smells like any other hair product you would use.  It has a slight lemony fragrance that is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ApHogee makes great products with its protein reconstructor, this looks like another item that they can add to their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to buy more while it is still on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alma</li>
    <li> Familiar with this product. I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture.leave my hair soft (does not help with shrinkage).</li>
    <li> For many people a good leave in conditioner is a dime a dozen. For my 4c natural hair, however, I was on the brink of giving up after 5 years of being natural. Leave-in- conditioners just left my hair more tangled and difficult to manage. But ApHogee made me want to pHone a friend! It is so good! My hair is very coarse and usually very dry because I have low porosity kinky hair. This stuff is magic in a bottle. I sprayed it in my hair and thought I had 2A hair for a second. I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer and detangler that makes my 3C curls pop!  It leaves my hair super soft and shiny.  I think it smells great as well, without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Ok Im coming back to edit this after initially giving it a poor review. I hadn&#x27;t noticed anything special about this product initially. This week I decided to detangle my hair outside of the shower. I noticed my hair felt dry (thank you shea moisture restorative conditioner, this shea moisture line never works for me when will I learn? ) So I sprayed this on my hair before detangling it and my hair felt instantly different. It felt moisturized after the conditioning in the shower left it lackluster and dry. My hair had shine, slip, and was easy to detangle. I guess I never noticed this product working before because I wasn&#x27;t using a conditioner that left my hair in bad condition.  I like this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and I have finally found in a leave in what I have been serachinf for in 2yrs. It has a slip like no other and keeps my hair moisturize for days!!!! Love this and is now a staple on my 3c/4a curls</li>
    <li> product just sat upon my hair. kinda disappointed, I wanted to love this product</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works divinely on all hair types.  Leaves the hair soft, non greasy with no residues or flakes. Will definitely purchase product again.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product off Amazon but I got it from Sally&#x27;s Beauty. This products works great and it&#x27;s one of the best leave in I&#x27;ve tried. I really don&#x27;t care for using too much protein in my hair but this product was great!</li>
    <li> Excellent on my daughter&#x27;s thick and long 4a type hair. She is extremely tender head and her hair tangles easy even after detangling. It&#x27;s hell doing her hair. After researching and found this product, I could use a wide tooth comb and de tangle her hair. NO TEARS NO FEAR NO TANGLE. Awesome! I gave it a four b/c I still need time to see how it is using as part of hair care for 6 weeks. I say this long to actually give products a chance. So far I recommend for moms with curly hair kids who are extremely tender headed that gives not only the child, but moms (dads too) a break!</li>
    <li> I use it daily.  It is really a great leave in conditioner.  I never let this run out either.</li>
    <li> I use it once a day. There is no residue build-up. It is non-greasy. But it smells like a medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer ......use to moisturize and seal at night.... Not sticky at all!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a first impression review. I applied this product to my curly hair dry and it seemed to moisturize my strands very well. It had a thick white consistency, and would have been better in a squeeze to release container. I did not like the smell of this product(smells like cheap men cologne). I will do another review after I have used this product for awhile..</li>
    <li> Need more right now.  great product</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and moistured!!! It even makes my curls pop.</li>
    <li> This leave-in is so good for entangling, and smells great! I like it very much.</li>
