<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These tweezers work fantastic! Nothing else needs to be said. You will love them.</li>
    <li> These are ok. Not grippy enough for my beard, but fine for my wife. Probably ok for splinters, as they are very precise, just not strong enough for ingrown beard whiskers.</li>
    <li> Finally a tweezer that works on difficult ingrown hairs.  Highly recommend these to anyone who hasn&#x27;t had any success with traditional tweezers.</li>
    <li> great for getting stickers and cactus out of feet and hands and then also used for tiny detail work with crafts.  Love them!!!!</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed :( not as sharp or narrow</li>
    <li> Easy to grip onto fine blonde hairs around the eyebrow area. Does not &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair ensuring that the hair is removed easily.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t what I expected, they don&#x27;t grab the fine hair, and not that precise.</li>
    <li> I recently lost my make up bag, tweezers and all! I so didn&#x27;t want to go spend the money in a store but also didn&#x27;t think anything could live up to my old tweezers!!! These tweezers are absolutely amazing! I received them way earlier than expected!!! Love the costumer service and product!!!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are superior to the other tweezers I have because the tip is very small and long. These tweezers are perfect for removal of splinters, ingrown hair, and precision eyebrow plucking. When I saw that this product was available at a promotional price, I was very excited to purchase and review it because I had been dealing with a very painful ingrown hair. I was unable to remove with any of my other tweezers. It was perfect timing. Definitely a must add to any first-aid kit! We will be taking these tweezers with us on every camping trip, boat ride, sporting event...</li>
    <li> I gave these to my husband for Christmas. He has already made use of them and says they work great on ingrowns. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Simply Essentials tweezers for ingrown hairs are an excellent addition to your beauty kit.  They are made of stainless steel and the long thin point allows you to pluck even the finest hairs or ingrown hairs that you cannot pluck with a lower end set of tweezers.  I did end up pulling a nasty splinter that was in my left index finger and it worked beautifully with minimal pain.  They are well worth the money and you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Well prepared, beautifully packed, &amp;#34;State&#x27;s Surgical Steel&amp;#34;, Stainless Steel, with keeper, and caring case with velcro, also made in Pakistan. Received quickly, also received an E-book great information on using the Tweezers for ingrown hair, I&#x27;ve used tweezers of various types,  for helping to clean medical equipment, for the last five years or so before I retired 2013, but this is the first time for my self, with this problem of Ingrown hair, up till this time I wore a full beard, my dentist  dropped an extractor  on my chin, I was using Hydrogen Peroxide, on the puncher but it still became infected, so I needed to shave, so I could treat the problem and place a band-aid, on area. because of the ingrown hair, it was having a problem healing. I&#x27;m always on the go! I needed something with a case Tweezerman, did not offer this, at $23.00 Prime and also Tweezerman&#x27;s G.E.A.R. Ingrown hair and Splinter at $16.14 (still no Case!)  I was putting something  together on  my own, (Grooming kit)  something I could use in the field,30 day&#x27;s or more, and yet keep up appearance, a Body Grooming  Nail Clipper set and etc with water-proof type case, at a good cost! after I&#x27;ve used a shaver, I still could pull out ingrown hair! :)- &amp;#34;Theses will only be used on my face.&amp;#34; Not for splinters or glass. I will order another one for that! I will update when it&#x27;s a necessity! Thank you! Ms. Jessica, and Castle Rock Essential Products- Amazon Marketplace.</li>
    <li> Despite the great reviews, despite the fact that the description says it&#x27;s calibrated, this product did not work for me.  Maybe mine was just defective, but the ends did not meet properly (one side was bowed) and they didn&#x27;t grip anything I tried to use them on.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not care for such pointed tweezers.. but maybe that is because I&#x27;ve never had REALLY good ones!!&lt;br /&gt;These are ON POINT.. literally! These are the sharpest pointiest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. They work really well getting really fine hairs. I hate it when you can&#x27;t get that one hair that is just too short to be tweezed.. but you can see it! These took care of that for me! They are longer then my normal tweezers but that just makes them all the more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel really sturdy in your hand and have a nice heft to them but not too heavy. They are nice and slick too. I have some other tweezers where the paint is flaking off but these look terrific. Check out my pictures for the length and how pointed they are!</li>
    <li> These are everything they claim. You can dig out a splinter with these since they are as sharp as a needle. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Got this tweezer because of the ratings... unfortunately,  didn&#x27;t work very well for me. Couldnt pull any of my facial hairs.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers.  Love them...fantastic size and quality.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! My husband has thick hair that&#x27;s prone to ingrowns. These are working great for him!</li>
    <li> Sharp, well aligned and strong.  I had a pair of my father&#x27;s WWII military issue splinter forceps for years, but after they were lost, I couldn&#x27;t find a decent replacement until these.  NOT FOR KIDS!  These are SHARP.</li>
    <li> these are very cool and they work amazingly</li>
    <li> I have the tweezerman just like these. My tweezerman&#x27;s had started to loose its grip so I wanted to buy new ones.  I tried these as they looked like they were the same and they were less expensive.  The sharpness at the ends is great but the grip does not grab small fine hairs on eyebrows, eyes &amp; chin.  That is what I needed them for. So for other uses they would probably work fine unless the grip still won&#x27;t hold.  I can not give a better review because they would not work for me.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a tweezers that your husband can use then these are the ones. My husband gets ingrown hairs around neck and chin area from shaving. These tweezers are precise at getting those tiny course stubborn hairs that just leaves his skin so irrated. With these he did not have go pinch his skin or cause any damage removing the hairs. Most times he took the pointed ends and simply lifted the hair up. He really loved that they were the perfect size for his large hands and not the cute danity ones I use, his words not mine. I&#x27;m so happy I was give. The opportunity to review this item at the discounted rate for our experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Took out one of my ingrown hairs didn&#x27;t even hurt!</li>
    <li> Finally!  A pair of tweezers that closes properly.  I get tired of grabbing nothing but air due to poorly made tweezers.  These feel sturdy and well built and I expect them to last a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are amazingly sharp tweezers and work amazingly.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are sharp and work well. I have tried many tweezers, but really like these. They work well for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the tweezers. My previous pair were good but the grip wasn&#x27;t as precise as these. Small hairs were hard to pluck with the old ones and are much simpler with these. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that it is much easier to pluck hairs out from the root instead of getting breakage along the hair shaft somewhere. Overall, very pleased with your product. Definitely a quality product.</li>
    <li> These are prefect for what they are designed for!</li>
    <li> These tweezers tend to snip/cut the hair that I am trying to pull; this only makes the problem worse.</li>
    <li> These are crazy pointy &amp; sharp.  I&#x27;ve tried using them to just pluck my eyebrows but doesn&#x27;t work as good as regular ones.  I haven&#x27;t yet had an ingrown hair to use these.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are fine: they work as expected. But if you purchase them from this amazon page, this vendor will instantly put you on a mailing list and spam you with literally daily requests for feedback about their tweezers, starting long before they even arrive. It is really not worth it for a pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> My wife says that she&#x27;s not sure how it works, but it works at getting out ingrown hairs.  Basically &amp;#34;point and click!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very sharp, easy to handle, and just work!  The best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not the best for everyday use of normal tweezer duties, but they&#x27;re phenomenal at ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Okay - so I have a bit of a &amp;#34;picking&amp;#34; fetish when it comes to my husband&#x27;s beard.  He has a strawberry blonde beard and sensitive skin.  When he transitions from the winter to spring facial hair and shaves off his beard he is more likely to get ingrown hairs than normal.  These tweezers are amazing.  They have a very sharp point for teasing the end of that ingrown to pop up above the skin.  They have a good strength and grip for then removing that pesky ingrown.  They come in a handy faux leather storage case, which I STRONGLY suggest using to prevent accidental pokes to your fingers.  I would strongly recommend these Tweezers for anyone who needs to remove those ingrowns or splinters.  Even though receiving these at a promotional price, I would purchase another pair if needed.</li>
    <li> For a person that often gets ingrown hair, I must say that this is a must-have! I felt like the tweezers were a bit pricey, but its usefulness has certainly made up for it!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for the pesky ingrown hair! They work great, but a little too great. Sometimes I find myself pinching my skin; sometimes even pulling a  bit off with how well they work.</li>
    <li> Out of the 17 tweezers currently sitting in my drawer this is THEE BEST ever.  look no further!</li>
    <li> i was very excited to get these tweezers!  i do my own eye brows and need  tweezers that will actually do their job and pull hair.  these tweezers absolutely WOULD NOT grab even the thickest hairs- never mind the tiny ones.  i tried and tried to use these tweezers thinking i had done something wrong but there is only one way to use them.  i am sure i can understand how to handle a pair of tweezers.  these are AWFUL!!!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever!!!! Does the job better than the normal tweezers! Reply helps with removing the hair under the skin not as sharp..</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers!  I use them mostly for removing dark facial hairs. Would and have recommended to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Tons easier to use than the old traditional tweezers. These allow you to tweeze even the finest hairs, thus lessening the need to tweeze as often.</li>
    <li> I have used these twice now. It makes getting ingrown hairs very easy.</li>
    <li> sharp and effective. works well</li>
    <li> The reviews listed here obviously must be fabricated. These tweezers are terrible and should be sold out of a dollar store instead of being sold here and advertised as quality product.</li>
    <li> even though I have my own special tweezer, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with your product . It made it easier for me to reach the ingrown hair . It&#x27;s very light and the point  is very thin making it easy to reach the single hair . It saved me a trip to the Dermatologist and/or beauty salon . I will recommend this tweezer to friends and family . I will also be happy to give it as s gift to make others happy and pretty . I was also thrilled  with wrapping and the packaging .</li>
    <li> This is a very sharp tweezer! I love it. It&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s described.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Super pointy. Makes it easy to remove unwanted hairs on my eyebrows.  Fits nicely in the case provided making it easy to store and find in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these tweezers!!! They are so easy to use and can get even the smallest hair! They are precise and make removing splinters super easy! It is easy to hold. The tip is sharp, and very fine. I was so excited to get this product as a promotion because this is a lifesaver!! I will definitely be taking these with my when I travel! It comes with a very nice case. I highly recommend these tweezers!</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers - very precise</li>
    <li> I had a metal sliver in my finger that just would not come out. As a retired RN, I wanted a very nice fine pointed tweezer that would be able to grip and not bend at the point. These are just what I was looking for! They rival the high quality ones I was used to while working in the ER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought MANY tweezers over the years , wether for detailed artwork  or in grown hairs. So far these have been the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and I feel compelled to write a review. I occasionally get in grown hairs on my neck or face and most tweezers take several attempts to grab the hair and actually hold onto it. Not sure what metals they use and how they designed the precision of these tweezers, but they work like a charm and haven&#x27;t dulled yet. I was also impressed with e-mail follow ups to make sure the tweezers are working for me and they included info on how to care for them and even sharpen them if they ever dull- which they haven&#x27;t yet.  Great tweezers and the price is great too. It sounds like I&#x27;m a sales person for these tweezers but I&#x27;m not, just someone trying to say good about a great product that deserves my effort to say Thanks! I can whole heartedly recommend these to the pope, the Dali Lama, my mom, my godmother, my gf, the bus of nuns, my rabi neighbor, etc. :)  Being an inquisitive person  I&#x27;m very curious how they engineered them so well? Ill have to ask</li>
    <li> My poor 2 year old had something stuck in his foot and he wouldn&#x27;t let me touch it but I knew I needed to get it out since it was hurting him. I tried my normal tweezers and it was a no go with getting the thing that was stuck in his foot out. I had just received these tweezers in the mail so I figured I would give them a try and see if they would do the job. I grabbed them then went to remove the item in his foot and these tweezers worked like a charm and I got the thing out of his foot. I could tell my son had instant relief. I used these again when my son had splinters in his hand. I tried to get them out by hand and they wouldn&#x27;t come out so I grabbed these tweezers and got all 3 splinters out in no time. They are super sharp as it is a pointed edge. It also comes in a small compact case that can easily fit in your purse. These tweezers are handy and can do more than my normal pair of tweezers. I now use these tweezers all the time and have retired my old tweezers. I was happy to receive this during a promotional period. The tweezers can grab anything and can remove anything. I have never owned a better pair of tweezers. I highly recommend this product and plan on buying a few for stocking stuffers this year.</li>
    <li> This works great for even eyebrows, grabs the hairs that your normal twezzer cannot get. I love it</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers I have every used has very precise pointed ends that is able to grab the smallest hair very easy.  Love them.  Very high quality and great value</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned! Most of the time when you buy pointed tweezers they don&#x27;t align up well and you can&#x27;t easily get what you are trying to get. Well not with these! First time every time! They are going in my purse and I&#x27;m ordering another set for the house. I love them</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed that these weren&#x27;t anything super special.  I mean, they work and all, but for the price,  I expected much more.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! Had them for a year now and still working like they were new. I bought this tweezer because I had some cheapo tweezers that could&#x27;t keep a grip on anything and needed something that could with a small griping area for my hobby work. I found this baby after a short search, and after comparing with the few other tweezers available at the time and I settled on these. They are very comfortable to hold and give a nice grip on anything you hold with them. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great for getting those ingrown hairs out!</li>
    <li> The tweezers did a great job of removing hair.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to work at all. I can&#x27;t get ahold of a hair no matter how many times I try.</li>
    <li> After reading the raving reviews, I thought this is the product for me. Only to receive it yesterday and to my astonishment things simply didn&#x27;t add up. First off the points are so blunt there is no way you can get an ingrown hair without scarring. Next there is no tension on the tweezers to properly grip the hairs even ones not ingrown. I gave it one star for the size it is big enough to handle and not easy to use. The only thing I can think of is that me and the rest of the reviewers received two different products. This is too much money not to work will send back and start my search again from scratch.</li>
    <li> Fell back on an older tweezer...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for a quality pair of Tweezers (for those annoying Ingrown Hair&#x27;s no less) then go ahead and add this item to your cart with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hairy dude lol, and these Tweezers catch what my other pairs miss.</li>
    <li> Awesome tweezers for slivers! These are a good size tweezers and feel good in your hand. The tip comes to a fine point and makes grabbing small slivers easy. We got a trial run we these a few days ago when my daughter got a sliver in her foot. It was quick work to pull it out. I was so happy to get these tweezers during a sale!!</li>
    <li> I just wish that the prongs were thinner.  But it works fine.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! will definitely recommend</li>
    <li> These are really nice tweezers.  Really sharp and perfectly aligned. I was able to easily pull a splinter from my little boy&#x27;s hand and dig out an ingrown hair.  The only thing I really did not like about this was that it came with 3x times as much packaging than necessary.  They came in a box that was almost 10 inches long by 2 inches wide for an item that is only 3 inches long by 1 inch wide.  Very environmentally unfriendly company.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Finally you can get those pesky unwanted, sometimes painful ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> love its precision! will def recommend it! great grip too!</li>
    <li> Came bent never worked right</li>
    <li> I wanted so bad to love these tweezers and give them a good review, but I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get them I immediately go to my lighted magnifying mirror to pull an in-grown chin hair and I can&#x27;t grab that hair for the life of me! I&#x27;m trying and trying and trying to no avail. I stop and come back and read some more of the reviews and decide to try again because everyone is saying how wonderful these tweezers are....still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am thinking well maybe I need to read the directions, then it hits me - if I need to read directions to use a pair of tweezers then I have no business using those tweezers. And in case you were wondering - there are no directions that come with these tweezers, but there is an ebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using my slanted tweezers is quicker and more accurate than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end of a positive note, these tweezers come with a leatherette pouch that closes with velcro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castle Rock Essentials Products, Inc. provided me with this sample for testing and review purposes without guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging and if these don&#x27;t remove a splinter than nothing will.</li>
    <li> This works fairly well for pinpointing single hairs. It isn&#x27;t a godsend (still see some strand breakage) but does better than my old tweezers for the super short hairs. If you&#x27;re going after a row of regular length hairs, use your old tweezers... it would take forever with these!</li>
    <li> This is a good tweezer. Many tweezers like these are small and hard to hold. These are good for normal size adult hands. I liked that it came with a case since it is so sharp. I needed new tweezers and saw these offered as part of a promotion so I jumped on it. This review is my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I know these are billed as ingrown hair tweezers, but I have found them to be exceptional at retrieving splinters and stingers.  My kids are notorious for running around the yard without their shoes and are consequently constantly picking up splinters, thorns, and bee stings on the bottom of their feet.  I saw these advertised as part of a review promotion, so I took a chance and purchased them. I was a little scared of the pointed end at first, but found it to be an asset. These have replaced my old “tool kit” of needle and angle ended tweezers.  I am happy with the way the ends line up perfectly and grab the splinter easier than I expected.  While the product itself deserves 5 stars, I gave it only 4 because it did not come with the case as advertised.  This case would be handy to store them in.</li>
    <li> Meh! I do appreciate that these tweezers are machined/ground to match the sides of the tip, but the tips themselves are not the same sharpness on my copy. These are OK, but other precision tweezers are better matched.</li>
    <li> After misplacing my tweezerman tweezers I was looking for another option. Some of the reviews were great so I ordered these hoping to find a cheaper replacement. Sadly they did not work, AT ALL. Not even for a regular hair that wasn&#x27;t ingrown. I have had better luck with tweezers from the dollar store, very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I sent these back right away for a refund and bought another tweezerman product.</li>
    <li> It seems like every time I find a set of tweezers I like, after a few months the ends slip and do not meet making it almost impossible to pluck anything.  These Simply Essentials tweezers ends line up perfectly and are fabulous for getting the small hairs that are just coming in.  I occasionally get a small black hair on my chin and these worked great at plucking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointy ends also make splinter removal a breeze.  My husband works in construction and gets at least three splinters a week.  The ends are able to get right under the skin and remove the splinter without much discomfort to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else I use these for is to place gem stones on my nails.  The small, pointy ends make it perfect for picking up smaller rhinestones and gems and perfectly placing them where I want them.  With so many ways to use these tweezers, I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to purchase them at a special price to test for quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome, large size and sharp tip makes accuracy a breeze.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great!  Sometimes you don&#x27;t realize that you&#x27;re using a bad product until you use something that is so much better and these tweezers were a marked improvement from what i was using.  These tweezers are easy to use and work well.  They are nicely weighted and feel good in your hands, which makes them easy to use and very effective.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are nearly surgical looking. Precise handling when I&#x27;m trying to pull sand spur splinters out of my feet. It happens a lot because my 6 dogs track them into the house. I no longer have to dig them out since these grab them the first try but if I had to these would be perfect for that too.</li>
    <li> These are great for getting hairs out. My husband has been able to use them to pull the hairs out as well, my hair is too fine, so I have to use this to get the ingrown hair free and then my other tweezers to pull it out. I am very pleased with these. I have had an ingrown hair for weeks that I have not been able to get out with my other tweezers and was able to get it in 1 minute with these :)</li>
    <li> These are Wonderful!!! I get in grown hairs on my legs sometimes and these effortlessly pulls them right out.</li>
    <li> I have a tweezer that I paid three times the amount that I paid for this one and by far this one is much better. It is very sharp and precise. It is also large enough for me to get a good grip. I love it....</li>
    <li> Great for splinters and as a wood worker I get the use of them from time to time when repairing pieces for clients</li>
    <li> These Tweezers are awesome!!  Be careful They are sharp.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother, as it is harder for her now a days to tweeze. She seems to have a lot of ingrown hairs but she said she likes it. It is super sharp but seems to be affective.</li>
    <li> It is a good additional tweezer to have.  It was made well and worked fine.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with these tweezers. Worked great for me</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these lil guys but they just did not meet my expectations in all arenas.&lt;br /&gt;I have not successfully plucked a single hair with these without breaking it off at the point of contact with the tweezer. The point is so fine that when and if I can manage to grasp a hair it snaps off when pressure is applied to attempt a pluck.&lt;br /&gt;As far as ingrown hairs go, I&#x27;m not sure this would work well at all without creating a bloody mess. Maybe my concept of ingrown hair is construed?&lt;br /&gt;However I do think having these in a first aid kit for splinters and glass shards and such will be invaluable and quite possibly the only real function that these would excel at. They are also made with quality and the case is a bonus. Three stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a promotional price with the understanding that I would test and review.</li>
    <li> Very narrow tip tweezers, perfect for difficult hairs or splinters.</li>
    <li> When I received this I didn&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs but I did need to pluck my eyebrows.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve been using the same tweezers for more than 35 years and am very fond of the way they work.  But I now have a new favorite pair of tweezers!  I love the weight of them, the precision they give you and the case is a very nice bonus, especially when travelling!  I think my daughters will like them too so I&#x27;m going to have to buy a couple more!</li>
    <li> These have a sharp and precise point on them makes for  quick and painless plucking of unwanted hair. They&#x27;re precise, no more going over the same hair several times from dozens of angles. They came with a case that helps protect them from damage when traveling. These are made of heavy duty stainless steel . Even my girlfriend ask me if I could order her one to use on her crafts.</li>
    <li> Purchased through Elite deals and was very surprised by the quality of the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as expected.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing. I reviewed once already but it has been removed. They are really good at getting those fine hairs and made easy to hold.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are precision made and fits well in one&#x27;s hand.  I like them, and intend to buy another set to use for micro ship building.  Great for ingrown hairs too.</li>
    <li> The corner of my slanted tweezers works betters and grabs better than these tweezers. Does not grab hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to replace my Tweezerman tweezers, which have become kinda dull over time. The reviews on here make these tweezers sound like they&#x27;re the greatest ever but I honestly don&#x27;t see how or why. My old Tweezerman ones work better than these do. The tips are too blunt to dig out ingrown hairs without making collateral damage to the surrounding skin. I was expecting a sharper point like a V rather than \_/ (sorry for the rudimentary diagrams.) I also found that they didn&#x27;t grasp hairs very well (and I have coarse hair). Maybe I just got a bad pair but I will be returning them and sticking to the Tweezerman brand.</li>
    <li> I love stuff that seems like it&#x27;s crafted for an airline engine - and this tweezer feels downright machined!  This feels great in the hand, nice weight, good springiness - this is a state of the art tweezer, very good looking, super precise.  Recommend them.  The only reason I dinged it one star is the eBook - maybe they sent it to me, but I don&#x27;t see it or anything with the tweezer; I don&#x27;t even want an eBook, I just don&#x27;t want to be told I&#x27;m getting one and then not get one.  Minor, minor annoyance - don&#x27;t let that redirect you from this stellar tweezer experience!</li>
    <li> Dang man this thing can get out anything!!! NICE</li>
    <li> Works very well. Careful on sensitive spots because it is easy to get the skin</li>
    <li> I had hoped these would be a good replacement for an old pair of needle tip tweezers (stray hair beware by Sally Hansen).  The newer versions of the Stray Hair do not have the needle tip points and I have been on the hunt for a pair of truly pointed tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not it. They tend to actually snip off the hair you are trying to pull, rather than grasp it.  They are harder to control than my shorter tweezers.</li>
    <li> You never really say to yourself one day you&#x27;ll be reviewing tweezers on amazon... After all, tweezers are tweezers, right? Wrong. These tweezers are legit. Their point is SUPER sharp so you can get even the most stubborn ingrown hair. The handle is also a little thicker than normal tweezers so you have a really good grasp. I&#x27;ve been using these for my eyebrows and they work great. If you need precise tweezers these will definitely do the job.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great.  Love the package!</li>
    <li> WOW!!  You can do surgery with these.  Fine, fine, well made product.  A precision tool and the price is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for getting those hairs without causing unnecessary trauma to the skin. I really love them and I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without this in my life!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect</li>
    <li> First ones I found that work for my fine fine hairs</li>
    <li> These ingrown hair tweezers are working great, beyond my expectations. They are made very well, very strong and durable, and with surgical stainless steel tips.&lt;br /&gt; My husband gets a lot of ingrown facial hairs and these work perfectly getting them out. He loves them. They also work really really good for slivers/splinters, my kids are constantly getting them from our neighbors railroad tie border and our wood porch. I love them for getting splinters out because they are so sharp that I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a needle to help break the skin where the splinter is.&lt;br /&gt; They come with a nice little leather like case to hold them while not in use, and they are the perfect size for traveling with. They also have a free ebook available with further instructions on use.&lt;br /&gt; I was asked to review this item in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! Great product!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to tweeze then it&#x27;s definitely the best!  It is affordable, durable and gets the job done.  It&#x27;s so good that I threw away all my other tweezers and can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to discover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and thank you Castle Rock Essential for introducing me to it.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen it in a store so get it while it&#x27;s hot !!  Thanks again ~</li>
    <li> The tweezer worked very well. It was very easy and effective to grab even the finest of hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t grip unless a hair was broken through the skin.  No instructions included.  Not pointy enough</li>
    <li> These tweezers are well made and appear to be stainless steel (non-magnetic) as advertised.  They will do the job well for removal of slivers (all but the tiniest pinpoint sliver).  I&#x27;d probably buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! Don&#x27;t use them so much for ingrown hair although they are great for that, I use them mostly for removing dark facial hairs that seems to come as you get older. Would and have recommended to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> What makes this tweezers so much better than the ones priced at under $5?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Simply Essentials tweezers are made from stainless steel and features a sharp, fine tip that will grab any ingrown hairs or thorns, glass, stones, metals or splinters that have been embedded in your fingers, hands, feet and legs. The tweezers are calibrated, giving it an accurate grip for every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a cheap splinter tweezers several times a week for small ingrown hairs on neck, but the tip isn&#x27;t fine enough to grab hold of the small hairs. I was excited to receive the Simply Essentials tweezers and I&#x27;m glad to say that it is the best tweezers I have ever used. I highly recommend the tweezers to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Very well made worth the price.The Tweezers for ingrown hair will last a long time and will be great for splinters and many other things.A must have for first aid kits.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do not pluck anything... I haven&#x27;t tried them for anything else other than hair but... They were not worth dollar I spent.</li>
    <li> I really like that these are big enough for my sausage fingers to get a good grip on them. And the tips actually meet up so you can get those tiny, near invisible hairs. I&#x27;ll be ordering another one to keep at work.</li>
    <li> tweezers I received were very ruff at point, they need some filing or something did they come from china very poor product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Used for getting splinters outs.</li>
    <li> I have several pairs of tweezers but none that are this small and pointy. These are great for getting the tiny hairs in your eyebrows that some bigger tweezers just can&#x27;t get without pulling out more than one hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers close together perfectly so it makes grabbing hair very easy. These would also work great at getting glass or splinters out. The grippy texture makes them feel secure in my hand while using them and the wider middle part gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added these to my makeup for touch ups that I might of missed and I&#x27;m very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided complimentary for review purposes</li>
    <li> Not calabrated around the whole tip. If I don&#x27;t get it lined up just right, I can&#x27;t pluck the hair. Gets to be very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Amazing for getting out my ingrowns!</li>
    <li> These tweezer are very fine tip and works wonders at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Much better than standard tweezers.  I&#x27;m plagued with ingrown hairs. These focus the pressure in the right place.  These in addition to my Anthony&#x27;s Logistics for Men Ingrown Hair treatment have dramatically improved my situation.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a pair that isn&#x27;t even but it doesn&#x27;t work to pluck.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t pluck. That may be a sin, but I don&#x27;t. What I do need tweezers for is my first-aid kit. Someone in our family always has a splinter, ingrown hair, or stitches. The tweezers which come in first-aid kits are unattractive and inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This streamlined stainless steel tweezer is precise. Its design is basic. I like that it closes evenly. The tips are very pointy and sharp. I am very impressed by the sturdy construction and expect to be using these tweezers for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(No human was harmed in the creation of this review, unless you count taking out my own stitches. I promise that it hurt much less than when the nurse takes them out.)</li>
    <li> These tweezers are super pointy and hardly has much tension to grip hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I finally managed to pluck the tiny hairs on my brows and they got plucked out easily. The trick to these tweezers is to hold them flat or to really concentrate the point to your hairs that need to get plucked from the root and pull. The style and size of the tweezer is really nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these reviews are fake. 38 out of 42 are five star ratings, and the other 4 are four star ratings, and they all were posted within a three week or so timespan? Very suspicious IMHO. I would report this to amazon if I knew how.  I personally do rely heavily upon amazon reviews even when I am purchasing items in-person, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for potential fraudulent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These might be ok, if pricy, tweezers, but I don&#x27;t like supporting fraudulent practices.</li>
    <li> Does not hold at the point.  Great for retreiving in grown hair but not pulling them out.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have a pointy end that is perfect for grabbing tiny hairs</li>
    <li> Not anything special.  Purchased similar in store</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers for removing unwanted and ingrown hairs. Their sleek design and easy to hold handle make tweezing a breeze. I recommend these tweezers for anyone who struggles with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy easy to use. Easy to clean. I would recommend having this around. I used it to get a splinter out and it worked perfect.</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING! The dont rip the skin and seriously get to the &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; of the problem (pun intended) lol I am so glad I have these in my medicine cabinet! I considered getting them for in my car as well!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers!  They get the job done!</li>
    <li> I am very happy I was able to get this during the company&#x27;s promotion for reviewing and testing purposes. The quality of this tweezers is amazing and if taken great care of, this would last us a while. My bf has a lot of ingrown hair, which is one of the main reasons I got this and oh my, this tweezers works. The fine tips are perfectly aligned, which makes my job easy when pulling his ingrown hair. Overall, I am very impressed with this tweezers and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers. They&#x27;re very pointed and perfect for removing ingrown hairs, glass, metal shavings, and splinters. They&#x27;re precise and get exactly what you&#x27;re trying to. They&#x27;re easy to grip very comfortable to use although they&#x27;re bigger than I had imagined them to be. They&#x27;re perfect for when my husband gets little tiny metal shavings in his arm when he&#x27;s at work. I&#x27;m very happy with these tweezers and they have been used many times. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I have not had a chanced to use these a lot. They seem very well constructed</li>
    <li> If you have some ingrown hair on your legs, you know what does it mean to put on pants to cover your legs. When you have to dig your skin to take off an ingrown hair which hurts your skin and leaves your  skin tore up. Now! the solution is here! These tweezers bring the hair out easily. Its sharp tips are and perfectly aligned points make it ideal for ingrown hairs or any unwanted hairs without making any soar on my skin. I believe, it a must have in any beauty bag or even medicine cabinet. The only thing I can add to this is, keep t away from your child because of its ultra sharp tips which might be dangerous for small kids.</li>
    <li> I ordered these tweezers because not much was helping in regards to my splinter removal. These were so precise that I didnt damage anymore of my skin. I tried them on other things. The grip is amazing.</li>
    <li> Like the pointed tip and it is easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I am going to have to say that these tweezers are awesome. I had bought a pair and left them at a hotel. I had to get another. They are the best at getting small ingrown hairs and small splinters. A must to have!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> During the brief time of using these tweezers, they have become my favorite. Quality craftsmanship at a reasonable price. Well done!!</li>
    <li> My husband gets ingrown hair all of the time on his face. When I Trenton get them, it leaves a large red blemish.  So I saw these tweezers for ingrown hair during a promotion period and I bought them.  They are amazing.  No more large red blemishes,  and it takes a fraction of the time.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I like to hike and geocache in the parks and woods of my area, and those two endeavors often land me in some rather thick underbrush and other thorny situations. I always carry a pair of tweezers to help me deal with the thorns and splinters I inevitably attract. These tweezers are the best I&#x27;ve seen for this purpose. The precision design and construction are obvious after just a few minutes of use. I&#x27;m still not looking forward to the thorns and splinters, but dealing with them is now much quicker and less painful.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really do a very good job, will just use for crafts now...</li>
    <li> These tweezers have been used daily since they arrived at my house. I tweeze my eyebrows and have a recurring ingrown hair in my left eyebrow, which usually takes weeks to remove with regular tweezers, and then I am left with an ugly blemish. These tweezers removed that same ingrown hair immediately with little to no pain, and no blemish. Amazing! The tips are very pointy and sharp, so I store the tweezers well out of reach of my toddler, but the tips are what make it easy to get to the ingrown hair and remove it. These tweezers are grippy and work so well that I have taken to using them for my regular tweezing as well. I was offered a promotional price for this item, but feel that it is well worth the full price. If you have any issues with ingrown hair, these tweezers are the way to go. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for digging out splinters.  Years ago I used to have an actual pair of surgical tweezers but I lost them in a move.  It&#x27;s nice to have a worthy replacement</li>
    <li> Nicely pointed and very sharp; will dig out a buried hair with ease. The long points make it easier to see what you are working on, and don&#x27;t block your view like wider-bladed tweezers.</li>
    <li> The claims that these needle nose tweezers are super sharp is grandly overstated.  I bought these to replace my Tweezerman brand needle tweezers that were confiscated by the TSA at the airport.  There is NO comparison between these and my Tweezermans.  Although described as super sharp, the tips on these are actually quite blunt- significantly more so than my old pair or the brand new Tweezerman&#x27;s that I just bought.  The metal is also quite thin, so they bend pretty easily.  If my husband&#x27;s strong hands get ahold of these tweezers, they&#x27;ll surely be sprung in no time.  I plan to return them and have already purchased a new pair of Tweezermans and am as pleased as I was with my first pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I got an email from the manufacturer, Castle Rock, thanking me for my order and asking me for my feedback on these tweezers.  I was honest about them.  I got no reply.  I&#x27;m assuming that was just an automated follow up that was never read by a human.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best!!  They are especially good for removing fine hair.  I recommend them highly!</li>
    <li> Holy moly these guys are sharp!  The point is awesome!  We had a splinter event over the weekend and these were my hero!  The point in tiny yet the pinch is super strong. We got that lil sucker out quick!  The seven year old splinter victim said it barely hurt!  SCORE!&lt;br /&gt;These came in a little protective case which you will not want to throw out. You don&#x27;t want these guys willy nilly in your drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The part that you grip is wide and easily held which is nice when doing minor surgeries 😉&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will gladly give my raving review. So glad I was able to utilize a promotional code while purchasing.</li>
    <li> I recently had to shave for a figure competition.  Problem after the competition had ingrown hairs numbs all over my shoulders.  They were awful and nothing was working until I got these tweezers.  Gave the tweezers to my husband and he was able to get all the ingrown hairs out with no problems.</li>
    <li> These work great, much better than I thought they would. Very sharp, so you can really get in there and pull out pesky ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> love them -easy to handle</li>
    <li> This was a great little stocking stuffer gift for a family member over the holidays and they love it.  They arrived on time and in perfect condition and work as advertised.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are sufficient and do exactly what I need them to do.</li>
    <li> Quite disappointed in these. They didn&#x27;t grasp hair at all, and the tips were too thick to do anything for ingrowns. I&#x27;m only giving two stars because I was able to return them for a mostly hassle-free refund.</li>
    <li> My husband has thick course hair. He&#x27;ll come to me about one a week to get an ingrown out of his neck. Most of the time I really do feel as though I am performing surgery. These tweezers have made my life so much easier!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s an my eyesight isn&#x27;t what it used to be. These tweezers hand is large enough for me to hold without my hand getting in the way and messing my focus up even more.&lt;br /&gt;They come calibrated and sharp enough to be a weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have to speculate by high ratings and comments that the lower reviews must be the competition. Some aren&#x27;t Amazon verified purchased and most of them sound exactly the same!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Works very very well!~</li>
    <li> I ordered these Tweezers for my husband because he was always taking mine and i would have to hunt them down. When i gave them to him he looked at me like i was crazy. But he used them and said these are the s@%t and said that they were better than the ones i have. I am a retired hair dresser and i thought i had a very good pare of tweezers. But i was wrong. I wish i would of kept them for my self LOL He also told me that i have my own tweezers so i didnt need to use his. Humm somethings wrong with this picture LOL I guess i will have to get some for my self. They are very good Surgical Steel and the tips are aligned perfect. You can get a very good hold of a very short hair. Just cant tell you how wonderful they really are.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing!!! They are very precise, and I am not breaking off hair when pulling it out. Also, the ends are sharp enough to get stubborn ingrown hairs, but not so much that they hurt. I would get more of these to have one in each bathroom!</li>
    <li> Literally the worst tweezers in the world. Wasted $25 on these.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do exactly what they say they are going to do.  They come to a very sharp point so that you can get to the smallest hair or smallest thing.  I have used these for hairs but then I have also used them for other completely odd things.  For example, I needed to put a tiny sticker on something and could not do it with my fingers.  These tweezers worked great for that.  So anything that is tiny that you need to pick up, you can do with these tweezers.  They are nice and long and the black covering provides a little more grip than just plain metal.  I played around with these to see how tiny of things I could pick up.  I was able to pick up a grain of salt with them.  If you are in need of fine tip tweezers, these are great.  To give you an idea of size, they are about the same size on the end as pencil lead.  I have attached a picture next to mechanical pencil let to give you an idea of size.  I was able to get this product at a special price in exchange for this honest review.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome tweezers! If you&#x27;ve ever had a planters wart, then you know how hard they can be to get rid of. When my son was involved in karate lessons, he ended up getting a planters wart on his foot. At that time I had no idea what it was and thought it was a blister, and so I left it go to heal on it&#x27;s own. In a short time he had quite a few planters warts because they spread quickly. Part of a home treatment was to pull the little black roots out of the warts, which was not an easy task to do with regular slanted edge tweezers. I ended up removing some healthy softened skin with the infected skin, which wasn&#x27;t good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers by Castle Rock are excellent! I enjoy their design being longer than my normal tweezers, and also the nice flat surface in the middle for your thumb. I also like they are stainless steel, so they are sturdy and will last longer than plastic tweezers. Sure, the tweezers I have with the slanted edge are good for some things still, like pulling cotton fillers out of a bottle or to help get that stubborn baby tooth out. However, with an active boy at home, when I need to be precise and grasp something specific, like a splinter or thin black root inside a planters wart, and not disturb surrounding areas of something else, like healthy skin, I will be using these tweezers by Castle Rock from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and reviewing.</li>
    <li> Really accurate pair of tweezers! These are well made from high quality stainless steel. They are easy to grip. They have a very precise pointed tip. They are great for eyebrows, ingrown hairs, and perfect for splinter removal. I am happy to recieve these tweezers to review.</li>
    <li> Great little tweezers that you can take with you. They work perfectly to get out those ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> These Tweezers are long and perfectly angled to grab ingrown hairs and pull them out from the root.  They squeeze together very well and get a good hold on the hair to easily pull it out.  They are made of black stainless steel.  I really like how the ends are pointy to make sure they really grab the hair.  I had some very small eye brow hairs that my regular tweezers could grab a hold of, but these tweezers very easily pulled the unwanted hair out. I also really like that it comes with a little black case to put the tweezers in.  Very happy with these tweezers and they will save me a lot of time to easily remove some stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. My opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these</li>
    <li> Castle Rock Essentials Tweezers for Ingrown Hair are super narrow tipped tweezers. These are designed to grab the tiny hairs and ingrown hairs- as the title states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them a bit tricky to grab the hair with. The super small tips are great for poking and lifting the hairs up, but not for pulling them out. I&#x27;m unsure of how to make it more effective, other than perhaps making it double ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m moderately pleased. They do expose ingrown hairs with minimal effort, but then another pair of tweezers is needed to actually pluck the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with a promotional code, for the purpose of a review. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> These are amazing tweezers! I have yet to use them for an ingrown hair but for every other tweezing need they perform admirably. I was fortunate enough to get them at a deep discount but I would still recommend them to anyone at full price.</li>
    <li> I use tweezers every few days. Sometimes is hard to pull out  the little hair with my regular tweezers, I have to wait till they get bigger so I can pull them out. With these tweezers my problem is solved. I have to say not every hair will be pulled out but most of them that I could see was. Stainless Steel , nice size and strong comfortable grip. I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> Just bought a pair for myself and my daughter. They work great! Would recommend highly especially for  tweezing eyebrows .</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this purchase.  I cannot remove any facial hair with this product and it is so big which makes it very awkward to work it.</li>
    <li> Awesome tweezers. I love the pointed tip. I&#x27;m always picking on my husband with the angled ones and these are so much better for ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes them. They work well</li>
    <li> Wow is all I can say!!! These are the greatest tweezers.  I have a little boy, so I am preparing myself for many years of splinters to remove, and now I can be confident that I can get them.  My husband has also been known to get splinters, and he can never get them out, and then I have to fight with regular tweezers and usually give up before I can get them.  Not anymore, these make it easy to grasp and remove even the most difficult splinter.  They are also great for plucking eyebrows, which is great.  Another great perk, is they include an ebook that tells you the uses of these tweezers, as well as how to take care of your skin and the tweezers. I highly recommend these. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> I had a issue when I first received them which the seller promptly resolved.  I wanted to use them a few times before I wrote the review.  Love them.  I have had them for about 3 weeks and found that both my husband and I use them from splinters (he&#x27;s an arborist) and ingrown hairs.  Amazing that these tweezers can get anything out.  I have spent up to 40 dollars for a pair of tweezers that cannot compete with these.</li>
    <li> I have a tenancy to get a few ingrown hairs when I shave. With regular tweezers ingrown hairs can be painful to pull, with these, you hardly feel anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. The only negative thing I can say is that after purchasing the product I was emailed 4-6 times within a 10-14 day period asking me to give feedback. I&#x27;m happy to review a product but it felt a bit pushy and the e-mail was the same every time, verbatim. I think they use some sort of bot to beg for reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that minor annoyance, it&#x27;s a really worthwhile purchase and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review first by saying these are NOT your mothers tweezers. These are NOT the tweezers many of us grew up using or may even be using now. Now on to the review. My husband has very thick, coarse facial hair. Very thick and extremely coarse. He has to shave every three days because his facial hair grows so fast. He has ingrown hairs a lot of the times, so we have several pairs of tweezers for this reason alone. So I jumped at the chance to review these, mainly because of how they are made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most tweezers you run across are either beveled edge and cut straight or they are beveled edged and cut on an angle. We own several pairs of these and my hubby is always complaining that neither work very well. These tweezers are specifically for ingrown hair and come to a point. He really likes them and feels that these are better overall. They are able to complete the task of removing the unwanted hair quickly and easily, so we highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> With a husband that works in construction, needle tipped tweezers are a necessity in this household.  Splinters are pretty much a daily occurrence.  You can see why I was so excited to get the opportunity to try and review these tweezers. These tweezers are very easy to grip and hold. They are very well constructed and super sharp. Perfect in every way!</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got a dud, but the product seemed like it was used before.  Black frame had a noticeable bend and the ends were not aligned properly.</li>
    <li> Our family SOOOOO needed these!!!! I always find my husband picking at his chin because of all the in-grown hairs he gets from shaving so often. He&#x27;s always got big red spots on his face and chin. These tweezers have been extremely helpful! It makes it much easier for him to remove his in-grown hairs without have to pick incessantly with his tiny fingernails, which just leads to infection. These tweezers are now a MUST HAVE in our bathroom cabinet!!!! Thanks for giving me a chance to review your tweezers. I am very thankful for the discount!</li>
    <li> These are super!!! I love the needle point tip.  They make it easy to get those hard to tweeze eyebrows that are too close to the rest, and those darn ingrown hairs we all get.  they are big enough to have a good grip and pointy enough to get that one hair without making a big gap or pulling more than you want. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
