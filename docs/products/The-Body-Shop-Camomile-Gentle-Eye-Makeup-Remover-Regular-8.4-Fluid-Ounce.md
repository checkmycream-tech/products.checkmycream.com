      <li>The Body Shop Camomile Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Regular - 8.4 fl oz;  Bought This As A Gift</li>
      <li>The Merle Norman one was a bit greasy and this one was recommended to me by the sales associate after I asked if it caused problems with sensitive eyes.</li>

<li> Not great for waterproof mascara but just takes a little more effort.</li>
<li> I use it daily and it lasts a long time!</li>
<li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
<li> During that time I have tried other stuff, but always go back to this.  </li>
<li> Originally got this item in a gift box, now I think I&#x27;m addicted!  </li>

<li> It really is gentle to the eye/skin and always cleans thoroughly without leaving residue behind.</li>
<li> I have eye allergies and have to be very careful.  </li>
<li> I used Clinique and L&#x27;Oreal and Estee Lauder eye makeup remover without issue, but for some reason with this product, my eyes itch, water for several hours, and just generally feel swollen and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Also, the remover slightly irritates my eyes.</li>
<li> Worse yet, it left a film, stringy black pieces of make up all over my eyeball.</li>
<li> I unfortunately took her word for it and every time I use this makeup remover on or near my eyes, my eyes swell shut and start watering.</li>
<li> This product stings my eyes pretty bad.</li>
<li> and now it&#x27;s worse then ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best make up remover EVER. Not oily and doesn&#x27;t burn if it accidentally goes in your eyes. The $11 you&#x27;ll spend</li>
    <li> Effective and gentle.  Removes makeup and does not leave a residue.  Very gentle on your skin.  Highly recoomended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes and is not tested on animals. Two of my favorite things in one bottle!</li>
    <li> This product is fine unless u wear waterproof eyliner. I use mac and this doesnt cut through it at all! For that I need something oil based unfortunately</li>
    <li> This product works great at removing your eye make-up completely and without stinging or burning your eyes.</li>
    <li> Lady in the shop strongly recommended it, so I took her word for it. Turns out it&#x27;s only a remover for regular make-up, NOT WATERPROOF. It doesn&#x27;t say that on the bottle anywhere. I use Mac eyeliner, and it doesn&#x27;t take it off at all... it merely smears it. Be sure to buy it only if your make-up is waterproof. Otherwise, yes, it&#x27;s gentle. And the remover foams if you rub it for a while... you can basically use it to take off your foundation, too.</li>
    <li> This eye make-up remover does the job, but is not the best that I&#x27;ve used. After I apply the remover it turns the outer portion of my eyes red and makes them feel a little dry. It takes many applications to remove the make-up and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get it all. Also, the remover slightly irritates my eyes. It could be just me, but I have definitely used better. I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to my eyes so I could be overly critical, but I will NOT buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The worst make up remover I ever tried. It&#x27;s not gentle at all. It doesn&#x27;t worst money I payed for it. My eyes still hurt. Forget about it if you wear waterproof make up</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years! During that time I have tried other stuff, but always go back to this.  It&#x27;s not oily and does a great job in removing my eye makeup without any irriation of my eyes or the gentle area surrounding the eyes.  I feel no need to wipe with anything else after.  I feel this is great stuff and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this make-up remover. It&#x27;s very soft and really takes away ALL your make-up...</li>
    <li> This is very gentle. I use a cotton ball to remove makeup with this, but afterwards I have to take another dry cotton ball to dry my eye area. Not oily, which is great.</li>
    <li> Very good m/u remover, gentle and safe to use on your eyes for non-waterproof eye makeup. If you wear waterproof mascara this will not remove it completely, but it doesn&#x27;t sting when I do use it on my eyes. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s also an 8oz bottle, unlike most removers that seem to come in only 3 or 4oz bottles. I compared the price for this bottle with another favorite, drugstore m/u remover in the 4oz bottle and discovered that, per ounce, they cost the same, so you won&#x27;t be paying any more for this than you would drugstore removers.</li>
    <li> It stung my eyes. It took tons of product to remove modest eye make up. Worse yet, it left a film, stringy black pieces of make up all over my eyeball. It was out of a horror movie. With no return policy what will i ever do with this big bottle of crap. ugh</li>
    <li> I have eye allergies and have to be very careful.  This product is very mild but cleans eye make up very well.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover ever.  Not great for waterproof mascara but just takes a little more effort. Have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Need I say more?  This gets it all off - gently and quickly.  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: when the Body Shop has a sale, the price may be better there.</li>
    <li> It removes eye makeup pretty well, but it&#x27;s very alcoholy and seems harsh. I don&#x27;t like to use it too often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years but I can never find it anywhere so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. It removes eye makeup very easily with no irritation at all and it&#x27;s a nice sized bottle that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was less than the Merle Norman eye makeup remover (which costs more for a smaller bottle) and I was running low. The Merle Norman one was a bit greasy and this one was recommended to me by the sales associate after I asked if it caused problems with sensitive eyes. I unfortunately took her word for it and every time I use this makeup remover on or near my eyes, my eyes swell shut and start watering. Like many others I figured it may just be because of the switch in product, but the problem continues. I will not be rebuying this product, it barely removes non-waterproof makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it is gentle on the eyes and removes the makeup pretty efficiently. I squeeze a bit onto a cotton ball and then rest it on my eyes. Then I gently wipe and most of the eye makeup (I use liquid liner AND pencil) comes off. I wipe off the remaining residue with more balls of cotton soaked in this makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best of the best. You can dump this in your eye and it won&#x27;t hurt you at all. (However, whatever makeup you are wearing can sting your eyes during the removal process but it has nothing to do with the remover.) You can have 10 tons of makeup on and in a simple swipe this removes it. It&#x27;s really amazing and there isn&#x27;t any oil in it to make your skin feel greasy afterward. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean, specially in the sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> Love the product but question the quality from the seller.  My bottle had tape around it and was way more watery than previous bottles I purchased at The Body Shop.</li>
    <li> This eye make up remover doesn&#x27;t sting like the clinique I always buy. It came on time, with a nice tissue around and they even hand write thank you on it. Very sweet. Bought one for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item because it is from bodyshop and it says it is gentle make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;so i gave it a try.. but now I regret. whenever i use this, my eyes, not eye balls but the skin over eyes feels itch and pain. i think it is too strong for me. I want to give it to someone else who has stronger skin than mine...</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to numerous eye makeup remover products (e.g., Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome, etc.). This product never irritates my eyes, works wonderfully removing my eye makeup including mascara, and I know it is made from the best natural ingredients. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and takes the make up off. It also is great for removing Sharpie marker off of a childs face without burning their skin - true story! My 2 year old son got a hold of a Sharpie and drew whiskers and a cat nose on his face. I had no idea what would take it off that wasn&#x27;t going to burn his skin, so I used the Camomile eye make-up remover and it worked great!!</li>
    <li> They changed it after years and its not the same! Doesnt remove the makeup like before and it smells different</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover. I like the fact that my mascara comes off easily and its not greasy at all. I hate the oily/greasy removers.</li>
    <li> Originally got this item in a gift box, now I think I&#x27;m addicted!  Really great product!  Send me a coupon though, it&#x27;s way too pricy!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this eye makeup remover, but it did not work very well for me. It would cause my eyes to itch a lot and become red. I always use eye drops before bed and in the mornings because I wear contacts. After using this, I would use the eye drops to relieve the redness, but it would make my eyes itch even more. Very uncomfortable. So I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and was happy to find it for sale on Amazon.  It is gentle to sensitive eyes, but still will remove waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  My mother-in-law started using mine and was amazed that it did not irritate her eyes at all.  I highly recommend this eye makeup remover.  It works well even for removing dance recital stage makeup from my daughters- without squirming and squealing!</li>
    <li> The Body Shop Camomile Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Regular - 8.4 fl oz;  Bought This As A Gift For My Sister So I Can Only Imagine That It&#x27;s A Good Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this remover for years and nothing compares to it! It really is gentle to the eye/skin and always cleans thoroughly without leaving residue behind. I use it daily and it lasts a long time! It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Always reliable, removes all types of eye make-up gently, even for my daughter when she has to wear make-up for dance recitals.</li>
    <li> The recipe changed  from cream to thin liquid.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover. It is not harsh and it does not sting my eyes or put a lot of oil on them as other removers do. I use this daily and love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easily removes all eye makeup without irritation or greasy residue.  Been using it for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Haven&#x27;t found anything that works this well![[ASIN:B000K73KCI The Body Shop Camomile Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Regular, 8.4-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This product stings my eyes pretty bad. I expected the &#x27;gentle&#x27; part to be worth paying this for, but in this case its really not. Also, it&#x27;s unable to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye makeup remover for years..It is easy on the eyes and it takes off all face makeup!</li>
    <li> I used this thinking it would be gentle but the next morning I had some red puffy and dry patches under my eyes. It got worse before it got better. I only use my travel size when I&#x27;m on the road. So back on the road I used it again and now it&#x27;s worse then ever. Had to have it happen twice to realize its the makeup remover. Not going to be a third time!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gentle on the eyes, and efficiently removes all the make-up without leaving a greasy residue. It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> Often burns my eyes and displeased that it contains parabens.</li>
    <li> I must have very sensitive eyes, because I am having a negative reaction to this product. I used Clinique and L&#x27;Oreal and Estee Lauder eye makeup remover without issue, but for some reason with this product, my eyes itch, water for several hours, and just generally feel swollen and uncomfortable. I thought at first that it was just because I changed product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now, and sadly, my eyes continue to be red and irritated. It does easily remove all of my eye makeup, so in that regard, it works well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it causes such irritation, I cannot continue to use the product.</li>
