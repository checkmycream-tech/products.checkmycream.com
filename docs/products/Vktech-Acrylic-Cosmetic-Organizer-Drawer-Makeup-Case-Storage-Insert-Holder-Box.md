      <li>(which liked to hide from me)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For the price these are nice</li>
      <li>All in all  it is a nice product.</li>
      <li>The drawers don&#x27;t Slide out very easy n</li>
      <li>My husband was able to &amp;#34;patch</li>
      <li>But still able to use it</li>
      <li>Work as it should and also look prety! :)</li>
      <li>Holds a fair amount and does not take up as much surface space as I thought it might/hoped it would for the price.</li>
      <li>return was easy, the product was not what i thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>the items I use daily fit in perfectly, and it&#x27;s made my morning routine so much smoother because everything&#x27;s right at my fingertips</li>
      <li>was concerned how everything would look once I packed it full of cosmetics, but it just looks very organized and neat - about 20 times better than when I had</li>
      <li>my expectation was so much that I thought I can keep so many items</li>
      <li>The quality is surprisingly good for such a lightweight product.</li>
      <li>I wear the most live in the bottom drawer,</li>
      <li>Much easier to clean, too!&lt;br</li>
      <li>By storing my blush and bronzer compacts on their sides, I maximized room in the larger square, so I can fit a sharpener and my BB cream in there as well without it being crowded.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>Feels cheap, Smaller than in picture!</li>
      <li>Very tiny I can barely fit 2 mac compact face powder in a drawer</li>
      <li>my shadow palette, single shadows and a mineral concealer live in the top drawer, and all my brow pencils, eyeliners, lip liners, mascara, lip balm, concealers, fit into the small squares.  </li>
      <li>Although my daughter likes the size of this (small enough to fit on her makeup table), and she was able to organize her makeup nicely, the bottom section came broken.</li>
      <li>It is a tad small, but organized most of my products.</li>
      <li>Nice looking and functional looks small but spacious enough</li>
      <li>Smaller and less sturdy than anticipated but gets most of the job done</li>
      <li>Do not cram the drawers with too many items, as they are hard to close.</li>
      <li>But maybe I&#x27;ll force me to get rid of the old stuff.</li>
      <li>but I really need something larger and taller to hold pencils and brushes.</li>
      <li>as in, much too small to fit all my daily use cosmetics &amp; accessories.  </li>

<li> A little less substantial than I thought it would be.</li>
<li> , I was a little worried until I started loading it up.&lt;br</li>
<li> This has helped me get all the little things off the vanity and put in one place.</li>
<li> Too small.</li>
<li> For the price, it should be at least twice the size.</li>
<li> ; so you can&#x27;t tell, but for the price, I thought the quality was poor.</li>
<li> Overall very unhappy!!</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t invest in one of these sooner!</li>
<li> but not I was disappointed</li>

    <li> I give this 4.5 stars. The quality is surprisingly good for such a lightweight product. It is a tad small, but organized most of my products. Do not cram the drawers with too many items, as they are hard to close. All in all  it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Smaller and less sturdy than anticipated but gets most of the job done</li>
    <li> Nice looking and functional looks small but spacious enough</li>
    <li> The drawers don&#x27;t Slide out very easy n they get stuck. It&#x27;s perfect for my makeup though</li>
    <li> Does what I need for it to.  A little less substantial than I thought it would be. Holds a fair amount and does not take up as much surface space as I thought it might/hoped it would for the price.</li>
    <li> Too small. But still able to use it</li>
    <li> Very nice,  lots of room for my lipstick and makeup brushes!!</li>
    <li> Very tiny I can barely fit 2 mac compact face powder in a drawer</li>
    <li> This was a surprise in appearance.  The measurements given are correct, just hard to picture the overall size.  The drawers are not very deep, but deep enough for a compact.  This has helped me get all the little things off the vanity and put in one place.</li>
    <li> return was easy, the product was not what i thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> For the price these are nice but I really need something larger and taller to hold pencils and brushes.</li>
    <li> my expectation was so much that I thought I can keep so many items but not I was disappointed</li>
    <li> Although my daughter likes the size of this (small enough to fit on her makeup table), and she was able to organize her makeup nicely, the bottom section came broken. My husband was able to &amp;#34;patch it up&amp;#34; so you can&#x27;t tell, but for the price, I thought the quality was poor.</li>
    <li> Work as it should and also look prety! :)</li>
    <li> When I first got the package the box looked small...as in, much too small to fit all my daily use cosmetics &amp; accessories.  I have to admit, I was a little worried until I started loading it up.&lt;br /&gt;The necklaces &amp; earrings I wear the most live in the bottom drawer, my shadow palette, single shadows and a mineral concealer live in the top drawer, and all my brow pencils, eyeliners, lip liners, mascara, lip balm, concealers, fit into the small squares.  By storing my blush and bronzer compacts on their sides, I maximized room in the larger square, so I can fit a sharpener and my BB cream in there as well without it being crowded.&lt;br /&gt;All the items I use daily fit in perfectly, and it&#x27;s made my morning routine so much smoother because everything&#x27;s right at my fingertips and I&#x27;m  not hunting through my cosmetic bag to find my brow pencil or eyeliner.  (which liked to hide from me)&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned how everything would look once I packed it full of cosmetics, but it just looks very organized and neat - about 20 times better than when I had 2 different make up bags sitting out.  Much easier to clean, too!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t invest in one of these sooner!</li>
    <li> This organizer is smaller than I expected but works well.</li>
    <li> This is SO TINY. Overall, it is the size of my shoe. The average woman would need about 5 of these to hold her makeup. For the price, it should be at least twice the size. Do not get it.</li>
    <li> Appears bigger in the picture. But maybe I&#x27;ll force me to get rid of the old stuff.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap, Smaller than in picture! Overall very unhappy!!</li>
