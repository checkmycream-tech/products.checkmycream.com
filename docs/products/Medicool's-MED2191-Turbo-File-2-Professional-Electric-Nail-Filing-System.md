<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price for this drill!</li>
    <li> This works great. I&#x27;ve used other and they seemed to bog down and stop. This is powerful and speed adjustable....perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as she does her own acrylic nails.  The unit is of quality construction and assembly.  Variable and reversible speeds along with a very secure twist-lock chuck to hold the bits.  It is a bit pricy, but as with most tools, you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Bought this file after looking at a whole slew of them.  I decided to go with a more expensive professional model because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of a lesser quality file. I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.  It hardly has any vibration when you use it; and is VERY easy to operate.  It&#x27;s so gentle that my dog lets me use it on her nails...yes, I change the sanding band &amp; sterlize everything before I use it on me ;).  I was a little sad that it didn&#x27;t come with more than just the mandrel bit and a few sanding bands; only because the product description didn&#x27;t exactly specify, but I found them online &amp; very easy to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had several Manicure Filing Systems over the Years.  My first was a Nail Genie.  Good machine.  Mine is 30+ years old, but limited nail bits and the newer Nail Genie bits won&#x27;t fit the old Nail Genie.  My next one was a SuperNail Deluxe Hand Held.  Not expensive and you get what you pay for.  Plastic on the hand held broken, so I have the bits now, but no machine to insert them into.  Then I bought a Red.  Had multiple bits, but again, specific to the RED machine.  Not very expensive and that being said, doesn&#x27;t have good power.  I think I bought it to use on my heels and feet to remove the cracks, etc...no enough power to do that.   The Nail Genie is still working fine, but I only have 4 bits and the emery board tip works the best.  I wanted more variety to get cuticles, etc.  The Nail Genie currently sold, has different tips that are used, but won&#x27;t fit my old Nail Genie.  Good marketing strategy to get me to buy newer model.  That would be a minimum of $149 and then add on extra bits.    So, that led me to start investigating other machines.  I almost went for the SuperNail for $140, but then remembered that little hand held SuperNail and lost confidence in the quality of the plastic.  Had good reviews, but I still opted for the Medicool Turbo File 2.      This Medicool System uses 3/32 bits so that in itself gives much more versatility.  I love the variable speed feature.  Allows me to slow it down to get close to the edge, but not hit the cuticle.  Speed it up when I need it.  None of the others did that.  My old Nail Genie has High and Low and maybe that is the same, but I like the control.  I can slow it down and stay on that spot longer and get the results I want, without the injury to the skin area.  It comes with a great DVD that shows you how to use the various bits and that was helpful to me.  I really needed to know which tip to use for the manicure, pedicure, cuticles area, shaping the nail, getting the cuticles, etc.    It comes with a 2 or 3 bits, but I went to the Medicool Web site and ordered both the Manicure and Pedicure bits.  They are a little pricey, but I love them.     I bought a small drill that was on sale at Christmas time...some come on sale...the drill sucked,  no power, but it had 3/32 bits that came with it.  I naturally saved them..  I just added them to my collection for my Dremel.   Well, they have never been used, so I pulled them out and added them to my Manicure/Pedicure collection.  An from the DVD from Medicool, I have some idea as to what I could  use them for.  At least I have the option with this Medicool system which uses the 3/32 bit size to try them out.       So, at this point in time, I love this Medicool Turbo 2 Nail Filing System.  I would recommend it to a family member or friend.        Again, I like the 3/32 bits.  I like the variable speed and it has good power that I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  Small handle to you can manipulate the tool easily, especially when doing your own nails and toe nails.</li>
    <li> I am just starting into nails and I find it a great machine, my teacher said that is the best file in the market, it does what you need to and love that is 110v - 240v, very soon I will be using this in Europe.  package was great and arrived on time for my lessons.</li>
    <li> NICE, COMPACT AND EASY TO USE MACHINE.  THE ONLY REASON WHY FIVE STARS WAS NOT GIVEN TO THE \\&quot;TURBO FILE 2 SYSTEM\\&quot; IN MY REVIEW IS BECAUSE THE PICTURE ON THE ACTUAL BOX THE UNIT COMES IN AS WELL AS THE INSIDE DIRECTIONS AND ALONG WITH THE ACTUAL PICTURE ON AMAZON&#x27;S WEB SITE ALL SHOW THAT THERE IS A BLACK SWITCH ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH IS THE \\&quot;FORWARD, ON/OFF, REVERSE\\&quot; WITH THE ON/OFF BEING IN THE MIDDLE POSITION.  THE UNIT RECEIVED BY ME (ALSO ORDERED A REPLACEMENT UNIT DUE TO THIS DISCREPENCY)DID NOT HAVE A BLACK COLORED SWITCH BUT HAD A GRAY COLORED SWITCH WHICH WAS ONLY FOR \\&quot;FORWARD &amp; REVERSE\\&quot; AND NOT \\&quot;ON/OFF\\&quot;.  THE ON/OFF HAS TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE ROUND KNOB ON THE FRONT LEFT FACE OF THE UNIT AND THIS KNOB ALSO CONTROLS THE UNIT&#x27;S SPEED.  A LITTLE HARDER TO KEEP IT AT A SET SPEED DUE TO HAVING TO FIND THE SPEED AGAIN AFTER TURNING THE KNOB TO THE OFF POSITION.  THE BLACK SWITCH WHICH IS SHOWN ON THE BOX &amp; DIRECTIONS WOULD BE EASIER TO OPERATE.  THE SECOND UNIT ALSO WAS THE SAME (NO BLACK SWITCH) AND WHEN I CALLED MEDICOOL DIRECTLY THE REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED ME THAT THE UNIT WITH THE NICE BLACK SWITCH WAS AN OLDER MODEL(?) WHICH WAS NOT MADE ANYMORE BUT THEY WERE USING THE OLD MODEL&#x27;S BOXES &amp; DIRECTIONS FOR THE NEW MODELS.  REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MAKE SENSE TO ME BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.  OTHER THAN THIS ONE ISSUE I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE MEDICOOL MED2191 TURBO FILE 2 SYSTEM TO ANYONE FOR HOME OR BUSINESS USE (BUSINESS USE IS WHAT I USE THIS SYSTEM FOR).</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for my dog&#x27;s nails.  I tried the Pedipaw (or whatever it was called) and the thing was garbage.  This product is strong enuf for dog&#x27;s nails AND it saved me from cutting too far and making my poochie bleed.</li>
    <li> It worked for 2.5 months. Then it stopped working. Warranty does not cover a shipping cost (either way). I am pretty sure the power adapter gone bad - for some reason Medicool decided to go with proprietary socket, may be so we have to order the replacements from them.</li>
    <li> I would have give  minus 5 stars if I could used  it wonce and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I am a disabled individual and had to rely on people clipping my nails for. For the most part this went well but every so often my fingertips would get clipped, causing eventual scars which then made it hard to get a close cut. Not only does this product not cause any type of injury even if you have low dexterity or tremors I am now able to keep my nails as short as I want and do it on my own, it&#x27;s very gratifying even doing the smallest personal needs that other wise would not be able to do.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT tool for keeping your nails short. I&#x27;ve been handicapped for over 20 years. \\&quot;It&#x27;s a nice feeling to accomplish this task again!!\\&quot;    iSpoon&#x27;r v2010</li>
    <li> Hi I don&#x27;t reserved my nail drill</li>
    <li> This is an excellent nail filing system.  Wonderful for thick finger nails or if you tend to do a lot of nails.  This quickly files down nails without the time and struggle filing by hand.  The system is also compact and stores easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Amazon  because it was hard to clip my toe nails and if I don&#x27;t they cut through and ruin my sox. I wanted to keep them trimmed better than I could with a clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product proved to be very effective. It files down my toe nails. It is electric with a wand that has a revolving sander that does the job. I can not only file down the length so they don&#x27;t cut into my socks but I can also sand my toe nails down so the tops are not so thick. What&#x27;s more, I can sand the dead skin where my foot has rubbed on the inside of my shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can used to round the toe nail and make it look better than it would if I used a clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is easy to use. Connect the parts, plug it in, turn it on and incrementally adjust the speed of the sander so it does not get out of control from going to fast. It&#x27;s easy to store. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It&#x27;s very sturdy and I expect it to last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my very first set of an electric nail filing system, so it took me a while to figure out.  Once I got it figured out, it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I wish they would include the part number of the bits they used as demonstrated in the DVD.  I would like to order extra bits, but it&#x27;s hard to know which are the right ones from the list of products included in the kit.</li>
    <li> I ordered this little guy when I was truly in a pinch; my better electric file bit the dust at a really bad time.  This drill makes a decent back-up, and I&#x27;ve found it travels well~ I&#x27;ve had clients who&#x27;ve had surgery and have needed me to come to them.  But, this drill is loud, vibrates a lot (if you&#x27;re used to a nice smooth ride), and doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
    <li> It really does a great job n my nails and I adore it!</li>
    <li> Sounds like there was some broken screws inside not happy about it:/</li>
    <li> I work in a salon. We do quite a bit of prepping natural nails and shaping of acrylics, which we accomplish with e-files. We use a Upower battery operated model, which is smooth as silk, and a cheaper Adventek, which is also amazingly smooth for a less than $200 file. I didn&#x27;t have $200 or $300 to invest in an e-file for my nail tech classes, so after reading the glowing reviews here on AMazon, for the Medicool Turbo File II, I purchased one, and brought it to the salon to take it for a spin. It&#x27;s possible that I received a bad unit, I guess, but my Turbo File II was so noisy and vibrated so uncontrollably, that it made for dangerous work around the cuticle area, when using carbide bits, and was just downright unwieldy to use on customers.  After using the Upower and the Adventek, which we use in the salon, perhaps I was expecting a little too much from such an inexpensive unit.  Well, whatever the case may have been, this file is simply not constructed as solidly as other units I&#x27;m familiar with.  Even my old Dremel hobby grinder is built with ball-bearings around the rotating shaft, and for the motor, has its own dedicated iron-core armature wrapped in copper wire, with replaceable brushes.  These cheap Medicool Turbo File units seem to use a cheap electric motor at the back of the unit, like you find in one of those cheap battery powered hand-held fans, and rather than ball-bearings, they instead use brass bushings, kept under tension by a steel spring. Also, the chuck locking mechanism is constructed entirely from plastic, and seems kinda sloppy, as the file tends to vibrate more or less, with no regularity, each time the chuck is opened and then locked back into place and then powered on.  This hardware would be fine, for a remote controlled car, or a hand-held fan, even, but not for a machine designed to perform potentially dangerous tasks with safety and smooth-operating precision (which this file definitely does not).  I can understand how this file would befine for use as a pedicure unit, where the tech is simply thinning calluses, or simply for smoothing their dog&#x27;s nails, rather than shaping the sensitive cuticle area of a human being&#x27;s acrylic fingernail, with a carbide barrel bit.  So in my opinion, if you&#x27;re looking for a backup file, or something to use during a pedicure, when the standard pumice stone or foot file won&#x27;t do the trick, or as the reviews suggest, something to smooth the edge of puppy&#x27;s claws, then go ahead and buy the Turbo file 2.  But if your clients are used to a smooth operator for use on their synthetic nails, like the Kupa, Erica&#x27;s, or even the more expensive Medicool units, then neither you nor your client will be happy with this file.</li>
    <li> Had 3 thick toenails and needs to file them down. I use medicine for a fungus, and file them once a week to keep inducing the liquid medicine.  Works quickly for file down - hand filing would take too long.</li>
    <li> I kept seeing these with expensive price tags and so when I saw one that wasn&#x27;t quite as pricey I bought it. Well first off this thing is noisy and it sounds like its old or worn out. Secondly I was hoping that this would have the power that my other machines didn&#x27;t have but of course it doesn&#x27;t. On the brighter side they did send me a nice quantity of sanding bands, the machine is a lot smaller then some of my others and lighter too. It has that handy little rest spot on top of machine for the file itself rather than one of those plastic ones that you set up beside the machine. So I decided to keep it - honestly I&#x27;m just really bad at returning things on time.</li>
    <li> Price is great. Meant for personal home or travel use, not meant to use for work as a nail technician. Makes noise as tho it has loose parts and can break easily but that is not concerning if just for personal use, only if for repeated or prolonged use. I&#x27;m not a nail technician so I&#x27;m happy with it. Handle is thick in hand &amp; slightly heavy so could give a nail technician hand cramps with repeated prolonged use. It works for me &amp; is light enuf to travel with to repair nails when out of town</li>
    <li> I got this for doing my own nails. It works GREAT and was easy to figure out. I LOVE mine. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This makes doing nails a lot faster...I love this product!  I would recommend to everyone!  I absolutely love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am a beginner nail tech and I have tried other nail drills before.  This drill, so far, is the best I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little gizmo that is absolutely perfect for the task at hand...or rather, &amp;#34;at foot,&amp;#34; since I bought this to trim my elderly mother&#x27;s extremely thick toenails.  It works like a charm! I no longer need fear cutting her toes with the toenail clippers. (YIKES!)  I particularly appreciate the ease with which one can adjust the speed. I am far from a pro, when it comes to doing pedicures, but this little grinder made a normally unpleasant job enjoyable (well, almost, anyway)!  The only thing that I would recommend getting that does not come with the item are extra (replacement) sanding belts, as it only comes with two.  Also, I would advise wearing a dust mask while using the device, because it does make a lot of dust. (Fortunately, I thought to do this, before I used it on my mother&#x27;s nails. If I hadn&#x27;t, I would have been pretty grossed out!)  This is a great piece of equipment that I expect to be using for a long, long time, as it is very well-constructed and sturdy, for something so (relatively) inexpensive.  I would definitely recommend it to other home users!</li>
    <li> as advertised but I bought a set of &#x27;bits&#x27; online at a lower price</li>
    <li> Blinking motor signal within a couple months. Was taken care of and died randomly. But I liked it while it lasted.</li>
    <li> This electric file works just fine. The twist lock chuck is easy to use to change bits. With the proper bits you can effectively use it on acrylic nails to shape them, thin them out and clean under the nails to remove excess acrylic.  I have used this machine numerous times and have had no problems with it. It is not excessively noisy and the hand piece is light and feels comfortable to use with no vibration.</li>
    <li> This nail file is used professionally and it&#x27;s easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t come with the bits (only a few filing ones and an attachment for those, plus a rounding tip), you  have to buy those separately. It has an adjustable knob for speed, plus a button to reverse the direction of the file which is handy. It has an useful DVD narrated by a guy from Jersey that will crack you up, but it&#x27;s worth watching because it tells you what each bit can do. It would be nice if the drill was operated with a foot pedal but for the price it&#x27;s a great buy to make your filing easy when doing acrylics or gels.</li>
    <li> This is a good investment if you have thick toenails. Machine is easy to use and I like that the speed can be adjusted.  I am mechanically  challenged and nowhere does it explain how to open the drill to get the bits in. I tried and suddenly had 5 pieces in my hand. Had to wait until a male friend could help and explain. This is the reason for 4 stars. Otherwise a great machine</li>
    <li> The blue light doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> Came brand new as showed , works perfectly, great deal , great work tool. It is the best !  I recomend it 100% . FAST SHPPING also :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> If you want a professional quality nail filer but pay half the price the Medicool&#x27;s Turbo File is the way to go. It is lightweight,  and the nail stylist can do the same quality style and designs like in the shop. All you have to do is go to Ebay and buy the 3/32 drill bits and sanding bits and you are ready to make that extra money. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good!! It was on time even earlier, and until now its working great realy like my machine im happy with it it works supper great fast easy :)</li>
    <li> Literally, I just brought a nail salon into my house by buying this product.  It is easy to use and fun to use!  I love it.  It deserves 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again</li>
    <li> If your looking for a filing system for home, this is the one. Very good price. The power is quite sufficient for those thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> I have had my drill nwo for a few months it may not be the best drill on the market as we all woudl know that anyways but I have had no problems with it it works excellent, it was packaged well so there were no problems with any shipping.  I am definitly happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have this exact file in my nail tech kit and I love it.  It&#x27;s very quiet and works great.  A great file for the money.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased with two uses in mind:  The first to use in at home pedicures and the second to handle the task of shortening toenails for two spoiled dogs.  The Nail Filing System comes with various tips to use to perform different tasks.  I also ordered a pack of 100 medium bit sanding covers in order to be able to do a better job keeping the toenails of two small dogs short and smooth.  This system handles my feet and their feet perfectly.  It keeps my feet smooth with a callus remover tip (because I insist on going barefoot) and it is quiet and smooth enough to use on our dogs.  They easily allow me to shorten and smooth their toenails and aren&#x27;t afraid of the instrument at all.  The unit appears to be solid and well made and doesn&#x27;t vibrate in my hand when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It started to stall only after the third use. It get&#x27;s a blinking light and then stops. I&#x27;ve managed to get it going but time will tell. When it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s a great product. I hope it&#x27;s a security devise so it won&#x27;t overheat but Ivé found nothing on the instructions, the manual or online about this issue. I will repost as soon as I try it again.</li>
    <li> This little drill is a very good quality for the price. I have used it for 1 year now, once every 3-4 weeks for my gel nails and it works great! I love the fact you can switch directions which is really important when you are doing your own nails. Doesn&#x27;t vibrate much and it sits comfortable in the hand. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received my parcel exactly the day my order said I would!  Excellent tool!  I will certainly order again!</li>
    <li> my life is complete now..thank you!</li>
    <li> Right after the 30-day return policy expired, the reverse stopped working...and it was only the 2nd time I used it. If you do your own nails, you definitely want both directions to work.</li>
    <li> This works as good as I hoped it would!</li>
    <li> My nail technician uses one of these and I decided to get one to clean under my nails between manicures.  These artificial nails are great, but they do get to looking bad underneath between manicures.  Just a few seconds with this tool has them looking white and fresh as the first day again.</li>
    <li> Nice System and not noisy at all!</li>
    <li> My wife loves how easy it is to use and how well it works</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase. The chuck to remove and install the drill bit was a little hard to figure out at first, but once I got it, the file worked great. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Bought as a beginning drill set after I got out of school !! great deal for a beginner. still use it now.&lt;br /&gt;have been out of school for 2 years !!!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is...this product is AMAZING..it works super GREAT....got it on friday and tried it on saturday night ...its easy to use and it did my acrylics realllllyy well..I LOVE IT and i recommend it to anyone looking for an electric nail file</li>
    <li> This filing system is well worth the money. The customer service that I received was excellent. If you ever consider purchasing an electric filing system, this is it!!</li>
    <li> Great machine, works much better than a few others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous but when I received it it was so easy to put together. and was so easy to control. and did it&#x27;s job to prep the nail before acrylic. I love it!!!! i would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The best drill I ever bought love it and it dose not get hot and it is nice and quite</li>
    <li> This is a very good home tool...would recommend it to anyone that has time to do their own nails. ...it was perfect for my thick nails. .easy to use. ..</li>
    <li> The machine works very well and has a dial to control the number of oscillations.  It could stand to be a little more powerful in certain instances, but then you&#x27;d have a Dremel that would be intimidating and maybe scary...  This machine is easy to use and precisely direct with your fingers.  Be sure to get the attachments separately.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Can&#x27;t imagine why I was hesitant in the first place. So happy that I made the investment  Use on ugly toenails. Makes them look flat and normal.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and about 50% cheaper than local shopping</li>
    <li> Was blown away by this product. Would recommend to anyone bneeding a nail drill.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this item! The price is amazing, considering it is often what professionals use. I was in debate on purchasing a higher Medicool model, but instead chose to give this one a try. So happy I did! For me: It is great with acrylic application and callous removal. It does not over heat, nor stop when pressure is applied (in comparison to the pink cheaper models listed on Amazon and Ebay - not a part of the Medicool line). I can change speeds (I don&#x27;t even go to max speed!), and there is a reverse file option. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> It is very good, its very strong,&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and nicely adjust to the speed you want.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Don&#x27;t ever get that lil $11 one. Thought i was doing something wrong But it was the cheep drill! This one the best.</li>
    <li> The machine works well and has the necessary parts to go with it. I ordered more pieces separately and the are all a standard fit. I&#x27;m sill learning what all the pieces do.</li>
    <li> NOt at all what I expected the battery one that i had yrs. ago was better than this one so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails at home. I have had this for at least two years now. Still works great!</li>
    <li> Great investment and awsome nail file. Worth every penny of your money. Doing my nails are sooo much quicker now that I have this drill. Filing my nails down used to take hours but now with Medicools MED2191 Turbo File drill, it takes no time! It files the acrylic down quick! Doesnt take long to file and shape acrylic nails. So much easier than manually doing my nails with a finger nail file. I would highly recomend this drill to any customer looking do acrylic nails, it could even be used in a nail salon.</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable speed of this machine and it appears to be well made.  It&#x27;s quiet and the hand tool  is easy to hold and use.  Has helped me with some home pedicures and I am happy.</li>
    <li> My wife say that this product is the best thing since they invented nail filers. It works well and very fast. Since you can control the speed it makes it easier to not damage your fingers or toes. It is sturdy and well made. It will save money too since you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I have had this drill for about 4 years now.  I&#x27;ve used it off and on, and it gets the job done!  I had a couple of problems with opening it to get the bit inside, which seems to happen when it gets dirty.  So far, tapping it to get the nail dust out has alleviated that problem.  Overall, a good product!</li>
    <li> Be careful if you have never used one of these before, or seen one used, or had one used on you. There is plenty of room for injury with this item. However, All that said It does a great job on Nails, cuticles, calluses, feet, and hands.  The DVD it comes with IS informative and you SHOULD watch it. I use this item every month. It was totally worth the cost And has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for shaping toenails on Dogs that have fear of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Most Dogs at the Dog Spa sleep through their toenail &amp;#34;Pawdicure&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I reveived two of these for Christmas, 2013. Received training at Emory University &amp; in Seattle with an awesome podiatrist, to receive license as Certfied Foot &amp; Nail Care nurse through the WOCN. I have used the drill now for almost a year,and have been extremely pleased. Great product. Bits are reasonably priced. Use to perform medical toenail debridement. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Medicool&#x27;s MED2191 Turbo File 2 Professional Electric Nail Filing System. Good Machine and it is easy to use and connect the parts,</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this nail filing system. I ordered extra tips and they work good.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than battery operated ones and like the speed control and reverse control.</li>
    <li> Just love my turbo file</li>
    <li> Used this same model for over a year in my foot nurse business. So I bought this back-up</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!!  No more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The bit sizes received don&#x27;t work and you can&#x27;t unlock the device to put the bits in there. She was really looking forward to doing her own nails. Unfortunately, by the time she received the gift and tried to use the device the warranty wasn&#x27;t valid to return. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Nice little drill. Works as stated. Drill does not get hot after long use. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well, the only thing is I have to push the cord in to make it work properly, I do not know why.</li>
    <li> worked for 2 minutes - then stopped spinning - it&#x27;s only job is to spin - wow ! - I would have to say - do not buy !</li>
    <li> Within about 5-8 uses it just stopped working all together. The motor is trying to work but it stopped spinning.</li>
    <li> However I didn&#x27;t realize this product didn&#x27;t come with the bits as shown in the picture. Picture needs to be changed, it is misleading!</li>
    <li> i read tons and tons of reviews trying to decide on one!  this works great for me, i use it just for me though, not a salon, works great for the do it at home!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a month now, but must say so far so good. I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech and just learning to use the drill effectively &amp; this allows me to practice with no problems. Didn&#x27;t want to purchase one of the more expensive ones just to practice &amp; learn. WORTH THE PURCHASE</li>
    <li> I love this drill bit it wasn&#x27;t green like in the picture :( it&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s my first drill so I love it a lot :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife because she just recently graduated with her Nail Tech. Degree! This was the same product that was in a Supply Store for Nail Techs. This item was 20 dollars cheaper than the one in the store. I was trying to save money and instead got a horrible damaged product in return. My wife turned it on and made this loud noise that drills should not make. Then it shut off on her without even doing anything, and then it would not even turn on. Just be careful if you decide to order this. Chances are you will have to return it. I would not recommend this product to anyone at all. Highly disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Ths works great!  I&#x27;m not a professional and don&#x27;t use it everyday but when I use it, it works just fine.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews unless you are using it professionally?  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as an electric pedicure file, not for buffing or shaping acrylic nails.  When it arrived, I discovered, as some reviewers have cautioned, that the tool I needed was not included. I decided to try what was there, but the printed directions gave little indication of what to use for filing (as opposed to buffing, shaping acrylic nails, etc.) and the DVD that&#x27;s included was no help at all--more of an infomercial for acrylic nail-wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found that, contrary to what the product page says, I couldn&#x27;t do simple toenail filing with the attachments that were included, I called the company and ordered the one I needed for $15. I didn&#x27;t mind that too much--I  understand that the machine is really intended for professionals, and the company can&#x27;t include all the tools a professional might need--and the company&#x27;s customer service was very good.  But I assumed that if it included everything a professional would need, it would certainly include what an ordinary user would require for basic things like filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the new attachment came two weeks later and I tried to remove the existing tool and install the one I had ordered, I couldn&#x27;t do it; I also couldn&#x27;t get the previous one back into the drill bit again.  Since Amazon&#x27;s return window was about to expire, I decided to return the machine rather than struggle with it any longer.  (Actually, the window had just expired, but when I called Amazon and explained that the delay was really due to the product page&#x27;&#x27;s failure to explain that some additional tools would probably need to be ordered, the rep arranged for the return--bravo, Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nonprofessional user with simple needs, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who just wants to file their fingernails or toenails. I&#x27;m keeping the diamond pedicure file bit I ordered separately because it&#x27;s the same bore (1/32\\&quot;) as the ones used in the $10 electric nail file sold by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and should last a long time. Medicool actually makes a similar one that&#x27;s on the Amazon website, though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive.  Perhaps Medicool should state on the product page that not all tools that might be needed by ordinary users are included, and that this is really intended for professional?</li>
    <li> I have used this drill for a long time and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandaughter who is going through cosmatolgy school. She LOVES it!! She can get nails done 3Xs faster!</li>
    <li> I bought this drill for half the price shown everywhere else....product was delivered on time and is very easy to use....love it!</li>
