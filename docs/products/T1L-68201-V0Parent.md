      <li>I also love the tube, keeps the germs away from not having to dig my finger into a jar.</li>
      <li>Wish it were more creamy.</li>
      <li>B000ORV3NC Weleda Skin Food, 2.5 Ounce]] which smells wonderful &amp; works beautifully (especially since I am a RN &amp; wash my hands maybe 100 times a day when I am at work ...)</li>
      <li>Love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I like the idea of this cream, but it always leaves a greasy film on top of my skin, feels more like it smothers my pores, instead of soaking in and adding moisture.</li>
      <li>but so do many Aveeno products.</li>
      <li>Feels more like sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love the texture it gives to my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I needed a more moisturizing face cream for the winter and this cream moisturizes without the grease.</li>

      <li>This is the BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve found in a very long time.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that does not feel greasy or break out sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>(although, I would pay more if I needed to get these fabulous results).</li>
      <li>A really lovely, light cream for day or night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great balancing cream, it really soothes and is mild.</li>
      <li>What a dream come true!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product I feel good about using because it&#x27;s not full of synthetic chemicals, which is a real bonus.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!!&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I use this daily, love it, love it ,love it!  </li>
      <li>This cream is light and soothing...great for day or night.  </li>
      <li>Since Amazon had Weleda Almond Soothing Cream available via Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
      <li>; I am allergic to peanuts and over the years they have changed some of their creams to peanut oil like their wonderful face balm that i used to use when I went snowshoeing or used on harsh weather hikes ...</li>
      <li>I use this with a thicker eye concealer for smooth application.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has skin sensitivity of any kind.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin and this is simply the best product.</li>
      <li>This is by far THE BEST facial cream</li>
      <li>When I tried Weleda I experienced absolutely no burning,  itching,  watery eyes, or breakouts.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and it leaves my skin really nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I love this even thought I don&#x27;t use it too much these days</li>
      <li>love Weleda products and love that they are pure and high quality</li>
      <li>on smooth, never irritating (to my dry &amp; sensitive skin), and it moisturizes beautifully!</li>
      <li>The smell is mild and pleasant to me and fades after the cream has time to sinks in.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for sensitive skin, never clogs pores, leaves skin dewy soft and radiant, even in the harshest of windy winter days, yet light enough to pair with sunscreen in the summer.</li>
      <li>I am not this would be ideal for someone who may have really dry skin as the cream may not be moisturizing enough.</li>
      <li>The only thing is I wish it was a bit more moisturizing because I used so much of it so quickly</li>
      <li>I think this moisturizer works pretty well for my type of skin.</li>
      <li>Overall, if the price is okay for you</li>
      <li>I love this product but it does not make enough of a difference to justify the cost.</li>
      <li>It does sooth irritated skin pretty well</li>
      <li>I have dry skin that sometimes looks oily on top and is prone to redness.</li>
      <li>After about an hour the residue is completely absorbed leaving my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Pros: very nice facial cream, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, leaves the skin feeling moisturized for a long time, soothing, non greasy feel, no overpowering scent, save to use on a cotton swab to remove eye make up, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily  </li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way and it smells great, but it&#x27;s pretty spendy for the benefits that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
      <li>Soothes redness gently.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, about the size of a pea.</li>
      <li>A sales rep for Weleda at Whole Foods suggested I try this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and the redness, while not gone completely</li>
      <li>Cons: the price is somewhat considering you don&#x27;t get much at all, but the amount you do get will last you quite a while -- you don&#x27;t need more than a small pea sized amount to cover your face; metal tube makes it hard to get that last bit out and considering the price I don&#x27;t want to deal with product being wasted  Cream is very nice however and feels great on the skin, so I repurchased!!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite facial lotion, especially while pregnant - all natural and no fear of chemicals or additives, and it feels so moisturizing without feely sticky.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is hardly there and it is just the right thickness  to sit on top of my skin and let it all soak in.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes, and this cream does not irritate either.  </li>
      <li>I recommend highly, that sensitive skin sufferers like myself, give this product a try.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It makes my face soft!</li>
      <li>Applied at any other time and you don&#x27;t feel clean (again, like sunscreen).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell (generic lotion smell with slight almond undertone)</li>
      <li>having said that this is lovely and it goes on smooth, I used this when my face is extremely dry, which is not very often as I&#x27;ve stopped using harsh cleansers on my face.</li>
      <li>A little too thick for my taste but overall very good.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it has protected it even during the winter without it being too hea.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this for her sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well, non greasy, soft skin and feels</li>
      <li>I suddenly developed an allergy to ALL of my makeup--everything I&#x27;d always worn, from Olay to Laura Mercier.</li>
      <li>&amp; I get compliments on my skin often ... and people think I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s ...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s super moisturizing and calms my skin down almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try since the ingredients of the two creams were identical except for the order of the two of them (Alcohol and Glyceryl Stearate SE) which means there is more of one than the other proportionally to other ingredients, etc.</li>
      <li>That seems to make a huge difference though as I smelled the alcohol as soon as I started applying the soothing cream (and it was stinging the face where there was even a little open blemish, etc.)</li>
      <li>I found my new go-to facial cream.</li>
      <li>It is a little thick but absorbs pretty well for the most part.</li>
      <li>I trust Weleda and like their phylosophy and actually use also their deodorant, skinfood (wow!), soap and so on.</li>
      <li>I have tried Clinique, Mary Kay, Oil of Olay, Nutrogena, and just about every other reasonably priced product out there with discouraging results.</li>
      <li>Found that despite the richness, it actually helped to clear up my forehead (which tends to be oily) and helped to moisturize my nose and upper cheek.</li>

    <li> I have dry skin that sometimes looks oily on top and is prone to redness. I think this moisturizer works pretty well for my type of skin. It is a little thick but absorbs pretty well for the most part. I don&#x27;t love the smell (generic lotion smell with slight almond undertone) but it&#x27;s also not terrible. I would use this again but it&#x27;s not so good that I think I&#x27;ve found *my* moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used Weleda Almond Intensive Facial Cream but our local store stopped selling it. Since Amazon had Weleda Almond Soothing Cream available via Subscribe &amp; Save I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try since the ingredients of the two creams were identical except for the order of the two of them (Alcohol and Glyceryl Stearate SE) which means there is more of one than the other proportionally to other ingredients, etc. That seems to make a huge difference though as I smelled the alcohol as soon as I started applying the soothing cream (and it was stinging the face where there was even a little open blemish, etc.) Will be switching back to the Intensive Facial Cream or looking for an alternative.</li>
    <li> This is by far THE BEST facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used- even compared to extremely expensive Chanel, Origins and Dr. Hauschka brands! It is perfect for sensitive skin, never clogs pores, leaves skin dewy soft and radiant, even in the harshest of windy winter days, yet light enough to pair with sunscreen in the summer. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Pros: very nice facial cream, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, leaves the skin feeling moisturized for a long time, soothing, non greasy feel, no overpowering scent, save to use on a cotton swab to remove eye make up, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily  Cons: the price is somewhat considering you don&#x27;t get much at all, but the amount you do get will last you quite a while -- you don&#x27;t need more than a small pea sized amount to cover your face; metal tube makes it hard to get that last bit out and considering the price I don&#x27;t want to deal with product being wasted  Cream is very nice however and feels great on the skin, so I repurchased!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day after I use my Nono</li>
    <li> Very nice cream! It makes my face soft! Would highly recommend!!!&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Found out about Weleda when we lived in Germany. Love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is wonderful, even though we live in the Tropics. Absorbs well, non greasy, soft skin and feels good!&lt;br /&gt;Healthy ingredients without nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Only sad the tube is so tiny compared to Germany.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and soothing...great for day or night.  I have very sensitive skin and eyes, and this cream does not irritate either.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I use it every day and it leaves my skin really nice and soft. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I suddenly developed an allergy to ALL of my makeup--everything I&#x27;d always worn, from Olay to Laura Mercier. A sales rep for Weleda at Whole Foods suggested I try this moisturizer. It totally cleared up the burn. No more rash! I also bought the night cream, which works just as well. The only thing is I wish it was a bit more moisturizing because I used so much of it so quickly but that was just because my skin was so parched. As it heals, I&#x27;ll need less of it, I think. I highly recommend it to anyone who has skin sensitivity of any kind.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin moisturzed all day, without making it greasy or clogging my pores. Soothes redness gently. Love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is my nightly face cream -goes on smooth, never irritating (to my dry &amp; sensitive skin), and it moisturizes beautifully!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as a night and morning cream. I love the texture it gives to my face. I also like the smell. It does not aggravate my skin at all. It is a soothing nighttime treat after I cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> Great for cold weather! My skin is usually oily, but after moving to a cold climate, my skin needed a moisturizer. This is a great product that does not feel greasy or break out sensitive skin. I found my new go-to facial cream.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I have sensitive skin and it has protected it even during the winter without it being too hea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new moisturizers as I&#x27;m never sure what will break me out or cause other skin issues. This is the BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve found in a very long time. It&#x27;s a bit heavy for my oily skin so I use it at night but it&#x27;s super moisturizing and calms my skin down almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it does not make enough of a difference to justify the cost. A little bit goes a long way and it smells great, but it&#x27;s pretty spendy for the benefits that I&#x27;ve noticed. It does sooth irritated skin pretty well but so do many Aveeno products. Overall, if the price is okay for you it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Helps with dry skin around your face that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling...I was worried about it being so small but I only apply it to my face every night and it lasts about 3 months.  I dont notice a scent and the texture reminds me of a sunscreen that you have to rub in a little longer than other lotions but does work well.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, love it, love it ,love it!  I&#x27;ve used it for years and years because it is the best!</li>
    <li> It is a nice product but I would not recommend for day time wear.  I wear glasses they are always smeared up from this facial cream.  I would not recommend for anyone who wears glasses because they will be a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> Nice moisture rich product that is not greasy; transaction met expectations</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing. It is also cheaper to buy through here than Weleda&#x27;s on line store.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and need to be careful about what products I am using as I also prone to breakouts. I needed a more moisturizing face cream for the winter and this cream moisturizes without the grease. The cream sinks in and makes my face soft. I don&#x27;t feel like I have goop on my face. I am not this would be ideal for someone who may have really dry skin as the cream may not be moisturizing enough. I also love the tube, keeps the germs away from not having to dig my finger into a jar. The smell is mild and pleasant to me and fades after the cream has time to sinks in.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is non-irratating. Very light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is the only product I can use on my face that won&#x27;t dry it out! Now that I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon, I&#x27;ll never purchase this item in stores again!</li>
    <li> A little too thick for my taste but overall very good.  I just wanted to have something safe for prego.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and so am always looking for a facial cream that soothes and protects but isn&#x27;t harsh.  This one definitely fits the bill and has been my go-to cream for the past year.  My skin feels smooth and soft and the redness, while not gone completely (probably never will be), has definitely abated.</li>
    <li> I have been using Weleda [[ASIN:B000QURQQU Weleda Baby Calendula Face Cream, 1.6-Ounce]] for many years &amp; I get compliments on my skin often ... and people think I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s ... I bought this to try, but it&#x27;s not as thick as I prefer or as the Weleda baby Face Cream ... but it is very nice &amp; I use it on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Weleda products and love that they are pure and high quality; I am allergic to peanuts and over the years they have changed some of their creams to peanut oil like their wonderful face balm that i used to use when I went snowshoeing or used on harsh weather hikes ... one of their best products is their [[ASIN:B000ORV3NC Weleda Skin Food, 2.5 Ounce]] which smells wonderful &amp; works beautifully (especially since I am a RN &amp; wash my hands maybe 100 times a day when I am at work ...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial lotion, especially while pregnant - all natural and no fear of chemicals or additives, and it feels so moisturizing without feely sticky.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 15 years or so. I have a very sensitive skin and this is simply the best product. I trust Weleda and like their phylosophy and actually use also their deodorant, skinfood (wow!), soap and so on. Great stuff !!</li>
    <li> Small yet useful. Feels more like sunscreen. Wish it were more creamy. It applies best right after the shower. Applied at any other time and you don&#x27;t feel clean (again, like sunscreen).</li>
    <li> A really lovely, light cream for day or night. I use this with a thicker eye concealer for smooth application.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from a health food shop and used it when I didn&#x27;t have anything else. Found that despite the richness, it actually helped to clear up my forehead (which tends to be oily) and helped to moisturize my nose and upper cheek. It&#x27;s a great balancing cream, it really soothes and is mild. I use about a pea-size every day. So a little goes a long way, but not as long as some reviews would have you think - it&#x27;s not bottomless...</li>
    <li> My wife loves this for her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning by mixing it into my thick face sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The Almond face moisturizer is the best I have ever encountered in my 40+ years on earth. I have Rosecea and Celiac Sprue Disease. My complexion is a horrible mess with dry, flakey patches and small, inflamed acne in the mix as well. I have tried Clinique, Mary Kay, Oil of Olay, Nutrogena, and just about every other reasonably priced product out there with discouraging results. When I tried Weleda I experienced absolutely no burning,  itching,  watery eyes, or breakouts. The fragrance is hardly there and it is just the right thickness  to sit on top of my skin and let it all soak in. After about an hour the residue is completely absorbed leaving my skin very soft. The package was hurried out to me and my face is very HAPPY!  AMAZON is competitive with the price so you save a couple of bucks (although, I would pay more if I needed to get these fabulous results). I recommend highly, that sensitive skin sufferers like myself, give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I prefer creams over lotions and oils over creams. having said that this is lovely and it goes on smooth, I used this when my face is extremely dry, which is not very often as I&#x27;ve stopped using harsh cleansers on my face. I love this even thought I don&#x27;t use it too much these days</li>
    <li> this cream is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin  and this is the only daily lotion I use. I tend to get breakouts from products but this never causes clogged pores. Definitely worth the price too, as a little goes a long way. I use it daily and only need to buy it 2-3 times a year.</li>
    <li> In the winter my skin gets so dry it hurts. The slightest irritation feels painful. I have red hair and green eyes and all the sensitivity issues that go with it. It&#x27;s often hard to find a simple moistruizer that doesn&#x27;t have harsh ingredients that cause a burning sensation. I tried this because the company has a good reputation and the product is organic. What a dream come true! My skin immediately felt soothed. It is not greasy or overly heavy, though it is thicker than a mositruizer or lotion. But, if you have dry skin, thicker is what you want. But it doesn&#x27;t have that heavy, skin smothering mask feel either. It melts in and feels good. It doesn&#x27;t take much, about the size of a pea. I will continue to use this through the winter, and in the summer, but probably only at night because I have fewer skin issues that time of year. I even used it on my hands and they feel softer, too. This is a very good product I feel good about using because it&#x27;s not full of synthetic chemicals, which is a real bonus. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this cream, but it always leaves a greasy film on top of my skin, feels more like it smothers my pores, instead of soaking in and adding moisture. I&#x27;m now using it as a nightime cream, seems to be its best use.</li>
