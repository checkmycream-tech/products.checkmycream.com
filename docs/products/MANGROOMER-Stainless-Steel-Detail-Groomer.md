<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a decent trimmer until the plastic where it snaps together failed rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> The first one was DOA. Thanks</li>
    <li> very good quality, price was good, works just as described.  very happy with this purchase. nice not cheaply made like some groomers can be.</li>
    <li> My Mangroomer Stainless Steel Detail Groomer functioned just fine for a few months, then stopped working entirely for no apparent reason.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Performs as advertised and attachments are very good and do the job.  stays charged for a long time.</li>
    <li> Did not work , right out of the BOX!</li>
    <li> I use this product several times a week.  Having reached a stage in life that the hair in my nostrils and ears grows at a rate far exceeding the hair on my head I find detail grooming a frequent necessity.  This handy little machine gets the job done with ease.  I also find it very useful in keeping my eyebrows from being my most apparent facial  feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer would get five stars if the eyebrow comb came in more than one size, allowing a choice in length of brow.  Since I shave with a razor daily, the sideburn cutter is a feature that I have no need for.</li>
    <li> This is an all in one grooming device that meets all the expectations it claims. Use it all the time, especially on brows.</li>
    <li> This product was good for about 2 months, then the plastic tab that holds the shaver head to the rest of the unit broke off (on both sides). Now the head will not stay on the unit when screwed in place. It&#x27;s made of a cheap plastic and I am disappointed at the quality of construction and the materials used to build this unit. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> It worked one time. Do Not buy this item!</li>
    <li> Its too expensive for what it does. The quality is equal to the much less expensive ones you can buy at walmart. They both do the job though.</li>
    <li> I love the multiple attachments - especially the one for the eyebrows (really - who thought I&#x27;d need to trim those?)  Feels much sturdier than others I&#x27;ve had too.  Was great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this and another similar one.  This cuts but not well.  It works with one AA battery, and has a nose/ear trimmer which pulls hair and hurts, and two attachments which snap on.  The small shaft rotates in an eccentric which (like a locomotive wheel) makes a back and forth motion, and thats how these get their cutting power.  They cut but need a lot of tries.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, works well!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Philips-Norelco product similar to this one, except that it is one piece without attachments.  So, when I received the Mangroomer for review, my natural inclination was to compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the single AA battery that is required is not included. Since they can be obtained for a very small amount of money, it seemed odd not to just throw one in the box in the factory.  But, I discovered that this device requires a battery with a good charge.  The battery that was still working fine in my Norelco groomer, failed to even start the Mangroomer.  So, undoubtedly they wanted to avoid complaints due to the Mangroomer not working because the \\&quot;new\\&quot; battery was too old and cheap to start it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, once I found a good battery, I discovered that the design of the product is very good. The regular head is well designed to trim any bothersome hairs in the nostril.  In constrast, the Norelco all-purpose head is not as well shaped for that task.  When I changed to the sideburn attachment, the Mangroomer did a fine job there, and also works well on those \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; hairs that sometimes grow in back a little lower than the head hairs.  The motor is suprising strong for a small AA-powered device.  (By the way, I did not test the thinning head, since I have no need for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, while the Norelco groomer is very solidly constructed of heavy materials, and includes a rubber grip, the Mangroomer is constructed using the cheapest brittle plastic usually found in dollar store or promo items.  So, taking the attachments on and off, and taking the battery cover on and off, is far from smooth, and does not inspire confidence in the longevity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - this is an effective product created by a clever designer, and then produced at low cost of very inexpensive materials.  So, it will work quite well at trimming, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few of these nose hair trimmers because--well, let&#x27;s be honest--I need them. I have seen very little difference in the functionality of the machines. They all work well for a while until the motor burns out and then--into the trash they go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; has a cooler name and looks swanky, there isn&#x27;t much else to distinguish it from the other trimmers I have owned.  Pop in a battery and it is raring to go.  It trims all the nose hair out, doesn&#x27;t pinch too hard, and does just what it is supposed to.  It claims to be wet/dry, but so did my [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex]] until it died one day after being used in the shower, so I&#x27;m not going to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this works as well as the others I have owned and I have no complaints.  We will see if it is still around after a year of use. Aside from just looking  and sounding cool, I wish there had been some actual improvements to this \\&quot;Mangroomer.\\&quot;  A charger instead of a battery would be awesome.  A stand to set it on would be great.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer&#x27;s attachments are it&#x27;s best point. The trimmer itself used for ear and nose is much like others I have used. It&#x27;s a very clean and close cut with no pulling or pinching.  The only part that concerns me is the fact that when it remains running for more than a couple minutes, the metal around the top of the Mangroomer becomes hot, not so hot as to burn, but warm enough that my husband doesn&#x27;t like it near his nose and ears. The attachments for trimming eyebrows and neck line really work well, and I like the idea of having all this in one personal groomer. But once again there is a but. The changing of attachments is a simple and easy thing to do, but in the few times I have done this I have had the nose trimmer come apart into two pieces and had to put it back together. Like I said the attachments work very well, I just have my doubts of this product holding up under any kind of regular use. Fine product just needs some work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, you get what you pay for here</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product. The basic groomer does such a poor job, I still use my old groomer. My old one is falling apart and still does a better job. So little of the blade head protrudes on the Mangroomer that it cuts very little and with lots of time and effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these types of groomers and they are always lacking in some way.  Not this one.  This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Piss poor design. I had lot of hope for this product and it let me down. Attachments will break easily; it is cheaply made. I mean, I know its only $12 but this product should be avoided. Not sure if the other products are the same as this is my first time with this company.</li>
    <li> Feels well made, but puils nose-hairs a bit.  Tickles like the devil, I usually use my old one instead.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, and he really didn&#x27;t use it very much.  The nose-hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work anymore since the plastic piece on the inside gets stuck on the base, and after re-attaching it it just doesn&#x27;t work (not a battery issue, the other attachments work).  The most concerning part is that the mangroomer company has not responded to any of my husband&#x27;s emails or attempts to communicate with them.</li>
    <li> This think worked ONE time then died. The motor is completely dead after a single use! Don&#x27;t buy this! The return policy should have been a heads up, but I completely missed it. One of the heads came apart and is now unremovable. Find something from WalMart or Target where they will at least take back stuff that&#x27;s faulty!</li>
    <li> This is a a second review of this product. I originally gave it a one star because the switch on the first one fell apart on the second time I used it. This really upset me, this product seems to be exactly what I was looking for. It is well made, very very solid. I can accept that every product sometimes fails. I have to say that the reason I am updating my review is due to the products customer service. Mangroomer asked me to contact them with my issue. I did explaining the problem and they sent out a new one that I received within a few days. This really impressed me. As far as the product the new one works great. I have a few of these type of products and this one is by far the best one I have. It is built like a tank and all the attachments work great. In conclusion the product is well worth the money and you can&#x27;t beat their customer service. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this for the eyebrow trimmer. The nose hair trimmer is not the greatest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It works, but not that well. I would recommend it for a teen with facial hair for practice not an older man. I purchased it for my boyfriend. It didn&#x27;t give a smooth finish. The motor isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
    <li> great product. lots of power. blades sharp.</li>
    <li> He says he likes it and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> It gets five stars, not because I really love it, simply because it performs as advertised.  No one loves a nose and ear hair clipper. Came on time as advertised, well packaged and was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> I keep looking for the ideal nose trimmer (have had six of them) and this seems as good, or better, than any of them. The additional tools are not useful to me, but seem like a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased  as a Fathers Day gift for my husband to do manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it took some convincing, he tried it reluctantly.  The results were great except this broke after TWO uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasted my money and it&#x27;s even harder to convince him to stick another groomer in his nostrils when this one burned him!  Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> Did not even to get to use it one time, piece o&#x27;crap came broke in box. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK IF YOU WANT TO THROW AWAY MONEY DONATE IT TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY !! LOL</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know when or how, but somewhere along the line my nose and ears started sprouting random hairs that grow stronger than an oak and faster than the Indy 500.  I have tried many ear and nose hair trimmers.  Originally I used a Panasonic trimmer with a slotted head housing an internal spinning blade.  It worked, but often ripped the hairs out instead of cutting them - man that brings a tear to your eye!  So, in order to avoid pain I switched to the Philips-Norelco NT9110 - this one uses a stick that has 1 inch long clipper mechanism.  The P-N is very delicate, and never pinches my skin or rips hairs out, so it is pain free but it also struggles to cut hairs ... mostly it just pushes them around - making a trimming experience pain fee, but 15 minutes long.  So now I have switched to the man groomer and I love it.  It chops with the intensity of the Panasonic, but the blade is sharp enough to actually cut hairs instead of rip them out - really it is the best of both styles.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer tries to be more than just your average nose and ear hair trimmer by coming with multiple attachments for trimming other parts of your body.  Most interestingly is the eyebrow trimmer which would purportedly give you that fresh from the barber look after your brows are carefully trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, the attachments don&#x27;t work particularly well.  After following the instructions I combed my eyebrows and went against the grain as requested.  Not much shaving, what little did happen was patchy.  Overall it wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard circular blade on the other hand seemed powerful and did a good job.  One thing that was missing is a flashlight, a nice feature for trimmers these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need a nose hair trimmer, it does a nice job.  If you are hoping for great attachments, keep looking.</li>
    <li> bought it for my son, he loves it</li>
    <li> Very well made. Does an excellent job of trimming in difficult areas. It is a bit bulkier as compared to other units I have had, but I believe it will last much longer.</li>
    <li> A small piece of plastic on the collar broke and now the attachments won&#x27;t stay fixed in place.  Very lightly used, no reason for it to fail.  Cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this groomer. runs on AA battery and it last a long time.  I hated running out of a charge with my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect grooming tool.</li>
    <li> Great little tool for those hard to reach grooming areas in the nose and ears.  Haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow piece yet, but will update when I do.</li>
    <li> SO CHEAP PRODUCT..DOESN&#x27;T WORK GOOD..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work tossed it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work returned and refunded.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to even give it one star.  took it out of package.  used it for 1 1/2 mins and the blade inside the nose trimmer broke into pieces. You get what you pay for I guess.  Very cheaply made and I would NEVER recommend it.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Fell apart and yanked nose hairs out violently. That can hurt. And it did!</li>
    <li> Good product bu the carry bag leaves something to be desired .... It will not contain all parts.</li>
    <li> I have had the Mangroomer for a while and while I do like the nose hair trimmer I am not quite as enthused with the other cutters. I have found that a weak battery really affects the starting of the unit.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is solid. The body is made of stainless and has a nice weighty feel in my hand. It comes with three different attachments which snap on and off the trimmer in seconds. The first is a hair trimmer for your sideburns and mustache. the second is a trimmer for touching up your neckline between haircuts and it also has a snap on eyebrow trimmer which makes that job foolproof. The third attachment is a rotary trimmer for nose and ear trimming. The trimmer parts are good quality plastic casings with stainless steel blades and they are designed to last. All three trimmer heads exceeded my expectations and do a great job at what they are designed to do. It uses one AA battery ( I&#x27;m still on the first battery / 3 months now) and you can rinse it with water to clean it.  What&#x27;s not to like about this trimmer?</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my eyebrows and it works great for that purpose. Very rugged, and easy to hold while using it.</li>
    <li> Broke after the first few uses.</li>
    <li> Great at first but if you change the heads often, they quickly loose their funcionality as they will not stay on. I bought it in April. Use it once a week for ear, nose and eybrows. Change the heads twice each time. The looseness of the heads became an issue in October. I guess for 12 bucks I should have known.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I needed a new hair trimmer and I liked the specs. I find it to be sturdy, with nice attachments, and it does a very good job trimming those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main trimmer is silver metal and black plastic. The bottom cap comes off to replace the single AA battery. The top part unscrews to change out the three heads: round (for nose and ear canal), flat (for sideburns and hair edges), and eyebrow trimmer (which has a plastic comb covering it). There is also a small brush for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally mention packaging for this sort of item, but in this case it comes in a red plastic package that has form fitted portions for the various attachments, and a clear plastic cover. It is not meant to be a storage (it is cheap and thin), but the design is so good that I think I will keep the trimmer and etc stored in the package. This is important for me because I tend to lose the attachments on this sort of device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use&lt;br /&gt;Round trimmer. This works well for nose hairs and ear canal. I also use it around the edges of the ear instead of the flat trimmer. It takes several passes for this attachment to get all the hairs, but that is pretty much standard for this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat trimmer. This one also works fine for sideburns and other flat areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow trimmer. The interesting thing about this one is the cover; it is clear plastic and snaps over the actual trimmer. The instructions say to comb the eyebrows first with the cover and with the trimmer powered off, and then with power of. This didn&#x27;t work for me - I suppose my eyebrows are not long enough - so I just carefully removed the cover and used the basic trimmer along with a hair comb. It works well enough, but this is one design feature that did not pan out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say this is \\&quot;semi\\&quot; water resistant, but I would not trust this; it does not seem to be waterproof enough for shower use. I need a mirror for this sort of stuff anyway, so it didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has nice attachments, sturdy design, and good operation. Highly recommended.aterproof enough for shower use.

Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was going to be great based on other reviews I read. It&#x27;s not. The nose trimmer is really the only thing about it that my Husband actually likes and uses, unfortunately. Not worth the money in my opinion. Spend the extra $10-20 and get a different/better product. I hate leaving bad reviews, but it&#x27;s honest to our experience with it. Not something I would purchase again. The parts aren&#x27;t sturdy or made to last.</li>
    <li> This product was weak from the start and would bog down during use to the point of a complete stop. (Note: I am not a very hairy guy, nor is my hair very thick.) Assuming it was the batteries, I waited to buy more. That was a mistake since I waited past the point of product return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may as well throw this hardly used product in the trash, (or recycling) because its nothing more than a paper weight. Learn from my mistake, if it acts up AT ALL, do not hesitate to return.</li>
    <li> For the price, this little groomer is pretty freaking nice.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a small bag (could have been a little bigger).</li>
    <li> For a nose and ear hair trimmer, this is almost perfect.  It does a better job of trimming nose and ear hairs than any other product I have tried, ever!  It wasn&#x27;t even close.  That alone would warrant buying this product, but they had to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it, which is where there are some problems.  The included trimmer attachments are largely irrelevant for most people, but since they are there, there has to be a docking port for them too.  The docking port is a weak point.  Attachments don&#x27;t go on easily, and they take a couple of tries to get them on right.  They also made it waterproof.  I&#x27;m not really certain of the advantage of that here, since I don&#x27;t think most people trim their noses in the shower, but because it is waterproof, the switch, cap, and attachments have to be sealed too.  As a result, the power switch usually takes two or three tries to turn on.  It does always work eventually, but if it didn&#x27;t have to be waterproof, it would likely work every time.  I am convinced that the water seal is the reason the attachments are so hard to use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this just for the nose and ear trimmer, and keep in mind that you will have to flick the switch on and off a couple of times to start it, this is a five star item without question.  If you are interested in the additional attachments, well, maybe a four star item then.</li>
    <li> This is a great, affordable man&#x27;s grooming set.  It operates on a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s been using it for about 6 weeks now &amp; says that not only is it easy to use, it really works.  It&#x27;s ESPECIALLY good for trimming nose hair. The motor&#x27;s powerful enough that it powers through the hair without bogging down (actually cutting it) without just \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; at the hair and torturing nasal nerve endings.  Painless nose hair removal is a HUGE plus in any over-50 man&#x27;s book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 heads (a rotary cutter for nose hair &amp; ear hair, a sideburn/hairline trimmer, and an eyebrow trimmer).  The heads are easy to change; just twist gently and pull off one, then twist on another.  A cleaning tool is also included to keep the cutting heads hair-free.  The cap that protects the head while you store it snaps on securely but snaps off easily--no struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel body has a great gripping shape and the on/off button is large and simply slides off or on.  He&#x27;s only used it \\&quot;dry,\\&quot; but this is a wet/dry appliance.  It looks like it will last &amp; has performed great so far.  He has about 4 other nose trimmers we&#x27;ve bought over the years, and this is his hands-down favorite.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a few days until it decided to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;Save your $$$$ and get something decent.&lt;br /&gt;Yes.</li>
    <li> very cheaply made the tops do not stay on. cover is even worse. it&#x27;s too bad they got this product wrong.</li>
    <li> All of the attachments do what they&#x27;re supposed to, although it is often difficult to find the right groove to connect some of the trimmers (particularly the nose trimmer) to the base and make it actually work. Once you find that sweet spot, it works great. Hopefully future revisions of this product will have a better locking mechanism.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when buying this because my hubby doesn&#x27;t like the battery operated groomers, but the previous reviews were favorable, so I bought it.  I gave this to my hubby for Christmas, and he really likes it!  It has all of the essential grroming tools to get the job(s) done.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband on 2-24-14.  It worked great.  He used it once.  It now works only if there is no head on it.  None of the attachments work.  I changed the battery and can watch the little peg spin but if I put a trimmer on it stops.  What a waste of money</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. Works and carries good. I would recommend it to every one. Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> Looks good, too bad it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Maybe it was a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; out of thousands?</li>
    <li> Only because ZERO STARS is not a possibility. Did not work at all (meant to replace old one that worked brilliantly, by contrast), and the SELLER WAS TERRIBLE all around. NO relief. BAD experience.</li>
    <li> Works poorly at best. I don&#x27;t even try to use anything but the nose trimmer because it&#x27;s a waste of time. I own three other trimmers, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. You&#x27;d think that since trimmers look alike, they should perform the same. They don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d attribute all the five star reviews to Vine, since they got them for nothing. I recently purchased a trimmer from ToiletTree Products and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Strong motor, no yanking of hairs, well built with a lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - True to their word (see comments), Mangroomer shipped me a new unit to use due to problems which occurred with my original purchase. I can&#x27;t yet tell if the replacement will prove to be reliable, as I just got it, but so far it is working better than the first. One complaint that hasn&#x27;t changed is the accessory used to trim my mustache is prone to yanking hairs and not very pleasant. Although from the description, it may be useful for sideburns and necklines and not up to the task of thicker mustache hair. The straight cutter attachment does not seem to be a problem in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have updated my rating and added two stars now that I have a working trimmer, and Mangroomer&#x27;s support.  I may add another star in the future if the unit holds up. Due to the discomfort one attachment causes, it will never get that fifth star. But I would now put it on par with other similar trimmers.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have returned this in time to get my money back, it&#x27;s horrible. The packaging and product materials and assembly are like a cheap 80&#x27;s kid toy. I knew then it would suck, but thought to try it just in case, then got busy, and by the time I found it again, figured it was too late to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it once to trim the sides of my mohawk, and it could barely make it through one side well enough to call it quits. And I know my hair isn&#x27;t THAT thick lol! And yes, I was using it correctly. I was a certified dog groomer back in the day, I should have used my dog&#x27;s nine year old Andes clippers after getting the 10 blade sharpened. :P Didn&#x27;t, and still don&#x27;t, have the mirror setup to try such big clippers for the back. I bought this for myself for Xmas hoping to find clippers that would give a perfect line, be lightweight and narrow enough to be maneuverable behind my head in the mirror, and maybe even be good enough to do designs on the sides. Which this looked perfect for. Ah well, the search continues. Any suggestions, ppl, hit me up, thanks!!! I had liked the idea of the add-on in this one that was very narrow, but you could put it 90 degrees to the scalp instead of going side-by-side with the mohawk line, which leaves the higher chance of clipping a long hair, and I don&#x27;t go for the ratty edges look lol - Perfect mohawk line, or none at all!! My cousin&#x27;s kid just shaved my head with his clippers instead when his Mom, my cousin came down with lymphoma and didn&#x27;t want to walk around bald by herself. It&#x27;s now about 7&amp;#34; and I want my mohawk back!!!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims. It works much better than a pair of scissors. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> First off I like this thing. The issue I had was simply my own fault but I wanted to mention it, but put up front it was my error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with a \\&quot;MANGROOMER\\&quot; product was the [[ASIN:B006BNFXHU Mangroomer 1680XL-6 Professional Ionic Hair Dryer for Men]] and I loved it. For a long time I used my wifes blow dryer and she hated it because I would change the setting to cooler air. I got the blow dryer and was impressed with the quality. After months of using it I still am very happy with the Mangroomer brand. That being said I had the opportunity to try out the Detail Groomer. For a long time now I&#x27;ve used individual tools to try to maintain my appearance. I liked the concept of having them all in one universal tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about this though is there is no case, no bag, no way to store the pieces you aren&#x27;t using. So for now they sit in the bottom of my bathroom vanity drawer. When I want to switch a piece I have to fish for it. Would have been great if MANGROOMER included some accessory storage method. Because of this I&#x27;m taking off a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the issue I had. My old eyebrow trimmer had an adjustable guide and when not in use had a plastic cap. Well, one morning half asleep I thought I&#x27;d try this thing out, my own fault and pulled the plastic cap off and wiped it across half of my eyebrow... Problem is there is no plastic cap, that&#x27;s actually a guide. So I essentially shaved off half of my eyebrow. Fortunately for me it didn&#x27;t get it all, just really thinned it out.  I liked that it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to completely cut the hair, but at the same time that is it&#x27;s job. Because of that I knock off another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the nose hair trimmer and it grabbed a few hairs at first, was a little painful but after a second I was good to go whereas my old trimmer never caused pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the sideburn hair trimmer yet, but I would imagine it&#x27;s the same, decent but not great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an all in one set, I&#x27;d look at this as a contendor. But understand there is no storage tray or bag so you&#x27;ll have pieces laying around, and it takes several passes to fully shave off an eyebrow (thankfully it doesn&#x27;t do it in 1!)/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an all in one set, I&#x27;d look at this as a contendor. But understand there is no storage tray or bag so you&#x27;ll have pieces laying around, and it takes several passes to fully shave off an eyebrow (thankfully it doesn&#x27;t do it in 1!)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he has no complaints. The price is very reasonable and it works great.</li>
    <li> Kind of cranky with battery connection, often have to jiggle or re-screw head to make it go -- on the other hand I&#x27;ve used it almost daily, as I use it to trim mustache more than anything else, and it&#x27;s done fine so far for the price.</li>
    <li> The attachments do not work.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good one for a while this did the trick. I like all the attachments and use them all.</li>
    <li> Gift giving for adult sons is a challenge. Because two of them have facial hair this was a fantastic idea! Really does a neat job.</li>
    <li> was delivered on time, using for more than month already, no complaints yet. does it&#x27;s job perfectly! i think this is good quality product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lettng my hubby do this review, as he uses it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be frank, I&#x27;m not a fan of many multi-function items like this one.  I find that usually, they are great at their primary function, but the secondary functions are not so hot.  The MANGROOMER is no exception to this.  The nose/ear hair trimmer works very very well.  It&#x27;s quick, does the job well, and cleans up easily.  As a trimmer, yeah, I&#x27;ll pass.  It&#x27;s not even close to doing as good a job as the [[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair GMT900 iStubble]].  It&#x27;s cool and all to have an all-in-one device, sure, but the MANGROOMER can&#x27;t manage to master more than one thing.</li>
    <li> THIS THING IS JUNK HEARD OF PRODUCT NAME ON STERN SHOW THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD DID NOT WORK FROM DAY 1 STAY AWAY FROM MANGROOMER STUFF BUY WAHL</li>
    <li> This works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Quality feel to it</li>
    <li> Better than advertised.</li>
    <li> The eyebrow trimmer and the mustache trim attachment are very effective at pulling hair out rather than trimming. I would not advise using this tool to do a bikini trim if you are a woman. Or a man who self bikini trims. You know who you are. Not rechargeable. Must use replaceable batteries.  Update May 9, 2015. This item died after approximately one year of use. I (generously) estimate I used it once a month so I got about 12 uses out of this. I cannot encourage anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Biggest POS. the damn thing broke the first time I used it.  Don&#x27;t even bother. It sucks. P O S</li>
    <li> The product looked about as expected when I received it.  However, there wasn&#x27;t even enough power with new batteries to cut hair.  It just bogged down.  Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> As many of the other reviews have stated, the &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; of the nose groomer is very shoddy and likely to break after a few uses. After that it becomes impossible to reattach (trust me, I&#x27;ve tried). Nice cheap price but very unreliable and disappointing product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very cheap made.  Useless after one month.</li>
    <li> Feel the same as many of the other reviews.  So far, so good.  No issues and no complaints.  Would recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> This product worked fine, until it broke after a couple months of use. The little blades inside the nose hair trimmer broke in half (don&#x27;t ask me how, I take good care of my possessions). I contacted Mangroomer on several different occasions using TWO different email addresses listed on their website inquiring about how to go about getting them replaced. Never heard back.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Stopped working in less than a month</li>
    <li> This product is about as good as you can expect for the price point. The nose trimmer attachment works great. Probably even better than I thought it might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other attachments seem a little under-powered to trim anything too long/thick. Tried to use the longest attachment for my beard and didn&#x27;t really cut it. Also, the the whole thing feels like its about one drop away from being in 30 pieces on the floor. But like I mentioned before, this is a pretty cheap trimmer so my expectations weren&#x27;t too high going in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> the same like others I thought it will be better but I didn&#x27;t see too much difference . its okay</li>
    <li> The internal pieces of each attachment are made of cheap plastic. Overall, works well, very high powered, but wish it was made better.</li>
    <li> As the heading states I thought this machine worked well, it was handy, easy on the battery - all good.  That is until the plastic holding clips that hold the various attachments onto the motor /  spindle, broke off and only after three (3) months, making the whole lot unusable  junk.  The fact is I may have used it say once a fortnight - so about six uses.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Notheing special here.  Works fine, as do the other 4 we have in the house.  It had been about 4 years since we bought a new one and I thought I&#x27;d see if anything had changed and if the Mangroomer products were anything special.  Nope - same old same old.</li>
    <li> It works ok, i thought it would be more powerful than it is based on purchasing the mangroomer body trimmer. The head seems to get pretty warm during use so it might feel like you&#x27;re burning your nose when you use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for something to replace my old groomer and this was the best I found for the right price.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for years and love it. It is THE BEST!  I gave one to my significant other recently and he agrees.</li>
    <li> This product is great, the multiple grooming attachments really allow you to trim whatever needs trimming.  Ear, hair, nose and touching up the back of your neck and sideburns is done quickly and effectively with this trimmer.  Can&#x27;t beat the versatility for the price.</li>
    <li> The selection of trimming heads is nice, but the electric motor is underpowered. If hair is lodged between the blades, it isn&#x27;t strong enough to start up until you bump it enough or brush it. Works well though on eyebrows and sideburns. Can stand in as an emergency beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I took a long while to write this review, because I wanted to make sure my husband used the product often. and I wanted to see the results. I actually noticed when he used IT and when he didn&#x27;t. He said he found the parts easy to change out. It&#x27;s easy to clean and care for. The battery seems to last a long time, as well. I noticed a change in his facial hair within a week. More under control. And he&#x27;s able to get rid of the dreaded ear hair by himself with the MANGROOMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I bought this in July because the one I bought about ten years ago, different brand, was going slow, so I figured a new super duper one would be better.  Wasn&#x27;t very fast either and it stopped working four days ago.  Put in a few new batteries (takes one) thinking it was the battery that was bad.  Nope.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews.  Having bought a different brand at the local store, I was skeptical of getting another lemon.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and my initial impression was it looks just as cheap as the other products I have been seeing.  But, the minute I picked it up, it had more weight to it.  So, I decided to put it to the test.  It not only worked, but it hummed right through the job.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful to the previous reviews that made me take a chance!</li>
    <li> Hair pulls and pinches</li>
    <li> After approximately a year of use it broke. Ended up throwing it out. The quality is on the lower end, definitely consider a different brand because this one is made for the recycling bin / garbage, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Accidently bought a 2 pack, but it was fortunate since the first one quit working after 1 use.  Haven&#x27;t tried the second one yet.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of men, I find hairs coming out of some places I&#x27;d rather it not. Really, why do I need hair growing on my earlobes? And, don&#x27;t even get me started on nose hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this groomer after getting fed up with another one (a common occurrence). It worked ok for a while, then started to show the same problem that leads me to ultimately throw the other ones out - it stopped cutting well! This is particularly a problem with the rotary attachment. I&#x27;ve tried keeping it super clean and putting a little dab of oil on it to keep things moving, but it is a losing battle. In the end, the blades just get dull and there isn&#x27;t a lot you can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice - until someone comes out with truly never-dulling blades, buy the cheapest groomer you can and just toss it when it starts to painfully pluck the hairs out of your nose!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bad one or what but it just seems underpowered even with a fresh battery and doesnt cut well. Trimmer heads are fussy, not impressed with build quality</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be tempted by this terrible product. It&#x27;s poorly designed and manufactured and doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;When I received mine it did nothing until I gave it a good bang. The plastic cap wouldn&#x27;t stay on. The metal inside and out was thin and cheap. The rotating cutter blades were not sharp and didn&#x27;t form a good fit with the fixed cutter teeth. Once I did get it to turn on it jammed on a hair within a few seconds--let me repeat, A SINGLE HAIR JAMMED IT. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time. You&#x27;ll just have to send it back for a refund. Or you might not bother because &amp;#34;it only cost $10.&amp;#34; Apathy can be the only thing the manufacturer is counting to be able to keep making and selling products like this.</li>
    <li> It worked well for a couple weeks, then the attachment heads began to come apart -- the inner parts remaining attached to the main unit when being removed -- and then finally the blades on the nose trimmer on the main unit coming apart and falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cheaply made, grossly overpriced.</li>
    <li> Died after 3 uses. Will be contacting the company but can&#x27;t believe it was that shoddy out of the box.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve purchased three. I will definitely buy more!!!  It&#x27;s quiet and does everything it says it&#x27;s capable of doing. Perfect for an &amp;#34;any occasion&amp;#34; gift! My dad received his for Father&#x27;s Day and my boyfriend for his birthday...I also bought one for myself...Just Because. It&#x27;s great for females TOO! Shocked, yet pleased with its performance :)</li>
    <li> I use it frequently. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Broken after 6 months.  Worked well until that.</li>
    <li> Durable and long lasting product until you open up product to clean away debris. The parts of quite fragile and need lots of care when cleaning away debris.</li>
    <li> I have had several different groomers over the past decade and this one is second to none!  Solid steel construction.  Not only does it feel solid and well constructed but also does an outstanding job.  Cleaning could not be easier.  Cleaning is as simple as placing the unit under running water while on and rinsing out.  In addition to an outstanding product, the company provided an immediate response to my email that I sent them.  Great product, great service, who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> I already have one but this second is at a different home. The nose trimmer seems to hurt when I put in my nose to get the hairs out, but it still is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> It worked well for about six months.  I dropped it on the bathroom counter and the part where the attachment connects to the motor broke on the motor/handle.</li>
    <li> functional and easy to use</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage. The eyebrow trimmer attachment was broke when I received it. The nose trimmer is dull, and the battery dies quickly. Going back to my Norelco trimmer.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the motor is weak and just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s made well.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. A must have!</li>
    <li> This thing was never what I thought it would be. It is poorly designed, and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. The nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work after having it for a little over a year.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> dead right out of the box! I tried several different new batteries- nothing worked. I should have listened to the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;A piece of junk!</li>
    <li> never worked properly for me #getwhatyoupayfor</li>
    <li> Really good high power trimmer.  Well worth it, and well made.</li>
    <li> Broke after just a few uses, don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk wahl has one that has worked well for me</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it would have held up.  my man lost it before he could even really give it a test run.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price</li>
    <li> My husband says, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t forget to put on the eyebrow attachment before doing your eyebrows.&amp;#34; He likes it and his overactive follicles&lt;br /&gt;have met their match.</li>
    <li> I may need the industrial grade. This didn&#x27;t work as good as I expected for trimming eyebrows</li>
    <li> These all work well, though the heads require a bit of care in attaching them without risking breaking the connection by too much force.</li>
    <li> From a 22 yr old stereotypically hairy Italian guy: I think this is pretty good. It can be a bit awkward to hold at times because the handle is a bit bigger than it could have been. I&#x27;m relatively satisfied with all the different attachment heads, I mostly use the standard one with the cutting area going in the same direction as the handle. They all work pretty well, but hair does get caught and pulled a bit on some of the denser areas. The main thing I really don&#x27;t like about this is how loud it is, it is extremely loud for what it is. Also, another reason why I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars instead of more is that they make women&#x27;s groomers and trimmers that work significantly better than this one, and that are much quieter. For an extra 4 or 5 dollars I&#x27;d look into ordering a woman&#x27;s trimmer, Panasonic makes some good ones, and just try those. I&#x27;m willing to use a pink or purple trimmer if it mean better quality and ease of use.</li>
    <li> its okay. good for a cheap product but over time work less good. there are definitely much better products out there</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law.  He was very happy with the item, as was I.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> bought this for the boyfriend, he dropped it getting it out of the box and an attachment bit the dust. returned it and the new one is great! no problems whatsoever, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. I unfortunately dropped my first one and so needed to replace. It&#x27;s great for nose and eyebrow trimming. Also good around those delicate areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a great build quality, and the batter lasts a good while. Sometimes it seems like it doesn&#x27;t work, but if you fiddle with the attachment it will work again. I almost docked a star for it, but I believe this is the best trimmer ever after owning many others. Therefore, I won&#x27;t dock points for something so minor.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this regularly, but take good care of it, as some of the parts are a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> It is very simple and easy to use that my father n law can use it with out any trouble, even with the interchangeable heads!  He&#x27;s had it for almost a month and hasn&#x27;t had any problems what so ever.  Would recommend to anyone, plus it&#x27;s cheaper than any of the other ones we have tried and they failed!</li>
    <li> Garbage. Cheap. Used once and threw it out.</li>
    <li> great device, it does a good job. my only complaint is the sideburn-neckline attachment doesn&#x27;t cut anything. the other blades are great but this couldn&#x27;t cut through butter. oh well, two out of three aint bad.</li>
    <li> The one thing bad about this item is the battery was almost impossible to install. Once I got the battery in the item, it might be impossible to remove. So it&#x27;s really like a throw-a-way item.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews complained about the 30 day warranty and the lack of a pouch. Well, the shipment I received had a pouch in the box and a small card that said the warranty is now 2 years instead of the 30 day warranty. On top of that, this little groomer worked extremely well and did a great job trimming my mustache, better than anything I have used to date. It is well built and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product as described. prompt delivery. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Better than other groomers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I bought this for father&#x27;s day and we have not been able to make it work, no matter how different brands of new batteries we use, it is not working.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Use for nose hair. Other uses are cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It seems ok for the money spent on it. Attachments fall off easily.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap way to manage nose hair/eyebrows/detail work then this works well enough I suppose. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year and it&#x27;s already starting to fall apart. I&#x27;d describe this trimmer as disposable - if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality piece that will last you a while then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy, the attachments connect easily, works like it should. The best one I&#x27;ve ever used, very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> this is a legit groomer -</li>
    <li> First time I used it, it broke. The nose hair trimmer adapter came apart and one of the little blades went flying. Not cool.</li>
    <li> By far the best groomer that I have used yet. I previously owned a Philips groomer similar to this, but it would not cut anything, this multi-function tool works great!!</li>
    <li> I got this at a tremendous deal during the Lightning buy at Christmas. Works great, doesn&#x27;t pull like some nose trimmers.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the other connections to this groomer, and it sure doesn&#x27;t do much grooming, I am terribly disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Works well on nostril and ear hair, but I have Caveman eyebrows, the trimmer jammed and would not cut.  If thicker haired, upgrade to a higher powered electric model.</li>
    <li> I am not even 30 and nose hairs are a pain.  This does the job well.  It works great and is built to last.  I use it once a week at least.  No issues at all.</li>
    <li> I had a little dynamo of a nose hair trimmer that I lost a few years ago and was looking to get a replacement.  This package seemed perfect, and for the most part it is.  The nose/ear trimmer pulls the hair out a little more than I remember but it serves its function fine.  The two trimmer attachments are actually very nice (my old one did not have these.) They function well and I quickly cleaned up neck hair missed by a barber.  They seem to work very well for small touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I was a little less than excited was in what it lacked. Since it is a multiple attachment trimmer, it would have been nice to have a small travel bad to hold them together.  Which seems reasonable to ask for at over $20.  Also they went a little too cheap on the cleaning brush.  The cleaning brush is less than 1/4 inch across and virtually useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; . I like that it uses a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt; . the different cutters interchange quickly.&lt;br /&gt; . Compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; . The cleaning brush is so small and cheap to be almost useless.&lt;br /&gt; . Nose trimmer is not painless.&lt;br /&gt; . No travel bag.</li>
    <li> What is it about men and their body hair? Well we got this for my husband to use in his grooming. So far he has enjoyed it pretty well. All that unsightly facial and body hair is carefully groomed. We even trimmed his neck for him. We are pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My 15yo son started shaving last year, but this year he has been needing even more than a razor.  Apparently, a girlfriend disliked his nose hair and eyebrows.  As a single mom, I felt a little lost about how to fix this.  Mangroomer to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Young son can use himself, successfully, even without parental guidance&lt;br /&gt;+ No nicks or cuts&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to change the heads&lt;br /&gt;+ Nosehair &amp; eyebrow trimmers work perfectly&lt;br /&gt;+ Can use in shower, can clean under tap&lt;br /&gt;+ Only needs one battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- A little case or bag would be nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Easy to use, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I can talk to the use of the nose trimmer and straight shaver attachment--I haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow attachment. The nose trimmer is excellent. I&#x27;m impressed with how close it can trim. The straight edged trimmer attachment is good. I&#x27;ve used it to trim body hair and to clean up hair on my head. For use on the body, it&#x27;s effective but you do have to be careful of nicking. For my head hair, it has been great for small touch-ups. For a battery powered device it is surprisingly powerful. I feel the blades must be of a high quality steel--they&#x27;ve remained sharp and cut very effectively. I wish it had a scooped attachment for better (less nicking) body hair trimming.</li>
    <li> This was great for about a month.  Then the battery had to be adjusted every time i wanted to use it and if you held it the wrong way it wouldn&#x27;t work.  There are also some plastic parts that are needed for the nose hair trimmer to operate properly and there are no instructions that come with the groomer to tell you that, so the first time you find this plastic piece that looks like garbage laying on your counter...Don&#x27;t throw it away because it it mandatory for the use of the nose hair trimmer.  Also if any water gets on this groomer it immediately rusts.  This thing was a waste of money</li>
    <li> I got this product through the VINE Program for my husband. He reports that he loves it and has replaced it with an older groomer set that he owned. His favorite feature of this product is that it is waterproof. He can use it in and out of the shower and it packs away nicely in his travel bag. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Things we enjoyed about this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;- The Flat Trimmer is good for neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The Eyebrow works if you&#x27;re very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that we wish we better:&lt;br /&gt;- No rechargeable battery. It&#x27;s 2012 and this product uses a AA. Even my toothbrush has a rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;- The nose trimmer tickles so badly my husband can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;- No guard on the eyebrow trimmer. The instructions say to comb through the eyebrows with the unit off and then turn it on and comb through them just like before, but if you did that then you would shave off your eyebrows. The eyebrow trimmer is like a small version of the flat trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Flat trimmer not good for thick wiry hair. My husband has a very bristly stash and this won&#x27;t trim it. Works find for neck grooming though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat trimmer works for soft hair, so this appliance is not useless, but it could be more practical and heavy duty.</li>
    <li> so far so good. I like the right angle trimmer for mustache. My wife easily trims around her bathing suit with it.&lt;br /&gt;Only had it a few weeks, but I love it so far.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m one of those guys that shave there chest</li>
    <li> Very nice unit. That&#x27;s what she said. I already have the Panasonic 30-K, and at 13 bucks it does what this one does, but lacks the attachments. To me they&#x27;re both equally good at shaving off ear and nose etc hair, and I recommend both. If you need the attachments get this, if not get the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is well built and should last for years, as long as you don&#x27;t do something silly like sticking it in your ear. No, wait...</li>
    <li> Replaced 3 times. Cheap parts. No refund.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it guys...  not all of us... but for a lot of us... our 80&#x27;s mullets and beards are migrating into our ears and noses and those unibrows just get thicker and thicker.... none of us want to talk about this and some of us live in denial about it, but there is no need... the mangroomer stainless steel detail groomer has our back.  (No pun intended)  It has the attachments to get where you need to get and cling to those days when all our hair was where we wanted it!  I tend to be easy to please in a lot of cases (if the product does what says it does I&#x27;m good) but this one not only gets by it does the job easily, which is a big plus for someone as inherently lazy as I am.  If you buy, I hope you are as pleased as I was and thank you for taking the time to read my review.</li>
    <li> Grooms my increasingly manly nose hairs and great uncle-like eyebrows like a champ. No complaints here. Had it about three years. Crushing it.</li>
    <li> Worked very well right up until the mechanism that kept the different attachments locked into the top of it... lasted maybe 5 months before breaking</li>
    <li> Worked well for a short time, a very few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers in my life. They all were very marginal and broke rather quickly. I have had this for a year now and it seems just as solid as day one. It also had just a touch better construction, but that makes for a much better cut then all the rest I&#x27;ve tried. I am with the people who are happy with this thing.</li>
    <li> The best thing I like about this product is I could do so many things with the different accessories it comes with</li>
    <li> The Pro for this item is that it work great.  Very sturdy and easy to clean.  Great attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The Con is that it uses batteries like crazy.  It went through several on my first &#x27;clean-up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Have not tried many other products like this so not much to judge by.  However, I am happy with this purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband, he really likes it. he&#x27;s never had one of these so really i have nothing to compare it to</li>
    <li> based on mostly positive reviews on amazon was very much looking forward to using&lt;br /&gt;for the first time any mangroomer product. unfortunately was disappointed. purchased&lt;br /&gt;this product to cut hair inside nose and ears. while the unit eventually cuts the&lt;br /&gt;hair it takes alot of time to cut the hair and it cuts the hair down to 1/3rd&lt;br /&gt;its original size at best. the only real positive thing i can say is the unit DID NOT&lt;br /&gt;cause a sharp pinch. there may be the problem. after doing alot of research it seems&lt;br /&gt;the newer nose clippers are being redesigned not to pinch and from doing that have&lt;br /&gt;lessened its ability to produce a clean crisp close cut. yet to use the attachments&lt;br /&gt;so cannot comment to them being effective or not. wish i could recommend another&lt;br /&gt;unit as the unit previously owned broke after many years of use and it was thrown&lt;br /&gt;away and i don&#x27;t remember the name (think it was a sharp product).  that unit did&lt;br /&gt;a terrific job cutting hair but it did nip while cutting hair occasionally which&lt;br /&gt;was an acceptable outcome versus the results of this unit. if someone can recommend&lt;br /&gt;a better unit that would be appreciated. perhaps this unit will work for you but&lt;br /&gt;it did not for me so i cannot recomment it. once order was placed unit arrived in&lt;br /&gt;8 days.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this.  Works OK.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be well-made and it only has a 30 day warrantee.  The accessories are difficult to attach.  I would give this an average rating for this type of product.</li>
    <li> Awesome, great product!</li>
    <li> Broke during the second usage.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!!!  I am ouch free...no more pulled nose hairs!!!</li>
    <li> It feels kind of cheap, but worked well the first (and only) time I used the nose hair trimmer. I would like to continue using it but the nose hair trimmer attachment broke into two pieces after one use. I&#x27;ve contacted Mangroomer directly for a replacement attachment – hopefully it was just a defective part and I can reevaluate.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my huby and look like he is using this all the time and he love it not like the other one i purchase in Walmart. Very well made.</li>
    <li> This groomer is high powered.  I managed to take off my eyebrow with one swoop.  I wont be messing with my husbands tools any more.&lt;br /&gt;Browless</li>
    <li> Good quality trimmer. Finally one that is worth the money AND does not fall apart.</li>
    <li> I love that it gets in all the right places with ease.  The attachments are easy to put on and use</li>
    <li> Powerful and durable.  Everything works just fine, but the nose trimmer jams when I first turn it on--I need to pull it off and put it back on for it to work.</li>
    <li> Just broke while I was using it…I have used it 3 times and it just broken. do not buy it is a waste of money</li>
    <li> So far it has worked well to trim my hair. The cheaper ones I have had did the job, but were less powerful and cheaply made. This was well worth the price.... if it lasts.</li>
    <li> I can do with this groomer what formerly took me 3 trimmer type devices.  I keep my nose hair in check once a week, my eyebrows get trimmed once a week, and then I trim neck hair and hair that grows on my ears as needed...some times more than once per week.  This groomer excels at all of these use cases.  It does eat the batteries pretty quick, though, so I have gone to using a rechargeable battery.  So far after months of use I feel like the trimmer is as sharp as the day I received it.  I highly recommend this trimmer if you want to look civilized.</li>
    <li> Not salon grade, but gets the job done.  Be careful when using the eyebrow trimmer:  tip the angle and your eyebrows can wind up a lot shorter than you intended.  Maintain 90 degree position when using and it works well.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well on my husbands coarse hair, but he is having difficulty figuring out how all the attachments work.  Nose trim and ear trim has worked well.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I think my husband was just alittle thrown off because it is new and he is used to his sad old broke down version LOL. I trim the back of his neck for him when he cuts his hair and this is AMAZING for that. It is sharp and precise and very clean, I like it. It worked out as a great add on to his Fathers Day gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t look too closely but I wish it came with a good cleaning brush and oil for the little motor parts!</li>
    <li> Sux I want my money back</li>
    <li> It all eventually fell apart.</li>
    <li> Great groomer and even better customer service. When the nose hair trimmer head broke, I contacted the manufacturer and with a receipt, they sent out a new one right away. Their prompt response and my positive experience warrant this review. Defects occur on occasion and they handled it perfectly, which is a rarity with most companies. Very pleased. Best groomer I&#x27;ve used and finding it through the mess of substandard groomers out there has been a hassle. Glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I had a problem where the part that you use for your nose broke as I was cleaning it.  I contacted customer service and I must say - very surprised by how great they are.  Once I sent them the information that they requested they took care of it - right away.  Very impressed.  The trimmer is my second one that I have owned but the first one by mangroomer.  Very good trimmer - does a great job.</li>
    <li> Was larger than I expected but it is well madew and works good. The attachments are large especially the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; which makes it a bit difficult to get in tight area&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is sold with a slogan that whose imperative tone seems very appropriate: \\&quot;Maintain yourself.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mangroom has three different attachments. The basic attachment has a small domed head with a hollow center. Inside the center there are small rotating blades. You put the object inside areas where you want to remove hair. Hopefully that means you put it in and around your ear and inside your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a small attachment which acts like a traditional beard trimmer - except that it is very small. This piece is good for trimming back those hairs that grow beyond the base of your hairline behind your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my review is positive because it works well. I will concede that it is somewhat delicate. You have to make sure that the attachment in on correctly. Mine came loose both times that I changed attachments. It is very effective with the basic point of operation - it makes quick work of hairs in places that are otherwise too difficult to get to with a traditional beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer is a small tool with a solid weight to it. It is small enough that it would easily fit into a travel kit.</li>
    <li> We have tested many groomer / trimmer devices over the years. Certainly having any product is better than having no product at all. It&#x27;s definitely worth it to own something along the lines of what this does. However, compared with the many other options out there on the market, I would not choose this as my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is a bit flimsy. There are three main heads which go onto the unit. There&#x27;s the straight cylinder for use in ears and nose, the graduated eyebrow brush, and then the sideburn / mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the ear / nose one, the shape is just like the end of a pencil, which means it&#x27;s not great for getting into nooks and crannies. Most other ear / nose trimmers we own have a much better shape in order to do that job properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the eyebrow trimmer, there is one length and that is it. Different people have different desires in this area. Some want to be well trimmed while others enjoy a more bushy look. Most eyebrow trimmers have at least two options as a result. Not here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; is supposedly for making neat lines along your hair&#x27;s back or sideburns or such. However, because of the ergonomics of the unit it&#x27;s quite challenging to do this precisely. You could do far better with a sharp pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I certainly appreciate the need for a product like this. It&#x27;s an important part of a grooming kit. But this particular unit doesn&#x27;t stand up to the many other options out there, which in many cases you could get for less money. I&#x27;d evaluate the other options before making a purchase.</li>
    <li> Any grooming item that has little parts should come with a travel bag. One star off for the lack of such with this grooming kit. The product itself works reasonably well. The nose hair trimmer does a better job than the [[ASIN:B00823BHOA Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Trimmer]] I was replacing with this kit. I paid more for that item, but it didn&#x27;t do a good job. In comparison to the Panasonic, the Mangroomer feels oversized in my hand.  It is much quieter, which makes me wonder if my ER-GN30 is defective (sounds like a tiny lawnmower). The eyebrow trimmer has a hard time with my very fine hair - I had to make repeated passes to trim the wildness. Another star off for that. The sideburn trimmer is effective for me. Overall, this kit is OK but not great.</li>
    <li> Bought the Mangroomer 2 weeks ago and it works very well.I am very satisfied with purchase and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt do a perfect job with ear trimming, but it is ok. Have  not tried the side burn trimmer</li>
    <li> Very good product as it is efficient in doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> Like you... I didnt know what to buy and I needed something like this. Buy the MANGROOMER. It is built well for the price and their customer service is easy to deal with. Will not be buying those cheap other ones off the Tv commercials or whatever- had one of those and it sucked</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to male or females. really nicely made and works awesome. Price is great and i&#x27;m glad i found this</li>
    <li> This product is made with stainless steel and does all that is necessary for grooming of sideburns, trimming eye brows and the back of the neck. The nose clipper rotates so there is no chance of cutting anything but hair. The attachments fit securely onto the base although the instructions could be more explicit. Clean-up is a breeze.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my hubby for all around man grooming. I think because this was a stronger little machine he was a little nervous with the nose hair cleaner, but I can safely say nothing happened. (and he looks better for it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Great Price.</li>
    <li> At first we were disappointed in this purchase, but that was due to a defective item.  The company was quick to respond and to send a replacement that works well. It is low-power and good for touch-ups and trimming.  A good guy gift.</li>
    <li> It might be a good product but as it did not work I can&#x27;t really say. The on/off switch was defective and would go on and off or just not go on at all.</li>
    <li> I have bought from man groomer before and have been very pleased with the solid construction. This product however was something you would find on clearance at rite aid. Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have to smack the product for it to work because it randomly shuts off or it looses its maximum power.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy or recommend this product to a friend. Please look elsewhere for detail groomers!</li>
    <li> Does the job of nose and ear grooming with precision and ease.. very sturdy and well worth the money</li>
    <li> So under powered that the trimmer is unusable.  I tried to use it to cut my sideburns but all it did was pull the hair and then slowed down until it stopped.  Probably the worst product I purchased from Amazon</li>
    <li> This is the 5th one I have purchased for my Dad and this one actually works great, my Dad is happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> This does the job, but it does pull on the hairs and it runs hot to the touch when using. It is also noisy.  I had a Panasonic that died after years of use and I thought I would try this. I will probably go back to the Panasonic which did a great job of trimming without pulling and did not run hot or noisy.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Excellent !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome works great just what I expected, you won&#x27;t regret on purchasing this amazing groomer, it gets the job done !!!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a fine product, until it completely quit working one week AFTER the Amazon return period! Not worth the money unless you want to buy a new one each month.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price and fits nice in ur hand</li>
    <li> Great product to trim different types of hair, ie nose, ears, neck, etc.  This is a real good product that works well and i am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these through the years.  This one does not pull the nose hairs..it cuts them..no itching..  the eyebrow thing works nicely.  remember to leave the plastic guard on or you will wipe out your eyebrows..  all in all i&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> I used only 3 times since purchased in December not even a month old and it doesn&#x27;t work looks like the battery contacts inside is broken.  Would recommend purchasing this item...</li>
    <li> Heavy duty. Feels like it will last a long time</li>
    <li> The best of them all. Others don&#x27;t do the job and break down quickly</li>
    <li> Son seems to like it.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He  has a heavy beard and he uses this all the time.</li>
    <li> Having used a bunch of different grooming products over the years, I&#x27;d rank this one among the best.  It is comfortable to hold.  All three attachments are easy to change and work well.  The nose attachment does not pinch or tear at the hairs, which has been a common problem of other products I have used.  The precision trimmer head is good for cutting long sideburns or the back of your hair.  I use the eyebrow tool (without the length attachment) to trim extra close on my neck and other areas since the precision trimmer doesn&#x27;t get quite as close (it is better for longer hair).  The product spins the attachments fast enough to make quick work of the job without pulling.  All of the attachments are easy to clean with the included brush and by running under water.  If you can get this product for under $20, it is a great bargain considering that other products (like the \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; ones) I have used only include one style trimmer for the same price.</li>
    <li> I had this product for less than a week and it just decided not to work anymore. It seemed to work fine with what little time I used it. I thought it might be the battery, so I changed that, but to no avail. I had to send it back. I didn&#x27;t want a replacement. The craftsmanship of this product seems more on the cheap-side too. I didn&#x27;t want to try another one.</li>
    <li> The minute I opened this product I knew it was junk. Very small and cheap feeling. The motor is very rough running and won&#x27;t even work with one of the attachments....Not even going to bother with returning it...I will just throw it in the trash...</li>
    <li> This little shaver, despite its corny name, is just the thing for not looking hoary. I&#x27;m sure that stiff hair growing out of facial orifices has some evolutionary value, but it doesn&#x27;t appeal to fellow humans, especially the ladies, so off with its head! Comes with several attachments. Works especially well on the nostrils. Ewww!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality attachments , would not recommend even at low price point trade off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item first in December 2014, worked 2 times and stopped. Replacement sent in January 2015, same issue happened again. Replacement shipped in February 2015, worked until mid June and once again stopped. I attempted to return and was told no longer eligible for return.  Very unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> The groomer worked well for a couple of weeks and then fell apart and became unusable. I would not recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The nose/ear attachment broke on the first use. What a load of junk. Everything else still works, but that is just flat our irritating.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I got it for eyebrow grooming but it doesn&#x27;t tell you how you should do it.  I don&#x27;t think it removes hair very well in the way that I use it.  My husband thinks it removes hair good.</li>
    <li> Eyebrows, nose, sideburns you name it this does it all, it&#x27;s sleek doesn&#x27;t take up much room and does exactly what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some mangroomer products before but was always wanting to get more, but this one has 3 attachments in one, which is quite awesome and packs away quite well, great for trips</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace a worn out nose hair trimmer. Got it in just 2 days. Used it and must say all attachments work very well. The attachments go on fast and easy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well made and does what it should. I would like to see more attachments but can&#x27;t complain with the ones that come with it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to come apart, it does not appear a very solid gadget. When put together it works well in all the areas is supposed to work for. I find this company kind of modern in the way they design their products, the red color surely calls the attention as compared to other grooming devices of the same class.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was just me but more than once it came apart, but of course I recognize the fact that with that many interchangeable parts it should not come as a big problem. Perhaps a little flimsy at times, never the less performs flawlessly when used.&lt;br /&gt;One AA battery is all that is required to have this gadget perform its magic, and so far I have to admit that nothing can compare to cutting the hairs is designed to cut to this method. Just a swift pass and one is ready to pretend that there was no hairs in the first place. I have met some people that never seem too concerned about nose hairs, and frankly, I am not one of them. The more natural look should be probably reserved for jungles or communities where no grooming is a way of life. How do you tell someone to cut their nose hairs? You don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s how, or get ready for an altercation.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this device could be a well intended gift for someone who finds the process tedious and prefers not to bother at all. Works very well, looks very cool, and gets a definite 4 Stars rating.</li>
    <li> I had a Mangroomer before but it was not nearly as good as this one. It is more powerful and fits in tight places much better with the attachments and it is easy and quick to use. This is an excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the first trimmer/groomer that I&#x27;ve ever owned so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this one so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s getting the job done. The different attachments are easy to put on and take off (but without feeling loose while you&#x27;re using them) and it only takes a single AA battery to operate. I&#x27;ve used the other attachments sparingly, but the nose/ear hair trimmer has been especially useful and made trimming both areas a lot easier than it&#x27;s ever been. The size of the groomer makes it convenient to store. I took one star off because the whole thing feels a little flimsy (especially the attachments).</li>
    <li> I purchased the Mangroomer to replace a Remington groomer that would no longer hold a charge.  This is a simple, well designed, and high quality product.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked well the first two times than the small tabs that hold the  attachments on broke off, now I have to hold them on by hand. I would return if I still had the orignal packaging. I will look for another brand in the future.</li>
    <li> wow, after years of searching for a quality nose trimmer, I have found the gold at the end of the rainbow!!! I have been through so many manufacturers and now mangroomer has come through. I must say I was surprised, i purchased the original mangroomer for the back years ago and it sucked. And a bonus eyebrow trimmer is great too!!! so impressed. The only complaint is the smell of the oil when you put it up your nose, small price to pay.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product to have around.  It seems sturdy enough too.  My son liked the portable size and the stainless steel foundation.  It feels good in your hands and is easy to use.  It comes with two grooming adapters that click on nicely.  The idea of rinsing it off with running water after use is a real plus cleaning the hair off after its use.  I can recommend this product because it works!&lt;br /&gt;1month review:  This has turned out to be a piece of junk after only one months use.  There is something seriously wrong with the internal mechanism.  It has quit working altoghter.  Very disappointing.  I cannot return this junk, but I can worn others...don&#x27;t bother to spend your hard earned money&lt;br /&gt;on junk you will put in the garbage.  This really sucks after giving this product a five star review and a glowing testimonial.  I shall let the manufacturer of this junk know how poorly their junk works.  Beware:  at first using this junk it works famously, but it will fail on you very quickly.  No, I cannot recommend this junk to you..</li>
    <li> Works ok, have had better groomers in the past, but this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and have not had any pulled hairs or ingrown hairs.  All three heads work great and cleaning them is a snap.</li>
    <li> I have this to a friend of mine as a birthday gift and he loved it.  He said it was much better quality than all the previous manscaping trimmers he has owned</li>
    <li> The ear trimmer out of the box.  The pieces are falling off already and the only thing I can use at this point is the eyebrow trimmer.  Should have paid more for a quality product</li>
    <li> Sometimes it takes a bump to turn on but other than that works good.</li>
    <li> Only lasted a month before I started to have problems. The inner workings are made of plastic and one of the attachments broke after two uses. I have to now hold the attachment in place with one hand and groom with the other. I&#x27;m still searching for a good quality groomer.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming nose and ear hair. But also great for trimming neck hail and keeping side burns clean. Takes a standard AA battery for operation, and easily used.</li>
    <li> For any guy whom has purchased these type of trimmers in the past, they are really hit or miss. This one I decided to take a chance on and really like it. It works great and it does not feel cheap. All attachments work very well. I would definitely recommend purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t a rechargeable unit. Works ok but not a lot of power. Plastic parts feel cheap, hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> This was a gift (sort of a joke) but the recipient is very pleased, would purchase it again.  thank you</li>
    <li> It worked one time and not well at all. Tried it again a few weeks later and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Changed batteries, even though they were brand new. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I received two of these, both of which broke almost immediately. Great customer service, but bad product. I recommend you spend your money elsewhere</li>
    <li> good product and service</li>
    <li> One of the best nose trimmers I have used</li>
    <li> The groomer is very good for nose hair and pretty good for minor trimming. The eyebrow trimmer wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought, but my eyebrows are not that thick, so it might be useful on thicker eyebrows. Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged well and in good time.  Added the battery (no battery came with it) and turned on --  nose trimmer started immediately.  Changed the attachments with some difficulty, and none made contact to work.  Jiggled the attachment back and forth and started for about 2 seconds then stopped again.  Thanks to Amazon for their fantastic return policy -- money was refunded immediately.  Do not even bother with this thing - very aggravating.</li>
    <li> Great value in a trimmer.</li>
    <li> No problems. Works just great.  Feels a little cheap plasticky, but whadday want for the price?  It definitely does the job</li>
    <li> Got this at an awesome price of 9.99 and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very, very disappointed with this.  I bought it mainly for the nose hair trimmer.  I put in a fresh battery.  But I constantly have to tap it against a hard surface to get, and keep, it going.  There&#x27;s so little power, it half cuts, half pulls the hair out, and when it comes to a little resistance, it just stops, and needs to be tapped firmly against a hard surface and manipulated just to get started again.&lt;br /&gt;These were exactly the same problems with a cheaper trimmer I&#x27;d been using before, and finally just gave up on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked everywhere, and can&#x27;t seem to find one, but why don&#x27;t they have rechargeables, like they do toothbrushes.  I have significant and fast growing nose hair.  I want to be decently groomed.  I need one of these.</li>
    <li> Yep, those eyebrows really start to sprout when you get a little older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my sole reason for buying this product, eyebrows. I didm;t care about the nose hairs etc. It trims by bushy brows to a consistent length, and I am very happy.  :-)</li>
    <li> This groomer works great. The heads are easily removable and go from one to the next in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> great product, and great customer service.. probably the best trimmer on the market, i highly recommend</li>
    <li> I shave my son&#x27;s head with a 2 (sometimes I go longer on the top and blend if I&#x27;m feeling fancy) and usually only shave it again after a few months when it gets too shaggy.  However, his sideburns and neck start looking scruffy long before the overall haircut looks like he crawled out of a dumpster.  I hate pulling out the clippers, plugging them in, cleaning them meticulously with a brush, etc. etc. for these little jobs.  I love the Mangroomer for these \\&quot;touch-ups.\\&quot;  No plugging in, easy to clean with water and easier to handle for the more precise/small jobs (I shave his head with a trimmer like I&#x27;d mow the lawn... any which way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for nose trimmings (yummy) it works very well.  Does the job quickly and effectively with no pulling or pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had a use for the in-ear or eyebrows so I can only comment on the uses we have.  For those, the Mangroomer wins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, it doesn&#x27;t come in a storage \\&quot;pouch.\\&quot;  I have a few makeup bags lying around that I use for storage for things like this but it easily could have come with a cheap one to keep all the attachments in one spot with the trimmer.  Also, a thirty-day warranty?  Wow!  Not that I have ever used a warranty on a \\&quot;low priced\\&quot; product but STILL!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and precise.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of the eyebrow trimmer which is pretty good ,except there is no way to adjust the length you want to trim. The nose trimmer attachment fell apart after the first use, however I was able to put back together. The neck trimmer does not give a very close cut and it has a tendency to scratch . Not worth $20</li>
    <li> I quite working after 4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review honestly, and I approached this item optimistically. I really wanted to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this thing was a steal at $20. When I got it, I realized the catch: it was fabricated for around two cents. With a little elbow grease it gets the job done, but it&#x27;s so depressing to use that it&#x27;s just not worth it. Right off the bat, the packaging is bland, non-descriptive and foreboding. The actual trimmer is just as bland-looking, and a brief look inside the device after removing the trimmer head reveals incredibly simple, terrible construction. Like something from a dollar store. The attachments fit into place at an awkward angle, and they never quite \\&quot;lock in\\&quot;- so you need to hold this thing by the freaking tip while trimming, or else the attachment will fall off mid-shave, and you&#x27;ll gore yourself with the whirring drive shaft underneath. It&#x27;s incredibly noisy for what it is, and so cheaply made that the dinky little plastic motor is just begging for you to drop the device so it can seize up. The one time I&#x27;ve used this thing, I handled it like an antique, and I assume that&#x27;s the only reason why it hasn&#x27;t blown up yet. It&#x27;s just depressing to see that absolutely no pride has gone into making this device. I would put up a fuss and ask for my money back, but I hate myself too much for buying the thing in the first place. I have no idea what to do with it... It&#x27;s just sitting in the bathroom: a testament to my gullibility. The Mangroomer is like a trophy handed out to people who make incredibly poor decisions. I feel stupid, and honestly... victimized, for buying it. The four-star rating is incredibly misleading. If you read this, then PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM MANGROOMER. Seriously, splurge on a real trimmer!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Only the nose trimmer disassembles every time your remove it. So you have to pop it back in.</li>
    <li> Great little kit! Love it. Very well made in my opinion.</li>
    <li> As I age, I have noticed my hair making tactical retreats from my head to parts previously unoccupied. In effort to combat this invasion, I secured this multiple application strategic strike device. You may be winning the current battle hair, but now I have the tool to win the war!</li>
    <li> Worked decently, although seemingly underpowered, for about 2 months, then the eyebrow attachment stopped working.  I contacted the manufacturer asking about a replacement and received the following response... \\&quot;  \\&quot;.  These aren&#x27;t expensive devices, but I expect a lot better than 2 months from a product that advertises itself with \\&quot;Stainless Steel construction for maximum durability and Professional quality performance\\&quot;.  This type of product is not renowned for durability but, given the complete lack of responsiveness from Mangroomer, I would steer clear of any products from this company and go with a larger, established brand that you might be able to get some service from if it breaks.    Update 2014-09-24:  I contacted Mangroomer again as per their message below, and they did in fact take care of the problem by shipping me a brand new boxed unit at no charge.  I am restoring a star for the company doing the right thing by their customer, albeit after my posting a negative review.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and wanted.  Excellent groomer.</li>
    <li> ,M ,M ,M M,M ,M NM ,M ,M,M M ,M  BKJLBNHNXDTYUIOJKPL</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, and I like it because it doesn&#x27;t come with too many useless attachments. It&#x27;s powered by one AA battery, which is nice because the dock doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the counter. That being said, we do wish it came with some kind of dock because we must store it in the drawer. He says it works perfectly and has no complaints!</li>
    <li> Works good. My husband seems to like it. Good buy for the price</li>
    <li> This is a good groomer and it&#x27;s nice that it can get wet. The battery does not seem to last long in the unit but otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> Not flimsy and cheap feeling like so many kits. This one feels solid and works well. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> this groomer does it all and what I like about it best is the battery seems to last in these things....usually in other groomers your changing the battery every week....this is a good buy and when it goes bad I will get another</li>
    <li> Of all the inexpensive &amp;#34;man grooming&amp;#34; trimmers that I&#x27;ve ever had, this one is the best quality and is durable.  After 6 months of use, it&#x27;s still like brand new and works great!</li>
    <li> overall an okay groomer, but gets clogged easily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ready to trash it.  Never works without 15 minutes of adjusting the battery and both top &amp; bottom covers.  When it does finally work, it is fine.  But if I turn it off, I must go thru the whole adjusting routine again. I feel I wasted $20.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to replace our old one that had finally given up.  This one is far superior to the one we had.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Does a great job for the price -- I wish the nose-hair attachment was one solid piece though -- When I was cleaning it out, I dropped the little blade attachment down my bathroom drain...ooops!</li>
    <li> When I first bought this Mangroomer kit, I was a bit skeptical at the build quality and overall look of it.&lt;br /&gt;I must say after having this kit for more than 6 months, I can say that it has changed my expectations of it drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use the neckline/sideburns adapter. The only downside I can think of this kit is the fact that it is a little bit weak when working on thick beards and sometimes it pinches either the hair or the skin. A side from that it does the job.</li>
    <li> Simply was expecting a better quality item, the description on website was not very well done. The eyebrow trimmer does not work well.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s up and running, attachments work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made. Nose hair attachment fell apart, limped along once reassembled - the design of the couplings between the motor and the attachments is to blame. Motor is flakey. This product isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s almost entirely plastic except for the blades/guides and shiny cladding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these criticisms are probably valid for all similar products. I&#x27;m not sure anyone makes a device with all three functions that&#x27;s (more) reliable and solidly built, at any price. The market seems to have spoken on the price point and quality of this type of widget.</li>
    <li> I had a battery powered nose trimmer, different brand than this.&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer has excellent power to do the job.  Easy to change attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product,.  I do not know about long term reliability since I have only used it 4 times.</li>
    <li> I think the primary thing that makes this different from many of products is its sturdily made for guys and seems like it&#x27;ll hold up. Works well - would buy again</li>
    <li> This worked okay until I dropped it. Although it looks well made and has a stainless cover, the important parts are cheap plastic. Dropped once and ready for the trash! Junk!</li>
    <li> This mans grooming set is absolutely terrific and does exactly what is advertised.  Easy to change heads and clean and durable.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because it is difficult to change attachments, After the third or fourth use, the ear/nose trimmer came apart each time it is changed. The trimmer head does not cut as closely as needed. I would definitely NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works as intended.  No complaints.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money, period. It cant handle anything thicker than cat hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year and it has worked without problems. Nose hair works well as does eyebrow trimmer. I can recommend this product at a price around twelve.</li>
    <li> I had one for a year or so &amp; it was great... Unfortunately I dropped it &amp; bought another one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one was NOT as good as the first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POOR quality control!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was battery powered until it got here, but using 1 AA it does great trimming nose hair and facial hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this groomer for a few weeks now to do simple trims on the nose. I have not used the other attachments, but as a nose groomer, it works just as good as my Panasonic. Plenty of power so no pinches or nicks. After you&#x27;re done, just a rinse under the faucet and let it air dry. Simple and it works. For under twenty bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it. Still on the original set of batteries too!</li>
    <li> Husband really loved this has a lot of power did what he need for his trimming.</li>
    <li> Easily gets rid of stray nose &amp; brow hairs.  Battery operated.  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced an older panasonic trimmer.  Seems like it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Feels more solid that the Remington kit that this set replaced. Although the Remington kit had more pieces and useful attachments such as trimmer guards, it just didn&#x27;t hold up long. Also looks \\&quot;manly\\&quot; in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mangroomer just feels more substantial in the hand. The blades worked well and quickly in the nose hair and eyebrow blade configurations. However, the sideburn trimmer does tend to pull hair when trimming the sensitive spots \\&quot;downstairs\\&quot;. It would be great if it came with the blade guards like the remington did. There is a little plastic blade guard for the eyebrow trimmer so I can&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t make/include one for the hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, no bag?  With this many peices, one would expect a kit to put everything in. Good thing I kept the Remington&#x27;s case when I tossed out that trimmer.</li>
    <li> This Mangroomer is a good little item to have. I thought that it would be larger from the pictures I saw, but it does the job. I replaced my old one with this, and this one is a lot smaller, and less powerful. Again, it did the job.</li>
    <li> The nose hair trimmer attachment (I bought for my father) broke after only a few uses. It fell apart. I didn&#x27;t do anything unusual. Annoying!</li>
    <li> One of the best items in my household....love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Mangroomer on March 26.  It was used once and did not work  when I went to use it on April 21.  I would stay away from this product entirely.</li>
    <li> did not work from the beginning, but Amazon return policy is excellent so back it went.... too bad, looked like a good groomer.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after one use.</li>
    <li> I have had other similar items and so far this works the best.&lt;br /&gt;Agree with other reviewers that the single double AA battery is better than the typical 2 AAA.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments work good too and would recommend this over similar products.</li>
    <li> All parts work well a hear after purchase.</li>
</ol>
