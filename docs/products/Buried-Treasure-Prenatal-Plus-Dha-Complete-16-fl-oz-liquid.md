      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>and I was so happy to know this vitamins got all I need.  </li>
      <li>hehe lol</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s a great product, it has all the vitamins you need +</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t all that great tasting</li>
      <li>i love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Liquid prenatal are the best kind to take as they absorb so much more vitamins than the pills.</li>
      <li>This has been a really good product I buy it for my friend all the time..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe all the good reviews.</li>
      <li>this is a good tasting multi vitamin that didn&#x27;t upset her stomach for the prenatal.  </li>
      <li>Tastes good.</li>
      <li>and she says she can deal with it because of the good source of vitamins.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using it for a while now, she loves it and now we have a beautiful and healthy daughter.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying more even after my baby is born to correct any deficiencies created during labor and delivery!</li>
      <li>Not the best tasting product, but I can tell it was very beneficial!</li>
      <li>I always wanted more than one!</li>
      <li>I love this pre natal!</li>
      <li>Be strong and brave and deal with it.  </li>
      <li>I had money to invest, I&#x27;d honestly invest it in this line of liquid vitamins.</li>
      <li>so when I found these pregnancy vits in a high potency liquid form I was very happy.</li>
      <li>Until I got pregnant lol.</li>
      <li>It tastes good  and its easy to take.</li>
      <li>In choosing a pre-natal vitamin, ideally months before you attempt to conceive (start 3 months prior TTC), liquid is always superior to pills.  </li>
      <li>My baby is super healthy and I&#x27;ve had a good recovery.</li>
      <li>This is a great choice for people who have the inability to swallow large pills.</li>
      <li>Consuming vegetables containing Vitamin A in addition to this prenatal vitamin is safe because vegetables contain the beta-carotene version of</li>
      <li>Plant sources of vitamin A belong to betacarotene, the safe version.  </li>
      <li>As a rule, liquid vitamins are more bioavailable than tablets, so you get more bang for your buck :)</li>
      <li>women incorrectly think that they do not need a pre-natal vitamin because they eat many fruits and vegetables / consume a healthy diet.  </li>
      <li>I love this liquid vitamin and the taste.</li>
      <li>I am assuming it&#x27;s just the fruits they used to make it taste better.</li>
      <li>And I have always enjoyed the taste.</li>
      <li>the betacarotene form of Vitamin A is safe).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never not been able to make it to the bathroom to vomit before.</li>
      <li>I had a healthy baby boy.</li>
      <li>I have order this product many times before without issues, but this time it missed the mark.</li>
      <li>Had better luck with Organic Pharmacy Pre-natals and Rainbow One Pre-natals.</li>
      <li>and I felt so much better</li>
      <li>Interestingly, I couldn&#x27;t find another multivitamin/mineral supplement that contains the diversity of ingredients in the amounts that this prenatal supplement does.  </li>
      <li>so I did some more</li>
      <li>It also will dilute the thickness of the pre-natal vitamin, and will make it taste better.  </li>
      <li>This happened 2 more times.</li>
      <li>and I am well pleased</li>
      <li>I feel like I have more energy</li>
      <li>This pre-natal vitamin (like most) will not sufficiently increase your iron level, so order your doctor to test you for all iron tests (TIBC, Ferritin, Hemoglobin, and iron reserves) sooner rather than later as iron supplements (liquid, of course are the best!)</li>
      <li>With best wishes on your impending journey to motherhood!use constipation for most people; contact me to get brand name that causes the opposite effect!</li>
      <li>I am pleased and will probably use this company again if the need arises.</li>
      <li>but when I do I feel better and get a boost of energy.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re totally satisfied with this vitamin.  </li>
      <li>I know some people are concerned with some of the herbs, but I&#x27;m ok with herbal ingredients.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the taste</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It needs to be protected better when delivered in the summer heat of Florida.</li>
      <li>but it sure did not hurt :)</li>
      <li>&amp; I always felt energetic.</li>
      <li>I always forget to purchase more before I run out.</li>
      <li>A better option for liquid vitamins (in terms of lead content) is Nature&#x27;s Plus - Prenatal Liquid Multi.</li>
      <li>:) I did contact the company about the reports of lead in this vitamin</li>
      <li>Not bad, honestly.</li>
      <li>The delivery of the product was great when it came in early</li>
      <li>It is easy on my stomach.</li>
      <li>Both are easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong here if you&#x27;re looking for a great supplement at a great price!</li>
      <li>Considering all that it has in it, it tastes decent, but by no means good.</li>
      <li>Good staff, but i have concern about high lead content</li>
      <li>It provides everything you need to keep your fetus healthy and the price is right!</li>
      <li>it was fine.</li>
      <li>No woman can possibly accurately predict, calculate, and consume the 100% RDA for each vitamin and mineral in a 24-hour period.  </li>
      <li>It tastes great mixed with juice or just taken alone.</li>
      <li>You can contact the company and someone should be available to talk with you about their measurements.</li>
      <li>in this pre-natal vitamin, for some vitamins, exceeds the 100% for RDA, it is important to make your doctor test you for the presence of these vitamins in your blood, to ensure you are not overdosing.  </li>
      <li>so i want to make sure this is a right vitamin to take</li>
      <li>The bottle is full and the vitamins are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best rated out there and does not contain chemicals or ingredients that are not derived from Raw, plant based sources.</li>
      <li>I can tell that these are more effective than pills for me because I am starting to perk up.  </li>
      <li>I like liquid better because it gets absorbed by the body right away.</li>
      <li>It only takes one tablespoon per day, and it tastes great right off the spoon...</li>
      <li>I feel better knowing this is a liquid vitamin and fully absorbing into my body.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just blessed/lucky, but I think these vitamins have played a big part in my good</li>
      <li>I am not one for swallowing pills so this product gives me all the vitamins I need in a not bad tasting liquid form.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy on the stomach, I haven&#x27;t had any nausea or stomach upset while taking this.</li>
      <li>When I became pregnant I started to bleed like a faucet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 25 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant but I am a vegan and was looking for a good multivitamin/mineral supplement.  This liquid has all the usual vitamins and minerals to insure you&#x27;re filling in any gaps in your diet, plus it has the vital B-12 and iodine that some vegans may be deficient in.  Interestingly, I couldn&#x27;t find another multivitamin/mineral supplement that contains the diversity of ingredients in the amounts that this prenatal supplement does.  It only takes one tablespoon per day, and it tastes great right off the spoon...the flavor kinda reminds me of Tang or Kool-Aid!  I initially found this at my local health food store, but of course Amazon has it cheaper.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here if you&#x27;re looking for a great supplement at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite DHA product I have found so far. It tastes great mixed with juice or just taken alone. I have purchased this product every month of my pregnancy so far.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for 1 month and have notice a difference in my energy level, hair, skin, and overall well-being.  Normally other brands of multivitamins (both liquid and pill form) make me very nauseous or cause heartburn, and at times jittery, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product.  I will admit that I do feel a difference when I don&#x27;t take it. I&#x27;ve researched a lot (over 75+) prenatal MV, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this prenatal vitamin with both of our children so she&#x27;s been taking it daily for the past 2 years now.  I appreciate being able to get it significantly cheaper online than at the local retailer.  We&#x27;re totally satisfied with this vitamin.  My wife notices a difference in her energy level and how she feels when she has and hasn&#x27;t taken her daily dose.  The taste isn&#x27;t bad...it&#x27;s not a flavor you&#x27;d drink for enjoyment but at least it doesn&#x27;t leave you grimacing.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would like would be a larger size (more doses  per bottle). The taste is decent for a vitamin, but it definitely has an aftertaste so chase it with some water. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the formulation I received DID NOT contain Meadowsweet which is not advised to take for folks with asthma. It&#x27;s pretty easy on the stomach, I haven&#x27;t had any nausea or stomach upset while taking this. I&#x27;ve even taken it on an empty stomach once or twice. I don&#x27;t think it contains as many types of vitamins as some of the other horse-pill prenatal vitamins out there, but contains the essential requirements. It also contains DHA, which is a big plus. I will most likely purchase this again. This is a great choice for people who have the inability to swallow large pills.</li>
    <li> I have been doing a lot of research of prenatal vitamins and came across a review that mentioned a new FDA study of lead in women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s vitamins.  This one scores pretty high.  I have not personally taken these vitamins and I am not a health professional, but I thought I would put this link out there for others to note before they make decisions about buying prenatal vitamins.  [...]</li>
    <li> When I was pregnant, I could not take big pills without seriously gagging (or sometimes worse). I searched and searched for a liquid prenatal vitamin that didn&#x27;t contain gluten. I found this one and have been happy with it. I just mix it with a little juice or water and drink up.</li>
    <li> I started taking this product about a year before we got pregnant, and I am still taking it as a nursing mom.  I have not been sick the entire time, and I feel pretty good.  My baby is super healthy and I&#x27;ve had a good recovery. Perhaps I&#x27;m just blessed/lucky, but I think these vitamins have played a big part in my good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t taste terrible, but it can get a little fishy toward the end of a bottle.  I take it straight, but I also put up with a lot of liquid crap since I can&#x27;t tolerate pills.  I like that it is natural and that when I called customer service to ask about the dosage (which had changed from two tbsp to one), I talked to a really helpful and kind person without going through a corporate phone tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I got a bottle that was so fishy I couldn&#x27;t take it.  When I called customer service, they said that the DHA source is algae and that it may have caused that taste, and they sent me a new bottle that was like all of the other bottles I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Customer service has scored big with me again and increased my satisfaction.  I highly recommend this brand based on my experiences with them.</li>
    <li> I used this during and after my pregnancy. It mix it in juice or tea to mask the almost overpowering scent of Flinstones vitamins, but the other benefits are so high that I can deal with that. I really wish this was available for Subscribe n&#x27; Save. I always forget to purchase more before I run out.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time swallowing tablets so I decided to try this liquid prenatal vitamin. Unfortunately the taste (very strong Vitamin B taste) makes me gag. If you put it in a smoothie you might not taste it as much but unfortunately I still do and it still makes me gag.&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s a great product, it has all the vitamins you need + DHA and it&#x27;s vegetarian (the DHA comes from algae)!&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a way for me to take it, pls let me know if you have any suggestions! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely can not stomach a pill right now, so I had to find a liquid prenatal. This particular product was recommended by a friend who decided to use it by its quality and content alone - not the fact that it was liquid. So I was reassured when she recommended it. My midwife has since given it her approval and has said she will recommend it to other patients. All that said... The taste does make me grimace. I should mention that I just take it straight - no juice, because when I have to drink a whole glass full of it, it makes me feel sick to my stomach. So, I&#x27;d rather just deal with the straight tablespoon full twice a day. Considering all that it has in it, it tastes decent, but by no means good. Overall, I do highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great vitamins, but tastes nasty.</li>
    <li> used this prenatal before with a previous pregnancy &amp; have ordered again. really like it. great product. a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This prenatal vitamin has really come to the rescue for me. I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-a liquid vitamin (I have a very hard time swallowing pills, let alone the horse pills that other prenatals seem to be)&lt;br /&gt;-a vegetarian solution&lt;br /&gt;-the right supplement facts&lt;br /&gt;-something that doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach&lt;br /&gt;-good (or at least tolerable) taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it meets all of those requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that&#x27;s frustrating is not being able to travel with it (either because I&#x27;m not checking a bag and therefore can&#x27;t bring liquids on the plane, or I&#x27;m worried about keeping it unrefrigerated under the plane). For travel purposes, I wish that they made this product in smaller sizes. That way, it would either be small enough to have in my carry-on for short weekend trips, or it would be slightly smaller in size so that if I checked it in my luggage unopened and then refrigerated it at my destination, I could just leave it there when I returned home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, the product itself is A+</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely positively agrees with me. I don&#x27;t love the taste but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I&#x27;m very sensitive. I mix it with a half glass of \\&quot;high pulp\\&quot; orange juice and mix it around. When I drink the glass down, I can&#x27;t really taste the vitamin at all (it tastes like orange juice). I do this once after breakfast and then again in the afternoon. If I do this same thing over the course of my pregnancy (I&#x27;m not yet pregnant) it&#x27;s going to mean buying orange juice once a week or so, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot. I don&#x27;t have to smell the totally awful smell of vitamins, and I don&#x27;t have to torture myself trying to swallow a pill that I really just can&#x27;t swallow. It absorbs quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had money to invest, I&#x27;d honestly invest it in this line of liquid vitamins.</li>
    <li> This is a follow up to L. Stallings comment about the lead content. A better option for liquid vitamins (in terms of lead content) is Nature&#x27;s Plus - Prenatal Liquid Multi. Check out the article here: [...] (FDA test results here: [...]</li>
    <li> I love the taste of them when mixed with juice. They do have a vitamin aftertaste, so I just take it before bed. They seem to to work as they should. I feel like I have more energy and I definitely noticed a difference in my hair and nails when I stopped taking them for a few days. I am back to buy my second bottle to take while nursing.</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with the shipment I received this time. The product tasted spoiled even though it wasn&#x27;t past its expiration date. I have order this product many times before without issues, but this time it missed the mark.</li>
    <li> I used this before, during, and after my pregnancy with my first. I knew exactly what prenatal I would take when we began trying for our second; therefore, I&#x27;m using them now. I love this liquid vitamin and the taste. It reminds of the Flintstone vitamins I took as a child. I always wanted more than one! :) I did contact the company about the reports of lead in this vitamin but they have changed the formula. You can contact the company and someone should be available to talk with you about their measurements.</li>
    <li> I am taking these vitamins because I have absorption problems.  I can tell that these are more effective than pills for me because I am starting to perk up.  I definitely have to take them in juice - preferably something tropical.  Otherwise, if especially when I am already fighting nausea, I can&#x27;t drink it without getting sick.  But in juice, you don&#x27;t even notice them.</li>
    <li> Not the best tasting product, but I can tell it was very beneficial! I would order it again!</li>
    <li> In choosing a pre-natal vitamin, ideally months before you attempt to conceive (start 3 months prior TTC), liquid is always superior to pills.  Not just because pills are hard to swallow / more likely to cause nausea, but more importantly, because liquid *anything* is absorbed much faster by your digestive system, ensuring you receive an adequate amount of all vitamins and minerals without interference from other items introduced to your digestive system within 90 minutes before/after you consume the pre-natal-vitamin.  Pills contain unnatural materials (especially capsules) - why would you want to introduce your body/your baby to rubbish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to choosing this product, I compared it to 6 other liquid pre-natal vitamins.  This product had by far the more diversified selection of vitamins and minerals.  It also had the more correct dosage of daily vitamins for pregnant women, preferring to err on 100% daily value or higher rather than shortchanging you and your baby.  I have shown the ingredient list to three of my lazy obstetricians/gynecologists (apparently they do not consider reading the long list of ingredients to be an important use of their time - and I thought I was their patient) and for what their uninformed opinion is worth, they said it was \\&quot;fine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of only concern to me based on my independent research was the 8,000IU Vitamin A content.  Upon further research, I learned that the cause for concern is only the 4,000IU Vitamin A preformed/retinol type (the betacarotene form of Vitamin A is safe).  Of the Vitamin A preformed/retinol type, the danger is if you consume at/over 10,000IU/day.  With this pre-natal vitamin, you will consume 4,000IU/day.  Plant sources of vitamin A belong to betacarotene, the safe version.  There are very few foods that contain the retinol type of vitamin A - one example is liver / pate - avoid that during TTC / pregnancy.  Consuming vegetables containing Vitamin A in addition to this prenatal vitamin is safe because vegetables contain the beta-carotene version of Vitamin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer is responsible.  When I complained to it about a 2005 study that claimed their product contained too much of a toxic substance (from the grape juice they use), they were very familiar with the study and had pointed out to me they changed their recipe after the study came out to address those concerns and that now they test at a safe level for a toxic substance which name escapes me at the moment.  Manufacturer also removed an herb from the ingredients when it was discovered this herb may cause uterine contractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect of this pre-natal vitamin is immediate.  24 hours after my first consumption, my consciousness and even vision were enhanced.  It made me wonder how deficient I had been prior to consuming the pre-natal vitamin!  Made me think I will need to stay on this for the rest of my life (dangerous to do that because that equals an overdose of vitamins).  Side effects: more energy, alertness, wakefulness, re-awakened consciousness, urine turns yellow from the B vitamins inside the pre-natal vitamin, can last up to 12 hours after consumption, do not be alarmed (think your doctors think you deserve to know this? no, you&#x27;re just an annoying patient...).  Another initial side effect can be stomach pains.  You are supposed to take this on an empty stomach so as to absorb all of it.  You should take it with vitamin C to enhance its absorption (i.e., orange juice or cranberry juice).  It also will dilute the thickness of the pre-natal vitamin, and will make it taste better.  Ideally, do not eat/drink anything other than water 2 hours before taking pre-natal vitamin and 2 hours after.  You need to build up stamina to get to that point, start with 1 hour each way.  This ensures maximal absorption, otherwise if you eat something during/before after/too soon, you are diluting the dose, so what is the point of taking the correct dosage if you are then diluting it?  If you really must eat/drink too close to the time of pre-natal vitamin consumption, then make sure it is not a calcium/dairy-based product and such blocks absorption of iron and several other vitamins. Back to the stomach pains/discomfort: this is mainly due to the iron content within the pre-natal vitamin.  It is normal to feel stomach discomfort upon introduction of a new vitamin/pre-natal vitamin.  Be strong and brave and deal with it.  Since you will ideally be consuming this 3 months prior to trying to conceive, this is sufficient time for your body to get used to this, without having to deal with potential nausea / vomit pregnancy symptoms.  My first 2 weeks my stomach did bother immediately after consumption of pre-natal vitamin; I drank water, and that helped.  Deep breaths also.  Once or twice I felt nausea for 5 seconds (not severe) a few hours after, especially when doing exercises causing my stomach to be upside down in relation to the Earth.  If it causes diarrhea, alternate days to see if stomach gets used to it, if it doesn&#x27;t, stop altogether to see if it is causing diarrhea.  Iron alone typically causes diarrhea, not so much when it&#x27;s coated with so many other vitamins, herbs, and minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women incorrectly think that they do not need a pre-natal vitamin because they eat many fruits and vegetables / consume a healthy diet.  No woman can possibly accurately predict, calculate, and consume the 100% RDA for each vitamin and mineral in a 24-hour period.  Besides being extremely neurotic, it would simply be impossible because you would be eating too many calories and making errors in calculations because portion size is not an accurate science especially when it comes to raw vegetables.  The purpose of the pre-natal vitamin is to shore up the daily deficits you will incur by virtue of being *human.*  Don&#x27;t skip your pre-natal vitamin ever.  Your child will thank you, one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in this pre-natal vitamin, for some vitamins, exceeds the 100% for RDA, it is important to make your doctor test you for the presence of these vitamins in your blood, to ensure you are not overdosing.  After 2 months of consumption, order your doctor to order blood tests for all the vitamin Bs (there are 6 of them), vitamin Ds (4 of them), calcium, folate, iron, potassium, magnesium, and anything else that stands out as appropriate given your medical problems / history (your doctor won&#x27;t remember, it&#x27;s up to you to inform your busy and unconcerned, money-focused doctor).  A note about folate: that is the one vitamin (a B vitamin) where it is o.k. to exceed the 20 range, i.e., to overdose on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are deficient in vitamin D / avoid the sun at all costs, the daily 400mcg vitamin D provided in this product will be insufficient to maintain your levels over time.  Thus, ideally, consume a lot of vitamin D a few months prior to trying to conceive (vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, therefore it can be stored in body fats for a long time, and causes toxicity in you / baby - though many doctors discount this risk, some do not).  My doctor recommended 5,000IU daily of vitamin D months before trying to conceive, and this raised my vitamin D3 from 30 to 68 in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are deficient in iron / are going to become iron-deficient during pregnancy, the daily iron level in this product (20mg) is insufficient to maintain your iron level.  Pregnant women are supposed to consume 27mg of iron daily, manufacturer is concerned about an overdosage.  During pregnancy you are losing much blood during the many blood tests you take and your iron is further diluted when your blood volume increases by 50%, so iron deficiency is very common.  This pre-natal vitamin (like most) will not sufficiently increase your iron level, so order your doctor to test you for all iron tests (TIBC, Ferritin, Hemoglobin, and iron reserves) sooner rather than later as iron supplements (liquid, of course are the best!) cause constipation for most people; contact me to get brand name that causes the opposite effect! (sold on amzn.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hypothyroid or hyperthyroid and are taking levothyroxine / synthroid each morning, ensure a gap of at least 4 hours between consumption of thyroid medicine and consumption of pre-natal vitamin.  The vitamins and iron in the pre-natal vitamin actively interfere with absorption of your thyroid medicine into your body, and this is very serious because it will cause your TSH to rise possibly above 2.5, which is the upper limit range for successfully getting pregnant (you are supposed to be in the 0.4 to 2.5 range to get pregnant - don&#x27;t let your TSH rise above 2.5 while trying to conceive!).  My endocrinologist, whose job is to not only know this but also inform me of this, knew I was consuming this pre-natal vitamin but failed to order TSH blood tests for me to ensure an appropriate TSH level for conceiving.  I therefore informed her that her \\&quot;disservices\\&quot; were no longer needed.  A competent endocrinologist for pregnant women / women trying to conceive with a thyroid problem / disorder is very important and can become a life or death matter for the growing embryo/fetus if it remains not addressed or if you are using an incompetent endocrinologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A concern about the actual daily dose: you are supposed to consume only 1 tablespoon per day.  Ladies, please use an actual measuring tablespoon, not a tablespoon from your regular-usage cutlery, which is not an exact measurement of a tablespoon of liquid!  You will notice if you accurately measure the daily dosage with a tablespoon that the product lasts for 35 or 36 days rather than the promised \\&quot;30 doses\\&quot; for 30 days.  This does not mean you have vision problems / don&#x27;t fill the tablespoon properly.  Rather, the manufacturer is very generous and fills up the bottle as much as possible, thereby providing 5-6 extra doses (this was verified by phone with the company when I wanted to know if I had \\&quot;under-dosed\\&quot; for the prior 30 days when I had 5 days&#x27; worth of pre-natal vitamins left over).  A few years ago, the dosage was 2 tablespoons per day.  Many websites advertising this product have failed to change the website label, so that when you view it, you see an incorrect dosage.  Even the manufacturer still uses the incorrect, outdated label on its website: [...].  I complained to the manufacturer about the error and how it causes confusion in customers, an employee is aware of the problem and said it will be fixed (9 months later, website has yet to be fixed).  The actual product states the correct dosage.  I am sharing this warning so that you (1) do not buy too many bottles, miscalculating how many you need, especially if you are going to try it for the first time, it would be ideal to only buy 1 of these; (2) do not rely on your memory / website ingredients / label and seriously overdose your body with vitamins!  Also the color of the pre-natal vitamin has the potential to stain  your teeth; therefore, consume it by using a straw aimed at the center of your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste: for the best flavor, mix the pre-natal vitamin with freshly-juiced pineapple - only 2 days post-conception until the pregnancy test (no fresh pineapple juice during follicular phase / conception / 47 hours post-conception / ovulation, and none if you have a positive pregnancy test).  Alternately, for second-best flavor, mix the pre-natal vitamin with grape juice or cranberry juice; both mask the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above medical knowledge I have shared is distilled and based upon the reading of 20+ pregnancy books written by obstetricians, gynecologists, medical doctors, endocrinologists, and nutritionists, as well as the close questioning of 4 obstetricians, as well as my personal experience consuming the product and its effects upon my thyroid / iron / vitamin B &amp; D levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, about pricing: amzn.com website continues to sell the product at$20/bottle.  I am a loyal customer of amzn.com, but this price is not on sale and is excessive.

    <li> I really like taking this rather than those nasty pregnancy vitamins the doctor give you.&lt;br /&gt;But this bottle, the lid has broken and it&#x27;s difficult to get it open and closed everyday.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for a while now, she loves it and now we have a beautiful and healthy daughter. Not sure if it helped but it sure did not hurt :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, beware:&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered undamaged. However, the item was damaged due to the heat during the delivery. The item burst from the heat and leaked inside the box. I live in Florida, so it&#x27;s hot in the summer and this liquid was sitting in the hot delivery truck all day without any protection. I ordered a replacement thinking it was just a bad sample but the very same thing happened to it. It needs to be protected better when delivered in the summer heat of Florida. Otherwise you might be risking the health of you and your baby from a spoiled product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The taste is wonderful and the formulation is comprehensive.  I used this throughout my pregnancy and continued to use it through my child&#x27;s toddler years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this for about a week. So far it&#x27;s fine. It hasn&#x27;t made my stomach hurt or feel nasty or add to morning sickness type symptoms that any pill for or chewable RX has done for me in the past 4 pregnancies I&#x27;ve had. I like that it has DHA included and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fishy or icky taste that often comes back up with DHA pills. I know some people are concerned with some of the herbs, but I&#x27;m ok with herbal ingredients. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This has been a really good product I buy it for my friend all the time..she has so much energy and she is constantly moving and it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s a chalky taste but she mixes it with juice and she says she can deal with it because of the good source of vitamins. The delivery of the product was great when it came in early and I am well pleased and we&#x27;ll be continuing to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Tastes really great, bottle recommends mixing with juice, which I did. These also don&#x27;t make me nauseous like the pill form did. I&#x27;ll keep buying more even after my baby is born to correct any deficiencies created during labor and delivery!</li>
    <li> Came leaking so can&#x27;t speak to much since we sent it back. Can say it did not look to appetizing</li>
    <li> Ok, first I bought the regular prenatal without the DHA and had NO problems. It wasn&#x27;t the best tasting ever but it&#x27;s a vitamin so I didn&#x27;t expect a lot. THIS one has been completely different and I feel I have gotten a bottle that is rancid. First, I had projectile vomiting within literally 2 minutes of this stuff hitting my stomach. It was horrible. I have never had ANY vitamins make me sick before. EVER. I do not have a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; stomach. Not only did I vomit everywhere trying to make it to the bathroom but my body wanted it out so forcefully that I also peed my prego pants! I&#x27;ve never not been able to make it to the bathroom to vomit before. I took this in the kitchen and only have about 10 feet to the bathroom. Sooo.. We thought maybe this was a fluke, maybe I didn&#x27;t have enough in my belly (I had eaten a little while before) so after a couple weeks getting over the trauma of a wrecked stomach, I built up the courage to try it again. I took it WITH food this time. SAME thing! I just lost my whole lunch, vomited my brains out, pissed all over myself and now have a very upset stomach. Also, the expiration date on my bottle is 2-2017!!!!! This has been contaminated with something or is rancid. I&#x27;ve taken several other prenatals before this one and this is my third liquid. There is something wrong with this!!</li>
    <li> Tastes like Flinstones vitamins! Yummy! It does give me a bit of heartburn , So I mix into my juices/smoothies! Baby happy Mommy happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having this prenatal for my whole pregnancy. And I have always enjoyed the taste. This time it tastes very bitter and sour. I am assuming it&#x27;s just the fruits they used to make it taste better. Other then that the product is good.</li>
    <li> I love this pre natal! It tastes good  and its easy to take. It provides everything you need to keep your fetus healthy and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t always remember to take this everyday but when I do I feel better and get a boost of energy. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad either. I&#x27;m a big fan of liquid vitamins because they are so easy to take so when I found these pregnancy vits in a high potency liquid form I was very happy. I couldn&#x27;t always take these during my nausea stage but when I did it didn&#x27;t add to my nausea at all. Highly recommend this to any pre-pregnant, pregnant, or post-pregnant mama.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! After starting the liquid vitamin my energy level was back and I felt so much better then I was taking the pills! I&#x27;ll definitely take this while I  breastfeed.</li>
    <li> This is the best prenatal vitamin I&#x27;ve encountered!  As a rule, liquid vitamins are more bioavailable than tablets, so you get more bang for your buck :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping that in mind, it concerns me that a number of other purchasers are consuming TWO tablespoons per day.  Though it says that on here, if you read the bottle it clearly says ONE tablespoon per day.  This bottle should definitely last you about a month.  Please be careful not to overdose!</li>
    <li> this is a good tasting multi vitamin that didn&#x27;t upset her stomach for the prenatal.  some of the other big pills hurt your belly and give you gas. unfortunately the packaging and shipping, two of our bottles burst from the pressure, probably on a plane,</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t all that great tasting</li>
    <li> Very well worth the money.  The bottle is full and the vitamins are easy to use.  I am pleased and will probably use this company again if the need arises.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me. I&#x27;m 25 weeks pregnant and I wanted to switch my prenatal vitamins to a liquid form, I have trouble swallowing big pills and this has DHA and I was so happy to know this vitamins got all I need.  I asked my Perinatologist before start taking this vitamins, I am on bed rest with a cerclage and taking progesterone shots so i want to make sure this is a right vitamin to take but the ingredient on this bottle has \\&quot;meadowseet\\&quot; and I found this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Avoid use during pregnancy. Meadowsweet may increase uterine tone and might stimulate uterine activity)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my Perinatologist found similar information and didn&#x27;t recommend it for now. I may start taking it after I deliver my baby. I don&#x27;t want to put on risk my pregnancy the herb has 300 mg in each spoon you can read the labels.</li>
    <li> It is easy on my stomach. Tastes good. I like that it hss dha, red rasberry, and ginger.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m TTC after a miscarriage and Id read all these rave reviews for this product here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like really REALLY thick pulp juice. Not bad, honestly. Felt really run down after starting it so I did some more research.&lt;br /&gt;Never mind that it contains Red Rasberry Leaf....(some say that this helps tone the uterus and helps with blood flow, some say that this causes labor and miscarriage). I have lupus anticoagulant so anything that may cause increased blood flow is a plus for me.......&lt;br /&gt;Never mind that it doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed very well......(proof is in the pee!)&lt;br /&gt;What bothered me MOST was later finding that it contains one of the HIGHEST of lead contents of any prenatal on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money and bought this product. I should have went with a Garden of Life prenatal. It&#x27;s the best rated out there and does not contain chemicals or ingredients that are not derived from Raw, plant based sources. Just because it says vegetarian safe/whole food, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s SAFE!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stopped taking this product. Energy levels are BACK!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t take this, it&#x27;s the easiest prenatal supplement to take by far! If your like me and can&#x27;t stand swallowing pills this is for you!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but it does it&#x27;s job!  Just mix with 2 oz of juice and it goes down very well.  I feel better knowing this is a liquid vitamin and fully absorbing into my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly anemic so needed to up my iron intake. My doctor advised that I take pre-natal vitamins, rather than a straight iron supplement. I have a lap-band and it&#x27;s difficult to swallow large pills, so I opted for the liquid form. I keep it in the fridge and take it straight, then follow with a glass of water. The taste is not that bad at all. I&#x27;m logging on tonight to reorder. Would be great if I could get on an auto-refill so it can be sent to me automatically.</li>
    <li> Liquid prenatal are the best kind to take as they absorb so much more vitamins than the pills. You definitely should not drink on an empty stomach. Drink a glass of water before hand.</li>
    <li> Good staff, but i have concern about high lead content</li>
    <li> i love this stuff!! I It doesn&#x27;t taste bad i dont know why others are saying bad things. hehe lol</li>
    <li> Gritty texture and an odd taste. I ordered a second bottle because the first bottle was busted. I will just stay with my other liquid prenatal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is complaining about.  I drink it straight and I LIKE the taste.  It&#x27;s like a carrot-based veggie smoothie.  My hair and nails are a lot nicer now that I&#x27;ve been on it for a year or so.  No baby yet but it&#x27;s not the fault of the vitamins............. ;-)</li>
    <li> I took this while I was trying to conceive and for the first 3 months of my pregnancy. When I became pregnant I started to bleed like a faucet. I thought I miscarried at 5 weeks. I rushed to my OB&#x27;s and the baby was still alive. This happened 2 more times. My doctors couldn&#x27;t find where the bleeding was coming from. I did some research on the Buried Treasure prenatal vitamins ingredients and found the cause and stopped taking it immediately. As soon as I stopped, the bleeding stopped. I had a healthy baby boy.</li>
    <li> I used this for a year before finally getting pregnant. I never got the flu when it was going around &amp; I always felt energetic. Until I got pregnant lol. But even though I was tired, I never got morning sickness, maybe I&#x27;m just lucky. It tastes bad yea, that&#x27;s no lie. But I would wix it with OJ &amp; it was fine. Sometimes I would mix it into a smoothie too - that&#x27;s the best. I like liquid better because it gets absorbed by the body right away. Plus it&#x27;s got the DHA - I would recommend this over the pills.</li>
    <li> I tried taking them twice and both times had intense vomiting after 20 minutes of taking these. I don&#x27;t believe all the good reviews.</li>
    <li> These tasted and smelled so bad they made me just as nauseous as the prescribed ones. I never finished the bottle. Had better luck with Organic Pharmacy Pre-natals and Rainbow One Pre-natals. Both are easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> I am not one for swallowing pills so this product gives me all the vitamins I need in a not bad tasting liquid form.</li>
    <li> The best liquid prenatal I&#x27;ve tried. I have Crohns and have a hard time taking pills. I was taking a highly recommended Rainbow brand before this and although small pills, I had to take 3x day and they didnt have enough folic acid and I took another capsule for Dha. I also didn&#x27;t feel like I got thr energy I get from this liquid. This has everything you need. I couldn&#x27;t find another liquid like it. I take 1TB with apple or orange juice daily. It is a thick, green liquid and has a sweet taste, but my juice disguises it, so it&#x27;s very easy for me to take. I&#x27;m 28 weeks and have been using this since a few months before pregnancy and will continue to use it after.</li>
    <li> The regular prenatal vitamins (pills) made me so nauseated I could not keep them down.  This liquid vitamin does not taste great but it&#x27;s tolerable when mixed with juice.  It&#x27;s the only prenatal I&#x27;ve been able to keep down since becoming pregnant.  The price is a little more than the pills but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> We did not open this right away, so it is too late to send it back.  When we went to use it, the foil seal was stuck to the lid and there was evidence of leakage.  It says to refrigerate after opening, so we decided to dispose of it rather than risk getting poisoned.</li>
    <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t keep down any prenatal vitamins so we tried this and it was the only one she could keep down! Worked great for her!</li>
    <li> Checked by the Gynae.  my wife cannot take pills so this liquid form serves well.  Even my Gynae says its hard its hard to get something like this outside of USA</li>
