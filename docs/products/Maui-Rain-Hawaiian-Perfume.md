      <li>I am very happy and the girlfriend is REALLY happy, since she was in Hawaii and didn&#x27;t know how to purchase outside the state.</li>
      <li>So, I was looking for a scent that smelled like the island flowers, and really captured the beautiful feel and smells of the islands of Hawaii.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scent when I visited Hawaii in 2003.  </li>

      <li>so we were glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>Found this in Hawaii and fell in love....</li>
      <li>I love the smell of &amp;#34;Maui Rain.&amp;#34; The lily-of-the-valley is one of my favorite flowers.</li>
      <li>I have been told that i always smell so good and so fresh, this is the truth.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My wife use it and love the scent</li>
      <li>also really live the beautiful bottles they come</li>
      <li>and it is just as spectacular as the original from Hawaii.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume and I am so excited I found a place to keep purchasing it :) :)</li>
      <li>Very powerful smell, was packaged really well, also included a hand written welcome note and a typed history explaining the scent.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making the purchase of it so easy!!</li>
      <li>Good price for great scent that has few sales outlets.</li>
      <li>My wife likes the clean scent which reminds her each time of our many trips to the Island.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic gift.  </li>
      <li>Maui Rain continues to remind me of a special vacation taken with family and treasured for life.</li>
      <li>I shipped it to my job, and when I received it, was super excited....</li>
      <li>I normally wear citrus-sy smelling perfume, but I love to use Maui Rain as an alternative.  </li>
      <li>Wish I could have picked it up in person, but since that wasn&#x27;t possible....ordering via Amazon, worked very well!!  </li>
      <li>Hawaiian Classic Perfumes did a fine job of packaging (including a hand written note) and the shipment arrived on schedule.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>I first bought this product 5 years ago on the Island of Maui.</li>
      <li>, I bought my first bottle in Hawaii</li>
      <li>Bought it the first time in Maui.  </li>
      <li>It is the exact item I had fallen in love with, the last time I was in Maui.  </li>
      <li>Takes me right back to the Tedeschi Vineyards in Maui where I bought my first bottle!!</li>
      <li>thank you  If you think the price is too high</li>
      <li>The scent is like no other perfume; flowery without being too much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However the price shown is not discounted, actually is full price on other sites.</li>
      <li>you will be surprised just how long it lasts for the price.</li>

<li> you will be surprised just how long it lasts for the price.</li>
<li> but they did not last as long</li>
<li> I tried to return the product, and was not able to because of &amp;#34;shipping restrictions.&amp;#34; So, there went $50 down the drain...and the perfume is sitting in it&#x27;s box under my sink now, because I don&#x27;t know what to do with it, and it would be pretty offensive to give it to anyone as a present.</li>
<li> I have purchased other perfumes that were more expensive</li>
<li> This product lasts a long time because you do not require a lot just a dab.</li>
<li> The shop that I had been buying this from in Charleston closed, so I bought it online.  </li>
<li> Some described the smell as &amp;#34;old lady perfume.&amp;#34; I am sorry if that is offensive, and I love all the older women in my life, but would absolutely hate if anyone wore this scent around me.</li>
<li> No more other perfumes for me.</li>
<li> I like the little bottle too.</li>
<li> I was bewildered that 93% of the buyers of this perfume rated it 5 stars, and the other 7% rated it 4!!</li>
<li> I have been buying this product for a few years and it is my favourite</li>
<li> ; perfume smell after it sits on the shelf for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It was hard to find in Hawaii</li>
<li> Some of my co workers said it smelled worse than that.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s crazy.</li>

    <li> My wife likes the clean scent which reminds her each time of our many trips to the Island.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product 5 years ago on the Island of Maui. I have loved it ever since. I am thrilled to see that I can buy this online and it is just as spectacular as the original from Hawaii. The fragrance is &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m so happy to get it. It is long-lasting on your body, as well as long-lasting in the bottle. No &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; perfume smell after it sits on the shelf for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>

    <li> I discovered this years ago on Mauii but went home to Australia without it. It has an amazing perfume.  Reminded me of the beautiful tropical aromas of the wonderful Hawaiin Islands.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of &amp;#34;Maui Rain.&amp;#34; The lily-of-the-valley is one of my favorite flowers. The jar it comes in is awesome, too. This perfume has beaten out Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Intuition&amp;#34; as my favorite scent!</li>
    <li> my daughter in laws mom used to bring this back from Hawaii every year when she went but she hasn&#x27;t been in a while so when I found this I thought it would be perfect....she loved it!!!!  I will be in maui next month so I will bring it from the island this time....</li>

This product lasts a long time because you do not require a lot just a dab. thank you  If you think the price is too high you will be surprised just how long it lasts for the price. I have purchased other perfumes that were more expensive but they did not last as long and Maui rain.  I have been told that i always smell so good and so fresh, this is the truth. No more other perfumes for me.</li>
    <li> My wife fell in love with this scent during our vacation on Maui. Good price for great scent that has few sales outlets.</li>

    <li> Found this in Hawaii and fell in love....Beautiful perfume.  I have been asked by several people what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Maui Rain continues to remind me of a special vacation taken with family and treasured for life. Thank you for bottling joy!</li>
    <li> So, I was looking for a scent that smelled like the island flowers, and really captured the beautiful feel and smells of the islands of Hawaii. I took a chance and ordered this fragrance. I shipped it to my job, and when I received it, was super excited....until I opened it. The best way I can describe it would be the smell of a gas station bathroom. Some of my co workers said it smelled worse than that. Some described the smell as &amp;#34;old lady perfume.&amp;#34; I am sorry if that is offensive, and I love all the older women in my life, but would absolutely hate if anyone wore this scent around me. It smelled up our office to the point where people we walking by my desk asking what the &amp;#34;disgusting smell&amp;#34; was. I was bewildered that 93% of the buyers of this perfume rated it 5 stars, and the other 7% rated it 4!! That&#x27;s crazy. I tried to return the product, and was not able to because of &amp;#34;shipping restrictions.&amp;#34; So, there went $50 down the drain...and the perfume is sitting in it&#x27;s box under my sink now, because I don&#x27;t know what to do with it, and it would be pretty offensive to give it to anyone as a present. For the record, I never post reviews, and probably have ever only posted one, and it was a praising review for a restaurant or something. But I feel as though the current reviews of this product are misleading.</li>
    <li> Love my Maui Rain. Shipper even put a personalized note in the package! I was impressed and will definitely order again.</li>
