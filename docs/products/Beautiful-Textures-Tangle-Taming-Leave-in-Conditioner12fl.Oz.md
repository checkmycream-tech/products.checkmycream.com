      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Just call to make sure they have it.</li>
      <li>Since my product is in demand  in my community, soon it will come to the market for all to experience  what we love :)</li>
      <li>I have used this for about two weeks and it is a pretty good</li>
      <li>This product is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this product when I first started using it because it got through my hair easily, but It does not give my hair the hydration it needs by itself.</li>
      <li>Also, I tried this before blowing out my hair before flat ironing and I loved the results from that too!</li>
      <li>this area is fine but frizzy.</li>
      <li>Never seen so much good natural stuff in hair products!</li>
      <li>The product has a light baby powder type of scent and it is cream based.</li>
      <li>- I once made a huge mistake by squeezing more than I normally need, and thinking I could just use it instead of wasting it.</li>
      <li>I was really expecting more from this product.</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite until...</li>
      <li>I would recommend using the whole series for a better experience.</li>
      <li>She actually loves this brand, so this was good.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit overly sweet</li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the scent and it doesn&#x27;t detangle that well, but I do love the fact that it really moisturize my hair and it doesn&#x27;t buildup in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful textures was mailed to me on my deployment a little over a month ago.</li>
      <li>It is definitely easy to get through very course hair because it works and a detangler, then a hydrator.</li>
      <li>I wanted to really like this product because of the awesome ingredients, just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
      <li>4a/b/c, dry scalp (but thankfully no flakes), damaged ends from brushing, fine, porous, tangle-prone, and no chemical treatments of any kind (including hair dye).  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the slip and the curl definition near my roots that frame my face as  </li>
      <li>{Chemicals cause enough damage to my hair, this product offers an affordable way to keep my hair looking great}</li>
      <li>so it s worth checking out.  </li>
      <li>I love this leave-in conditioner it leaves my hair soft and gives it moisture....</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by a friend and she was right about it.</li>
      <li>Right now I am using apple cider vinegar rinse to seal in the cuticles and braiding up my hair at night to deal with the tangles and dryness.  </li>
      <li>should mention that Beautiful Textures is made by the same company that makes African Pride and African Pride has a line of hair products that is very similar to Beautiful Textures but at a lower price point.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance and, when my hair cooperates, leaves it with defined curls--frizz free--and soft, not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I am transitioning it works great for my thick textures...</li>
      <li>First let me describe my hair so that you will understand why I rate it the way I do:</li>
      <li>So moisturizing and I love the slip like I said earlier.</li>
      <li>I love trying new hair products that is catered to natural hair.  </li>
      <li>yeah pretty much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 22 years of my life, I tried a texturizer for a couple of months and quickly regretted the decision.</li>
      <li>But this is a good choice if you are not willing to take a gamble on ordering hair products over the Internet and you can return products if you bought it from a major retailer like Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very temperamental</li>
      <li>As a cream leave-in to battle tangles, this works very well.</li>
      <li>The result - no pulling, pain, or popped off hair strands while I gently comb through my mid-back length, 4a, relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>Had I started out with too much</li>
      <li>I have very curly type B/C hair</li>
      <li>One whose hair is on the straighter side and doesn&#x27;t require much of any products.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband who has curly hair and he absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>This ladies and gentleman is THAT product!&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy or greasy at all!!!</li>
      <li>scent is a bit overly sweet and strong, but it does dissipate to a lighter fruity aroma within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do apply a small amount and gradually add a bit more because my hair tends to absorb the product rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have very very curly hair and have been going natural for a while.</li>
      <li>because even though I have fine hair, my hair is highly porous and cannot hold on to moisture for long.  </li>
      <li>I have used this on my 3C/4A hair many times and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down!</li>
      <li>It feels like hand lotion and rubs in so easy and since it is a creamy off white color, it disappears instantly!</li>
      <li>I have searched far and wide for a product that is NOT heavy and greasy but also moisturizing with a clean NON OVERPOWERING scent!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a freak when it comes to reading the ingredients - and this one is wow!</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a child!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any and everyone with natural hair!</li>
      <li>I normally love a product with a scent, but this one goes overboard and doesn&#x27;t dissipate over time.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>My already dry hair was suffering from the climate change, strong winds, and constant sandstorms.</li>
      <li>but once it dried it was fine.</li>
      <li>I transitioned from permed to natural hair.</li>
      <li>So I am going to try the kit and see how much of a difference it makes because I achieved the same results using this.</li>
      <li>and here I am with hair the complete opposite of what I had before the processing.</li>
      <li>My hair was silky straight with minimal shedding and lots of bounce and shine.</li>
      <li>I use a little on my hair right after washing it.</li>
      <li>also use it on my 2 years old curly hair, her hair is really dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best. I have low porosity, 4c hair and this detangles my hair with ease. It has amazing slip and make my hair easy to style a lot faster.</li>
    <li> I love it!,it tangles perfectly.I jst find the smell nauseating sometimes because,its kind of strong</li>
    <li> The conditioner works well, but is not as moisturizing as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> First let me describe my hair so that you will understand why I rate it the way I do: 4a/b/c, dry scalp (but thankfully no flakes), damaged ends from brushing, fine, porous, tangle-prone, and no chemical treatments of any kind (including hair dye).  I was in search of a daily moisturizer because even though I have fine hair, my hair is highly porous and cannot hold on to moisture for long.  Right now I am using apple cider vinegar rinse to seal in the cuticles and braiding up my hair at night to deal with the tangles and dryness.  I have used this for about two weeks and it is a pretty good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it does moisturize my hair and helps me to detangle my hair when I want to style it.  I do apply a small amount and gradually add a bit more because my hair tends to absorb the product rather quickly.  It smells nice and I don&#x27;t have to apply it on wet or damp hair, but sometimes I do.  The moisture last about a day or to before I reapply.  The only con is that over time, I have to shampoo my hair because my hair would be acting weird with all that product.  When you see that it contains silicones, that is the reason why.  I don&#x27;t have anything against silicones but over time my hair would be greasy but dry and looking somewhat dull.  My leave-in of choice would have to be Oyin Handmade Hair Dew.  I am not crazy about the scent and it doesn&#x27;t detangle that well, but I do love the fact that it really moisturize my hair and it doesn&#x27;t buildup in my hair.  And there is no greasy feel when I use Oyin Handmade.  The reason why I haven&#x27;t re-upped on Oyin is because it is a bit spendy and I have a short attention span when it comes to hair products.  I love trying new hair products that is catered to natural hair.  When I finish Beautiful Textures leave-in conditioner, I will return to Oyin Handmade Hair Dew.  But this is a good choice if you are not willing to take a gamble on ordering hair products over the Internet and you can return products if you bought it from a major retailer like Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that Beautiful Textures is made by the same company that makes African Pride and African Pride has a line of hair products that is very similar to Beautiful Textures but at a lower price point.  I saw it at my local Walmart a.k.a. Wally World so it s worth checking out.  Just call to make sure they have it.</li>
    <li> The smell is so overpowering that I had to wash it out a few hours later...I wanted to really like this product because of the awesome ingredients, just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. I normally love a product with a scent, but this one goes overboard and doesn&#x27;t dissipate over time.</li>
    <li> I got a sample bottle. I think it is 3 oz and I decided to try it today. I was pleased with the slip and the curl definition near my roots that frame my face as  this area is fine but frizzy. The smell is a bit overly sweet but once it dried it was fine. I would buy this since trying the sample.</li>
    <li> I was really expecting more from this product. My very own organic hand craft product is now all me and my children  need for our hair Moisturization  and shine, enhanced texture and protection to have our hair in the best condition. Since my product is in demand  in my community, soon it will come to the market for all to experience  what we love :) Thank you Jesus Christ  for the wisdom and blessing my hands. Amen</li>
    <li> It is definitely easy to get through very course hair because it works and a detangler, then a hydrator. The smell is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a super greasy feeling on your hands after use. Though I had to wash my hair once every like 3 days because there would be build up. I really liked this product when I first started using it because it got through my hair easily, but It does not give my hair the hydration it needs by itself. Maybe I should combine it with their shampoo and their other products.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it after every Anti-Reversion wash and condition.  It makes a huge difference in the feel of my hair!</li>
    <li> Not many leave-ins I have ever used have had slip like this one does. So moisturizing and I love the slip like I said earlier. Also, I tried this before blowing out my hair before flat ironing and I loved the results from that too!</li>
    <li> This too was for my mom and she loves this product. She actually loves this brand, so this was good.</li>
    <li> As a cream leave-in to battle tangles, this works very well. The price is the best benefit for the ingredients. My main criteria is to never purchase anything that is loaded with unhealthy or &#x27;junk&#x27; fillers. I only use it on damp hair, just after a shampoo or on dried hair with a few sprays of my Giovanni leave-in. The result - no pulling, pain, or popped off hair strands while I gently comb through my mid-back length, 4a, relaxed hair. {Chemicals cause enough damage to my hair, this product offers an affordable way to keep my hair looking great} This is my third bottle and I no longer need the $28 8oz similar overpriced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit overly sweet and strong, but it does dissipate to a lighter fruity aroma within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note - I once made a huge mistake by squeezing more than I normally need, and thinking I could just use it instead of wasting it. Had I started out with too much, it&#x27;s very likely I wouldn&#x27;t have liked this product at all. One bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Love it.. This product was recommended by a friend and she was right about it.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling healthy and moisturized. I will admit it is not as great as I thought it would be by itself. I would recommend using the whole series for a better experience.</li>
    <li> I have very curly type B/C hair I guess.  This product is pretty good.  My hair is very temperamental so it&#x27;s hard to say if this product works the way I was hoping it would.  It has a nice fragrance and, when my hair cooperates, leaves it with defined curls--frizz free--and soft, not heavy.  Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I really apprecate 6 out of the 7 Beautiful Textures products. This leave in is smells fruit, but that is not a problem for me. It detangle may hair and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I have very very curly hair and have been going natural for a while. I have tried using this daily... it works for me</li>
    <li> WOW! I am a cult user of the Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in conditioner. I Big Chopped December 26, 2012 and have probably used about 5/6 bottles of the KCKT leave- in since then. It is my absolute favorite until... I went to FL for Summer 2014 and my aunt is a beautician and told me about Beautiful Textures and their Texture Manageability System and how it lasts for about 6 weeks but IS NOT a relaxer. She didn&#x27;t use the kit on my but used this as the leave-in for 20 minutes then blow dried and flat ironed. My hair was silky straight with minimal shedding and lots of bounce and shine. So I bought all the products, including the anti-reversion shampoo and conditioner. After I did some researching, I realized that this leave-in is NOT the same as the leave-in that comes in the kit. So I am going to try the kit and see how much of a difference it makes because I achieved the same results using this. I have used this on my 3C/4A hair many times and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down! also using it with their growth oil...Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> After using this conditioner, It has yet to be shown up. It smells great, de-tangles and defines my curls. Hopefully this brand never goes away.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a I transitioned from permed to natural hair. It provided the moisture that I needed to keep my hear from breaking off as I transitioned. The product has a light baby powder type of scent and it is cream based. I use a little on my hair right after washing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 my hair is a 4a, dry, and sometimes flaky. I&#x27;ve been natural for 22 years of my life, I tried a texturizer for a couple of months and quickly regretted the decision. I went ahead with a big chop and here I am with hair the complete opposite of what I had before the processing. Beautiful textures was mailed to me on my deployment a little over a month ago. My already dry hair was suffering from the climate change, strong winds, and constant sandstorms. This thing works wonders! My hair is moisturized, it smells amazing, and it&#x27;s never greasy. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a child! I&#x27;d recommend this to any and everyone with natural hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has curly hair and he absolutely loves it. I bought so many different creams before including really expensive loreal kerastase, etc but this one is by far the best. I&#x27;m also a freak when it comes to reading the ingredients - and this one is wow! Never seen so much good natural stuff in hair products! Love, I&#x27;m using it too and the smell is divine. People compliment it and ask what we r using!</li>
    <li> Although I did not purchase this here, (local drug store) I felt compelled to write my review of this wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have 2 boys. One whose hair is on the straighter side and doesn&#x27;t require much of any products. The other, his hair is curly like mine but not as thick and course curls as mine (typical mixed larger curls!) I have searched far and wide for a product that is NOT heavy and greasy but also moisturizing with a clean NON OVERPOWERING scent! This ladies and gentleman is THAT product!&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy or greasy at all!!! It feels like hand lotion and rubs in so easy and since it is a creamy off white color, it disappears instantly! I am completely sold and plan to try their other products.</li>
    <li> This product was a great purchase as I needed it to help moisturize my hair as well as define the curls. It helped my curls to stay in place all day which was an added bonus. It also smells amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! i have naturally curly hair (type 3b) and this stuff is great for my hair! i co-wash then apply this and diffuse and my curls are beautiful! and last at least a week! I love the smell! People say the smell is over-powering, it may be strong but is smells soo good and makes your hair smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my 2 years old curly hair, her hair is really dry and this works wonders for her too! Keeps her hair silky and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love , love , love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I so badly wanted to like this product. Hated it, the smell was over powering, left my hair crunchy &amp; that&#x27;s about it. Not worth it for the price. Will NEVER buy this product again, will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner it leaves my hair soft and gives it moisture.... I am transitioning it works great for my thick textures... I don&#x27;t like the smell but I would buy again... its cheaper at Sally&#x27;s with the card of course</li>
    <li> love this stuff gave me very nice curls  defines my 3b 3c 4a curls great detangler and mosteriser would i buy it agai defintley its super great love the smell and yeah pretty much</li>
    <li> Very good product on my hair. Love it</li>
