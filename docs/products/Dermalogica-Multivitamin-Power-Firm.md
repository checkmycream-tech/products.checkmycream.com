    <li> This is a great price for this product!!! Love the professional size!!! Can&#x27;t find this size anywhere else. I love this product. So smooth. I use this around my eyes and it works great. This is the only product that I can see after 2 weeks that my eyes are not puffy. I got this fast and on time. Early even.</li>
    <li> Something was wrong with the tube I got.  It is watery.  It is not the consistency of the others I have bought.  I am unhappy with the supplier, very unhappy</li>
    <li> I think I got an old tube. It does not seem to work like my previous one. Very disappointed. I know it works, but the one I got is just not the same.</li>
    <li> I have ultra sensitive eye lids.  I can&#x27;t even wear makeup.  And all eye creemes have given me a rash.  This is the ONLY product that soothes my lies and helps with wrinkles without breaking out.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product.  We always buy through Amazon.</li>

    <li> I have used this for years and it is a great product.</li>
