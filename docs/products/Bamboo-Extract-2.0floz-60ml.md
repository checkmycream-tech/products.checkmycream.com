      <li>It is a good product for hair</li>
      <li>I gave this bamboo extract five stars because it&#x27;s amazing .</li>
      <li>For th size this was a nice price,I do plan to repurchase.</li>

      <li>I love this and will order more.</li>
      <li>JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>but overall still very good product</li>
      <li>I got it fast and the product is really good.</li>
      <li>first i wash and condition, after i make each strand is covered nicely with the leave in</li>
      <li>My intent was to use it on my hair, but I liked the results on my face so much, that I think I&#x27;ll reserve it for that.</li>
      <li>It made my skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working good so far.</li>
      <li>Anyway who knows it may be worth every penny lets wait and see, I may do another review once I use it!</li>
      <li>this added much needed slip 9( LIKE A SILICONE) and that is very important.</li>
      <li>details that may help you to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo has a very large amount of silica, an essential nutrient (one of the most abundant minerals on earth).&lt;br /&gt;Silica plays a role in maintaining skin and hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully, the ingredients are natural - because so far I am loving how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>Love it, especially in my conditioner and on my skin.</li>
      <li>natural anti-oxidants (helps fight off free radicals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around a winner!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I saw a difference the first time I  use a  cotton suave on that area of my face.</li>
      <li>let my hair air dry being sure not to play in it and</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite product and I will purchase the 8oz bottle next time.</li>
      <li>I use it straight on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
      <li>It has very nourishing properties.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I have heard so much about the benefits of bamboo.</li>
      <li>: I mix this with Babyface Protein Treatment and a nutritious hair oil (it varies) to make a conditioner that really softens and strengthens the hair.</li>
      <li>Together, these three seem to really make my hair grow faster.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is amazing on sensitive skin or even slightly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put this liquid in a spray bottle and apply to both my hair and skin after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin nice and firm as well as glowing!</li>
      <li>with just a few drops my hair looks and feels FABULOUS!...</li>
      <li>(giovanni direct leave in)</li>
      <li>I will use this in a hair mist for natural hair.</li>
      <li>When I spray this on my skin, its soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>My skin is really sensitive because I have peripheral dermatitis and after reading the reviews I decided to use this on my face.</li>
      <li>Surprised with shinny results, I will now use bamboo serum products for my beauty regimen</li>
      <li>Make mg extentions really soft.</li>
      <li>Its a water based product to use during cool down phase.</li>
      <li>was extra soft, also when I was combing my hair I experienced much less shedding than usual.</li>
      <li>I mixed it with my all natural hair conditioner when I washed it out my hair</li>

<li> I mix some with aloe vera juice and a little water for detangling nd my curls pop!</li>
<li> the bottle is MUCH small that it appears here...note:</li>

<li> hate it... completely slippery...</li>
<li> I have tried everything and nothing seem to help except expensive prescription that I have to fill every so often to help the breakouts.</li>
<li> - so no one is benefiting from a fake review.</li>
<li> but when I opened the box boy was I disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> have been using it at night under my night cream,has made my skin smoother and softer</li>
    <li> Love to add this to hair products. Helps reduce breakage</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have heard so much about the benefits of bamboo. This stuff is a great addition to all cosmetics and hair care products. It made my skin silky smooth. Just a little will do. I will be purchasing this product as long as it is sold!</li>
    <li> It is a good product for hair</li>
    <li> JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and skin. My skin is really sensitive because I have peripheral dermatitis and after reading the reviews I decided to use this on my face. OMG!!!! I saw a difference the first time I  use a  cotton suave on that area of my face. I have tried everything and nothing seem to help except expensive prescription that I have to fill every so often to help the breakouts. I love this and will order more.</li>
    <li> Love it, especially in my conditioner and on my skin. When I spray this on my skin, its soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up in the morning, glowing skin.</li>
    <li> this product is great. i added about 1/4 cup to 32oz of conditioner to assist with detangling and it made the process a breeze. i have 4a type hair and for all my curly girls i would say give it a try. this added much needed slip 9( LIKE A SILICONE) and that is very important. i also added some to my leave in conditioner. i use about 2tbs of leave in...(giovanni direct leave in) 1/2 tbs of bamboo, wheat germ oil, caster oil, and 1 tbs of aloe vera juice.  first i wash and condition, after i make each strand is covered nicely with the leave in i use gel to help set my curls. let my hair air dry being sure not to play in it and my curls pop.....very happy!</li>
    <li> hate it... completely slippery... I thought I would use this on my face, but the glycerin just makes it slippery and not good for topical application so it&#x27;s a waste to me.</li>
    <li> Add a little to hair conditioner, skin lotions, or plain water to apply to the skin for soft and strong results. Sounds like an ad. Unintended.  Update, May 2015: I mix this with Babyface Protein Treatment and a nutritious hair oil (it varies) to make a conditioner that really softens and strengthens the hair. I also use Chumket shampoo. Together, these three seem to really make my hair grow faster.</li>
    <li> This bamboo extract makes my hair so soft, dark and shiny.  I put it in a spray bottle with castor oil and the results were wonderful.  This is my new favorite product and I will purchase the 8oz bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Make mg extentions really soft. I mixed this with my regular conditioner it cane out so lovely.&lt;br /&gt;price should be a bit more affordable.  Bottle is tiny....</li>
    <li> Seems to be working good so far. I added this to my homemade leave in my hair is getting stronger</li>
    <li> Let me say this, I just received this item today along with provitamin B5. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I placed the order but when I opened the box boy was I disappointed! So the only reason I give this product three stars is because I would&#x27;nt have sold my worst enemy such small bottles for the price. Anyway who knows it may be worth every penny lets wait and see, I may do another review once I use it!</li>
    <li> I gave this bamboo extract five stars because it&#x27;s amazing . I mixed it with my all natural hair conditioner when I washed it out my hair was extra soft, also when I was combing my hair I experienced much less shedding than usual. When my hair dried it had a really glossy shine.</li>
    <li> I cannot say if it is good for hair, yet. I have not tried it for that purpose. It seems to feel great, on my skin, though. After applying it, my skin feels tighter, smoother, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the ingredients are natural - because so far I am loving how it feels on my face. I purchased this, too - so no one is benefiting from a fake review. My intent was to use it on my hair, but I liked the results on my face so much, that I think I&#x27;ll reserve it for that.</li>
    <li> Safely packaged and sealed.This was great to find.I will use this in a hair mist for natural hair.The scent is pleasant.For th size this was a nice price,I do plan to repurchase.Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great additive for my home made shampoos and conditioners</li>
    <li> OMG!...with just a few drops my hair looks and feels FABULOUS!...pay attention...the bottle is MUCH small that it appears here...note: 2.0floz...</li>
    <li> In my experience with using Bamboo extract is that it makes hair products conditioning. Its a water based product to use during cool down phase. It has very nourishing properties.</li>
    <li> I got it fast and the product is really good. I use it straight on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I put this liquid in a spray bottle and apply to both my hair and skin after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin nice and firm as well as glowing! It makes my hair thicker and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing on sensitive skin or even slightly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some details that may help you to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo has a very large amount of silica, an essential nutrient (one of the most abundant minerals on earth).&lt;br /&gt;Silica plays a role in maintaining skin and hair health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps alleviate eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo is an anti-irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains natural anti-oxidants (helps fight off free radicals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I&#x27;m a medical esthetician, just trying to help keep others healthy, Its upsetting to see so many horrible additives and ingredients to our beauty products.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just reordered the 8oz</li>
    <li> Surprised with shinny results, I will now use bamboo serum products for my beauty regimen</li>
    <li> AWESOME for my curls. I mix some with aloe vera juice and a little water for detangling nd my curls pop!</li>
    <li> Not as expected cause it is water based and me thought it was all oil but overall still very good product</li>
