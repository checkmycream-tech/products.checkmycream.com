      <li>a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple switched that can be hit with the fingers in either hand are great and the cool blast is great as well for when you accidentally get carried away on your own head, also seems to work well to after getting a section of hair to do what you want it to and then hit it with cool air and it will stay much better.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know about about blow dryers, but she has told me it does a great job, does not get too too hot and is an overall great package.</li>
      <li>If the temp gets too hot, since it has 3 heat settings, I just change the temp and since the air&#x27;s output doesn&#x27;t change, I still get great results with drying my hair quickly.  </li>

      <li>The unit was also comfortable to handle and easy to operate.  </li>
      <li>Revlon Perfect Heat hair dryer dries my hair FASTER  and with less frizz.</li>
      <li>For my purposes this dryer worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s an 1875w blower, which means it is among the most powerful.</li>
      <li>The clips are great for holding back portions of my hair in for hard-to-reach places.</li>
      <li>This is a ceramic hair dryer that is light in weight but no flimsy.  </li>
      <li>It feels light in the hand, offers impressive power, isn&#x27;t too loud, and has a competitive price point.</li>
      <li>There are three heat settings cool, warm and hot.</li>
      <li>is a very nice lightweight basic hair dryer that does indeed work to help reduce frizz&lt;br /&gt;due to the ceramic</li>
      <li>This light weigh easy to use dryer has triple ceramic coating that provides heat distribution which penetrates hair quickly and that cuts drying time.  </li>

      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when my husband asked me to use the Revlon 5 piece deluxe blowout set with IONIC and Tourmaline  technology.</li>
      <li>I like that there is also a quick cool button.</li>
      <li>This is a great entry level dryer and actually functions very well.</li>
      <li>I really find it perfect for my needs and the round brush included does wonders.</li>
      <li>It cools quickly which was surprising.&lt;br</li>
      <li>hair dryer gets very hot quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve paid more for lesser dryers in the past and I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has six combo settings (three heat levels, and two speeds), affording you a wide range of options to best suit your individual styling needs.</li>
      <li>Powerful motor/blower&lt;br /&gt;Multi-temperature and speed</li>
      <li>Lightweight powerful hair dryer.</li>
      <li>This dryer comes with a styling brush and two very large hair clips to make straightening easier.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very responsive and provides cool air almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>To add to that, I&#x27;m a long hair kind of girl.</li>
      <li>The round brush accessory may be nice to have depending on your hair, but the two clips are huge and not that useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush is a perfect aid for my long, wavy hair, removing the slight frizz</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of them at first but don&#x27;t discount them!</li>
      <li>hot</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been told by several hair stylists that I have 2-3 times MORE hair than the majority of their clients</li>
      <li>but after I had my first child, my hair got a bit of a wave to it, therefore making my hair lose some of it&#x27;s shine.  </li>
      <li>The dryer blows air at a great pace so it only takes a couples of minutes to get my hair completely dry.</li>
      <li>A new feature to me is the cool shot which I find helpful for post shower</li>
      <li>Although this dryer seems more powerful (again same 1875 but has a more powerful air output than my other 1875 dryer), it&#x27;s MUCH quieter</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are no premium bells or whistles included in the package, but there are no drawbacks to speak of either. This is a great entry level dryer and actually functions very well. I&#x27;ve paid more for lesser dryers in the past and I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with this one. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The things that make a hair dryer good for me is, does it dry quickly, is it too heavy, how loud is it? This basic hair dryer fills all areas well. It is easy to hold, comfortable and not too heavy. It has just enough power to dry my thick hair fairly quickly and it operates fairly quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the cord is a good length, the accessorizes are ok (personally I don&#x27;t like a round brush) and the control buttons are easy to use. I like that there is also a quick cool button.</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my wife and daughter, and they love it. It&#x27;s a 5 piece set, with the dryer, a brush two clips and an anti-frizz piece that fits over the end of the blower. With the humidity lately, my wife likes to add volume to her hair, otherwise it goes flat and straight. With the Blowout set she&#x27;s able get the look she wants, and it&#x27;s a powerful hair dryer without overheating, so she cuts down on the dry time. She&#x27;s already told me she&#x27;s taking it to the beach with us so she can use it after a long day of swimming and sunning.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Perfect Heat 5 Piece Deluxe Blowout Set is great. I use this one for drying my daughters shoulder length hair straight. It works great on her hair. This one comes with a sturdy round blowout brush and two large sectioning clips which are both handy. The attachment to the front works great for concentrating on hair sections and I like that there&#x27;s a cold air button. The quality of this hair dryer is very nice, I am definitely happy with it.</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday and again this morning and had wonderful results. The brush is a perfect aid for my long, wavy hair, removing the slight frizz look I always get with my old dryer. The clips are great for holding back portions of my hair in for hard-to-reach places. The attachments are an asset to the product, giving my hair the full, wavy look I like. I adore this product! It should be called &#x27;frizz-be-gone&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, who uses her hairdryer every single morning as part of her daily beauty routine.  She has very thick, full hair and usually uses a salon-quality high-powered hairdryer to cut down on her styling time.  Aside from this one being a step down in wattage, she gave it a thumbs up with the following observations...&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with two very helpful hair sectioning clips which allow the user to isolate sections of hair for styling.  The included brush is also a nice touch and of satisfactory quality.  The concentrator attachment is easy to attach and fits securely.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best features are the controls.  My wife really likes the toggle-style switches this unit uses.  She particularly likes the cold shot button, which lets you remove the heat from the airflow temporarily as needed.  It&#x27;s very responsive and provides cool air almost immediately.  This is especially useful when she helps our 6 year old daughter dry her hair as it reduces complaints about the air burning her head or neck.  The unit is also reasonably non-deafening, unlike some hairdryers that should come with earplugs.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, my wife said she will continue to use a stronger hairdryer as her daily go-to choice because her hair is so thick she needs the time-saving advantage of a top-strength unit.  This will be a great backup for her and go-to dryer for the rest of the family, and it is well-priced for the quality of the unit and included accessories.  As for me, I will affirm that this unit dried my hair almost instantly...both of them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been this excited about something I use on a daily basis in a very long time! I am half Asian and have extremely THICK hair.  I&#x27;ve been told by several hair stylists that I have 2-3 times MORE hair than the majority of their clients so they have to schedule extra time for highlights.  To add to that, I&#x27;m a long hair kind of girl. My hair length ranges from 2&amp;#34; past my shoulders to the middle of my back so drying my hair each day is NOT something I look forward to since it takes FOREVER.  I&#x27;ve had 4 different hair dryers from various brand such as other Revlon or Remington that claimed to have &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; Technology to faster drying and in all honesty, I have never noticed a difference except for now with the REVLON PERFECT HEAT hair dryer!  My hair dryer previous to this one is even a 1875 watt dryer, such as this one but it pales in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have thick, shiny, straight hair but after I had my first child, my hair got a bit of a wave to it, therefore making my hair lose some of it&#x27;s shine.  After my 2nd son however, my hair is just straight up frizzy.  I&#x27;ve used just about every anti frizz hair treatment (temporary products like foams, oils and creams, etc - I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian hair treatment) and while some work better than others, I haven&#x27;t been able to find something that works perfectly well in Texas heat that will last.  If I don&#x27;t add anything and just let my hair air dry, it&#x27;s frizzy then calms down a SMIDGE but if I simply just blow dry, I look like Mufasa&#x27;s twin.  I never thought that a blowdryer could help in any way but it does! If the temp gets too hot, since it has 3 heat settings, I just change the temp and since the air&#x27;s output doesn&#x27;t change, I still get great results with drying my hair quickly.  Since I have very frizzy hair now, I do need to add a leave in conditioner or some type of anti frizz product to my hair but when I combine it with using this dryer, I&#x27;m actually very pleased with the results! My hair looks normal with a bit of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Revlon Perfect Heat hair dryer dries my hair FASTER  and with less frizz. Although this dryer seems more powerful (again same 1875 but has a more powerful air output than my other 1875 dryer), it&#x27;s MUCH quieter which is just a HUGE bonus!!! It is a bit heavier than my old one but I&#x27;m more than happy to work with it for these results.  In this boxed kit, the dryer also comes with a round brush and 2 sectioning clips.  I didn&#x27;t think much of them at first but don&#x27;t discount them! The sectioning clips work MUCH better than my old hair clips from my hair roller sets and the round blowout brush seems to separate the hair strands, therefore both styling and drying your hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do I love this dryer? I just came back from an out of town trip and I was willing to haul this dryer with me, considering the size of it, even though I&#x27;ve got other smaller dryers that I could have taken instead.  I&#x27;ve now given my teenage son one of my old dryers to use for his craft projects, donated one and am only keeping one in the even this one breaks and I have to reorder one in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVLON, PLEASE, PLEASE don&#x27;t stop making this dryer!! (Maybe offer more color selections (the color doesn&#x27;t coordinate with my bathroom AT ALL and make a portable version as long as you don&#x27;t lose the results!) :-)</li>
    <li> I love this great hair drier and accessories. When I opened the box, the brush looked a little insubstantial. (I have thick, heavy hair), but when I tried it I changed my opinion. It&#x27;s lightweight but the bristles are magic. Sometimes round curling brushes like this wrap my hair up in a wad, but this brush separates the strands deftly to allow the drier to do its job. The drier itself produces a stream of soft, directed air. It has three heat settings and two power settings, so you can customize the air stream to suit your needs. I used hot and high, as I did with my old drier, but this was softer. It did a beautiful job of drying my straight collar-length bob. When I finished, my hair was dry, but not dried out, smooth and silky.  I don&#x27;t usually use clips when I dry my hair, but I tried them. They worked. If they hold my hair, they&#x27;ll hold almost anyone&#x27;s. The drier has a long cord and a built-in loop to hang. I don&#x27;t know whether you hang your drier up, but I do. The loop (see the handle by the cord in the picture) fits perfectly over a miniature coat hook. Now it&#x27;s handy for all my special occasions.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer for those occasions where I actually desire to use one. I don&#x27;t necessarily have frizz issues but I do have very thick hair that needs to be dried a lot quicker than air drying at times and this works. It&#x27;s also great to have one around for when I&#x27;m cutting hair for all of us. I was expecting just a basic no frills hair dryer at this price point but it turns out that it does have a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple switched that can be hit with the fingers in either hand are great and the cool blast is great as well for when you accidentally get carried away on your own head, also seems to work well to after getting a section of hair to do what you want it to and then hit it with cool air and it will stay much better. Having a couple kids and some adults to keep their hair in check is very doable with this hair dryer and it seems like it should last quite a while. It already has it&#x27;s own hook in the bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added brush and hair clips were a nice bonus as well, I&#x27;ve been meaning to get some of these for cutting hair as it is and this ended up being a great combo pack setup. I would certainly get this again if I needed a second one.</li>
    <li> When I removed this from the plastic bag, it had scratches and a large smudge mark along the handle. Even worse, when I plugged it in and switched it on - in the same outlet where I normally use my Conair hair dryer each day - it emitted a low humming noise and a smoky scent. I immediately unplugged it and tried it in another outlet. Same result. This must be a defective unit but it scared me. I was afraid to leave the house for awhile lest it caused an electrical fire. I never got it to work, so I can&#x27;t review it on that but I can say it was a very bad customer experience.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Powerful motor/blower&lt;br /&gt;Multi-temperature and speed&lt;br /&gt;GFI for use near sink&lt;br /&gt;Removable end cap for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Long (6 foot) heavy-duty power cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It comes with a plastic bristle brush: this is unfortunate because it&#x27;s going to rip hair.&lt;br /&gt;Big.  Tough to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Heavy.  Makes for a tired arm doing lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, especially if you have solid arm muscles.</li>
    <li> Sleek and light, this Revlon hair dryer/styler is great! I use many Revlon products and this one has the Revlon quality I&#x27;ve come to expect. I works great on my unruly mane, and I appreciate how light it is. I also love the color which &amp;#34;goes&amp;#34; with my burnt orange bathroom. This dryer comes with a styling brush and two very large hair clips to make straightening easier. The quality-to-price ratio is excellent!</li>
    <li> Thus far am very pleased with the performance of the blow dryer. The ionic technology helps to reduce frizz -- and in this humid weather every bit helps! It comes with a styling brush and two hair clips.  Dryer has 3 Heat / 2 Speed Settings, a Cold Shot Button and removable end cap. This blow dryer does an excellent job. The cold shot button is very nice. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Revlon Perfect is the perfect dryer for my long curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not use a blowdryer for my hair because it gets way too frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;With this blow dryer this has not been happening and the quick cool button has been holding up great&lt;br /&gt;since I use that quite often.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice lightweight basic hair dryer that does indeed work to help reduce frizz&lt;br /&gt;due to the ceramic technology.&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a round brush and two hair clips if you are needing these types of things.</li>
    <li> I have not owned a hair dryer since my 70s era Conair died on me. After that I just stopped using them. Lately though I have wondered if a dryer would give my hair a liitle life and it did. This is much improved over the ones we used to use. For one thing the heat seems more contained so it dosent burn your hair to a frizz like the old days. Nor is it heavy and cumbersome. I really find it perfect for my needs and the round brush included does wonders. Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer.  Forget those expensive blow dryers, this blow dryer gets it done!</li>
    <li> As usual with Revlon grooming products, this is a very well-made and useful implement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has six combo settings (three heat levels, and two speeds), affording you a wide range of options to best suit your individual styling needs. There&#x27;s also a cold shot ability. They all work extremely well, with the variations being very noticeable. When you set the speed at \\&quot;high\\&quot;, it really puts out some air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a styling brush, as well as two hair clips (not really useful to me, as I&#x27;m a guy. And I don&#x27;t do \\&quot;man buns\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very well made; sturdy and durable, with excellent fit and finish. The filter screen is easily accessible for cleaning, too, to ensure proper air intake as time goes on (those screens do have a tendency to gather lint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This will probably end up being the shortest, most succinct review I have ever written.  With some products, you either like them or you don&#x27;t.  I like this blow dryer.  I like it, a lot.  It feels light in the hand, offers impressive power, isn&#x27;t too loud, and has a competitive price point. I appreciate that the cord is long enough to allow me to move about my bathroom.  I also like that it came with two clips for sectioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pick one feature about this blow dryer that impressed me the most, it would be how quiet it is.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive, burnt-orange unit that&#x27;s nicely balanced, easy to hold and manipulate. It has two speeds and three heat settings, plus the &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; for setting curls. The round brush is okay - it&#x27;s plastic, and I prefer brushes with a metal backing to help with setting curls. I was expecting standard size sectioning clips, but these are extra large and hold tightly - wonderful for my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.  The motor puts out a lot of air but isn&#x27;t particularly loud. I&#x27;m very happy with this kit.</li>
    <li> I have used a hair dryer in one form or another from back in the mid to late 60s.  Although my hair has thinned, I have enough of it to still warrant the use of a blow dryer such as this one, at least for about two minutes.  Yes, I actually timed a session in preparation for this review.  What I look for in a dryer is power and heat and a bit of heft to keep it from flying out of my hand.  This Revlon dryer has the usual three speeds, three temperatures plus a button for cool air.  For my purposes this dryer worked fine.  When I handed it over to my wife to try, however, she felt right away that it was too heavy and that its weight would be a problem for her considering how long her own drying sessions take.  (What do women do that takes so long?).  For the record, this one weighed out at 16.3 oz while her Conair dyer is a mere 14.1 oz.  Frankly, I couldn&#x27;t tell that much of a difference but maybe someone could if they had to use it longer than my usual two minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a ceramic hair dryer that is light in weight but no flimsy.  Upon looking at it, it is a cool color of metallic orange.  The cord is long enough for easy use.  The buttons work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long thick hair and I can burnout a dryer after a couple of years. I like the heat and blow settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer gets very hot quickly.  It is well made and has a low setting.  It cools quickly which was surprising.&lt;br /&gt;The best parts are the accessories.  There are two clips that is bigger than depicted on the box.  The brush is a good size and easy to use.  That, and it’s not too heavy.  It is reasonable priced at $25.</li>
    <li> Lightweight powerful hair dryer. Good cord length. Buttons on the handle were clicking off till I became used to it. Hair clips were useless, could not hold up even small section of hair, round acrylic brush is not something I would use with wet hair. Hairdryer itself I recommend.</li>
    <li> With three females on premise, the hair dryers in our house get quite a workout. We&#x27;ve been through a few over the past year or two, with the most recent being the most maddening thing we&#x27;ve used - a hair dryer with touch controls. I&#x27;m happy to say that this dryer really does not try anything fancy. It sticks to what makes a quality dryer, which consists of ceramic/tourmaline and ionic technologies to reduce frizz and static. It also has 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings, with the highest putting out ample &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34;, as well as the now common &amp;#34;Cold Shot&amp;#34; button to temporarily stop the heat and set styles. This dyer also includes a round &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; brush two &amp;#34;sectioning clips&amp;#34;, though my wife has not used them and I do not know what they are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a man&#x27;s perspective, I appreciate the hotrod orange color and the rubber &#x27;grips&#x27; on the sides that keep it from sliding off the counter every time I bump it. I also like that it&#x27;s an 1875w blower, which means it is among the most powerful. That comes in handy when I use it, not as a hair dryer, but as a body dryer. lol! But it&#x27;s also probably the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen, which is nice when someone else is trying to sleep that it doesn&#x27;t sound like a small airplane is taking off in the next room. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it.  I don&#x27;t know about about blow dryers, but she has told me it does a great job, does not get too too hot and is an overall great package.</li>
    <li> I have rather thick shoulder length hair that takes a while to dry and style, a process that I find rather tedious.  This unit managed to get the job done a bit quicker than the dryer I have been using.  The unit was also comfortable to handle and easy to operate.  I particularly liked the design of the controls that allowed me to adjust the temperature and speed without stopping my styling.  The styling brush that is included is a nice size and also easy to manage.  The clips are also a useful addition, particularly on those occasions when I want my hair a bit bouncier than usual.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It works great and has just the right level of heat for my hair. I love the brush as well. I haven&#x27;t used a round brush in years,  but gave this one a try and found I love it. The dryer blows air at a great pace so it only takes a couples of minutes to get my hair completely dry. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all had our share of dryer disappointments, and the carcasses of yesteryear&#x27;s hair care appliances litter more than a few garages. But this model by Revlon is a keeper. Not only will it enliven your dressing area with its punchy orange color, the multiple heat and dual speed options ensure that you&#x27;ll be able to find a setting that works for your particular style and comfort.There is also a cold shot button, which Revlon says &amp;#34;releases cool air to set your style.&amp;#34; In practice, it provides a way for you to cool off your neck, back, and any other body part that got overheated during the drying phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is well-balanced, the controls intuitive and within easy reach. The round brush accessory may be nice to have depending on your hair, but the two clips are huge and not that useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, it&#x27;s not noisy but not super-quiet either, so if you are looking for a dryer that you can use in your sleep, this is not the model for you. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a well-priced high-powered model that should do the job for most wet heads.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a durable and quality blow dryer that has many features, looks great and is easy to operate.  I use it to dry my hair after showering and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it much more than I do.  Here is what she has to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I must confess that I have not had to purchase a blow dryer for about 10 years. I was pleasantly surprised when my husband asked me to use the Revlon 5 piece deluxe blowout set with IONIC and Tourmaline  technology. This light weigh easy to use dryer has triple ceramic coating that provides heat distribution which penetrates hair quickly and that cuts drying time.  The tourmaline ionic technology eliminates static electricity and frizz. There are three heat settings cool, warm and hot. A new feature to me is the cool shot which I find helpful for post shower hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a textured hand grip that helps with wet hands.  Also there is a round blowout brush, a concentrator attachment and two sectional clips that aid in styling your hair.  I have what I call thyroid hair, it is thin, dry and lackluster. I do find that this dryer has given my hair a little more volume and appears to me to shiner, less frizzy and less dry looking. My styling/blowout time has decreased and that allows me another cup of coffee before leaving for work. This makes me a happy lady.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with this blow dryer and would recommend it to family, friends and those of you looking for an easy to use, quality blow dryer that is very functional.  Enjoy!</li>
