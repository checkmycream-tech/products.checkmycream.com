      <li>Amazing products.</li>
      <li>I discovered this product after spying the bottles in the bathroom of a friend who has the most gorgeous hair I have ever seen.  </li>
      <li>By far the best product in the biz.</li>
      <li>but I bought this because while this size costs a bit up front, the cost per ounce is a better value than buying 8 oz bottles.</li>
      <li>It simply is The Very Best.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair care products.  </li>
      <li>If you do the math on this set one 8 oz bottle is 30$ so for 8x times that you get 67.6 oz and the set is even more savings.</li>
      <li>I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner~</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>No shampoo/conditioner has been able to deliver as this product has for me.  </li>
      <li>My hair is heavenly and stays healthy.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is sulfate free - very important for healthy hair.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair so healthy and easy to manage</li>
      <li>then I use their perfect blowout cream and even in dry desert</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product and the huge size because I have daughter who uses it as well.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much besides smell good.</li>
      <li>Although it is quite pricey, you can use so little and get AWESOME results.  </li>
      <li>my hair looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>The product came in a timely manner and the product itself did not look tampered with or of lower quality, as I had brought the product before from Sephora and am familiar with the consistency and color of both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Cant say enough good things about this</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR READING THIS. .:)</li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair with this product because it leaves it in such good shape that it dries naturally with no fly-aways and great volume.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think this is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give it a try to see if my hair would look half as good.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I need!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to try this shampoo, after I saw all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I brought the large sizes</li>
      <li>They are too large to sit on the rim of my tub</li>
      <li>and this product is by far superior than others out there.&lt;br /&gt;Continues to moisturize and condition well without making my hair feel limp or greasy.  </li>
      <li>Less breakage and split ends for sure...</li>
      <li>This stuff transforms the hair of older women.</li>
      <li>I love my blonde white and brown highlights</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Alternal Caviar shampoo/conditioners.</li>
      <li>The conditioner makes my hair feel like silk in the shower and when dry, it is soft, silky and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I have processed hair and live in the desert</li>
      <li>My only regret is that one week later these were $20 cheaper with free shipping.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>I HAVE 20 YR OLD HAIR</li>
      <li>I have to say this shampoo has transformed my hair completely.  </li>
      <li>but they fit nicely in the weird little window we have in our shower.</li>
      <li>No other shampoo and conditioner compares to Alterna Caviiar.</li>
      <li>On the rare occasion that I blow dry my hair, I use the Alterna Caviar Blow Dry Cream.  </li>
      <li>All natural with no parabens or sulfites which is big plus.</li>
      <li>I have straight to wavy, long hair that is neither dry nor oily.  </li>

    <li> Worth every penny.  The best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product after spying the bottles in the bathroom of a friend who has the most gorgeous hair I have ever seen.  I decided to give it a try to see if my hair would look half as good.  I was not dissapointed!  I have straight to wavy, long hair that is neither dry nor oily.  This product makes my hair feel like silk.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair with this product because it leaves it in such good shape that it dries naturally with no fly-aways and great volume.  On the rare occasion that I blow dry my hair, I use the Alterna Caviar Blow Dry Cream.  After I began using these products, my stylist of 15 years asked me what I was using on my hair, because, in his words, &amp;#34;your hair LOVES whatever you&#x27;re using.&amp;#34;  Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
    <li> No other shampoo and conditioner compares to Alterna Caviiar. It simply is The Very Best.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have long dry hair and this product is by far superior than others out there.&lt;br /&gt;Continues to moisturize and condition well without making my hair feel limp or greasy.  All natural with no parabens or sulfites which is big plus.</li>

If you do the math on this set one 8 oz bottle is 30$ so for 8x times that you get 67.6 oz and the set is even more savings.I will NEVER stop using this I love my blonde white and brown highlights but it used to make me cry to brush through my hair..not anymore..I am in perimenopause and my hair and skin is dry.this product makes me look ford to washing my long hair..I&#x27;m telling you just try it ,and I am also a product junkie this blows everything out of the water including morrocican hair products in the Salon ..I hope this helps anyone oh and I have thyroid problems that used to make my hair dry..not anymore...This set is my MUST HAVE!!! THANKS FOR READING THIS. .:)..I FEEL LIKE I HAVE 20 YR OLD HAIR AND I AM 35..</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft! Now I know why Jen Aniston used it. Smells really good too. Love it!</li>
    <li> I had to try this shampoo, after I saw all the positive reviews. I have struggled with weak, dry and thinning hair for many years and I was always desperately looking for products that would improve the look of my hair. I have to say this shampoo has transformed my hair completely.  It&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s been resuscitated, it looks shinier, fuller than it has been in years. No shampoo/conditioner has been able to deliver as this product has for me.  People at work have even noticed the difference in my hair, and the women their have pulled me aside inquiring about what I am using.  I am very happy that Amazon has this product at a lower cost. I brought the large sizes so I would not have to worry about running out for a while. The product came in a timely manner and the product itself did not look tampered with or of lower quality, as I had brought the product before from Sephora and am familiar with the consistency and color of both shampoo and conditioner. Thank you Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> These products are amazing! and will last forever!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair care products.  Lasts a very long time.  My only regret is that one week later these were $20 cheaper with free shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff transforms the hair of older women. I love it.</li>
    <li> By far the best product in the biz. You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this! My hair is heavenly and stays healthy. Less breakage and split ends for sure...</li>
    <li> Amazing products. Really good! My girlfriend loves them.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this is worth the money. I have have dry, thin hair and was hoping that I would get some of the moisture back with this product but it didn&#x27;t do much besides smell good. I would not spend the money on this shampoo and conditioner duo.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s done wonders for mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived on time and the bottles were individually sealed in leak-proof plastic. They are too large to sit on the rim of my tub but they fit nicely in the weird little window we have in our shower. I could see this larger quantity size in a salon but I bought this because while this size costs a bit up front, the cost per ounce is a better value than buying 8 oz bottles. I have very long, dry, colour processed hair and I go through a lot of shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using Alterna Caviar shampoos for years now. I love the stuff. The shampoo is sulfate free - very important for healthy hair. It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. The conditioner makes my hair feel like silk in the shower and when dry, it is soft, silky and easy to manage. I highly recommend Alternal Caviar shampoo/conditioners.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner~</li>
    <li> I have processed hair and live in the desert so dry hair is an issue.  I LOVE this product and the huge size because I have daughter who uses it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different shampoo but this one is exactly what I need!&lt;br /&gt;You need to use conditioner every time after so that the hair won&#x27;t be that dry since the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sodium.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and Conditioner. It is very good if you have damaged hair and have some frizz.  The size of these bottles should last me at least 6 months. That make this a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes your hair so healthy and easy to manage</li>
