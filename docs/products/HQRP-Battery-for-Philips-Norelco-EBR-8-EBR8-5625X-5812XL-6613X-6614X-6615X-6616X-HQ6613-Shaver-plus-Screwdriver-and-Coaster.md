### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent replacement battery for my Norelco shaver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Holds a charge great and VERY happy with this price and quality.  </li>
      <li>It was a great price also.</li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>It was a great price also.</li>
      <li>Having the correct Torx #8 screwdriver come with the battery was great and even included a coaster to hold a beverage of your choice for the victory party.</li>
      <li>Very happy :)</li>
      <li>works great in my razor ,good product.</li>
      <li>This was a good find.</li>
      <li>This was a good find.</li>
      <li>Factory battery lasted around 10 years, so this one should be good for a while.</li>
      <li>Worked perfectly and breathed new life into my Norelco 5812XL razor.</li>
      <li>But, hey - free coaster!</li>
      <li>Better battery than the original one in the razor.</li>
      <li>Fairly easy to install, and better capacity than the original.</li>
      <li>If you have some soldering skills, this is an easy way to repower your shaver.  </li>
      <li>But if you have the iron and tools, its easy.  </li>
      <li>This is great, was easy to install with a minor problem.</li>
      <li>Then I charged the new battery and the razor now runs as good as new, and more importantly</li>
      <li>I installed this battery into my Norelco razor and at first the razor ran strong and kept the charge for a significant period of time.</li>
      <li>I had an older Norelco 68xx model and it was torturous shaving any more.  </li>
      <li>Batteries were right for the model razor.</li>
      <li>And the torq screwdriver, for those who don&#x27;t have a set, opens the razor right up.</li>
      <li>Very easy to install if you know basic soldering technique.  </li>
      <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;It seems that this never happened with the original battery when it was new.</li>
      <li>The enclosed Torx #8 driver was exactly the size needed to disassemble my 6613X razor.  </li>
      <li>If you have the most basic soldering skills, you can do this.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you happen to install it in the wrong direction, I believe that at best you&#x27;ll kill the new battery, and possibly worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found a video on another website that was very helpful; it showed me how to peel the contacts off the old battery and use them to solder the new battery in place without having to solder on the board itself.  </li>
      <li>Torx #8 is the right tool to open the case.  </li>
      <li>(New shaver about $60.00)  </li>
      <li>Cheaper than a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to unsolder the old one and solder in the new one.  </li>
      <li>Took out old batteries and soldered in the new batteries.</li>
      <li>I put the battery in place (polarity is clearly marked, on the old and new batteries)- and just soldered in place.  </li>
      <li>Just the thing to refurbish an old Norelco.</li>
      <li>put in this new battery 3 or 4 weeks ago, and my shaver has been running on the initial charge I gave it, since then, and I&#x27;m using it every</li>
      <li>The original battery slot on the circuit board was a little smaller</li>
      <li>After only a couple of months, the razor is running with less pep and the battery discharges quickly.</li>
      <li>The screwdriver it comes with is a necessity because hardly anything else will fit it, but the thing works.  </li>
      <li>Took the advice I saw in an online &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; video, and detached the leads from the old battery (and left them soldered to the circuit board).  </li>
      <li>My razor was 12 years old and now, with a little oil and this new battery, it&#x27;s like new.</li>

    <li> I installed this battery into my Norelco razor and at first the razor ran strong and kept the charge for a significant period of time. After only a couple of months, the razor is running with less pep and the battery discharges quickly.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install if you know basic soldering technique.  Only one minor problem &#x3D; the spot welded tab on the negative end came off so I soldered it back on the battery.  NOTE:  This is generally not a recommended thing to do.  The #7 TORX tool is an added bonus.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> This works. The screwdriver it comes with is a necessity because hardly anything else will fit it, but the thing works.  My razor was 12 years old and now, with a little oil and this new battery, it&#x27;s like new.</li>
    <li> Worked just fine, although Norelco requries you to unsolder/solder the battery in, but that just makes it impossible to break loose.  And the torq screwdriver, for those who don&#x27;t have a set, opens the razor right up.</li>
    <li> This item was all I needed to fix my dead Norelco (stopped holding a charge).  Torx #8 is the right tool to open the case.  Took the advice I saw in an online &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; video, and detached the leads from the old battery (and left them soldered to the circuit board).  Then, I just &amp;#34;tinned&amp;#34; the battery terminals, and the leads on the circuit.  I put the battery in place (polarity is clearly marked, on the old and new batteries)- and just soldered in place.  Motor ran as soon as I moved the switch.  Initial charge is critical- so, plug it in and wait 12 hours or so.  Factory battery lasted around 10 years, so this one should be good for a while.</li>
    <li> I had an older Norelco 68xx model and it was torturous shaving any more.  Very slow and was not happy, but loved the shaver.  Ordered this and came with the rights parts,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to trim the leads the have to go into the circuit board a little.  REMEMBER:  You have to unsolder the old one and solder in the new one.  But if you have the iron and tools, its easy.  if not take it to an electronic shop and give them $10.  Cheaper than a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge great and VERY happy with this price and quality.  We&#x27;ll check back in a year...</li>
    <li> Better battery than the original one in the razor. My only complaint is having to artificially inflate the word count in the review.</li>
    <li> I was not able to install battery without additional tools. This is not a &amp;#34;pop in&amp;#34; battery. Must be hard wired.</li>
    <li> Simple to change the battery (New shaver about $60.00)  They include a small sized screw driver!  And the fee coaster for my coffee!!!</li>
    <li> Saw this on Amazon while checking for replacement batteries for my electric shaver.  Saw HQRP had replacement battery. Decide to purchase the battery. This is great, was easy to install with a minor problem. The original battery slot on the circuit board was a little smaller then the contacts on the battery. All you have to do is widen the hole a little and everything is good.&lt;br /&gt;Currently charging battery for use. I would recommend  HQRP for replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Very happy :)&lt;br /&gt;I put in this new battery 3 or 4 weeks ago, and my shaver has been running on the initial charge I gave it, since then, and I&#x27;m using it every day!&lt;br /&gt;It seems that this never happened with the original battery when it was new.</li>
    <li> I was not aware when I ordered the battery that it required soldering .. Therefore I was unable to use it . A waste of money...</li>
    <li> Just the thing to refurbish an old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement battery for my Norelco shaver. Fairly easy to install, and better capacity than the original. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I never reiceived the battery and have been in contact with the shipper and never got any help with my request</li>
    <li> If you have some soldering skills, this is an easy way to repower your shaver.  Has been in use for several weeks now.</li>
    <li> Why this thing includes a coaster, I have no clue. The battery was a little bit of a pain to put in because the tab was wider than the slit in the circuit board. I only gave this 3 stars because after charging, it still didn&#x27;t seem to work. This could be because the shaver itself was bad or any other number of factors outside of the control of the company.</li>
    <li> Only used once, hope to still have it next time i have to replace the battery again, worked well.</li>
    <li> A simple 10-minute job with a soldering iron and the job is done. The negative terminal lead did need to be narrowed with a pair of snips to fit into the slot on the board, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to resurrect a dying razor. If you have the most basic soldering skills, you can do this.&lt;br /&gt;As for the drink coaster, it is an odd item to include. But, hey - free coaster!</li>
    <li> Batteries were right for the model razor. Took out old batteries and soldered in the new batteries. Charged up the unit and started shaving.</li>
    <li> This was a good find. It was a great price also. This was a good find. It was a great price also.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly and breathed new life into my Norelco 5812XL razor. It used to hold a charge for only an hour and now goes for weeks. Having the correct Torx #8 screwdriver come with the battery was great and even included a coaster to hold a beverage of your choice for the victory party. I did use a small pair of fingernail scissors to trim a VERY small sliver of metal off the negative battery tab so that it inserted into the slot in the circuit board.</li>
    <li> The enclosed Torx #8 driver was exactly the size needed to disassemble my 6613X razor.  I found a video on another website that was very helpful; it showed me how to peel the contacts off the old battery and use them to solder the new battery in place without having to solder on the board itself.  Then I charged the new battery and the razor now runs as good as new, and more importantly, it continues to run for two weeks of daily shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHORTCOMING: I have marked it down a star because the HQRP battery shows no polarity marking.  None.  Only by comparing it carefully with the original battery could I detect a subtle difference in the shape of the end caps and infer that the \\&quot;CE\\&quot; end is +.  If you happen to install it in the wrong direction, I believe that at best you&#x27;ll kill the new battery, and possibly worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question: why does HQRP include a coaster?</li>
    <li> works great in my razor ,good product.</li>
