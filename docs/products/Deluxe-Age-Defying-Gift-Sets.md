<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cannot say that it took away any wrinkles, but don&#x27;t expect it to in just about 4 weeks.  There is no miracle in a bottle.  But I can say that it feels great on my skin, I like the texture of both items and would purchase again, as you do have to give a product time to work.  I gave it four stars as the cap for the  moisturizer got damaged in shipping, an actual hole, but was lucky that the product did not leak out.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week now and I love it! My face feels so soft</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Cooling. Have not used long enough to write an in depth report, but It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling soft and fresh and has a lovely scent. Fights the signs of aging with minimizing lines just after a few applications!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying using this product.  It feels good and seems to help this aging skin.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, but light when applied.  Gentle to no fragrance so doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mingle&amp;#34; with other fragrances.  Absorbs completely in seconds.</li>
    <li> Works well. Very easy on my skin. High quality product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have only used for about 4days but my skin already feels so much softer and smoother. I can&#x27;t wait to see what results await after I have used it for  a few weeks. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great value, and great product!  Skin feels so soft!</li>
    <li> This is an addition to my line of products from this company. i love all of their products, works great on my skin, doesnt leave a greasy residue, very light weight, smooths your skin. I wake up feeling refreshed &amp; clean. Definitely would recommend this product to my friends!</li>
    <li> Currently using these and an eye cream. I apply my eye cream first and then the serum. The serum is nice, I only need two pumps and it is enough to cover my whole face and neck. It is a light fragrance that isn&#x27;t too perfume heavy. The serum is actually pretty thick and you can really feel it when it goes on. Easy to apply and glides nicely and evenly. After a minute or two it absorbs into the skin (you will still feel it though). Once that is absorbed you add on the moisturizer which is white and creamy and thick. The  moisturizer is also a nice light scent. While it goes on and glides over the skin you will feel it and it is thick and slightly tacky to touch until it is absorbed into the skin. Moisturizer will make your face feel slightly cool and takes a while to soak into the skin (it is okay for me though because I am using it right before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I spent the whole day traveling yesterday and on a plane for about 19 hours, when I finally reached the hotel I was dehydrated and my skin just felt dry in some places oily in others. I put these on before I went to bed and I am really surprised at how nice my face/skin looked this morning when I got up. It is re-hydrated and soft. I also think there was some plumping effect as I don&#x27;t seem to have as deep a line underneath my eyes. Seems to be really clear as well. If you have issues with dehydration I would say give this a shot.</li>
    <li> i received this product at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..it arrived within a timely manner and was packaged well.i applied both the serum and wrinkle cream as directed and after using ththese products for only a couple days my eyes do feel a little tighter around my crows feet ..im still testing so we will see what happens..the skin cream isnt greasy and it does make my skin softer..</li>
    <li> This is a great box. It would make an excellent gift for any lover of facial products that you know. I had used their Anti-Aging Facial Serum already and loved it. Now I can say I love their moisturizer also. A little bit goes a long way. This also currently comes with an E-book called &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; and promo codes for your next purchase. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Thank you Le Fair!</li>
    <li> Perfect combo-great price. Very cooling and hydrating!</li>
    <li> I have used this for only 5 days so cannot see change in lines but my skin feels smoother than it has in years.  I am pleased with results so far.</li>
    <li> Yes, my wife likes it very much.</li>
    <li> I use this product 2x a day both morning and night time after I wash my face. it works instantly making your lines and wrinkles disappear as it leaves your skin with a healthy glow. Then I follow through with my day or night time moisturizer Hydroderm also takes away the tightness my skin feels after I wash my face. This little bottle is a miracle youth restorer in a bottle. I cannot live with out it. Iy works wonderfully on dry very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great products makes my skin feel and look better. Its instantly refreshing nice after a long day.</li>
    <li> Great product to use. Make your skin feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Loved this set. Leaves skin feeling amazingly youthful. Has a nice tightening affect. Grate packaging and came super fast.</li>
    <li> works amazing! feels so good on your skin. Also helped me get rid of &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but half way through the pump on the serum stopped working.  Way to expensive not to be able to use the whole thing.</li>
    <li> This combination of serum and moisturizer is a great anti aging duo for my skin care regime. It hydrates and is absorbed quickly. It is not greasy and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It makes my face feel firmer and yet soft.  It is packed full of anti aging ingredients leaving my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, and she uses it for couple months, she does feel it help.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of moisturizer and face serum.  I use the face serum first with rosehip oil and than the moisturizer.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  When I use this combination I have no need for primer.  I definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I really like this prooduct. The serum is one of the best I have ever used and for the price is not bad. The moisturizer is good and goes well with the derum. I have had inquires as to what I an&#x3D;m doing different as my skin looks more radiant and smooth and mor eyouthful. Love hearing this</li>
    <li> Very smooth feel to skin, no irritation. Have only had it a short while so have not seen any type of results as of yet .</li>
    <li> Le Fair skin cream really is one of the best skin creams i have tried in a long time. After using the cream and serum I noticed my skin texture became brighter and any wrinkles I had were now no longer there. Other skin creams did not work as well as La Fair. I will definitely purchase the cream and serum again.</li>
    <li> Product came in a very good package and that showed a lot about the product. It is a kit and you can follow the detailed instructions for it. I felt very good with this product and I continue to use it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my mom! She said that was great! So,I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love it! Silky and smooth. It feels like it does tighten up my face. Smells great too. A good product to reorder, which I will!</li>
    <li> I use this set around my eyes and my neck mostly. Those are the areas I have the most problems now. I really like this brand (although I&#x27;ve tried some of the pills and they didn&#x27;t work for me) and feel very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so old but i get dry and saggy skin from the weather. Thats why there&#x27;s no reason to not use this amazing product i got. Works well. Skin feela so smooth. No more visible stretch marks. Its still there but its a littlw better. I got this at a diacounted price in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The products arrived as promised.  Packaging was intact, and there was no damage.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used these a couple of days, but thus far they seem to work as described.</li>
    <li> Great product that gives the results that it says it will!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I just started using it, my skin does look firmer when I put it on. It&#x27;s very light weight, goes on smooth. I&#x27;ll be back for the long term result review ☺️</li>
    <li> Wow!  This combo cream &amp; serum is perfect!  It feels luxurious and is super hydrating.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  I have been using it for a month and I have gotten many compliments.  I am sold on this product and will be continuing!</li>
    <li> I like the way the serum feels when it goes on.  The moisturizer when used day or night I do not feel is a moisturizer at all.  Living in Denver the air is dry and I would like to feel my skin is hydrated all day.  I am having to add other moisture to my skin, especially at night</li>
    <li> Love the set. Made my skin feel soft and not oily. The scent was clean and not overpowering. I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I got this using a high discount code. I gave this to my mother as a gift. my mother like it, she said she like the smell.</li>
    <li> These products make my skin feel softer and fuller which help hide my wrinkles. Overall I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product, attractive packaging!  This is really great for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I was exceptionally pleased that I could use both of these products on my neck , eyes and face without any irritation! That&#x27;s unusual for me. The beauty serum glides on and dries quickly and fills in fine lines and pored .Your skin feels tight and toned and you follow with the moisturizer which is very light and leaves your skin with a incredible soft feel! I&#x27;m sixty one and usually use Lancôme products but was wanting to try something else! I have been using about three weeks and I&#x27;m  Evaluating the value of the products! Will update later but I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these products. It&#x27;s rare to find two skin products that perform this well!</li>
    <li> Feels really good on my skin.  Noticeable difference after only using a few days.  This is my new duo.</li>
    <li> Wow! I look like I gained a solid 1/12 year back on my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  The formula feels so good on the skin.  My skin felt softer after using only one day.  It is very moisturizing without being to thick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week I find that I have to reapply the moisturizer a couple of times otherwise my face feels very dry.</li>
    <li> Comes is a decorative box . very expensive looking.  The product is creamy and smooths on lightly that gives a radiance look.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Look younger already! Skin is firmer and feels fantastic!</li>
    <li> Very gentle in my skin love ut</li>
    <li> This set is really great and leave my skin so soft and moisturized. Unlike many of the other serums on the market, I love that this one comes with a moisturizer. I also like the texture of this better. The serum is more of a light cream so it&#x27;s not runny like dropper serums so it is easier to apply. Plus the moisturizer has the scent and texture of a cookie frosting so I love how is applies (it&#x27;s not sticky though!). Definitely love this for daily use :)</li>
    <li> These two products are great! The jars are a good size and the packaging is beautiful! I love them. The jar of cream is soft and silky and drys well on my face. The bottle is a pump and is great as well. These would also make a great gift as the packaging is so attractive. I would highly recommend these. Love Le Fair. Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products they make. I fell in love with these two!</li>
    <li> Helps improve skin. Been using for 2 weeks now and it really works! My skin looks/feels better. Cant go wrong with this combo</li>
    <li> Would recommend  this product works well makes your face looking younger and very smooth</li>
    <li> I love this product... I have very dry problem skin so most products will moisturize temporarily but they do not last long.  This product works, bottom line!  My skin feels so much softer now.  I love that it has natural ingredients like Aloe Vera in it.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft after using this!!  I use the cream at bedtime and use the serum in the morning, before I put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> I so Love this serum! Just started using it &amp; my skin is already changing and very soft too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still observe the results of the products</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the products and think they perform just as well, if not better than their expensive counterparts.  It is refreshing to see a company  that is committed to providing women with quality skin care products without taking us to the cleaners.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, I will keep buying and never going back to my old one this is great!!;):) my skin feels amazing and my big pores are much smaller, I saw a big difference in only two weeks of trying  it thank you Le Fair!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been putting it on the backs of her hands. She loves the results!</li>
