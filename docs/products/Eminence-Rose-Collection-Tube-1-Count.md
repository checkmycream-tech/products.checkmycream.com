      <li>and I feel good.</li>
      <li>What a great way to sample their rose</li>
      <li>however, it may not be good for acne prone skin, as it made me and my sister break out.  </li>
      <li>Gift, recipient loved it.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with every item.</li>
      <li>Really softens your skin and smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The Couperose-C serum works WONDERFULLY on my skin; it&#x27;s reduced the acne significantly, and the sweet rose cleanser is FANTASTIC, as are the rosehip whip moisturizer and the rosehip maize exfoliant (both of which I already knew when ordering).&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin has such a nice feel after using this set!!!</li>
      <li>we love this products</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
      <li>glad they have sample sizes</li>
      <li>and I seem to look better because of it.  </li>
      <li>Also, it smells mildly lovely.  </li>
      <li>and she has fallen in love with them now as well.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>It turns out, I&#x27;m in love with the cleanser, the serum,</li>
      <li>Enclosed chart was most helpful in knowing what to use and when.</li>
      <li>Tube is packaged with easy travel size product.  </li>
      <li>skin has been looking and feeling great for the last week (since I started using these products with my evening cleaning routine).</li>
      <li>This is such great stuff.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been (successfully) using Eminence products for a little over a month now, and have been hemming and hawing over the Rose 6 Piece Collection Tube.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this originally because I wanted travel size of Rosehip whip moisturizer as well as the rosehip maize exfoliant *</li>
      <li>Can not say enough good things about Eminence products.</li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long, it feels good on my skin</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>These small collections are a great way to try the products and decide which full sized ones to order.</li>
      <li>I have liked every single product I have purchased and loved every single product in this combo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The remaining moisturizer (Sweet Red Rose Whip Moisturizer) is just a little too much for my face, but works AMAZINGLY WELL on my hands and smells divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels so much better after a short time.</li>
      <li>So if you are not sure what do you need, or you never used any skin product before, it can be a good buy for you.</li>
      <li>so you can try it our before buying large sizes.</li>
      <li>I found such fantastic results with this regimen.  </li>
      <li>Everything else, I would definitely purchase full size.</li>
      <li>All natural, organic and makes my face look soooo much brighter.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a few of the Eminence lines and love them all.</li>
      <li>They shipped fast and included a 20 percent off coupon for next time.  </li>
      <li>Products promote natural improvement to skin.  </li>
      <li>:) The sample of the product is very small, but it has everything in it.</li>
      <li>The only complaint would be that the red rose treatment stings my eyes.</li>

    <li> Gift, recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> Products promote natural improvement to skin.  Tube is packaged with easy travel size product.  Enclosed chart was most helpful in knowing what to use and when. The only disadvantage was locating where it was sold.  It required contacting the company and them telling me where to locate a supplier in my area.  Very pleased with every item.</li>
    <li> Eminence products are the best! I have liked every single product I have purchased and loved every single product in this combo. They all smell amazing and are great for my skin. The only complaint would be that the red rose treatment stings my eyes. It is great on my skin, but the eye burning made it so I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. Everything else, I would definitely purchase full size.</li>
    <li> This is such great stuff.  Really softens your skin and smells wonderful.  Well worth the money and it goes a long way</li>

What a great way to sample their rose line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining moisturizer (Sweet Red Rose Whip Moisturizer) is just a little too much for my face, but works AMAZINGLY WELL on my hands and smells divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been looking and feeling great for the last week (since I started using these products with my evening cleaning routine).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom after I started using it in March.  I found such fantastic results with this regimen.  All natural, organic and makes my face look soooo much brighter.  I am 47 and have had compliments thinking I was in late 30&#x27;s.</li>
