### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>for the price, it&#x27;s a good item</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked UNTIL I received this adorable shower visor in the mail.</li>
      <li>this works ok.</li>
      <li>Really great for when my baby is in the shower with me, keeps the water out of her eyes really well.</li>
      <li>Cute, floats in the tub, adjusts and fits well.</li>
      <li>But if you can find a version that uses velcro and/or one made out of more stretchable material, the product will serve you longer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
      <li>For the time being, we are using the muchnkin bath cup which seems to do an okay job.  </li>
      <li>Although this shower cap is cute, it did not create a snug fit against the head so water still leaked onto my toddler&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit easily.</li>
      <li>so it would fit securely on childs head ...</li>
      <li>since it neither stretches nor fastens, but is one continuous ring to fit around one size of head.</li>
      <li>I can tell you the construction is good and should be daughter decide to wear it, it is adjustable for her to wear for several years.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly too, when hung up.</li>
      <li>Hopefully for the full span of time that children find a product like this useful.  </li>
      <li>This one worked best for our 3 and  half year old</li>
      <li>But I figured the \\&quot;froggy\\&quot; would make it fun for her to wear.</li>
      <li>Both my 3.5 year old and 20 month old will wear these for bath time - they have HUGE heads and they fit fine.</li>
      <li>My daughter is 4 years old and it fits Her head just fine.</li>
      <li>immediately checked to see if the product fit my five year and my almost three year old.  </li>
      <li>this has really helped.</li>
      <li>I cannot really comment on this because I cannot get my daughter to wear it.  </li>
      <li>has become so much easier.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s much you can do about that though.</li>
      <li>very likely cannot return them now that it hasn&#x27;t worked out ... at least not without a great deal of aggravation and detective work to figure out the procedure -- if it even is returnable at all.  </li>
      <li>Also, it sits high on the head so you cannot rinse all of the hair at once.</li>
      <li>the snaps could be a little better but for the price I cant complain.</li>
      <li>It is cute, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my little ones head</li>
      <li>it took over 2 weeks to get and than when it arrived it was squashed in a very small package so it made it lose it shape and haven&#x27;t been able to get it back into original shape</li>
      <li>this may work for a baby or a very young child.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shampoo visors are useful in general; they end hair washing struggles once the child is old enough to accept wearing one and to understand that the visor will keep the soapy water out of their eyes.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not painfully tight, it won&#x27;t keep the water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess there has to be some compromise in the material between being flexible enough for a tight fit and being sturdy enough to use over and over.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is that my 1 yr old doesn&#x27;t like wearing it.</li>
      <li>We only tried using this once on our 14 month old, and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>I found that the fit was NOT good at all.  </li>

<li> but this keeps the water from running down her face and washing her hair</li>
<li> The price seemed a little steep compared to some of the other shower gadgets on here.</li>
<li> A few drops in her face</li>
<li> It&#x27;s waste of money and I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
<li> I ordered this product to replace an existing shampoo visor, which is looking a little worse for the wear.  </li>
<li> The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s hard to rinse/wash under where the band sits.</li>
<li> I will say Im a little skeptical on the material durability</li>
<li> The package arrived very late (so late that I was just about to go to my account page to find out what had happened to my order).  </li>
<li> Really poorly made</li>
<li> That one (looks like a crown of leaves) is even worse ...</li>
<li> She absolutely hated getting her hair washed because of the water hitting her face.</li>

    <li> Flimsy material. Took long time for delivery from China</li>
    <li> for the price, it&#x27;s a good item</li>
    <li> This does nothing. It is cute, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my little ones head and it took forever to be mailed to my house. Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Although this shower cap is cute, it did not create a snug fit against the head so water still leaked onto my toddler&#x27;s face.  Also, it sits high on the head so you cannot rinse all of the hair at once. Would not recommend.</li>

    <li> I had such a hard time washing my daughter hair because she was scared of the water getting in her eye but this keeps the water from running down her face and washing her hair has become so much easier.  My daughter is 4 years old and it fits Her head just fine.</li>
    <li> Really poorly made and he didn&#x27;t like it at all no matter what we tried to get him to use this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit easily. It keeps falling and can&#x27;t hold the water. It&#x27;s waste of money and I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> My grandson doesn&#x27;t like to get water in his face when I wash his hair, so I started looking for these caps.</li>
    <li> I guess there has to be some compromise in the material between being flexible enough for a tight fit and being sturdy enough to use over and over.  I found that the fit was NOT good at all.  If you snap it tightly enough to keep water out, your child will cry, because that&#x27;s too tight for comfort.

We only tried using this once on our 14 month old, and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  RETURNING, and I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Both my 3.5 year old and 20 month old will wear these for bath time - they have HUGE heads and they fit fine.</li>
    <li> Cute, floats in the tub, adjusts and fits well. The only problem is that my 1 yr old doesn&#x27;t like wearing it. We keep trying, and leave it in the tub with him. So hopefully one day he will give in, so we can stop getting soap in his eyes. Dries quickly too, when hung up.</li>
    <li> this works ok. keeps water out of my daughters eyes fighting her for bath time has been a nightmare. this has really helped. the snaps could be a little better but for the price I cant complain. thank you!!</li>
    <li> My daughter hates to have water run in her eyes at bath time.  This visor keeps the water from running down her face.</li>
    <li> My 2 1/2 yr old daughter has VERY thick curly hair. Washing her hair has always been a fight! She absolutely hated getting her hair washed because of the water hitting her face. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked UNTIL I received this adorable shower visor in the mail. The price seemed a little steep compared to some of the other shower gadgets on here. But I figured the \\&quot;froggy\\&quot; would make it fun for her to wear. And it worked! She was actually eager to take her bath today and actually let me wash her hair without any fight!! I will say Im a little skeptical on the material durability so just incase I&#x27;m ordering the duckie one too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to replace an existing shampoo visor, which is looking a little worse for the wear.  The package arrived very late (so late that I was just about to go to my account page to find out what had happened to my order).  Turns out the package traveled all the way from ~Shanghai~ ... and it included no packing slip or return instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately checked to see if the product fit my five year and my almost three year old.  It did not fit the five year old at all ... and the almost three year old ... only on the very last, widest snap setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very likely cannot return them now that it hasn&#x27;t worked out ... at least not without a great deal of aggravation and detective work to figure out the procedure -- if it even is returnable at all.  NTM the cost of the postage probably makes that impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are shopping for a visor ... this may work for a baby or a very young child.  But if you can find a version that uses velcro and/or one made out of more stretchable material, the product will serve you longer.  Hopefully for the full span of time that children find a product like this useful.  If you are shopping for a child over two, don&#x27;t bother with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo visors are useful in general; they end hair washing struggles once the child is old enough to accept wearing one and to understand that the visor will keep the soapy water out of their eyes.  It&#x27;s a simple device; how hard could it be, right?  I just don&#x27;t recommend this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased another visor version from the same manufacturer to keep in our travel kit.  That one (looks like a crown of leaves) is even worse ... since it neither stretches nor fastens, but is one continuous ring to fit around one size of head.</li>
    <li> it took over 2 weeks to get and than when it arrived it was squashed in a very small package so it made it lose it shape and haven&#x27;t been able to get it back into original shape so it would fit securely on childs head ...</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch. This one worked best for our 3 and  half year old</li>
    <li> I cannot really comment on this because I cannot get my daughter to wear it.  I can tell you the construction is good and should be daughter decide to wear it, it is adjustable for her to wear for several years.  For the time being, we are using the muchnkin bath cup which seems to do an okay job.  A few drops in her face but I just keep a washcloth nearby for  those.</li>
