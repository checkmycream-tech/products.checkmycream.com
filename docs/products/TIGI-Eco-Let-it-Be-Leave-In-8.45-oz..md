      <li>A his leave in was great at first, but after about four months of use it started to turn counter-productive.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and the feeling on my hair.</li>

      <li>I love this product but think it is being discontinued.</li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I love the smell...</li>
      <li>Her hair was so static filled and frizzy</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like strong perfumey scents (they give me migraines)</li>
      <li>I needed a new good leave in</li>
      <li>I like the thicker texture, less hair falls out when detangling and the scents are all wonderful.</li>
      <li>my hair feels a whole lot more silky and shiny... works great so far...</li>
      <li>wonderful and smells great,made my hair very soft.a little bit goes a long way.really great product.i love it.very cool.tigi rocks</li>
      <li>the first couple uses (it takes some getting used to if you normally use a more creamy leave in).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m collecting it while the price is right.</li>
      <li>All in all, it was just okay product, definitely not as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; as it advertises itself to be (read the ingredients when you get the bottle).</li>
      <li>I love how it smells - it&#x27;s like Jergen&#x27;s cherry almond hand lotion, only this one is supposedly made with all-natural fragrances.  </li>
      <li>This products has helped keep my hair from breaking and I always get compliments from the hair stylist for having such healthy hair when I come in.</li>
      <li>but I had also heard a few good reviews</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different TIGI products now and all of them smell good.</li>
      <li>At first the smell was pleasant (to me at least, my boyfriend didnt care for it)</li>
      <li>After the first use I did notice that it detangled my hair well but didnt feel very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>No matter how styled or what products are used, the fragrance of this product stick with you pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>I was very intrigued by this leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Regretfully, only one bottle remained available.  </li>
      <li>and I didnt really know what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I can absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>Even when I put in a lot of it, finally the hair just becomes smooth, not greasy, not sticky, not oily.</li>
      <li>My air is hort and very curly and this keeps my air under control.</li>
      <li>I was just looking for a reasonably priced leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is very course and it needs all the moisture it can get.</li>
      <li>my hair likes it :) curly black hair.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my daughter who won&#x27;t sit still in the tub long enough to wash her hair most days</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy hair, and this product keeps my hair healthy shiny and tame!</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully on my naturally curly hair!</li>
      <li>my hair was soft and shinier than usual but the curl was not as defined as I would normally like it, more wavy.</li>
      <li>I tried this when blow drying straight and it really helped keep the frizz away, but I did notice the texture seemed rougher than usual,although that was quickly fixed with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>but after awhile it gets old.</li>
      <li>This leave-in conditioner did not destroy my hair, but it did not flourish it either.</li>
      <li>I dig the natural inclinations of this product, but...</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>This stuff made my hair really sticky and dry.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s curly state with no other product</li>
      <li>The product is very liquidy which does make it harder to apply</li>
      <li>I like this because it had a very faint pleasant cherry almond fragrance</li>
      <li>Paired with natural coconut oil, this product does wonders to smooth out my frizzy hair without adding unnecessary weight or stickiness.</li>
      <li>Overall the purchase wasnt a total loss because I will continue to use when I blow dry my hair because this product really cuts back on frizz.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>After letting my hair dry naturally to</li>
      <li>and I may have used a little to much</li>

    <li> This stuff smells amazing!  It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product! A little goes a long way and it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy. My air is hort and very curly and this keeps my air under control.</li>
    <li> I love the smell...so yummy! Seems to weigh my hair down, but I didn&#x27;t blow dry..gonna try it again</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a reasonably priced leave-in conditioner. I like many of the TIGI products. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve used it quite how I&#x27;m supposed to (bc they don&#x27;t tell you how to)or my hair just sucks, but it seems to do what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> This product is being discontinued.  Too bad.  It contains expensive emollients and fragrances which are hypoallergenic, unlike Tigi&#x27;s newer products.  I&#x27;m collecting it while the price is right.</li>
    <li> A his leave in was great at first, but after about four months of use it started to turn counter-productive. I wish this product would have been better for me but it just isn&#x27;t. After a while my dry ends wouldn&#x27;t even respond to this stuff. The middle of my waist-length hair would feel like glue, thank goodness I never put any on my oily prone roots. Now I just use it to help detangle my hair after swimming until I use up the bottle and can get a shower.</li>
    <li> I love how it smells - it&#x27;s like Jergen&#x27;s cherry almond hand lotion, only this one is supposedly made with all-natural fragrances.  I dig the natural inclinations of this product, but...it&#x27;s a very thin conditioner, and honestly, I&#x27;m not convinced that it does a whole lot of anything for my hair.  That said, some conditioners have left a gunky gnarliness to my hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t do that.    Better than nothing, but not the best leave-in I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll use up this bottle, but I&#x27;m probably not going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> i have used TIGI &amp;#34;Love, Peace and The Planet Let it Be&amp;#34; for years, but Toni and Guy salons no longer carried the product.  Then it was suggested, and a friend searched and found the product on-line for me.  Regretfully, only one bottle remained available.  The question - will TIGI continue to offer the product to their customers?.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with 4b/c hair. This leave-in conditioner did not destroy my hair, but it did not flourish it either. The smell is not as pleasant as I had hoped it to be either. I ended up just mixing it with a couple of deep conditioners I already had and using it up that way. All in all, it was just okay product, definitely not as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; as it advertises itself to be (read the ingredients when you get the bottle).</li>
    <li> Helps nourish dry hair. My hair is very course and it needs all the moisture it can get. This products has helped keep my hair from breaking and I always get compliments from the hair stylist for having such healthy hair when I come in.</li>
    <li> After only 2 applications (followed by Bed Head ressurection shampoo and conditioner my hair feels a whole lot more silky and shiny... works great so far... my only complaint is that it causes my hair to go from curly to straight when I use it.... I&#x27;ll continue to use it but I am going to find another one that is meant for curly hair just so I can pick which way I want my hair to go for the 5-7 days when I wash it again.</li>
    <li> great for my curly hair</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE hair product! Paired with natural coconut oil, this product does wonders to smooth out my frizzy hair without adding unnecessary weight or stickiness. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the TIGI Love, Peace and The Planet Let it Be Leave In Conditioner kind of on a whim. I needed a new good leave in and I didnt really know what I was looking for. I think I fell for the bottle and hippie theme but I had also heard a few good reviews so I caved and spent the extra money. After the first use I did notice that it detangled my hair well but didnt feel very moisturizing. The product is very liquidy which does make it harder to apply and I may have used a little to much the first couple uses (it takes some getting used to if you normally use a more creamy leave in). After letting my hair dry naturally to it&#x27;s curly state with no other product my hair was soft and shinier than usual but the curl was not as defined as I would normally like it, more wavy. I tried this when blow drying straight and it really helped keep the frizz away, but I did notice the texture seemed rougher than usual,although that was quickly fixed with a flat iron. No matter how styled or what products are used, the fragrance of this product stick with you pretty much all day. At first the smell was pleasant (to me at least, my boyfriend didnt care for it) but after awhile it gets old. For when I dry curly Im sticking with my regular herbal essesence conditioner. I like the thicker texture, less hair falls out when detangling and the scents are all wonderful. Overall the purchase wasnt a total loss because I will continue to use when I blow dry my hair because this product really cuts back on frizz.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair really sticky and dry. I tried to comb through my hair with my fingers and pulled out chunks of hair (it was that tangly and flyaway). I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there - leaves your hair great and smells wonderful.  Don&#x27;t miss out.</li>
    <li> my hair likes it :) curly black hair.</li>
    <li> wonderful and smells great,made my hair very soft.a little bit goes a long way.really great product.i love it.very cool.tigi rocks</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair, and this product keeps my hair healthy shiny and tame! I don&#x27;t like strong perfumey scents (they give me migraines) and it took me a long time to find something I liked that didn&#x27;t smell bad to me. I&#x27;ve tried several different TIGI products now and all of them smell good. I like this because it had a very faint pleasant cherry almond fragrance and it works!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.....</li>
    <li> I was very intrigued by this leave in conditioner. Even when I put in a lot of it, finally the hair just becomes smooth, not greasy, not sticky, not oily. I can absolutely recommend it. I love the smell of it and the feeling on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product but think it is being discontinued. It works wonderfully on my naturally curly hair! I hate that once I find a product that works that I love they discontinue it!</li>
    <li> First, it smells great.  Second, I notice that my hair feels less dry since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I bought it for my daughter who won&#x27;t sit still in the tub long enough to wash her hair most days never mind condition it.  Her hair was so static filled and frizzy I thought this would be the perfect solution.  It was.  But now all of us use it.  Even my husband loves it.  Great buy, but I wish it was Prime eligible.</li>
    <li> Got it for $1.15/bottle.  I think I bought 5.  :)  It smells very nice and works well.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
