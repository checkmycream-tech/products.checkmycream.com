<ol>
      <li>This shampoo is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>a wonderful problem t0 have</li>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair in great condition.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and was so happy that I thought to go on line to see if I could buy some.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also great for people with itchy scalps.</li>
      <li>Smells great, nice volume.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and most shampoos leave my hair either too tangled or too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This product did nothing to make my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>I love the Eufora line of hair care products.</li>
      <li>I love all Eufora products.  </li>
      <li>I am sure others would enjoy this product but for my hair it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>very, very fine straight hair and EVS gives it lots of body and holds curls nicely.</li>
      <li>Eufora products had been referred to me by one or two hair stylists - and I was happy to see the product actually works.</li>
      <li>Light and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine - almost baby fine - and this product actually provides more volume and body.</li>
      <li>It is nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much that I keep re-ordering.</li>
      <li>Received quickly</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this shampoo but the price point is just too high.</li>
      <li>It came in a box that wasn&#x27;t right for packing the&lt;br /&gt;size of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>you really need to give it a full 30 day trial to get a feel for it.  </li>
      <li>my scalp was very very dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I suspect that the shampoo inside this bottle is not the same shampoo inside the bottle I bought for more money at the salon.</li>
      <li>the shampoo, I use the Eufora Daily Balance Conditioner and love that as well, so I would suggest using both to get the results you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This shampoo really works!  </li>
      <li>The month of consistent use gives your hair time to really acclimate to the product in order to reap the maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so on, I noticed a loss of hair, and have certainly noticed a difference since using Eufora Volumizing</li>
      <li>so I believe it&#x27;s this particular type versus the Eufora brand.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re new to the line, keep in mind</li>
      <li>I first starting using this shampoo</li>
      <li>Bottle is a bit hard to squeeze, so I would have given it 5 starts if the packaging was better.</li>
      <li>FYI, My hair is color-treated and naturally curly.  </li>
      <li>It looks and smells different although the label on the bottle is exactly the same.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was so happy that I thought to go on line to see if I could buy some. I moved and had to buy it every year when I went home for a visit.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I keep re-ordering. I am a cancer patient and with all the tests and so on, I noticed a loss of hair, and have certainly noticed a difference since using Eufora Volumizing Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;With the shampoo, I use the Eufora Daily Balance Conditioner and love that as well, so I would suggest using both to get the results you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you that I didn&#x27;t have to finish the product before noticing the difference.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist carries this line, and she raved about it.  So I purchased this from Amazon.  It is nothing special.  I would not purchase it again.  FYI, My hair is color-treated and naturally curly.  This product did nothing to make my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I love all Eufora products.  If you&#x27;re new to the line, keep in mind you really need to give it a full 30 day trial to get a feel for it.  Eufora products should come with a money back guarantee after 30 days of use, backed by Eufora itself.  The month of consistent use gives your hair time to really acclimate to the product in order to reap the maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is one of my favourites.  Not only does it help volumize but it&#x27;s also great for people with itchy scalps. A little bit goes a long way and it lasts forever. It&#x27;s also coloured, chemical-treated hair friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  It is concentrated enough that it makes it inexpensive to use so a bottle will last me about 5 months.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE HEAVY HIGHLIGHTED HAIR AND IT REALLY IS TERRIFIC.  BONUS, IT HAS A WONDERFULL SMELL AND WORKS HAND IN HAND WITH EUFORA CONDITIONER.</li>
    <li> I am sure others would enjoy this product but for my hair it didn&#x27;t work well. My son uses the clarifying shampoo for dandruff and says it works well so I believe it&#x27;s this particular type versus the Eufora brand. I have total grey hair so that also might be the problem.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Received quickly</li>
    <li> Eufora products had been referred to me by one or two hair stylists - and I was happy to see the product actually works. My hair is very fine - almost baby fine - and this product actually provides more volume and body. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I really enjoyed this shampoo but the price point is just too high. There are other products on the market that are just as good that are less expensive.</li>
    <li> It has Aloe in it.&lt;br /&gt;When I first starting using this shampoo my scalp was very very dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now my scalp is almost too oily.&lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful problem t0 have</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works!  Only a little bit is needed so it lasts a long time, too.  I have very, very fine straight hair and EVS gives it lots of body and holds curls nicely.</li>
    <li> Same shampoo as the salon sells.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I like, but the way it is delivered, not good.  It came in a box that wasn&#x27;t right for packing the&lt;br /&gt;size of the bottle.  The shampoo bottle was dirty looking, had black marks on it from the box.  The shampoo itself&lt;br /&gt;should have had tissue or something around it, then put into the box.  Flatten on one side also when arrived.</li>
    <li> Was what I expected and worked for me.</li>
    <li> I love the Eufora line of hair care products. My hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for about four years now and it just works so well with my hair type.</li>
    <li> Light and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> I suspect that the shampoo inside this bottle is not the same shampoo inside the bottle I bought for more money at the salon. It looks and smells different although the label on the bottle is exactly the same. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling the same way either. I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed.</li>
    <li> Smells great, nice volume.  Bottle is a bit hard to squeeze, so I would have given it 5 starts if the packaging was better.</li>
    <li> I have med tex hair.  I use the volumizing  shampoo with the moisture shampoo, just add a little and I think it helps.</li>
    <li> The last time I got my hair cut, the stylist used this and recommended it, so I bought some. It smells great and leaves my hair in great condition. I have very fine hair and most shampoos leave my hair either too tangled or too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;. This shampoo is perfect for me.</li>
