<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> High quality, very sturdy, glad I paid the extra price for this, it will last forever.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, looks great. A bit over priced. Definitely on the smaller size.</li>
    <li> Much easier to hold than the Conk bowl I had been using.  At first I thought the bottom diameter might be too narrow for the large Edwin Jagger brush I have  but it seems to work fine. The ridges on the bottom help the brush lather up a lot quicker than bowls with a smooth bottom.  The glass seems a little thin so I wonder if I&#x27;ll eventually break this.  Oddly, the ivory on this is much &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; than the ivory on the Edwin Jagger brush &amp; Edwin Jagger razor, so it DOES NOT match.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cup.  I have used it with my Klar shaving soap and it works like a charm.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome handle to make it easy to control!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and about as traditional as you get. Best way to lather up I&#x27;ve tried as well. The old school knob handle is much better than a regular mug.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this item only to find that it is so light that I fear I will break it during use. I find myself being very easy with it b/c I worry about it breaking after its higher than some price.</li>
    <li> Great shaving mug. Purchased 2, gifted one.</li>
    <li> Purchased this recently.  Edwin Jagger products are always top notch.  This mug holds plenty of lather for a 3 or 4 pass shave.  It is easy to grip and keeps the lather warm throughout the shave.  It also looks great on the counter with a brush and razor.  Although its not cheap, I expect it to be around a long time.</li>
    <li> A little deep but works fine. Once he puts a puck in there and forms it. It will be fine.</li>
    <li> This product is comfortable to hold and easy to use. It cleans up with very little effort. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first Edwin Jagger item and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it. As a result of the quality of the mug, I will be investing in one of their brushes very soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and size.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap glass shaving mug, this is a gentleman&#x27;s shaving bowl. Made from porcelain in a classic design, you will be proud to have this sit on your bathroom counter. The only thing I can fault it for is that it forced me to go out and buy other Edwin Jagger accessories to match it.</li>
    <li> The mug looks good, is fairly thin, and light weight. Although if your going for an all ivory look like I did you might be a little disappointed. The mug is not as creamy looking as the edwin jagger d87 and ivory colored brushes. Rather the mug is greyish. Overall, the mug isn&#x27;t really worth it. I will be getting a wooden bowl to replace it soon. That would look much nicer with my ivory accent shave set.</li>
    <li> My son in law loves it.</li>
    <li> It is very good quality and it was delivered on time as scheduled i recommend it I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced</li>
    <li> The handle is a nice feature, and it is also nice to leave my kitchen mugs in the kitchen. However, it does not hold heat as well as the kitchen mug I was formerly using. This is likely a result of the wide mouth, which does make it much easier to mix up a lather.</li>
    <li> Okay,  I have been using a coffee mug or hamster food bowl for 20 years or so and decided to buy one of these just too see if it was better in some fashion.  Yes, it is.  With the knob, you cancomfortably hold it in your secondary hand and happily work up a lather.  The shape keeps the lather where it belongs.  And the walls are just the right thickness.  I have a brush with very long hair and it works ideally with this bowl.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to shaving with a DE razor and using a brush to apply my shaving cream about two years ago. It was an \\&quot;Art\\&quot;ful all-in-one bundle of product, needing only the razor to be supplied. I had experimented with building the lather directly on my face, cupping my hand with some water, etc., but I knew I wanted to get a mug. My wife surprised me with this one and it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be. The handle is easy to use, the ridges in the base of the vessel help build lather, and leaving it in a sink of hot water ensures my lather stays warm for the entire duration of my shave. The fact that it&#x27;s made in England rather than farmed out for a cheap price or maximum profit is just icing on the cake. It&#x27;s a very dignified and luxurious piece to have, and I love it. Easily worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using Art of Shaving cream, and cannot comment on what soaps do or do not fit.</li>
    <li> I prefer a larger width that is shallower. This cup is deep and narrow, which causes the lather to get all over the brush handle and my hand. I also have to make small lather circles to whip the soap. I also expected the cup to have more weight/quality feel like the rest of the EJ products. The lighter material, which I assume is ceramic does not retain heat well.</li>
    <li> Bought this few weeks ago. It is really nice and very good quality. You can use anything to mix shaving soap in  but I bought it because It looks real nice with  my Edwin jagger razor, badger brush and chrome stand. The shaving mug also has a nice handle.</li>
    <li> Base is too narrow to fit some soaps (Art of Shaving) and for use with creams. Can&#x27;t lather without hitting the sides of the cup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s your basic shaving bowl. The inside has four ribs to make lathering easier, the handle is comfortable (I am right hand dominant and use my left hand, nestling the handle in between my middle and ring fingers with my palm up.) Very easy to clean and very durable.</li>
    <li> Good quality bowl but the shape always forces the lather up and out onto my hand and brush handle. If I did it over again I&#x27;d get a different one.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, just don&#x27;t drop it. Ribs on bottom work well and lather works up side leaving room for your hand.</li>
    <li> Its a cup for soap....</li>
    <li> After a few months of using this shaving bowl, I can say it i a decent bowl. It is very well made, pretty, has ridges on the bottom for improving the making of lather. Up until here, very good.&lt;br /&gt;What makes me give it a 3 star rating is it&#x27;s really small diameter. This would be a great shaving bowl if it was bigger. It is only good for my small Art of Shaving traveler size brush. For my regular size Crabtree &amp; Evelyn (made by Edwin Jagger) brush, is very small. All the lather you make ends up getting pushed up and eventually out of the bowl which makes it really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Recommend it if you use a small brush. Definitely not recommend it if you have a normal to big brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and very nice feel/look.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size and thanks to the raised lines in the bottom of the cup make a nice lather. the handle feels good in the hand and over all this mug feels right. weight is good and quality is high.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because I was tired of him using our mugs for shaving.  Not only does it look great but has held up nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice little shaving mug and it works great!  However, the price for this mug keeps me from rating more than &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I bought a porcelain mug so it would hold heat. (I soak my mug and brush in very hot water before lathering.) This mug was perfect, and stays warm enough to apply a nice warm lather on my face. Also stylish!</li>
    <li> I searched a long time to find a product that was good quality and for a good price. I love this brand and by boyfriend loved it even more. Definitely the best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I bought two, one for myself and one as a gift.  Local stores don&#x27;t carry them, so Amazon is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you to use a cup, this style cup is easy to keep a hold of with wet hands.</li>
    <li> This manly piece of traditional shaving paraphernalia looks handsome in the display shower&lt;br /&gt;reflective up high end remodeling.&lt;br /&gt;The Olde English finish and shape are quite attractive as well as functional.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice elegant looking soap bowl.  And it has the main feature I was looking for in one, which is surprisingly hard to find on amazon, the nub handle.  Something about that type of handle to me screams straight razor barber shave I see it and I picture a barber lathering up.  This piece completed my shaving kit and made it official in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an addition to my shaving set. I really enjoyed it until I accidentally knocked it over and broke it. It was a little expensive considering that you can accomplish the same thing with an old coffee mug but I really liked the Edwin Jagger logo and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like you grabbed an old coffee mug for your shaving set. It looks really nice in the bathroom and doesn&#x27;t look like you were lazy and left your coffee mug in the bathroom. I also loved the shape and the handle. My brush is not big so it fit perfectly fine and creating lather was not an issue. The off white &amp;#34;bone&amp;#34; color was really nice and quality was great. The size and weight  of the bowl was perfect for my hands which are small and I was able to grip it nicely while lathering. I set it down to clean up the sink and knocked it over breaking it but I will definitely get a replacement and take better care not to break one again. I don&#x27;t like making recommendations since criteria vary from person to person but for me, I was not disappointed and didn&#x27;t feel like I wasted money but rather  felt that I paid for something nice and received something nice that met my expectations.</li>
    <li> No better shaving bowl for me!&lt;br /&gt;Just the right size for Art of Shaving Soap, it fits nice and tight at the upper end of the bowl, the bowl is easy to handle in the hot shower..</li>
    <li> Works great to create a lather using the matching badger brush. I love this old school look and feel and hope that it becomes a family tradition.</li>
    <li> A quality shave mug, it leaves 1/4 inch space around 3oz.bar of shave soap and has four 1/4 inch bumps inside mug &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works really well. Fits the smaller (2&amp;#34;) soap with a little room, but those larger soaps may have some issues. No big deal if you break it up in pieces. My pops loved it!</li>
    <li> It is what it is and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> There are three bumps in the bottom of the mug to help the brush make lather.  Awesome design, the only thing is if you have a small brush it may clink on the sides of the mug while making lather.  great form and function!</li>
    <li> Nice, quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I spent the extra money on this. I just used it today for the first time and it allowed me to whip up a great lather in no time. The mug has a very refined look about it and I think the ivory color is the most elegant. It doesn&#x27;t show dried cream as the black one might. I thought the squarish shape at the bottom of the mug would be less than ideal, but as it turns out, it gave me a good grip when I held it from beneath (when not using the handle). The three ridges on the inside serve two purposes - 1. to help whip up a lather, or 2. if you use hard shaving soap, it keeps it from sitting in any residual water in the bottom, allowing the soap to dry after use. I highly recommend this mug!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I bought Col. Conk shaving soap (puck) and it fits very nicely in the bottom of this mug with just a little space left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;br /&gt;You can put a full puck of soap into this and microwave it to melt the soap into the mug. This allows the soap to completely dry after each use since water can&#x27;t seep in under the puck.</li>
    <li> This a very handsome, manly shaving bowl. Classic in shape and smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;I like the color I chose, I have read reviews of the black bowl and understand water marks can be seen on it, even after a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;This bowl looks GOOD on my granite bath countertop next to my brush and razor, Edwin Jagger by the way as well.&lt;br /&gt;Fine products, fine indeed!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving mug, which adds a bit of a class to my morning shave and makes it that much more enjoyable. Compliments my Edwin Jagger DE89L perfectly. So far I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk shaving soaps, which fit perfectly. Retains heat well, and is easy to hold even with wet hands.</li>
    <li> I mostly soap lather and put my refills in tins. I like this mug for making lather or putting in a puck-soap that I want to use more often. Good weight, size and handsome to look at.</li>
    <li> This is my first Shaving Soap Bowl so far I have enjoyed have it. it is not as heavy as I would have thought and is deep enough for my brush.</li>
    <li> Love this classic shaving cup, top quality.</li>
    <li> A regular bowl does a better job, this looks good though in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This cup has ridges in the bottom that I believe helps with the lathering process. The handle is great. I&#x27;ve enjoyed it since I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the lighter color, but I received the black one. Upon getting it, my wife liked the color better, so I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> What is it:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving soap bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed, blemish free, beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logo is small and discrete, and the color matches any decor nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle knob on the side is very handy when holding the bowl and mixing soap, and the shape lends itself well to mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a tad &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than I thought it would be - it&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s so lightweight to hold, but, I do have a general fear that if I somehow drop it one of these days (gets slippery with soap and water!) I&#x27;ll be out a bowl and need a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again/recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, good product, high quality and well worth it, great brand, great bowl!</li>
    <li> Item as described very good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok as the bowl is well disign and not to heavy for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this mug if you let a soap puck in the bottom your lathering will be difficult as the brush will always take more soap, if you remove the soap the mug will be really deep, especialy with the &amp;#34;Edwin Jagger Best Badger Shaving Brush With Drip Stand&amp;#34; short hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommand a good lathering bowl, like the capitain choice who is incredible, with a classic Cella or Proraso soap. Now this mug is only decorative for me.</li>
    <li> Great quality porcelain bowl with excellent attention to detail. This is my first shaving bowl and most likely my last unless something drastic happens. No doubt why Edwin Jagger is highly regarded in the shaving product industry.</li>
    <li> This shaving bowl is definitely top quality and well made but it does cost a fairly good amount. It&#x27;s got the features one would want in a quality bowl. The handle is easy to grasp and the bottom of the bowl has ridges built in to help with making lather with the brush.  Unless this is dropped and broken or something I don&#x27;t see why it won&#x27;t last for as long as you will be around to use it.</li>
    <li> Beware, beware, beware, beware!!  Way too small to accept Caswell-Massey shaving soap refills and CANNOT be returned.  What a total ripoff!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, sturdy and blends well with the other shaving products that I ordered.</li>
    <li> very nice shaving mug!</li>
    <li> He loved it - I just wish it would have come with soap that fit; the one I bought was too large and will take lots of time to shrink with use to fit the bottom of the mug.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas from my wife this year along with a Merkur DE 47c and an Omega brush. Very high quality, as is with all the Edwin Jagger stuff. Very easy and comfortable to handle with wet hands and is extremely lightweight. It has ridges in the bottom so you can leave your soap in it and it can drain. This mug is very beautiful on the sink next to your razor and brush. A very nice addition to your shaving routine.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed at the heft of this specific soap mug. My grandfather had one back in the day that could be used to club bad guys and still provide a nice vessel for a shaving lather. Edwin Jagger does make some beautiful products at a high quality, but to my tastes, porcelain should be a bit heavier and thicker to provide some piece of mind when using some heavy handled shave brushes (stainless steel and the like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific mug works decently for soaps, but it really shines when used with a tube good quality shave creame (and possibly a little glycerine). It transfers heat quite well, due to it being a little thinner than it&#x27;s competitors in it&#x27;s price range, and keeps your lather nice and warm in between passes. I also use it when I clean my razor and blade after shaving since the bottom can hold enough alcohol to cover the blade and head of the razor without a bunch of waste in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle also provides a secure holding point for wet hands when refluffing and rehydrating your lather after your first pass, which is significantly thicker than any other part of the mug. This heavy handle helps to balance out the weight of the mug making it more comfortable to hold for a few minutes while working a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my only niggle with this specific mug is the thinness of the walls, where everything else is more than adequate for a good shave mug.</li>
    <li> Good bowl. I previously bought and used 2 or 3 different regular bowls (cheap Walmart ones), they just weren&#x27;t quite the right size for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this has the handle and it&#x27;s not rounded on the bottom so it&#x27;s easier to hold on the bottom or using the handle. I would prefer if it was overall just a bit wider though. The most recent bowl I used was too wide so I need something in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is a good bowl. Definitely pricey but what the heck I actually half kind of like shaving now.</li>
    <li> Very nice , high quality shave soap mug !  Feels great in the hand and looks great - a very nice cream color with a nice , tasteful looking logo .  Many different size shave soap &amp;#34;pucks&amp;#34; will fit in here with no issues.</li>
    <li> This a great shaving bowl. it looks great and is great quality too. You will not be disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> I just started using DB razors and this cup is perfect for whipping up the shaving soap. The handle helps a lot and is comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> The bowl has a great vintage feel and hubby is using each time he shaves. That&#x27;s what you want to hear when you give a gift :).</li>
    <li> I was very happy I ordered this ad a gift and it had a great look for the cost of the item very classy. It was the perfect accessory to the straight razor I purchased as well.</li>
    <li> This is a good bowl for making lather. Looks good, too. That said, I think it is overpriced, and I notice pictures of apparently identical shaving bowls at half the price. But maybe they are not identical. Or maybe we are paying for the Edwin Jagger label</li>
    <li> Nice high quality soap dish.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Cost was higher than most but very nice product</li>
    <li> Ordered this because I wanted to try shaving with a DE Safety razor. Received as promised and very nicely made. Now just waiting for the Soap....</li>
    <li> I must agree with most all the other reviews. Excellent workmanship and looks great on my bathroom sink area next to my Edwin Jagger Badger brush and drip stand and Merkur razor. The ridges at the base do help to gather a nice lather as well as to prevent shaving soap from sitting in a puddle of water and it does retain heat (I rinse it out with hot water prior to applying my shaving cream). Do I really require such elegance to get a good shave? Of course not. I could use a coffee mug for all that. But it proffers a certain sense of style to what might otherwise be deemed a dreary early morning chore. Love it. Hope it doesn&#x27;t break!</li>
    <li> I feel like a big deal every time I use this thing. Like I&#x27;m pampering myself or something. Plus it looks good sitting on the counter. It costs more than I would have liked, but I deserve nice things. Shaving is much more enjoyable when you have nice things to shave with. It&#x27;s funny how the little things turn a grooming chore into an enjoyable, relaxing experience.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Builds up a great lather and looks sharp on my black marble bathroom countertop. Use it with shaving cream</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not wide enough which makes lathering kind of annoying. Other than that it looks great, is a pleasure to hold and makes lather...</li>
    <li> I use a very expensive silver tip badger brush with Jagger and Trumper shaving creams. My razors of choice are Jagger DE89L and Merkur Futur. So why would I want to use a cheap bowl or mug to shave with. This mug being porcelain keeps the lather warm, whips up a great lather, is easy to hold and looks very classy on the bathroom vanity. Maybe some people will consider me a shaving snob but isn&#x27;t that why we DE shave to begin with. It&#x27;s just another part of a great shave that makes you feel good and not a chore.</li>
    <li> Top quality product! Perfect for whipping up a great lather on your brush! Edwin Jagger makes products to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> It is my second EJ bowl.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one that got dropped, it&#x27;s got a nice wide mouth for whipping up lather. Hear some complaints it gets cold, I fill mine with hot water before my shower, then empty and work in soap, stays warm for a decent amount of time. I&#x27;d recommend, I don&#x27;t keep soap in a mug as it will dry out without cover so that&#x27;s not an issue for myself, if you do this mugs not for you, most pucks won&#x27;t fit, but there are some that will.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this shaving mug and I actually bought two, one for me and one for my brother for part of his graduation gift. I was happy with the feel of the mug and I love how deep and wide it is.  It has three little &#x27;grips&#x27; on the bottom to keep the soap from rotating when you brush a new cake of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the mug is that it&#x27;s aesthetically appealing.  I love the look of it and it goes good with a classy looking brush and razor set. This gets 5 stars and a triple BOOM!</li>
    <li> My Lover has no complaints about this. He likes how it flares at the top making it easier to create a nice thick lather. Has a comfortable weight and the knob does it&#x27;s job perfectly even with his gargantuan hands.</li>
    <li> Very nice bowl. Deep enough so not to lose lather. Handle is big enough to grip securely.  Color is great and uniform. The Edwin Jagger logo is clear and has yet to rub off. Has splines to lock in soap puck. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my SECOND Edwin Jagger mug. My first bit the dust when it was accidentally dropped by my wife. I couldn&#x27;t find something that was a better replacement, so I bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint - draw your soap and whip it up in the cup. Place the cup into your sink with your warm water and wait a few minutes. You&#x27;ll have some nice warm shaving foam to shave with. After your done, just rinse inside and out and you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the perfect size. It allows a good foam to work up and fits his hands great.</li>
    <li> This mug is precisely what I wanted.  It looks exactly as pictured, and holds my Col. Conk shave soaps just fine.  It&#x27;s deep enough to work up a good lather and not spill, and the handle is easy to hold.  Classic bowl, great purchase, feels solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the material, shape, color and the weight, and fit perfectly with the soap. A little bit pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> purchased to make set complete. Kind of pricey, but it was Edwin Jagger</li>
    <li> This is very nice.  I really like the look and feel.</li>
    <li> For my recent birthday, my wife bought me an EJ best badger brush (great product).  I liked it so much, that I bought an EJ DE89L (also a great product) and this shaving bowl to go with it.  Boy, am I glad I did. The bowl looks fabulous and has a very nice heft to it.  Mixing up really good lather is a breeze and relatively quick.  Being made of porcelain, the bowl retains heat nicely, and the handle is sturdy as well.  Yes, it costs a bit more than the competition, but so what ... it may cost about $10-$15 more than lesser or other mugs, but that small difference is well worth it.  Also, consider that there&#x27;s a pride of ownership factor at play here. I feel good and a bit pampered in owning this bowl; it&#x27;s an elegant product and I think I&#x27;m worth the extra few bucks to have it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this at all and, if you&#x27;re like me, you just may crack a smile of satisfaction each time you use it. Highly recommended, as are all the EJ products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaving mug, it is the proper depth to allow your brush to mix up a good shaving cream/soap for shaving.  I wish it was a bit heaver as I like to keep in the sink filled with hot water while shaving to keep the shaving soap hot, if you have a full sink it wants to float and is somewhat top heavy (will turn over -not float), but that is just a minor issue.  I would recommend for anyone that is doing DE shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to add a touch of elegance to the shaving routine. It was extremely well received. The mug looks beautiful in the bathroom amidst their other shaving accessories. They loved the handle and said it made it very easy to grip at the proper angle. If you know someone who shaves with a safety razor (a huge comeback in the past couple of years) then this is the go-to gift. They are sure to love it.</li>
