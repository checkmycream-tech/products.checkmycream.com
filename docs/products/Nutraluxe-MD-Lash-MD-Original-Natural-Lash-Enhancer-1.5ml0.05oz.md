<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second tube!  This stuff works!  Friends are asking me if I have lash extensions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years and it WORKS. My lashes are so long. I am 67 years old and have the lashes of a teenager. People all the time mention how long my lashes are. LOVE this product!!! Wish it was a bit less expensive although it does last about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product on my lashes for several months and am very pleased with the condition of my lashes. They are longer and healthy with less breakage. Thank you for making an affordable solution for eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase for this product.  I liked it so much I bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This really has made a difference for me.  Now I look like I have eyelashes.</li>
    <li> there really isn&#x27;t any noticeable change at all  I am very disappointed in this product which was recommended to me  and I certainly followedthe applcation&#x27;s instructions</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and have gorgeous lashes!!! I get comments all the time about them and have at least 6 people whom have ordered this product now from amazon based off of seeing my new lashes.  My lashes were puny and blonde before and I never received complements on my eyes before.  I love this product!:)</li>
    <li> It was recommended i buy this to grow my lashes. i couldn&#x27;t tell if i saw a difference or not. however, i have eyebrows that are rather short and this product grew my eyebrow hairs in. so now i can get an arch! buy if you have short brows! and i&#x27;m also not sure if when i applied this to my lashes if i was responsible for making my eye jump. i&#x27;m going to buy it again and see if the same thing happens twice. i haven&#x27;t used it in months.</li>
    <li> Works just like latisse</li>
    <li> It worked great for me and I&#x27;ve tried others with no results.  It does take 4-6 weeks to see the difference but it thickened, darkened and lengthed my lashes a bunch.  This is the second tube I have bought.  It lasts for about 4 months - once a day use.  So it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Keep trying for a month hoping it will work but nothing happened. I lost so much of my lashes instead bc it makes my eyes itching all the time. It&#x27;s over a month and I can&#x27;t even return it now. Completely waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I found this product because it works. The product is reasonable in price and lasts a long time. I had missing eyelashes and now my eyelashes are full. I cannot see myself not using this product because it works.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a month but I feel as though my lashes are getting fuller.  I&#x27;m using it on my eyebrows, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it definitely helps with the length of my lashes.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product it caused some irritation so I stop and went back using it and now it&#x27;s fine I did notice my lashes got longer but nothing dramatic.  after all eyelash growth is mostly genetic but this does help</li>
    <li> This stuff is outstanding!  I got fake eyelashes glued in for a wedding and low and behold when it was time to take them out most of my regular eye lashes came with them.  A friend recommend this and in about a month they were really improved and almost back to normal.  In about 6 weeks they were back to normal but longer!  I really love this stuff and so far one tube has lasted me almost 2 months.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Side note: if you get it in your eye, and it will happen,  your eyes will get red and irritated but it will only last a couple of hours.  So it&#x27;s definitely something you use at night.</li>
    <li> I love Nutraluxe MD.  Your eyelashes grow almost overnight.  I have the longest eyelashes that I have had in years.  I received it in about a week.  This product really works.  I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job.  Worked as well as a more expensive product and as quickly, but did not turn my eyelids dark brown like the other one did.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on efficacy.</li>
    <li> This product Does not work! Used for 3 weeks everyday! Waste of money!!!! Do not think about purchasing this product!!</li>
    <li> Nutraluxe MD really works.  You can see results in about 3-4 weeks.  How could you live without it?  I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> this. stuff. works. it will sting if it gets in your eyes so watch out!</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for a long time.  Loved it. I bought two at a time. The last time the second tube didn&#x27;t work and lasted less than a week. Supplier would not replace because it was past 30 days.  I am using Grandelash enhancer now,  including the mascara.  Too bad the supplier didn&#x27;t stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of months to see improvement. I now have full, long lashes.  I&#x27;m sold on NutraLuxe Lash. I run a cosmetic counter, and have ladies who know me,  asking me what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve told many ladies what I&#x27;m using and they are now customers too. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this product, and during my research of a few hours this had the best, most consistent reviews.  The same day I got it, I applied it on clean eyes before bed and repeated the application for two days.  I noticed a very slight stinging, but no itching.  The next day my eyes were pink.  I still applied the following night before bed.  My eyes became increasingly pink - all the way to the irises - and I had massive bloody patches below the lid - like really big patches of blood shot eyes.  So I cannot use this product.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had this problem.  I cannot say if it works, and did not notice any other side effects, but bloodshot eyes is enough reason for me to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Takes a couple months but works wonderfully:) have ordered multiple times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> not the real stuff. normally a great product. I have noticed  it didn&#x27;t work last few time I bought it from this seller.</li>
    <li> I have seen wonderful results with the product.  My eyelashes are visibly thicker and longer.  My eyebrows are also darker.  The price is very reasonable.  I have had several comments and inquiries if Im wearing false eyelashes. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised,  I&#x27;ll check back in a month to see how it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve brought this product from another vendor last time and didn&#x27;t see the results I expected as i did from previous vendor.</li>
    <li> I bought it once from a different seller and it was great. Bought it again from this seller and it burned my eyes and didn&#x27;t work the same at all. Customer service refused an exchange .. I threw it out. Bummer</li>
    <li> It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t have a color - but probaly the best product  have ever used! It actually works and my lashes are much longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
