<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A wonderful scent for him.</li>
    <li> A whole bottle was out of the question for my boyfriend&#x27;s Christmas present, but it was nice to be able to get him this smaller size so he could wear it on occasion and I could still get him something else for Christmas, too. I don&#x27;t know much about reviewing scents, but I like it. Smells like a man :). Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
    <li> There was a paper sample of this in my Ulta magizne and my boyfriend tried it and it smelled amazing (breath taking) on him so I bought this one and I wished I got a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> The absolute best fragrance I have ever sampled.  Worth the price!  Highly recommend the sample spritzers- you will want the full-sized bottle soon thereafter!</li>
    <li> I am glad i could buy this because then i could see if my bf really liked the product or not before buying a larger bottle that he may not have even liked. Great stocking stuffer for xmas.</li>
    <li> They were just the perfect size and did not leak, to take on a trip. My husband uses Chanel Bleu all the time ,but had the large spray bottle. Since we could not take that, these were just perfect. They also wennt right through airport screening without a problem.</li>
    <li> If you like Chreed you will like this cologne as well.  My husband is difficult to find cologne for and I am pretty picky about smells.  I am very sensitive to most smells so finding something that I like and he liked too was critical.  We agree on this and Creed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.  I just love it.  I highly recommend it. Bleu has a sort of citrus aspect to the scent and is a really great cologne.</li>
    <li> Ok Smell, last about 3 to 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The platinum by channel is a much better cologne.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...............this is better than old spice or brute, thats for sure !!</li>
    <li> smells real close to the real deal but i have my suspissions if its real&lt;br /&gt; i got a real bottle from macys&lt;br /&gt; WOW best and most noticed scent i&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
    <li> A refreshing aroma that fits any occasion...&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting and although a bit pricey, well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;The ladies enjoy it !!</li>
    <li> i love blue its so sweet and masculine cent for me love chanel great seller will buy more when i ran out</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to test out before I bought the larger bottle. He loved it! It smells really good on him and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I brought this after a friendcwas wearing it. I use itcas an room spray because it really smells good.  If I ever meet someone I hope he wears something this good. Lol</li>
    <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend. It smells so great and was shipped very quickly. The ONLY problem I had with it was that the cardboard holder in the picture did not come with the order; the bottle was just in a little plastic bag. Now I need to figure out what to put it in so it doesn&#x27;t look tacky...</li>
    <li> Smells excellent and I will be getting a larger bottle now. This was a tiny bottle but perfect for trial and I used it up quickly.</li>
    <li> This is most certainly fake. I can detect that the cover has been spritzed with bleu de chanel; however, the stuff inside the bottle smells totally different and bizarre. It&#x27;s some other cheap perfume. Dont buy this and do yourself a favor by buying the 1.6 oz</li>
    <li> #1 favorite men&#x27;s fragrance of all time. Nice to purchase sample size to make sure recipient likes the fragrance before purchasing a large bottle for gift-giving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance and I express them in the future I&#x27;ll buy more than Symbol I&#x27;m proud of her</li>
    <li> This is great .All my friends ask what i&#x27;m wearing and where they can get it !!!!!!!!!!!Thank you . I will get more</li>
    <li> Here you go if you want your gal to have some great parfume. I like the smell of it and my wife won&#x27;t have anything else. A bit spendy in  my opinion but the good stuff always is.</li>
    <li> I bought the regular size for my husband, but sometimes I wear it as well.  Excellent unisex fragrance!</li>
    <li> It was not what I had wanted and that was my fault because I did not double check the name.  Disappointed because of the quantity received for the amt. of money was a little over priced.</li>
    <li> The cologne shipped quickly and smelled great. I need to check their inventory. In the market to buy more scents.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this stuff is heavenly!  I had smelled a sample in Sports Illustrated magazine, and fell in love!!!  I was SO happy to find such a little bottle, as I was not sure if the recipient would share my enthusiasm.  Not sure if he did.  My son ~ he doesn&#x27;t tell me anything.  His girlfriend liked it, though!</li>
    <li> Great great great great best full bodied but not over powering scent Chanel remains a classic great timeless iconic scent</li>
    <li> The item was shipped and arrived very quickly, the fragrance was not quite what I expected but it was okay...I would recommend this for an individual who likes classic scents.</li>
