      <li>I get many compliments when I wear it</li>
      <li>A nice, clean, non-sweet but girlie scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance, while it looks like a tester, the fragrance is soft and beautiful and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for me to try D&amp;G products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
      <li>She was so excited!</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and I would definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice smelling calogne for a man or woman.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and refreshing, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Clean, sophisticated, feminine.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>this one was very light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend for guys who don&#x27;t like bright, sweet smelling colognes.</li>
      <li>Its a good product , I had the original one before from D &amp; G stores , and its just the same , I bet this is original too.</li>
      <li>She has enjoyed it so much and asked that I give it to her as a Christmas gift again this year.</li>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance at a good price, however I was a bit disappointed that the bottle of perfume I bought was a &amp;#34;Tester&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only warm and feminine smell I&#x27;ve tried that isn&#x27;t revoltingly spicy.</li>
      <li>does not like very fruity / sweet scents.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that this was considered unisex, because I had always thought it smelled very much like cologne.</li>
      <li>I actually purchased more to ensure i do not run out.</li>
      <li>Modern and fresh.</li>
      <li>The calogne is marketed toward women however when it was first released it was considered a unisex calogne.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty tacky to have it sitting on my shelf looking</li>
      <li>I was really expecting this scent to hold up to all of the reviews that I read.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really see a girl wearing it.</li>
      <li>I really like the scent of this perfume, I feel refreshed when smelling it.</li>
      <li>Maybe the real thing does, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>After my first bottle ended I decided to get something new.</li>
      <li>I have had more people ask me about my fragrance when I wear this perfume than any other I have ever worn.  </li>
      <li>and now I love that it&#x27;s $10-15 cheaper than the local big box stores!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I ordered a new Cartier and started using it but realized I missed my D&amp;G.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I notice is the smell wears off pretty quickly if you put it on your skin; therefore, I have started spraying it on my clothes (which I normally DO NOT do).</li>
      <li>Clean fragrance, I catch all members of the household using it, both male and female.</li>
      <li>The woody tones are more common in a men perfume.</li>
      <li>25yr old Male</li>
      <li>Long lasting and highly addictive.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

<li> Shipment came earlier than expected as well.</li>
<li> A previous reviewer said someone followed them in a grocery store and I am not surprised!</li>
<li> It looks pretty cheesy sitting there on the bathroom vanity.</li>
<li> The selling price on amazon is about half the price I&#x27;ve seen it in department stores.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  </li>
<li> so I lost half the product, but my purse smells AMAZEBALLS!</li>
<li> That said it&#x27;s my only disappointment with this perfume.</li>
<li> and I never have to re-apply, but with L&#x27;amoureux #6 I have to re-apply at least once a day.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through at least 4 bottles, and I think this is of the few scents I&#x27;ve actually finished the bottles before getting sick of it.</li>
<li> it was a fake smell, watered down.</li>
<li> I suppose this could be because the base is alcohol and not oil?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing!! I am so glad I bought this, it couldn&#x27;t have been better. The price is cheaper than anywhere. It&#x27;s a must have and the best deal!!</li>
    <li> I have had more people ask me about my fragrance when I wear this perfume than any other I have ever worn.  I actually had someone follow me through a grocery store once in order to find out what perfume I was wearing! LOL!      The combination of earthy elements makes this a go-to signature scent.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this perfume, I feel refreshed when smelling it. I use it all the time even at home ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size is big enough .. price is good ..</li>
    <li> Favorite sent on earth ! Musky, and delicious in the perfect way. Great for night time. Plan on more purchases !</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, while it looks like a tester, the fragrance is soft and beautiful and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for me to try D&amp;G products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this fragrance for some time and now I love that it&#x27;s $10-15 cheaper than the local big box stores!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my partner (which means I get to use it too). It has become a tradition for me to buy D&amp;G #6 and D&amp;G #1 on alternating Christmases.</li>
    <li> Great perfume. It&#x27;s closer to a men perfume, but it can be suitable for a woman too. The woody tones are more common in a men perfume.</li>
    <li> I have worn and am a fan of Versace&#x27;s Crystal Noir.  This, D&amp;G 6 is reminiscent of that fragrance.  A nice, clean, non-sweet but girlie scent.  The only thing I notice is the smell wears off pretty quickly if you put it on your skin; therefore, I have started spraying it on my clothes (which I normally DO NOT do).</li>
    <li> I was really expecting this scent to hold up to all of the reviews that I read.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  Maybe the real thing does, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> NO STARS. it was a fake smell, watered down. DO NOT purchase</li>
    <li> all i can say is that my wife liked it a lot and she is picky, does not like very fruity / sweet scents.  this one was very light and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> My very favorite scent....I wish it came with a matching lotion! Shipment came earlier than expected as well.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s for women but it&#x27;s unisex. I wear it, the girls are constantly asking me what it is. &#x3D;) 25yr old Male</li>
    <li> The D &amp; G 6 L&#x27; amoureux perfume smell really good. I bought it for my husband and he liked it.</li>
    <li> I just received my order. and to my surprise. is a TESTER without box!</li>
    <li> Clean, sophisticated, feminine. My staple fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I get so many compliments when I wear it!  Glad to find it at a discount.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this perfume and they were not selling it in stores anymore. I was able to buy it on here and give it to her for Christmas. She was so excited!</li>
    <li> Smells great!, i have used this for a few years already and it never gets old. I actually purchased more to ensure i do not run out.</li>
    <li> Clean fragrance, I catch all members of the household using it, both male and female. I get many compliments when I wear it</li>
    <li> Modern and fresh. Love it. Long lasting and highly addictive.&lt;br /&gt;All of the d and g frangrences are excellent. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance at a good price, however I was a bit disappointed that the bottle of perfume I bought was a &amp;#34;Tester&amp;#34; bottle. I think it&#x27;s pretty tacky to have it sitting on my shelf looking like I stole it from a department store or something.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this fragrance and I love it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that this was considered unisex, because I had always thought it smelled very much like cologne. I couldn&#x27;t really see a girl wearing it. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on this cologne. Smells 10x better after it sits for a day I&#x27;ve discovered. Would highly recommend for guys who don&#x27;t like bright, sweet smelling colognes.</li>
    <li> Its a good product , I had the original one before from D &amp; G stores , and its just the same , I bet this is original too.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and always get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through at least 4 bottles, and I think this is of the few scents I&#x27;ve actually finished the bottles before getting sick of it.</li>
    <li> Bring this scent back!  Why does the stuff I love always get discontinued? Ugh.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mother last year as a Christmas gift. She has enjoyed it so much and asked that I give it to her as a Christmas gift again this year. She said when she&#x27;s out shopping, strangers stop her as she passes by to ask what perfume she is wearing because they like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to perfumes. The scent of most perfumes upset my stomach, but this one doesn&#x27;t. The scent is light and refreshing, not overpowering. So, I&#x27;m happy my mother likes it. I have already submitted an order so that she will have it for Christmas again this year. :)</li>
    <li> THIS HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE SINCE IT CAME OUT. YOU CAN WEAR IT DAY OR NIGHT. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my wife&#x27;s request for her.  She uses it as a work perfume.  The price was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was a good deal, I was disappointed in that it is not the bottle pictured.  Our bottle is labeled as a demonstration sample not for resale. It looks pretty cheesy sitting there on the bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> This time I ordered 4 bottles of D&amp;G6 spra!  My 3 co-workers liked it on me and asked me to place an order for them too.  After my first bottle ended I decided to get something new. I ordered a new Cartier and started using it but realized I missed my D&amp;G.  So I ordered it again and use it as a day perfume and use Cartier for evenings.</li>
    <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s the only warm and feminine smell I&#x27;ve tried that isn&#x27;t revoltingly spicy. A previous reviewer said someone followed them in a grocery store and I am not surprised! It doesn&#x27;t last very long however. I suppose this could be because the base is alcohol and not oil? I also like to wear White Musk (an oil) and I never have to re-apply, but with L&#x27;amoureux #6 I have to re-apply at least once a day. That said it&#x27;s my only disappointment with this perfume.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;amoureux, c&#x27;est vrai! This perfume has a very warm aroma with sweet spices and a nice musky scent. Loving this perfume!</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you :::)</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance!  I get so many compliments on this.  The only downfall was that the bottle came apart and spilled into my bag so I lost half the product, but my purse smells AMAZEBALLS!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear it, I am asked what I am wearing.  My favorite!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> The calogne is marketed toward women however when it was first released it was considered a unisex calogne. The selling price on amazon is about half the price I&#x27;ve seen it in department stores. Shipping was quick and I would definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice smelling calogne for a man or woman.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, its awesome&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it to all my girlfriends, I get a lot of compliments</li>
