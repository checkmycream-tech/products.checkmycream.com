    <li> This Xeryus is my favorite fragrance for my husband. I bought it years ago from Dillards and I have always wanted my husband to continue using it.</li>
    <li> As advertised – Prompt shipment –  Recommended **** Note the original lasted a bit longer</li>
    <li> I ordered the product which had a description of 3.4 oz what I got was the 3.3 oz.  I ordered this specifically because I was matching a eau de toilette I already owned.  I order from Perfum1 because of the description. When I contacted Perfum1 the customer service group helped me out and explained that while the bottle was different the product wasn&#x27;t.  They updated the site pictures within a day.  They also offered to accept a return for the product. I was worried about losing out on the orignal shipping and they made that right too.  I ended up keeping the bottles because of their quick responses and customer service.</li>
    <li> Awesome...just as I remembered it and much better! I hated having to ferret through all the impostors though!! Well worth it...I guess!</li>

    <li> Love it.  Nothing like it.  Distinctive.  Mature by doesn&#x27;t make me smell like an old man.  Not musky or fruity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 25 years. If like females, this is a sure way to get them!! No kidding this works on women! There is another way to say it, but Amazon would not like it. Lets just say ( Cat in a bottle). Taupe</li>
    <li> Xeryus is something I have ordered from you in the past and both me and my partner love it. Please keep it in stock.</li>
