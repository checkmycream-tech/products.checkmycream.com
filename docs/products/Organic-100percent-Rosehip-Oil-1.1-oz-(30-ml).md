<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a great oil.  The only thing i don&#x27;t like so much is the bottle top - i find it a little tricky to get the oil to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that it is a great item and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nice carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and makes a wonderful mixed with your facial moisturizer. Great product, Great size and great price!</li>
    <li> It is a 4 to 5 star product for me. Many nighttime moisturizers clogs my pores. As a result, I&#x27;ve skipped wearing any in the summer. I could no longer skip it when the winter dryness kicked in.&lt;br /&gt;The positive reviews of this oil prompted me to give it a try. I have combination skin recovering from acne. It is definitely adventurous to try wearing 100% oil. At first, the oil seemed to just sit on the skin, forming a greasy layer. Leaving it on overnight, the greasiness went away. I felt my skin softer the next morning after washing my face. I&#x27;ve used it every night for weeks now. The skin tone of my face is looking brighter and more even.&lt;br /&gt;I like the mess-proof dispenser. You just tap the bottle against your palm repeatedly to get the right amount. Rubbing my palms to warm the oil before putting it on my face seems to speed the absorption.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel or see any improve on my skin :(</li>
    <li> great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;I love rosehip oil for my acne prone skin. Combining it with an African black soap used once a day and this oil twice a day has definitely made a difference. The only thing about this particular rosehip oil is that I found myself having to apply it rather liberally.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil was everything I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin.  Made me break out something terrible.  Trying to find another use for it.</li>
    <li> I have cystic hormonal acne on my chin, and I tend to get a massive breakout all at once. I believe that this oil helps to heal my sores faster than if I just use a moisturizer and acne treatment. Combined with salicylic acid and tea tree oil, I&#x27;ve seen marked improvement in my skin. If used alone, I feel like it tends to clog my pores, but I can&#x27;t be certain. The smell is a little .... weird. I don&#x27;t quite know what to think of it.</li>
    <li> I am female, mid-30&#x27;s, mixed race and have dry skin. Oily in the T-zone but otherwise dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried. Smell is okay, not great but not awful. I consider myself sensitive to smells and find that this smells slightly sour but dissipates quickly. The only other facial oil I&#x27;ve tried is Josie Maran Argan Oil which is lovely/unscented but also REALLY pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on an environmental kick and I love the idea of a product that has only ONE ingredient so this fits the bill. My face does feel moisturized, but as much as I like this product, it doesn&#x27;t really replace my moisturizer and in dryer months (or on dryer skin days) I need to supplement with a heavier moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for my perfect solution but this will do in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to you!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I had expected. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have tryed other products but this rosehip oil is just wonderful, I mix it into my daily moisturizing (goats milk) lotion and it makes my skin much more softer and younger looking takes away some of the redness and just makes you face feel great. And I received my package very quickly no waiting for ever.</li>
    <li> Product works but the reason why i give them a 3 stars is because shipping took forever to get here.</li>
    <li> Though I found out I&#x27;m highly sensitive to this oil I still love it and am extremely pleased</li>
    <li> Organic Rosehip Oil arrived faster than estimated. Was packaged well. I just started using so can&#x27;t provide feedback on benefits of it&#x27;s use. Goes on easy, has an orange-red color but color doesn&#x27;t stain skin. Using on hands for fading of brown spots. It absorbs easily, very faint odor. Not sure if I would use it on my face. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I experienced the typical teenage acne. I had a few residual scars from it. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have been using this on my face, when I get up and when I go to bed. I didnt wear make up to work on tueday this week, and I was self conscious about not having any on (because of my scarring)...but my co worker made a comment saying that she didnt notice a difference. I went home and really looked at my face that night, and the scarring that I have really is barely noticable. I didnt wear make up for the rest of that week lol..... It worked well. Nothing over night...but before I have finished the bottle, I&#x27;ve noticed a change.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for stretch marks and the quality is just amazing, cute bottle with an awesome dispenser, nice pakage and it comes with a beautiful note explaining where this oil comes from.  I&#x27;m more than happy and I just paid for a second bottle!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it . I heard about rosehip oil and now I have tried it . It is wonderful .And wonderful fast service allot faster than I thought. Great Job!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face at night and love it. It helps with my pores and acne. I will continue to use this on a regular basis it  works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great price great product! I love this oil. I use it every night under my night oils/creams. Its a good value too</li>
    <li> I have used rosehip oil for over ten years, since my late 20s. Of the brands available, Trilogy the Australian product has always been the best, deep amber, always fresh and extremely effective, but having travelled and lived in other countries it wasn&#x27;t always available, so I have tried many many different brands and many other intensive antioxidant products, including Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Prevage, the most potent man made antioxidant in existence (and around $150 a bottle).&lt;br /&gt;As any long term rosehip oil devotee knows, regardless of cold pressing, chosen packaging, country of origin (most often Chile) and organic or lesser status, the end product can vary widely in appearance texture smell and most importantly it&#x27;s actual effectiveness on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overstating by describing Nuriva rosehip oil as pretty incredible, and that it blows trilogy out of the water. Deep rich amber in colour (almost saffron like intensity) it sinks in and is completely and utterly non greasy, which for me is the benchmark. Beautiful true fresh essential oil smell (not really a fragrance, just a clean fresh plant oil aroma)&lt;br /&gt;Packaged in dark glass to preserve its integrity, I&#x27;m thrilled with this order, and will keep using it as long as it&#x27;s available. I won&#x27;t bother raving about rosehips  miraculous results on redness,dryness,uneven tone, scarring and lines, because anyone who uses rose-hip oil is already well aware of how powerful it is. Even after using this oil for so many years, I&#x27;m thrilled by the potency of this brand. I ordered it three days ago having gotten down to the last tablespoon of my previous brand, and the difference in effectiveness between the two is blatantly obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I&#x27;ve used amazon regularly for many years but have only ever left a few reviews of products, I&#x27;m a fairly cynical gal and demand a lot of my beauty/personal care products, but when you find something this wonderful, and with no reviews, it&#x27;s worthwhile to letothers rosehip fans know.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought two. I like to get a little sun this time of year to even out my skin tone. No need this year. Noticed a difference in 1 week. I use liberally in my moisturizer in the PM and just a drop in my moisturizer in the AM. At this price, it&#x27;s worth trying. I tried another brand of &amp;#34;organic rose hip oil.&amp;#34; I believe it was in a carrier oil (EVOO), but this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell, a little too heavy for my taste.</li>
    <li> I was going to get the Life-flo rosehip seed oil (organic), but it wasn&#x27;t available at the price I wanted to pay, at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I considered the Now brand, but it wasn&#x27;t organic...and I read the reviews. A bunch of dissatisfied reviewers were questioning the quality of the Now brand rosehip seed oil...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I wanted to find a good quality oil at a low price. I came across this brand (Nuriva). It only had a few reviews, but the one mentioning that it was one of the highest quality rosehip oils that the reviewer had encountered, convinced me. Especially since the risk isn&#x27;t that big, considering that it&#x27;s under $10 for a little over an ounce of organic rosehip seed oil (including shipping and, for me, no tax--I&#x27;m in California).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree -- the quality of this rosehip seed oil is also the best I have come across!&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs into the skin quickly. I have oily skin, so I usually use it in a blend with aloe vera gel and jojoba oil (a squirt of aloe vera gel, a drop of rosehip seed oil, and 2 drops of jojoba), and my skin is loving this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is a rich amber color and lightly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;Note: to my nose, rosehip seed oil doesn&#x27;t generally smell like roses, it usually evokes cod liver oil. While my fragrance description makes it sound vile, I didn&#x27;t find this oil offensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a dropper top -- which I like far more than a glass dropper inside the bottle (which Life-Flo has in theirs) -- due to durability.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price. (I paid $6.49)&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping (I received this product five days ahead of schedule).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wanted to write a review just so the company has some visibility -- and can continue making this oil available at this price!</li>
    <li> using it on my face and it is doing a good job. I have highly sensitive skin and this is the first product I&#x27;ve had that did not make my skin break out</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference between rosehip seed oil and rose hip oil but the seed oil seemed thicker but maybe it didn&#x27;t absorb as well I don&#x27;t really know. I like the tint they both give your face.</li>
    <li> Works good to minimize wrinkles but I didn&#x27;t notice any skin tightening. This is why I cannot give 5 stars</li>
    <li> I am pretty pleased with the results, it has faded some of the dark spots I had from melasma (pregnancy mask). I didn&#x27;t have a terrible case, but it did lighten the spots I had. At the time of this review I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, so I know that the full results have yet to be seen, but I do consider it a very worthwhile purchase. I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hands, since they tend to be very dry, and it&#x27;s made my skin soft and smooth. The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because I&#x27;m not seeing a dramatic difference, but if I continue using this and the results keep coming, I&#x27;ll adjust my review. All in all, good price, good for your skin, and decent results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it! Smell terrible like a fish oil! And it didn&#x27;t work in my scar acnes on my face. I feel like I put the oil from what I just got done fried a fish!!!</li>
    <li> I am using this with combination of vit c and phytoceramides. My skin looks smoother and younger. I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
    <li> Love it, it really makes my face soft, I have also used it on my body. A cheap way to moisturize and have had no reactions to it. A great buy.</li>
    <li> Absorbs very quickly leaves skin soft and silky. Well worth the purchase you can also add it to your favorite creams or lotions. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Worked as promised. Shipping was great. Will order again without a doubt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my sunscreen in the morning, and with lotion at night them smooth it over my neck, face, chest and hands</li>
    <li> I had heard that rosehip oil is a wonderful skin refining treatment.  I don&#x27;t see a difference after using it nightly for a while.  I&#x27;ve been applying it on my face, neck, and decolletage after cleansing and at bedtime.  I don&#x27;t love the smell of this product, which smells nothing like roses.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry and i have a lot of acne and pimples. I use it as a moisturizer for my face before i sleep but would wake up with a flaky and stretched skin. Compared to this, argon oil works best for my skin.</li>
    <li> I add my Rosehip oil to the lotion I use on my body along with another oil essence that also gives me my my own personal &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s why I like the fact that this oil is not scented so it doesn&#x27;t fight the scent of my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; essence aroma oil.</li>
    <li> I bought the Trilogy, NOW, and Nuriva brand of rosehip oil over the last few weeks to try it all out and this one was my least favorite, due primarily to its fishy odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trilogy -- way more expensive, about $22, but was the best (sort of). It was bright yellow, light, and absorbed really quickly. Didn&#x27;t smell at all....until about 2 months after being in my bathroom cabinet. Now it has the fishy smell too. I won&#x27;t buy it again unless I get the tiny container and use it up asap. (purchased in Feb 2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW -- super cheap, less than $6 for the same amount. Liquid is clear, can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s yellow because of the dark container. When it goes on my hand, it&#x27;s colorless. Does its job, but I feel like it might have vitamin e oil mixed into it as it&#x27;s pretty thick compared to the other two. Still feels nice tho. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again. (purchased in Mar. 2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Nuriva one. Pricing was pretty good, less than $10 and had more 0.1 ounce more product than the other two. Came in a bright orange liquid. Texture was slightly thicker than the Trilogy one, but not as thick as the NOW brand. It feels nice on the skin. Only thing I couldn&#x27;t stand is the strong fishy odor (like it went bad one. The odor is much stronger than the Trilogy one that went bad). The smell is so pungent that I don&#x27;t want to use it on my face. I don&#x27;t want to waste it so I use it on my hands now instead of using hand cream. Since it absorbs so fast, my hands still feel dry and I still prefer to add hand cream afterward. Been using it for almost a month and still can&#x27;t tell if my scar on my hand is getting lighter or not. The scar was from a scrape a few weeks back. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. (purchased in Mar. 2014)</li>
    <li> I saw an episode on Dr. Oz that was about Rose Hip Oil and the benefits of it. I&#x27;m using it on my face for the bags under my eyes and to help my skin look better. I have noticed a difference on my face and eyes. I will continue to use this product. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the smell is a little unfavorable. It DOES NOT smell like roses if that&#x27;s what anyone is expecting. Oh, my husband has been using it for dry patches on his hand and it started softening the skin after the first use.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying rose hip oil, but this seems to be a very nice product (especially for the price). It burnt orange in color, and smells warm (nutty/earthy) both of which are, according to what I&#x27;ve read online, indicative of quality pure organic rose hip oil. It also says that it&#x27;s from Chile, which is where rose hip oil originates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried buying another brand (NOW) which smelled very nice but was totally different. It was clear in color, an smelled fruity. It also didn&#x27;t absorb the way that a dry oil tends to, which makes me think that it might not be 100% pure and organic like the Nurvia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that whether you&#x27;ve been using rose hip for years or your just curious and want to give it a try, then go with the Nurvia. You really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I should also say that it was nicely packaged and arrived before the earliest estimated arrival date. Great experience overall with this product (I&#x27;m now purchasing my second bottle).</li>
    <li> Thank you Nuriva Herbals LLC for having this 100% Organic Rosehips Oil. I like this product and I highly recommend it to those looking specifically for 100% Organic Rosehips Oil. Thanks for the great customer service as well!!!</li>
    <li> I use it every night after the shower. It works much better than my expensive creams! And it hydrate my skin without acne. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months now, and it is my favorite oil to use on my face, daily. I don&#x27;t use it under my makeup, I use it after cleansing and removing my makeup.  I use all kinds of organic oils for body and hair care.  Castor and coconut for hair, rose hip for face, hemp and olive for body, flaxseed for inside.. well, you get the idea.)  Rosehip oil has a high natural vitamin a content, retinol, which is fantastic for all facial skin problems.  Twice to three times a week, in the evening, I also apply a bentonite clay and organic milk mix facial mask, leave on for twenty minutes, wash off and apply this rosehip oil to my skin.  It&#x27;s just amazing, and the oil does not irritate my face at all, which is prone to breakouts.  Customer service is also excellent, you can tell that they care about the products they are sending out.  I do usually order directly from the Nuriva website, as the prices are usually better than here.  The oil goes on smooth, and has a plantlike scent.  I absolutely love love love it.  When you are done applying it to your face, use the extra on your hands and smooth it on the backs of your hands, an area usually neglected.  I try to apply it several hours before bed, because I want to enjoy all of the benefits, without giving it all to the pillowcase!  I also store mine in the refrigerator, because it does last for some time, and I store many of my organic oils in the fridge.</li>
    <li> Ordered the evening of July 1st, delivered in Hawaii July 5th. Amazing! This is a gift to a friend. Hope it lives up to its quality reviews.</li>
    <li> Great oil and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This rose hip oil is great! leaves my skin feeling amazing! would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> i think this stuff plumps my skin from the inside out. i use one drop around my eyes and another drop around my mouth, the crow&#x27;s feet and cheek lines. soothing and sweet smelling and makes me skin all glowy.</li>
    <li> Okay for moisture but not scars- need something more potent. Its pure rosehip oil which isnt good as addition of 0.5% Vitamin E will increase shelf life by a year.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price! Softens skin and fades discoloration. Wonderful for dry skin and under eyes to soften fine lines. Buy it now if you want glowing, perfect skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Leaves my skin soft and never oily.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil.  Like the results.  Ordered because saw benefits of oil on Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> Product is okay bought it for help with rosacea but cannot tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Pleasant faint smell, easy to apply and seems to moisturize nicely</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. It came in a timely fashion. thank you</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Have my mom and sister in law trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teresa</li>
    <li> Best skin oil.. My ever night routine.. Made my skin super smooth and flawless</li>
    <li> Given that my skin has been acne prone pretty much since my teenage years, I have stayed away from oil based moisturizers for the last 30 years. I still have combination skin with an oily t-zone, however, my face seems to be drying out now a bit more. In the past I have always been extremely reluctant to change my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Heard good things about rosehip oil and decided to give it a try with nervous reservation. Few weeks of using the oil appears to have regulated the natural oil content of my skin in a positive way. My face is less oily in the t-zone part and less flaky in the dry spots. I also cannot report any clogging of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the quality of the rosehip oil, admitting that I don&#x27;t have any prior comparison, I would say it has a rich orange color and the smell, at least to me, is not fishy but rather earthy for the lack of a better word. I also like the dark glass bottle and the plastic insert dropper to dispense the oil. I would imagine this helps protect the oil from oxidizing. A few drops go a long ways. I like to drip a few drops of oil in the palm of my hand, add a squirt of my favorite oil free moisturizer, emulsify and spread it all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that it is at an excellent price and if Nuriva stays reasonable with their pricing I will order again and make it my staple skin care. Was also satisfied with the shipping process.</li>
    <li> To the negative feedback—you used product for 2 weeks, so you must have liked it! Now u claim to have discoloration!  I’m not Sherlock Holmes but something just isn’t right, are you a competitor?&lt;br /&gt;I’m on second bottle; friend gave me first one. Fabulous serum; color gorgeous (what ROSE HIP should look like) texture melts into skin…it’s divine and effective. Price is ludicrously low for grade of oil. This serum as well as C should not be exposed to air; the sellers are smart enough to avoid an eyedropper—which allows light and air into bottle. They use a modern plastic device. If it was selling at Niemen Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue for $100, (where it should be) I’d buy it. And, the people that sell it put the H back in humanity. I applaud them for their product and customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I have never counteracted anyone else’s feedback, but I’m compelled to defend this product and the people who created it.  I’m a shopaholic and skin product fanatic. And through the years, there are only a handful of products I would rave about, and Nuriva Rose Hip Oil‘s one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This feedback is legit, from a real customer. This is a must have for everyone’s skin regime. You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Very strong odor, however it fades quickly. To be frank, if I have to smell a little woodsy to restore a few smile lines and crows feet, I&#x27;m up for it!!</li>
    <li> I think that the product is probably ok, but it does have an odor that was described in a previous review. It does make your skin smooth and supple but you have to get over the smell.</li>
    <li> This company was selling this product on their own website for only $2.50 - what a steal!&lt;br /&gt;This is also a US company and has outstanding customer service.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with Life- Flo brand and others, this rosehip seed oil&#x27;s quality is on par, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;It is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderfully and works very well on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering from Nuriva, again, as I like to support independent US companies trying to make it amongst the big- name brands.</li>
    <li> Got it for scars and can also use for moisturizer for face</li>
    <li> I use every nightly face is nice soft my dark spot gone</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when I first bought this oil as it was my first time trying rosehip oil and there are so many brands and prices to chose from, so I just randomly went with this one mostly for the price, I mean what if I bought a 30$ bottle and it sucked? I&#x27;m a college student on a budget soo wasn&#x27;t gunna happen. Anyways to cut to the chase it was great, I used it on my face and it made redness go away over night! Love love this product it definitely has worked for me! I recommend.  p.s this is my first review ever so I mean all this lol</li>
    <li> awesome &amp; pure. good for DIY facial serums or creams</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of rosé hip oil from another company, but after reading a couple of reviews of it smelling like olive oil and I noticed it too, and it was very oily, I purchased another bottle from here. This bottle was twice as much and cheaper than the other company I ordered from. However, it seems that the price has gone up almost a dollar since I ordered here two weeks ago..&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was free but it took to the very last day of their delivery date. It took about 10 days which was a little annoying since I&#x27;m used to getting things in maybe 3 days. Aside from that, I see the oil is from Chile which is where rose hip bush grows and that&#x27;s a sign its true rosé hip oil and when I tried it on my skin, it was not oily at all, like how rose hip oil should be I read. It absorbed very quickly on my hands and my hands felt very soft and not greasy at all. So far, this company seems to be legitimate and the oil seems to be of high quality with a nice plant smell and readily absorbed oil from chile. And the price is very good compared to other companies and how much they give you.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer. Very light, and absorbs quickly.  Also I noticed that after applying, it actually keeps skin feel soft and well moisturizer for long! Just received the purchase so we shall see how effective it is in reducing minor problems on my skin. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be my godsend and relieve me of all of my problems but it just made them worse :( It is extremely greasy and does not absorb well into my skin. Even when I mix it with my moisturizer. It just feels like a film of grease sitting on my face. And I know I am not using too much. I only put one small drop in my hand and barely dab it around my face with my finger. When I go to spread it and rub it in it just feels like it&#x27;s clogging my pores. I have to go back over with a cotton ball to dab off whatever didn&#x27;t absorb. Sure enough, my acne that I&#x27;ve been working so hard at to keep at bay was flared up again the next day after using this oil. Maybe it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;it has to get worse before it gets better&amp;#34; deal, but I am afraid not. I gave this 2 stars instead of one because I have noticed my skin is a little softer and it was delivered a lot sooner than it said. Other than that, this product is nothing at all like I thought it&#x27;d be. I&#x27;m glad it seems to work for other people. But if I wanted to feel like my face was covered in oil, I&#x27;d go in the kitchen cabinet for free and rub on some olive oil.</li>
    <li> good to use for healthy skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product performance! Works on wrinkles, spots, quickly too! Although I don&#x27;t use this daily, I should. Fine lines and deeper wrinkles all look better after using. It is not good for acne and blackheads so avoid those areas, hard to do with wrinkles but if it happens I use very little. Also added to an oil blend less than 20 percent, skin looks luminous and feels velvety. Love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin I bought it for my eczema to add to my hand moisturizers. Saw it on Dr.Oz.</li>
    <li> Dries fast, not oily is really orange consistency pure and potent I believe and healing. Not a miracle or magic but quite good excellent product</li>
    <li> I like how hydrated your skin feels and the glow is a wow...I just add this to my daily cleansing and good to go...Beautiful</li>
    <li> First bottle smelled fishy. They sent a replacement write away. Second bottle a little less fishy. Not sure why but I now buy it locally and it has no smell.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for scaring on my face from hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to try this. What a mistake! After only 2 weeks of using it on my face, I now have marks and discolorations that I know are from using this oil. I am extremely upset over using this, since my skin at 54 is actually very smooth and unblemished. Now, however, I have these obvious marks and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do about it!</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned, redhead model for Vision Los Angeles and ordered this to lighten my facial scaring from teenage acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin and accidentally cutting it easily shaving, this is the perfect oil to rejuvenate my face (research what top models use this and you&#x27;ll be amazed). I&#x27;ve been using Jojoba as a nightly moisturizer and look forward to using Rose Hip Seed as it is especially good for scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research your oils but let me sumerize a bit because each has its strength: Rose Hip Seed is great for rejuvenating skin because it is (vitamins etc)&lt;br /&gt;Caster is thicker so it might clog facial pores but is great for staying on hair over night to grow lashes/brows).&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba is thin, matches the PH of your face, and is great for facial moisturizer because it is thin it helps spread other oils out evenly like extra water to a sauce.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut is great all over as a moisturizer-look it up now if you haven&#x27;t yet.&lt;br /&gt;Start using oils daily and think if them as more powerful, non-toxic organic lotions (;</li>
    <li> Its way too soon, but so far it works pretty well. My skin looks smoother and clearer. My only complaint is the fact this stuff smells like cooking oil and that smell stays potent throughout the day. It also doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I would like, but these are not enough for me to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and have age spots so I decided to give this a try.  I like organic everything and</li>
    <li> I use this every night along with my nightly face cream. Love it</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight product that is helping my skin stay moist without feeling too heavy or greasy.  It comes in a small bottle with an eye dropper and it could be used for travel as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it made a difference on my skin. So I can&#x27;t give it a positive or negative review.</li>
    <li> Very hight Quality oil! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...you can put it in homemade lotion or use it alone and it makes your face feel baby soft. Also is suppose to help prevent wrinkles which is a plus!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, and a good price. This is the first time I have bought rosehip oil so I can&#x27;t compare it to other products but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost daily for about two months now.  I was expecting amazing results due to the reviews here, but what I&#x27;ve experienced is more subtle.  There is a quality to this oil that is not unlike anything I&#x27;ve experienced before.  It moisturizes on a deep level and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  My skin was in pretty good condition before I started using this so that might be why I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  The level of moisturizing is out of this world, if all you&#x27;ve ever experienced is various lotions for moisturizing then you are really missing out.  There really is no comparison.</li>
    <li> Has a faint smell at first but seeing how quickly it absorbed into my skin, and the smooth supple feeling almost the day after made my skin feel like it was hydrated.</li>
    <li> So wonderful - very hydrrating for my face</li>
    <li> I use this as a nightly moisturizer. It has made my skin feel so soft, and when I wake up the next morning, my skin is less blotchy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been one week, but I think it&#x27;s fading age spots/sun damage on the backs of my hands</li>
    <li> Am still trying to find the same quality unrefined Organic 100% Rosehip Oil as the one I ordered directly from Patagonia.  This one is not and the VoilaVe is not either.</li>
    <li> It is fresh and really helps my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Works great!!</li>
    <li> Love it! People have mentioned how beautiful my skin looks! I will continue to use this product!los of results for little $</li>
    <li> Love it cauz is 100% organic , I will be ordening more soon .</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Nice smell, semi-sweet but not strong&lt;br /&gt;2. Long shelf life&lt;br /&gt;3. If kept out of direct sunlight, will last longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Bottle doesn&#x27;t come with dropper. I had to buy a separate dropper so that I can use it easier. If it came with a dropper, that&#x27;ll be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by Jerry S.</li>
    <li> Great oil, moisturize perfect my skin</li>
    <li> Good quality and easy on the wallet</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it on my dry skin as a face moisturizer along with some organic rose water I bought on amazon. But back to this product, I want to just start off and say the following morning that I ordered (I ordered at 1am)  I got a personal email from them saying that my product would be here from 1-3 days and it was! I mean you just cant go wrong with this. Organic, free and fast shipping, and the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen on amazon for the amount of product you get. I was pondering to pay a couple more dollars just for the squeezing top but this actually has a dripping top on the bottle.  And I noticed it&#x27;s actually removable if you didn&#x27;t want it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow! I used this Rosehip oil on my face and on a few scars on my body and I saw results after one day! My scars that were quite red and swollen had lightened and been smoothed. It is not greasy as all, it sinks right into my skin without any residue. I use an expensive primer to smooth out my skin before applying my makeup and I discovered that just three drops of this essential oil produced the same results, while also treating my skin- not just something that will wash away.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the results, my boyfriend even asked if he could use some. I suggested that we could even buy him a bottle and at first he was doubtful, thinking it was very expensive. He couldn&#x27;t believe it when I told him it was only $4.99.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this oil to anyone with any skin type. It is amazing! My hands feel so soft too just because of applying it to my face.</li>
    <li> I really love putting this oil on my face. I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference in my overall appearance it makes, but it feels fantastic. It dries quickly without being oily, and it feels like it really soaks into my skin. I enjoy it much more than the expensive lotions and serums I&#x27;ve used in the past. The first bottle I received was half empty, so I emailed the company and was delightfully surprised by their quick response time with an apology and a new bottle, especially since this was a Christmas gift. I will definitely be purchasing more bottles in the future.</li>
    <li> 50+ with normal/dry skin.  Absorbs quickly leaving skin soft and moisturized without feeling greesy. Better than all of the over the counter moisturizers I have tried over the years!</li>
    <li> This Oil is wonderful when you have try skin as I do. I have very try legs and angles and this oil gives me soft and moist skin all day. Lotions  make my skin feel tight. I also use it for my face and it helped with the redness on my cheeks and forehead .This is a very high quality oil and I like its denseness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using this Oil for about 4 weeks, my dry skin on my legs has improved. I can skip a day. I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the face and under the eyes, this light oil is great to use straight from the bottle or mixed with your favorite lotion.  It has a light fresh scent and lots of vitamin C. Great for all skin types.</li>
    <li> ok not impressed by quality..</li>
    <li> I like the oil but I don&#x27;t really like the smell and the bottle is self it&#x27;s very small.</li>
    <li> I love rose hip oil for its anti aging propeties. This is my second bottle and I am would recommend it to anyone looking for smooth, soft skin. Nuriva improved their packaging with more protection for the fragile glass bottle. It arrived in about 2 days!</li>
    <li> I previously bought the NOW Rosehip oil and realized immediately it was not real Rosehip. Nuriva Herbals Organic Rosehip oil is authentic Rosehip and the quality is really good! I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> The Organic Rosehip Oil was delivered the day before yesterday, so I have had two or three days to use it.  I bought it for some sun discoloration on my forehead, and for overall skin quality.  I have gotten into skin oils--they do far more than any skin cream, are generally cheaper, and yet I don&#x27;t get acne like I used to with creams!  The Rosehip oil is no different, and I have to say it&#x27;s remarkably effective on the photo aging marks on my forehead in only three days! Although it&#x27;s a little hard to tell with the photo discoloration (it almost disappears at times but yet reappears when I&#x27;ve been in the sun a bit), I can tell that overall, the color seems to have faded noticeably--I love it! It even seems to be softening the lines in my face (I don&#x27;t actually have any &#x27;wrinkles&#x27;, just lines at the corner of my mouth and expression lines)!  The difference is noticeable to me, and it seems to have balanced out my skin pigment.  My pores are reduced too--although I think this was due to the other oils I used (maybe the Vitamin E oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very short shelf life, but I believe I will have no problem using it on 6 months, and I have kept it in the refrigerator to preserve it somewhat.  Coming out of the fridge cold, it is a little less like oil and more the consistency of maybe maple syrup I guess? It seems like it doesn&#x27;t go as far either as it does when keeping it in my cabinet, maybe because it&#x27;s a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did mark one star less because of the scent.  I can&#x27;t really be disappointed though, but to be honest I have smelled the scent from a bottle of $25 Rosehip oil at the local Whole Foods, which was light, sweet, and very pleasant.  The Rosehip oil which was just delivered, however, had a mild scent, though not sweet, it was somewhat pleasant but really hardly a distinguishable scent at all, ever so mild and &#x27;natural&#x27; is the best way I can put it. Also… it comes out of the container a little dark yellow, almost amber colored (apparently that is the right color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all I find it a pretty reasonable quality oil (considering I paid $8 for it), and my skin looks much improved in only a few days.  I highly recommend it!  I do plan on reordering, although I would like to try the $25 bottle first to see if there&#x27;s a noticeable difference other than scent.  When I do (which will be in six months or so), I plan on updating my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Rose hip oil especially from my mom (she is 56) who&#x27;s been using Rose hip oil a lot at a younger age as a moisturizer. So I decided to give this one a try. To be honest it did meet my expectations. I have mixed type of skin and it&#x27;s becoming dryer with age, especially around my eyes and cheeks. What I like about Nuriva Rose hip oil is : first it&#x27;s organic, it absorbs in my skin fast without leaving a greasy residue and  it has very natural scent , no additional perfumes and chemicals. I&#x27;m at the end of my firs bottle and will definitely be purchasing this oil again.</li>
    <li> Good for your hair.  Helps stop breakage,</li>
    <li> lives up to expectations</li>
    <li> I had heard that rosehip oil as being the best over-the-counter topical fine line remover I gave it a try and am so pleased with my results it&#x27;s amazing after only a few uses its leaving my skin soft supple and much more useful.. this is definitely going to be part of my beauty regimen from now on...</li>
    <li> superior quality...will order again!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this oil and trying this on my daughter&#x27;s skin for severe eczema. Her skin drinks it up and it&#x27;s not too greasy and does not cause irritation. Will try again to see if this really helps over time. The oil came with a list of benefits which is great to refer back to.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality organic rosehip seed oil. It has a nice orangey-red color and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this. I have to take out the little stopper in the jar to really get anything out, but about 3 times a week I use this on my face and neck. It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
    <li> I use this one my face and it has closed pores.  But the biggest thing is I had cyst underneath the skin on my arms I was self conscious about.  They could be seen.  After using this for about a wk or more they have shrank and co NO longer be seen.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I RARELY write reviews, but I love this product so much that I want everyone to know about it!  It is the ONE beauty product I could not live without, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!  As someone who has struggled with cystic acne, uneven skin tone, combination skin, and EXTREMELY sensitive skin, let me tell you that this oil is the answer to ALL of those problems!!!  It evens your skin tone, makes your skin produce less oil, and as a 30+ year old, has kept my skin looking better than it EVER did in my twenties!  It is a beautiful amber color and a wonderful clean smell (not overpowering).  I&#x27;m now on my third bottle, and I will be ordering many more!  In fact, this time I ordered a bottle for a friend who has tried mine &amp; loved it...  For the price, why not share the love?? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention I&#x27;ve tried every high end department store brand AND drugstore brand of facial cream for sensitive/acne prone/uneven skin??  Order this oil NOW.  You&#x27;ll thank me later!  :)</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old and was developing a rash of some sort on my face so I thought I would try rosehip oil.  I thought that the rash was ezcema since I&#x27;ve had that on occasion.  Not only did the rash go away but the dull, lifeless look to my skin went away with it and was replaced by the skin I had all of my life until recently!  I purchased this bottle on 2/17/14 and the change in my skin happened very quickly, a few days, a week, something like that.  I have been using this product ever since in place of my nightly face moisturizer.  This small 1.1 oz bottle has lasted me me all of this time (7 months and counting!) and is just now getting towards the bottom of the bottle.  I probably still have another month left in it though.  It&#x27;s an amazing product and I have been thrilled with the results!!!</li>
    <li> Nuniva Oils is my new best friend.  I have ordered several oils through Amazon and this company is awesome.  Pure organic oils at a great price.  Will continue to order from them.</li>
    <li> I used it just 2 weeks by now (at night, and a bit in the morning before applying make-up). I yet don&#x27;t see big improvements, but I noticed that it makes my face smooth and I didn&#x27;t noticed bad effects.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived broken but the mess that leaked onto my hands moisturized my skin pretty well</li>
    <li> On my second bottle.  Absolutely love this oil!</li>
    <li> Tried a LOT of products...this one is the BEST!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and grade. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this is a skin healing miracle in a bottle. skin heals so fast, even scratches, heal with no scar!! this is a really amazing product. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Did a wonderful job at lightening my acne scars and evening out my skin tone!</li>
    <li> This product is great !  I use it for surgical scars, and dark facial spots.  I will be purchasing this again !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil straight on my face at night as a moisturizer for a week. I can see a definite difference in the brightness and time if my skin, especially under my eyes. In have sensitive skin and have no problems with itching, rashes or new pimples. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor. I&#x27;ve also mixed a few drops into my face wash and facial scrub and it works nice. I put a few drops in my conditioner as well and noticed an added sheen to my bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Love This product. Its like magic in a bottle</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product is garnering such positive, glowing reviews.  My first observation was that it has a strong, fishy oder.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to put in on my skin.  I wanted to give it a fair shake, so I used it twice a day for two weeks.  I saw absolutely no difference in terms of reduction of redness and uneven skin tone.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  In the future I&#x27;ll spend a bit more and look for a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this oil, but I will try another brand in its place soon. I was disappointed that when I received it, there was an expiration date for February 2015 on it. That didn&#x27;t leave me enough time to use the whole bottle. I&#x27;ll use the rest of it on my body scarring, but will try a new brand for my face. Overall I am glad that I started using rosehip oil as a part of my beauty regimen. I am a skincare and makeup junkie, so I love when natural products really work!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil! I use it on my face in the morning and again before bed and my skin has never looked better! It has a very slight nutty smell which I love and does not make you look like an oil slick if you use it during the day. My skin is moisturized and glowing. I will be repurchasing this every time I run out!</li>
    <li> i started using this for a week and i broke out like crazy, idk what else it could be all i use on my face is this oil and a face wash and i know its not the face wash</li>
    <li> I really this rosehip oil and will order it again.</li>
