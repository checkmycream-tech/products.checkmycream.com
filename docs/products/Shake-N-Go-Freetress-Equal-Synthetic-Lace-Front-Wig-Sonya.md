      <li>love it, looks very natural, wash well, you can part the hair any way you want and still looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>They said they don&#x27;t know how much the restocking would be because they need to see the item and its condition!</li>
      <li>Sonya and I are ready to go now!</li>
      <li>It is my first Lace Front, but I already had tried some others hair.</li>
      <li>but sometimes I miss having straight hair!</li>
      <li>Its very flattering!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order another one since I wear it so much!</li>
      <li>Pretty.</li>
      <li>It holds the style consistently and I am always getting compliments on it.</li>
      <li>There is no fake synthetic shine either.</li>
      <li>I KNOW I can pass it off as my real hair!</li>
      <li>to it retaining it&#x27;s style, I have never had to flat iron it even though it is safe to do so.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I could play tennis in it, but for regular day and evening wear, I find it stays on just fine.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing my real hair all my life</li>
      <li>I asked how much.</li>
      <li>Ordered for my mom and got the shipment in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>The hair is shiny but in the off-black that I bought, surprisingly real.</li>
      <li>This wig looks and feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>Wig was well packaged and shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Overall, not a bad wig.</li>
      <li>The lace front makes all the difference in a realistic hairline:</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I guess because I normally don&#x27;t wear wigs, it looked too wiggy for me.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking</li>
      <li>So, basically, they were asking me to send it back without knowing how much I would be charged!</li>
      <li>My SIL couldn&#x27;t even make it look like the picture even though she is a professional hairstylist!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even tried adjusting the &amp;#34;straps&amp;#34; and it is still fitting a bit tight and I worry that it might come off or gradually move back away from my hair line throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>This wig is a must have for the business professional to the playful girl in you.</li>
      <li>and it is a nice natural black (not TOO black).</li>
      <li>My head is small, so the fit is a little roomy, but with the adjustable bands and the lace front, it stays put pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Before hand I would always wear instant weaves as a go to hairstyle for my hair because it looked so natural when I blended my permed hair and the weave hair .</li>
      <li>but when you are use to wearing human, Remy, and natural you can tell the differences.</li>
      <li>I was too self conscious of wearing them outside of my home because I feared they looked &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The wig is really soft and human like</li>
      <li>Last year I decided to go natural.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s easily fixed because you can curl and flat iron up to 400 degrees.</li>
      <li>Synthetic doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few months with everyday use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this wig. It&#x27;s my go to quick cute style. I&#x27;ve had it now for about three months. It&#x27;s still holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> I love it, I trimmed the front to fit my face and I just shake and go.  I have bought another one.  I wll also try some of their other products.  I wish they had a dark auburn in this.  I have a 1B.  All and all I Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig based on the packaging of a wig my sister gave me a couple of years ago.  While I did not open the package for a month or so, I assumed it would be perfect.  When I finally opened and tried the wig on, it was tighter than the one my sister gave me.  I&#x27;ve even tried adjusting the &amp;#34;straps&amp;#34; and it is still fitting a bit tight and I worry that it might come off or gradually move back away from my hair line throughout the day.  I would love to exchange it for a new one.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my mom and got the shipment in a very timely manner. But it was not at all like the picture. It flipped up, thoroughly exposing the \\&quot;hairline\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if it was a defect in the way the wig was sewn together, or if it was a defect that resulted because of the packaging. Either way, when I emailed the seller, they responded to please send a pic of the wig in use. I did as instructed. Took them a LONG time to respond (and only after I nagged for an update). They concluded the issue was inexperience in how to style a wig. My SIL couldn&#x27;t even make it look like the picture even though she is a professional hairstylist! Demanded I get a refund. They said it was now \\&quot;used\\&quot; already and I couldn&#x27;t get a full refund. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was \\&quot;used\\&quot; because THEY told me to send them a pic of the item being worn! They said that I would have to pay a restocking fee. I asked how much. Took them about another week to respond and when they did, they didn&#x27;t give an answer! I nagged some more. They said they don&#x27;t know how much the restocking would be because they need to see the item and its condition! So, basically, they were asking me to send it back without knowing how much I would be charged! Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s guarantee. I immediately filed a claim and within 10 days, I got my refund. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller. They ignore you and delay their responses and keep pushing it back so it&#x27;s beyond the period for full refunds/returns. I would give them zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking and it has a lot of bounce....Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this wig! Its very flattering! It arrived in a timely manner. It fit perfectly. Its simply wonderful! I&#x27;m going to order another one since I wear it so much!</li>
    <li> very beautiful wig, just as expected .the colour and texture was just as described.Very nice and looks very natural love it</li>
    <li> I just received mine today &amp; I immediately tried it on. This hair is SO. Pretty. Normally, I&#x27;m all against synthetic hair, but to me, this hair feels far more superior than any other synthetic hair wig I&#x27;ve felt. I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great quality lace front wig. Looks like natural healthy hair. Falls beautifully and compliments all face shapes. I love it! Check out the video reviews on YouTube. That&#x27;s what I did before buying.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wig. I wish it came in human hair so I can use it for longer. Synthetic doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few months with everyday use. At least the price is right.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. It looks fabulous on. It&#x27;s a little difficult with how extreme the side sweep is -- I used a bobby pin to keep it out of my eyes -- but otherwise I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I got what I thought was dark brown but it definitely looks black. The hair is soft and realistic looking -- feels synthetic but visually is great. Pretty easy to put on as well (I have fairly thin, medium-length hair). Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This wig may be inexpensive but don&#x27;t mistake that for low quality. I have been wearing this wig every day(except nights and weekends) for the past two months. Due to my busy schedule, it has been difficult for me to get around to washing it. It is still holding up great and it doesn&#x27;t smell. It holds the style consistently and I am always getting compliments on it. It is synthetic but it looks like human hair. I am still amazed by it. When I wear the current one out, I&#x27;m going to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to it retaining it&#x27;s style, I have never had to flat iron it even though it is safe to do so.</li>
    <li> This wig is a must have for the business professional to the playful girl in you. It looks very natural and is the perfect solution for those going natural and want to still wear straight hair.</li>
    <li> This wig is ok. It is kind of shiny in my opinion, so it doesn&#x27;t look natural to me. I put it on and I did receive plenty of compliments. I guess because I normally don&#x27;t wear wigs, it looked too wiggy for me. It is good for when you don&#x27;t have time to do your hair and just want to shake and go. I would recommend this to my friends who know how to style and adjust their wigs. Overall, not a bad wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I seen so many reviews for this wig. It was a rave on youtube. However, I would rather have a human hair wig in this style. The wig is really soft and human like but when you are use to wearing human, Remy, and natural you can tell the differences. For the price it is a nice wig.</li>
    <li> Last year I decided to go natural. Before hand I would always wear instant weaves as a go to hairstyle for my hair because it looked so natural when I blended my permed hair and the weave hair . Now when I try blending after almost a year without a perm my natural thick curls do not want to blend with anything that I have tried. I love my hair now but sometimes I miss having straight hair! I know I can straighten my own hair but I don&#x27;t want to damage it now that its finally healthy.Here is where Sonya comes in! She is short, sexy,  and everyone thinks that its my hair!! It has a weird bend when you first try it on but that&#x27;s easily fixed because you can curl and flat iron up to 400 degrees. I just run the flat iron over the wig and just run the flat iron through it ti straighten and voila! Perfection! Highly recommend.  It also lasts longer than any other lace front that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this wig a try after purchasing a small hairpiece made of the same material which blends perfectly with my own ponytail, and no one has even imagined is not all my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is amazing for the money. It is so lightweight I can wear it for hours.  The hair is shiny but in the off-black that I bought, surprisingly real. I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors and how real they may or may not be, but mine just looks great. Friends actually thought I had cut my shoulder length hair.  My head is small, so the fit is a little roomy, but with the adjustable bands and the lace front, it stays put pretty well.  I don&#x27;t know if I could play tennis in it, but for regular day and evening wear, I find it stays on just fine. I had to cut the bangs because I wear glasses, and they look fabulous.  The lace front makes all the difference in a realistic hairline: No big bump or bulge at the part, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy and comfortable alternative to those damp and rainy days, or the days you didn&#x27;t have time to wash and blow-dry, or if you just want a different look for fun, I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is my first Lace Front, but I already had tried some others hair. This unit is amazing. Lovely haircut, easy to use, great texture and balance.  Nice price, also.</li>
    <li> love it, looks very natural, wash well, you can part the hair any way you want and still looks very natural.  I bought another&lt;br /&gt;at a wig shop where i live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearlie</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! I had a baby and lost a lot of hair!! Over the past two months I have purchased two other wigs.I was too self conscious of wearing them outside of my home because I feared they looked &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. This wig looks and feels like real hair. The cut is on point and it has a lot of body. It is classy and sophisticated, but can also be used for going out. This will be my go-to wig. I have been wearing my real hair all my life and I have no issues whatsoever with this wig. I KNOW I can pass it off as my real hair! I am so in love with it that I will be ordering another one...or two....as a backup. Got the 1B and it is a nice natural black (not TOO black). There is no fake synthetic shine either. I took the wig out, cut the lace and styled the bangs. Sonya and I are ready to go now! This has saved me, truthfully! Wig was well packaged and shipping was fast.You won&#x27;t regret this!</li>
