### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I get the best smoothest shave with these and recommend them.</li>
      <li>Please improve the razor bodies, these products are so close to perfect!</li>
      <li>I think of the gel strips on the Breeze as supplemental, and they are great!</li>
      <li>I was done shaving within 10 minutes and didn&#x27;t have to go over any missed ones, it worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>This is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Venus always makes the best women&#x27;s razors.</li>
      <li>But all in all this is the best razor I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Venus Breeze is the best razor!</li>
      <li>I love this razor!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent Product and great shopping experience.</li>
      <li>Perfect for someone who kind of has to rush the shaving process like me!</li>
      <li>Good product by one of the best brand in their field.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for about two uses - after that you might want to use some shave gel.</li>
      <li>have not replaced the blade in 4 uses, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it already has lotion on each end</li>
      <li>I could probably save up and get electrolosis for that kind of money!</li>
      <li>If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor.  </li>
      <li>but it has a pleasant floral scent to me.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t too \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, and it had a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>That one is good.</li>
      <li>It did not produce a good lather</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of this razor.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Plus there is a nice smell.</li>
      <li>(It smells really nice too)</li>
      <li>I liked the design of the razor itself.  </li>
      <li>The gel smells nice too...not very strong...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting an amazingly close shave every time and - to all of those who aren&#x27;t - you must not be doing it right!!!  </li>
      <li>The blades were very easy to change.  </li>
      <li>This is the best razor I have had so far (and I&#x27;ve experimented over the years!).</li>
      <li>This razor does provide a smooth shave, that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it.</li>
      <li>The gel bars are great, providing just the right amount of lubrication for a shave.  </li>
      <li>Like a lot of the reviewers, I was impressed with the first couple of shaves, but noticed the gel strips dying quickly on me in the shower.</li>
      <li>These are great for the first 2 to 3 shaves depending on how course/fine your hair is.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap as anything, lasts forever, is 100% vegetarian (to those of you interested in that kind of thing), and works really beautifully with this razor.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable to the skin.</li>
      <li>love this item.</li>
      <li>And I love how this razor came with a suction cup</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more?</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>&quot; Maybe I&#x27;m just a cheapskate, but I expect to get more than four or five shaves out of a blade--</li>
      <li>This razor is 100 times better than the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I even thought it might work better if I used shave cream too.</li>
      <li>and I am glad because now I can use the razor and get a close shave.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
      <li>wish bar could have been better ajusted</li>
      <li>This is my favorite razor on the market.  </li>
      <li>I also love the case that the handle comes in.</li>
      <li>I love the razor</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many nicks and cuts.  </li>
      <li>I know I will never get hairy legs again. :-)</li>
      <li>Both myself and my girls love this razor.  </li>
      <li>I love how amazon allows me to set up automatic delivery, that way</li>
      <li>I have flawlessly smooth legs!</li>
      <li>One thing I feel is really important to note: I would never, not in my wildest imagination, use ANY razor without using some kind of shaving cream, lotion, or gel.</li>
      <li>This seems like a good product in theory, shave gel built right into the head is convenient.</li>
      <li>Give&#x27;s you a nice clean</li>
      <li>I loved this razor the first two times I used it.</li>
      <li>The Venus Breeze works pretty good on the legs and armpits, basically areas that can be flattened.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>I just recently tried this product, and it is amazing!!</li>
      <li>I have to say that these are some of the best razor blades on the market, I have never had such a smooth shave without irritation.  </li>
      <li>Wonderfully, my legs were not irritated at all after shaving, which is a problem I have had with many other razors.</li>
      <li>This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it.</li>
      <li>Leaves legs soft and smell is great.</li>
      <li>The most important factor for me is the shaving experience.</li>
      <li>This razor, on the other hand, is INCREDIBLE for me!</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and with the fragrant pad around the blade, this razor won&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
      <li>The idea of using a blade with no creams or gels applied separately was a bit daunting, especially in certain areas.</li>
      <li>However, if I am spending $11 on a razor and another $10 on every 4 new blade cartages I expect it to be good</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a fine stubble.  </li>
      <li>This razor was easy to use and fit comfortably in my hand.      </li>
      <li>My legs stayed smooth for not one, but TWO days.</li>
      <li>I really want to love this product, because it does an amazing job at getting a close shave, but I just do not feel like it would be financially wise to purchase yet another razor body (which is also pricey) that is not going to last any longer than 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>This razor is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, silky moisturizer and does the job well.  </li>
      <li>If I got it for free I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Venus Embrace gave me a smooth shave, Venus Breeze didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I like not having to add gel or lather to get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The results really depend on one&#x27;s own hair and skin type, and probably even on one&#x27;s shaving technique.    </li>
      <li>This razor is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This razor really works great and it gives you a really close shave without any cuts or razor burn, you will like it.</li>
      <li>If it works on my head, I&#x27;m pretty sure it will work on whatever body part</li>
      <li>My wife has been using this razor for a long time with great results.</li>
      <li>This razor is perfect for small showers - I don&#x27;t have space to put on cream or gel b</li>
      <li>Shaving is actually fun now!</li>
      <li>I wish Gillette could make more products that are safe for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t even cut the hair right!</li>
      <li>I got such a good shave</li>
      <li>This is true.  </li>
      <li>On the positive side, the gel itself was really rather nice, but I had to let it run under the water for a while to get any sort of lather going.</li>
      <li>you shave inward from the thigh, you can manage to get your bikini line sort of OK- and facial areas along the jaw and neck seem to be done average at best (had to try it, just to see).</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this razor but just notices that easy glide gel is already falling apart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for on the go, and you also dont have the mess that shaving cream makes.</li>
      <li>I used this product once on my armpits and legs and thought it was great, especially because the way the strips on either side of the razor, and the razor head itself, kind of maneuver in a way that I didn&#x27;t cut myself on my ankle, when if I was using my normal razor, I definitely would have.</li>
      <li>I will say however, something about the design of these razors leaves me with fewer/to no nicks unlike standard razors, so these also might be ideal for that younger set of gals who are just learning to shave, as they may have fewer cuts from these...sort of like a learning curve razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Those pieces come out so far you can&#x27;t get a close shave.  They only lasted a couple of shaves then fell off and I am glad because now I can use the razor and get a close shave.</li>
    <li> ...but I could never use this as my \\&quot;daily driver.\\&quot; Maybe I&#x27;m just a cheapskate, but I expect to get more than four or five shaves out of a blade-- I couldn&#x27;t afford not to! Like a lot of the reviewers, I was impressed with the first couple of shaves, but noticed the gel strips dying quickly on me in the shower. Once they fell off, I found the razor head overly cumbersome to use (especially since a standard Venus razor head is no petite thing). If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to last, though, I&#x27;d go with the Venus Divine.    For the best, least irritating shave, though, I find conditioner works better than shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I bought this just on a whim looking for a new razor and I am hooked! Shaving is actually fun now! I never wanted to use shaving cream or gel (what a hassle that is) so here&#x27;s the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a close shave you just have to make sure you bend the lather things back some. Small price to pay for the convenience this product offers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this to anyone who prefers to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes of saving some time and money. Instead, it was a waste of money. The gel things are so thick (and gooey and sticky) that the razor doesn&#x27;t get close enough. I had to go over the same area 6 times and it still didn&#x27;t get that close to the skin shave. I still had bristle and I got razor burn! The gel stuff around the blades left my legs feeling sticky and gross. I&#x27;ll have to use a regular razor and gel to shave again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor on the market.  I used it once and will never change.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with breaking out or stubble.  It is a very close shave.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new razor to see if I could improve my underarm shaving.  I&#x27;m so sorry I tried this one.  It had only been two or three days since I last shaved my legs, but my legs are nowhere near smooth.  There&#x27;s a fine stubble.  In addition, immediately after use my skin got rashy and itchy anywhere the razor had touched.  One of the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used -- and a complete waste of my money, as the skin irritation means I don&#x27;t dare use it again.</li>
    <li> I was looking through the comments on these razors and some of you are stating that you are not using shaving gel/cream with this. The gel thingy on each side of the razor is not a substitute for shaving gel. No wonder some of you are getting razor burn/bumps. I love the razor the gel thingys on each end of it do seem to disintegrate pretty quickly. And I have a problem shaving my underarms with this I am a small person and the razor is just too big to fit in there. I mean I can get some of it but have to use a smaller razor to do it right. But all in all this is the best razor I have ever had. Really close shave.</li>
    <li> THE &#x27;LOTION&#x27; EDGES WERE GOOEY AT TIMES. COULD NOT GET A CLOSE ENOUGH SHAVE. HANDLES DIFFICULT TO GRIP WHEN WET AND SOAPY. DISPOSIBLE DOUBLE BLADES WORK JUST AS WELL AND ARE MUCH CHEAPER. SORRY-JUST MY OPINION.</li>
    <li> I have to say that these are some of the best razor blades on the market, I have never had such a smooth shave without irritation.  That said, I am very disappointed in the quality of the razor \\&quot;bodies\\&quot;.  I have gone through three razors, that have all broken in half and did not last any longer than 2 months. The first one I thought was due to the fact that the wall hanger it came with doesn&#x27;t work very well, and that it had become weakened from falling off the wall so much. So, I bought a new wall mount so that it would not fall. I also bought two new razor bodies and two boxes of razor heads. Both of the razor bodies have broken in half and I really am not sure what to do. All I have now are two very expensive boxes of razor heads and two new scrapes on my legs.  I really want to love this product, because it does an amazing job at getting a close shave, but I just do not feel like it would be financially wise to purchase yet another razor body (which is also pricey) that is not going to last any longer than 6 weeks. Please improve the razor bodies, these products are so close to perfect!</li>
    <li> This razor does provide a smooth shave, that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it. I have stubble a few hours later like always, so it doesn&#x27;t help reduce shaving. I cut my ankles with this razor around 4 times because the head is so big and bulky and I missed a million spots on my knees but it shaved the main part of my leg fine. I hate the gel bars on this razor, they get gooey and stringy and the goop gets on the blades and makes it hard to shave. I would NOT buy this razor again. Also I have very pale, sensitive skin, and my skin did not break out in a rash or get bumps like other people have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Do not attempt to shave your lady bits with this razor. It SUCKS! It can&#x27;t even cut the hair right! It took like 30 minutes to shave down there when it takes like 10 with a normal razor. The stupid gel bars are in the way and the razors don&#x27;t want to get close to the skin. Not to mention the hairs get trapped in there. GROSS!</li>
    <li> I hope they make this razor forever because I never want to use anything else. I get a very close shave, the gel provided by the head is just enough moisture and my legs feel moisturized after. I have really sensitive skin, but the Breeze gel doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I was really reticent about spending the money the first time, but I really feel it has been worth it. I can use a head for several weeks at a time, shaving 3-7 times a week. I also love the case that the handle comes in. I have it hung up in my shower...no more razors stuck every-which-way, falling under foot.</li>
    <li> No more porcupine legs! I am actually shaving every time I shower now for the first time in my life. Shaving used to be the dread once-a-week-only-if-i-had-to routine for me, but with this new razor I look forward to swiftly and smoothly shaving my legs and pits FAST! Yes, the gel-strips only last about a month if you are careful, but I can spend $2-bucks a month for the luxury of having great legs and no prickle-yelps from my husband ;-)    Truly a revolution. I am going to buy a dozen refill blades to store away in case they try to discontinue or change anything on this razor.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this razor with high hopes and wound up being mildly disappointed. It is by no means bad, but it has some serious flaws. The biggest frustration for me was that the gel bars are very bulky and I have a hard time getting a close shave. I have to go over my legs several times.    On the positive side, the gel itself was really rather nice, but I had to let it run under the water for a while to get any sort of lather going. It wasn&#x27;t too \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, and it had a pleasant smell. Wonderfully, my legs were not irritated at all after shaving, which is a problem I have had with many other razors. Overall, I&#x27;d say this is an okay razor, especially for people who have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Both myself and my girls love this razor.  It&#x27;s great because it already has lotion on each end so you don&#x27;t need shaving cream.  Give&#x27;s you a nice clean shave.[[ASIN:B000MAV2XW Gillette Venus Breeze 2 in 1 Razor for Women, 1 Razor]]</li>
    <li> I love Venus razors, but the Venus Breeze is absolutely horrible.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many nicks and cuts.  The shave gel bars don&#x27;t produce enough  moisture and/or lather, so I find myself using shaving gel, and I still get nicks, cuts, and irritation.  The last time I used it, a chunk of skin actually came off my leg.  With the other Venus razors, I NEVER even get small nicks. To top it all off (as if the former wasn&#x27;t enough) I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m getting a close shave, and I actually end up shaving every day, instead of every other or every three days.  I hate to be so negative, but this razor really has nothing to offer.  Go for one of the other varieties of Venus razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of this razor.  The gel bars are great, providing just the right amount of lubrication for a shave.  Other reviewers seem disappointed with the gel - it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; like one you would dispense from a can.  You definitely couldn&#x27;t shave dry with this razor, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up, but in the shower/bath, it provides just the right amount of gel for a smooth, painless shave. I was surprised how long the gel did last.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the closeness of the shave as other reviewers noted, felt it was just right and lasted as long as other razors.    This razor is 100 times better than the [[ASIN:B000TCW0IO Schick Intuition Plus Moisturizing Care Pack, Variety Pack, 1 Pack]].  That is just a big block of moisturizing soap around a razor that dulls after the first use (which isn&#x27;t that great itself).    Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and will continue to use it.  Just wish it was a little less expensive for refills.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and with the fragrant pad around the blade, this razor won&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
    <li> The long and short of it is that my legs look like they were shaved with a lawn mower. Enough said.    P.S. I gave it one star because amazon doesn&#x27;t offer an option for half a star. I&#x27;d give it half a star merely because it would be better than nothing if I had access to no other razor in the world.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this razor, I was looking forward to trying it out. I tried it for around a week and a half and enjoyed using it. I felt like it was a close and moisturizing shave. However, I began to develop a horrible itchy rash on my legs. I didn&#x27;t immediately connect it with this product, but it finally dawned on me that the itching got way worse every time I used it. It was a red, spotty, extremely uncomfortable rash. I stopped using this razor and went back to my old Mach 3, and my rash took around 2 weeks to heal. I tried the Venus Breeze again a few months later (I really liked it!) and that darn rash came back. It&#x27;s too bad. I wish Gillette could make more products that are safe for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic.  I&#x27;m getting an amazingly close shave every time and - to all of those who aren&#x27;t - you must not be doing it right!!!  Shaving is so much faster with this razor because you don&#x27;t have to waste time lathering up with shaving gel/cream...and because this is a Venus product - you are getting a great shave.  The gel smells nice too...not very strong...but...clean smelling&amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> The Venus Breeze works pretty good on the legs and armpits, basically areas that can be flattened. The gel strips give enough lubrication to glide over wet skin with minimal irritation. Plus there is a nice smell. I don&#x27;t know what they claim it to be but it has a pleasant floral scent to me. I also noticed that the heads are where the spring tension is located rather than the refillable handle. I think this is great to help keep your shaves close without having to press too hard since you&#x27;ll never have one head long enough for the resistance to lessen. Otherwise the gel strips get in the way if you&#x27;re trying to shave intimate areas -if you shave inward from the thigh, you can manage to get your bikini line sort of OK- and facial areas along the jaw and neck seem to be done average at best (had to try it, just to see). They seem to only last around 4-5 uses also and the strips don&#x27;t exactly lather, just provide slick lubrication which some might consider more on the slimy side. It&#x27;ll likely be expensive to use regularly so I won&#x27;t be getting anymore and for manual shaving, I&#x27;ll continue to use my previous razor but if you want to try out the Breeze, go ahead and from there you can decide whether the cost is worth the results you get yourself.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Something I almost forgot is that you&#x27;re best using this on already wet skin rather than running it under water to keep it going every stroke as the gel strips seem to slowly drool away when soaked too much.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this razor for a long time with great results. The blades last about as long as other blades, which in her case is fairly long. The most important factor for me is the shaving experience. I found myself in need of a razor when this was the only one available. The idea of using a blade with no creams or gels applied separately was a bit daunting, especially in certain areas. I wanted to be sure that having a pivoting blade going across sensitive skin while holding onto the shaft would give me enough control. I found that holding the skin tight was all that was needed and I didn&#x27;t come close to getting a cut or a nick. I didn&#x27;t shave anything as large as a leg, but did shave in tight places and on sensitive skin where I would not have been able to use a band aid if I had gotten cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you want an extra millimeter of smoothness on your legs or an extra inch of smoothness on your partner, it&#x27;s worth trying this. It may be a ladies&#x27; razor but if your partner uses it, that doesn&#x27;t mean your partner&#x27;s nuts. He won&#x27;t lose anything by trying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Schick Intuition razor since it showed up on store shelves. So, when Gillette finally came out with their version of a 2 in 1 razor, I was excited to try it. Although the Gillette Breeze makes maneuvering more simplistic due to it&#x27;s sleek style, the moisture/shaving strips ran out after one shave. At that rate, it could become quite expensive to replace the blade. I also agree with others - it didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave and a bit of razor burn too.  &lt;br /&gt;    * Bottom Line - I prefer the Schick Intuition and will continue to use it.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I saw all the not-so-good reviews on this razor and can&#x27;t figure them out... I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  I only had to use it once to be hooked.      A couple reviewers stated that the moisture bars kept them from getting a close shave.  The bars bend back, to allow the blades close to the skin as soon as you apply it, so I&#x27;m not sure how they are inhibiting a close shave.  I&#x27;ve had opposite results.    One person commented that the moisturizer isn&#x27;t foamy.  This is true.  It&#x27;s a light, silky moisturizer and does the job well.  My skin isn&#x27;t dry - just silky smooth.    I can&#x27;t emphasize enough what a close, comfortable shave this razor provides.  I adore it!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have had so far (and I&#x27;ve experimented over the years!). It&#x27;s great for on the go, and you also dont have the mess that shaving cream makes. But my favorite aspect is now shaving \\&quot;down there\\&quot; is a lot safer, easier, and less irritating (for me, and my skin). I have even suggested this for a friend of mine, and havent heard any complaints so far. Just pair this up with a retinol cream (at least the one we sell where I work), and you have less irritated, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and great shopping experience.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The only problem I had with it was the gel parts don&#x27;t last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible. This razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary. But using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin. This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it. I did not notice a tropical scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin on my legs but this product was very harsh. It made me itch like crazy. I&#x27;ve recently gone back to the regular venus divine product and the itching is gone. Be careful when using this, it wasn&#x27;t much fun for me.</li>
    <li> This product feels like butter gliding on my legs! It does not even feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, then all of a sudden I have flawlessly smooth legs! It&#x27;s so much easier to just use this and not having to worry about shaving cream washing off by the water when I&#x27;m in the shower! Perfect for someone who kind of has to rush the shaving process like me!</li>
    <li> This seems like a good product in theory, shave gel built right into the head is convenient. The problem is, it&#x27;s less shave gel and more shave goop. You assume it will build a normal lather but it never does, it&#x27;s just shaving GOO. I prefer to shave while in the tub, and this razor does NOT like a lot of water. If it gets too much water on it, like if you submerge it or rinse it off, the gel strips start drooling goop everywhere. Shaving quickly becomes a sticky, stringy, goopy mess. I&#x27;d imagine shower shavers must encounter something similar. It must be designed for sink shavers only. No where on the package is a warning about getting it TOO wet, but I think they should consider one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ends up being too slick to really get close to the skin anyway. Don&#x27;t even think about trying to shave your lady parts with this because it doesn&#x27;t get close enough, and I kept fearing that the slip sliding goo mess is produces would cause me to slip and cut myself. Not cool, and definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect for small showers - I don&#x27;t have space to put on cream or gel b/c it will wash off immediately. I take it out of the shower after each shave - I am assuming this helps make it last. I have used it for 4 shaves so far and the gel bars still look new. I have extremely sensitive skin and many allergies, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with this razor. I love it!</li>
    <li> Reading through some of the other reviews on here, I&#x27;m surprised at the mixed results people have been getting. However, I&#x27;m sure this personal care product is just like any other. The results really depend on one&#x27;s own hair and skin type, and probably even on one&#x27;s shaving technique.    I, for one, have tremendously coarse, fast-growing, awful hair on my terribly sensitive legs. Over the years, I have come to accept that shaving daily or everyday is a fact of life for me. Or, I just give up in the colder months and let my legs recover for a week or two. (My husband, bless his soul, is a very understanding person!)    Anyway, I have tried several different brands of razors (Gillette, Schick, and various disposables to name a few), with lots of different brands of shave gels and creams (Aveeno, Skintimate, etc. etc.) and every combination left me feeling like I needed to shave again just hours later. This razor, on the other hand, is INCREDIBLE for me! My legs stayed smooth for not one, but TWO days. I absolutely love it, and as much as I hate the cost of the cartridges, I will gladly pay the money for these results. I have always suffered terribly from razor bumps on my thighs, and for whatever reason, I don&#x27;t have nearly as much of a problem with this razor. That&#x27;s not to say they&#x27;ve gone away entirely, but there is considerably less irritation and discomfort using this razor than with any other I have ever tried.    One thing I feel is really important to note: I would never, not in my wildest imagination, use ANY razor without using some kind of shaving cream, lotion, or gel. I think of the gel strips on the Breeze as supplemental, and they are great! Very soothing and calming. I would highly recommend using a shaving lotion or cream in combination with this particular razor. Several months ago, I discovered Trader Joe&#x27;s Honey Mango Shave Cream, and I am telling you, go out and get it... it&#x27;s cheap as anything, lasts forever, is 100% vegetarian (to those of you interested in that kind of thing), and works really beautifully with this razor.</li>
    <li> I liked the design of the razor itself.  The blades were very easy to change.  I just pushed a button and they popped off.  The new ones easily snapped on.  This razor was easy to use and fit comfortably in my hand.      It worked well enough.  I have a catch 22 situation with razors.  If I get a close shave, I end up with a rash and razor burn.  So, I live with a shave that&#x27;s not very close.  That&#x27;s better for me than being uncomfortable, any day.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst razor I have ever spent money on. I mean, it&#x27;s sort of expected when you buy a cheap razor that you aren&#x27;t going to get the best shave. However, if I am spending $11 on a razor and another $10 on every 4 new blade cartages I expect it to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not make the mark. The \\&quot;gel\\&quot; bar was completely useless. It did not produce a good lather and I would go as far as to say it felt like I was dry shaving. (If you have ever had to do that you know what I mean.) The other problem I found is that because of the gel bars I was also not getting a close shave. I had to press down more to get the blade to cut well. Using this razor I got cut more than a few times while shaving. Something that never ever happens with my Venus Vibrance. What&#x27;s more? That day I felt regrowth and my legs were not smooth. The very next day I had noticeable stubble and had to endure this awful razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. This razor is terrible. If I got it for free I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I even thought it might work better if I used shave cream too. Nope. The blades are way too expensive and I can&#x27;t tell you how much I regret this purchase. I think next time (which is soon because I threw this one away) I&#x27;m going to buy a different brand. Way to go Gillette.</li>
    <li> I used this product once on my armpits and legs and thought it was great, especially because the way the strips on either side of the razor, and the razor head itself, kind of maneuver in a way that I didn&#x27;t cut myself on my ankle, when if I was using my normal razor, I definitely would have. I got a close shave and didn&#x27;t have any problems with irritation later. However, after using it 3 days later for the second time, it seems as though the strips lost their lube and although the razor head itself was still better than the one I have been using, I would definitely say I wish I&#x27;d used some shave gel because my legs are on fire. (even after applying my \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; lotion generously.) So... if you have enough money to buy a new razor cartridge every time you use it, or if you want to reuse a blade with shaving gel and open a new cartridge on the days you&#x27;re in an extra hurry, then why not... I personally don&#x27;t have the cash!</li>
    <li> Ok, this is going to be a strange review. For YEARS I have been looking for a razor to use when shaving my head that doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a mess with ingrown hairs and inflamed pores. This is the one! I&#x27;m not sure if it is the number of blades or the smooth bars on both sides that help it glide, but my head is shaved and there is no razor burn at all. If it works on my head, I&#x27;m pretty sure it will work on whatever body part you are going to hit with it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first used this razor because I got a really close shave and it took less than half the time that it usually does, mainly because I didn&#x27;t have to stop every couple of strokes and rinse out all the shaving cream.  Unfortunately, the third time I used it, the gel thing was almost gone and it gave me razor burn.  I got such a good shave the first couple of times I considered buying more refills and just using them for a few times, but after seeing the prices, I can&#x27;t afford to do that.  I could probably save up and get electrolosis for that kind of money!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor the first two times I used it. But by the third time, the gel wasn&#x27;t really useful anymore. I&#x27;m not the kind of person to spend the money on buying razor blades every other week. That wasn&#x27;t necessarily why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars though. If you want to spend the money, go ahead, but for me, personally, my legs started to itch very badly after a couple days. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was at first because it persisted at least a week after I stopped using the Venus Breeze. I definitely don&#x27;t want to deal with that again!    It doesn&#x27;t seem like everyone has this problem, so I would find one to use once and see what happens. If no itching, go ahead! It&#x27;s great for about two uses - after that you might want to use some shave gel.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!!! Shaving is truly a &amp;#34;breeze&amp;#34; with this razor! I was done shaving within 10 minutes and didn&#x27;t have to go over any missed ones, it worked perfectly! It left my legs and armpits super smooth, I will def buy this again! And I love how this razor came with a suction cup so you can put it on the shower wall!!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I love it. And all the refills for Venus fit so if your not happy with the one that comes with it you can get the one you do.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Gillette for years, but the mens razors. I got this one to try and as soon as I used it, it cut me. The gel bars are also kind of gross and leave a weird residue on my skin which made my legs itch for a couple hours, I think i might be allergic to it. Are there any other razors from venus that have a better gel around? or like soap around?</li>
    <li> Works like a champ and the only model my wife uses.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor but just notices that easy glide gel is already falling apart.</li>
    <li> So I bought this razor thinking it&#x27;ll save me time by not applying shaving cream and because I ABSOLUTELY fell in love with Venus Embrace, so I figured all Venus products would work the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! This razor doesn&#x27;t get a close shave (I shaved last night and I have stubble this morning). But that&#x27;s not the worse: I got razor burn and broke out in huge hives!!!! It happened last night a couple hours after I shaved. It was sooo bad, that nothing could touch my legs (pants, bed sheets) and this is even after I slathered myself with Triple Antibiotic Cream. I also got a lot of cuts.    This NEVER happened to me before with Venus Embrace. I&#x27;m returning this product and going back to Embrace!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Venus Embrace for awhile and have been content with it. When I was at the hypermarket today, I decided to buy Gillette Venus Breeze and see how it compared to Venus Embrace. Result: Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Venus Embrace gave me a smooth shave, Venus Breeze didn&#x27;t. When I ran my hand over the shaved area, I could still feel a bit of stubble. I tried the razor without sudsing my legs because the shave bars were supposed to suds up your skin. It didn&#x27;t. In the end, I ended up using my shower gel to lather my skin. Plus, the shave gel bars kept on dripping unsightly. Also, this razor made my skin itch post-shower. I have sensitive skin and this one caused me to have a rash on my thighs. Venus Embrace didn&#x27;t cause any rashes or irritation. As of writing this review, my skin is still itching me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chucked this razor and I&#x27;m going back to using Gillette Venus Embrace.  That one is good. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this one. I do not recommend Gillette Venus Breeze at all!</li>
    <li> I hate to shave my legs but love how easy it is with this--have not replaced the blade in 4 uses, so I&#x27;m happy.  Close, comfortable, long lasting shave.</li>
    <li> Venus Breeze is the best razor! Venus always makes the best women&#x27;s razors. I used to only shave 2-3 times a week because I just couldn&#x27;t bother with it, but this is so easy to pick up and use. Forget the shave cream or soap and buy this razor! You&#x27;ll love it! (It smells really nice too) Highly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> this has to be one of the worst products gillette has ever put on the market.  it simply doesn&#x27;t work.  the shaving cream bars extend so far past the blades that the blades don&#x27;t even come near enough to my legs to remove any hair.  i seriously can&#x27;t say that this razor doesn&#x27;t work well--it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  i&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s still on the market.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the venus breeze. It became dull very quickly, it gave me razor burn on the first use! Also, the gel/soap strip dissolved after only a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> This is great if you are strapped for time/in a rush, or perhaps if you have mobility issues/ as this razor eliminates the step of applying standard shaving cream (less motion/moving around in the shower/bath required). These are great for the first 2 to 3 shaves depending on how course/fine your hair is. After that the soap/strip seems to wear out fast and or the blades dull quite quickly. Overall, I tend to keep one of these in the shower and also a standard razor and cream and switch off and on based on time constraints. I will say however, something about the design of these razors leaves me with fewer/to no nicks unlike standard razors, so these also might be ideal for that younger set of gals who are just learning to shave, as they may have fewer cuts from these...sort of like a learning curve razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these overall if you want a fine shave, or you&#x27;ll be replacing these cartridges about once a week, and in comparison to cream/standard razors they aren&#x27;t inexpensive, nor are they quality enough to be worth the high overall cost.</li>
    <li> This razor really works great and it gives you a really close shave without any cuts or razor burn, you will like it.</li>
    <li> I like not having to add gel or lather to get a smooth shave. The first few times I used the Venus Breeze, I did notice a little dripping/oozing from the shave gel bars. Not after that. But the bottom shave gel bar fell off the razor long before it was &#x27;used up&#x27;. And there didn&#x27;t seem to be any way to make it stick back on. This is my first gel cartridge, so I don&#x27;t know if this was a fluke or an ongoing problem. The razor still shaves: but I&#x27;m back to adding gel or lather, which really defeats the purpose of the &#x27;2 in 1&#x27; cartridge.</li>
    <li> Good product by one of the best brand in their field. Very comfortable to the skin. wish bar could have been better ajusted</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. I have been using it since it was first released and I still have the same grip and simply replace the heads as needed. I get the best smoothest shave with these and recommend them.</li>
    <li> I will only use this for shaving, No need for shaving cream and you can get about a dozen uses out of them. I love how amazon allows me to set up automatic delivery, that way I know I will never get hairy legs again. :-)</li>
    <li> I just recently tried this product, and it is amazing!! left my legs soooo silky and smooth! love this item. definitely a must!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic - highly recommend. Leaves legs soft and smell is great. I hate the word requirements on this... what else am I supposed to say?</li>
