<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought as gift for teenage son, works great, tight shave, no razor cuts.</li>
    <li> Great shaver as everyone else has mentioned.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve had in a while.GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding!!!  After many years with a WAHL, this is quieter, smoother cut, faster cut, more comfortable to use, easier to clean and many more shaves on a charge.  I cannot even imagine any shaver that could out do this model.  And I do not even consider doing a wet, gel shave as that seems gross to me, but it claims it can do that too.  The mfg description falls far short of describing this model.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do very well for the contour of my face</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Wal-Mart three years ago and have replaced the shaving head assembly once. Wal-Mart no longer carries replacement heads. NOTE: Unlike the older Series 2, the head contains the blades and the mechanical transfer mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Quick Recharge&lt;br /&gt;* Recharge stand with detachable power cable&lt;br /&gt;* Power cable may be plugged into the end of the shaver,&lt;br /&gt;  which saves counter space&lt;br /&gt;* Recharge indicator LED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* Head may detach from shaver while shaving&lt;br /&gt;* Flimsy plastic power switch cover doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;  adequately protect from accidental power-on&lt;br /&gt;* Fails to trim long bread hair (~3/16\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;* Cannot be used while plugged into wall&lt;br /&gt;* Difficult to find replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;There are better options at this time</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband dropped and broke his older more expensive Braun. I purchased this as a replacement, thinking he would not like it, but I did not like some of the prices of other shavers. Surprise to me - he loves it. Says it is superior to the old Brraun.  He highly recommends it. Cannot, however, comment on the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feature as he has used only when dry.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a high school graduate and he loves it.  Seemed a little easier to maintain in a dorm environment.</li>
    <li> my son didn&#x27;t like it very much and we returned it for the Philips.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well out of the shower. It works best with short hair to trim close. I have sensitive skin and this leaves no razor burn with dry shaving. The trimmer, works okay for those tricky areas, but does not give you a lose shave. It charges quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used. (I&#x27;m a male)</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with a return to electric shavers... its been about 20 years since I tried one.  Compared to a Panasonic ES8103S, using both dry and wet shaving, either will give a close shave.  However, the Braun is easier to handle and much quieter.  That actually makes a difference to my morning shave.  The key design difference is on the Braun you remove the cartridge to clean; the cutter and the foil together.  On the Panasonic, just the foil. Although the Panasonic is slightly more convenient to remove, I believe over time the Braun is less likely to cause alignment issues.  Sometimes with the Pany the noise increases unless you reset the foil.  Be advised, if shaving dry Braun recommends you shave before washing, and if shaving wet that you put fine machine oil on the cutter once a week.  Obviously either using skin oil, or the machine oil, for lubrication.  No such requirement on the Panasonic.  Having both, I pick the Braun for a better shave.</li>
    <li> I must say that this is the smoothest wet or dry shaver hands down, it really is amazing.  It also runs an entire week on a charge.  The best part is that you can take it in the shower and get a really smooth and close shave.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone and cleanup is a snap.  What are you waiting for just get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> great shaver. this is my second one. tryed all the others. nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun 3Series 380S-4 about 10 days now its good. Not as close and a regular razor but almost. I like that  use it wet or dry. I still touch up my neck with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and it cuts effortlessly, even if I miss a day or two of shaving. I found it to be a very good value.</li>
    <li> I absolutely believe that an electric razor provides a much better and closer shave when used as a wet razor. I had used a Braun razor as a wet shave before but when it gave up the ghost decided to try a much more expensive wet/dry razor. It was noisy, but gave a good shave which I thought was as good as the Braun.  The batteries quit taking a charge after one year and so I went back to the Braun.  I quickly found that I was wrong that the other razor shaved as well as the Braun. The Braun is quieter, shaves more quickly and most importantly provides a closer more comfortable shave. Five stars to the Braun.</li>
    <li> It is ok but the blade does not seem to last very long and I need to fin replacements for it already.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, amazing</li>
    <li> Great battery life, flexible head and close shave!</li>
    <li> Received this razor for Christmas and it is one of the best electric razors that I have ever owned.  My only complaint is that they just can&#x27;t give the same kind of shave a safety razor gives.  I use my Braun every other day and the safety razor on the other days.  The Braun is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned and I might add it holds it&#x27;s charge for a long period of time and there seems to be no great loss of power.  It also has an excellent sideburn trimmer.  Just remember, if you want a real close shave go with your safety razor otherwise the Braun will do the trick.</li>
    <li> No better than my old Norelco, and cost more</li>
    <li> it gets really extreme smooth and soft results when I use it with shaving foaming or cream. Great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I am returning the razor.  It was loud and would never shave my neck area smoothly.  On my neck, it was very rough to the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a foil shaver before, so I decided to take my chance on the Braun 3Series 380S-4. It was a real gamble simply because it was a blind $70 investment. Right now I can say that this investment has payed off. My shaves are closer than my previous rotary shavers, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my own skin. It&#x27;s very low maintenance (wash, occasional lube) and I can get about a weeks worth of battery out of it before charging. I usually use the shaver dry, but it works just as well when used wet. On top of that Braun shipped this package and it arrived in 3 days (my selected shipping time was 5-8 days). Great product! I will be recommending this to my friends!</li>
    <li> The discount is small.</li>
    <li> So far , so good.  Nice close shave and is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased a 790cc-4 and am extremely happy with it. I just purchased and received the 380S-4 for travel bag and wanted to try shaving with gel. WOW, shaves closer than a blade when used with gel. Will update review  after dry shave with electric shave lotion.    I know why the 380S-4 is getting 5 stars across the board after using it!</li>
    <li> Biggest complaint was delivery by USPS.  Ordered on 01/12/2012.  Received on 01/19/2012.  If Fedex had remained shipper, would have received two days earlier on 01/17/2012.  Have had for three weeks and used both wet and dry.  Shaves best for me dry.  I have used Remington, Norelco, and Emerson electric shavers.  The Braun 380S-4 beats them all.  It gives a very close comfortable shave.  I do not have to press excessively hard on my face.  While not as close as a blade (no electric shaver can cut as close as a blade since the foil is between your face and and the blades), the shave is quite close for an electric shaver.  It was closer than any other electric shaver I have ever used.  The trimmer is great and easy to use also.  The ability to just use one foil on the upper lip makes it real nice and easy to shave the upper lip.  The reason for the four stars is the battery life.  I can only get 5 shaves  before I have to recharge.  It only takes me 5 minutes to shave, so I am only getting 25 minutes of shaving per charge even though I am completely discharging the shaver between charges.  Every other electric shaver I have used gave me at least 7 days of shaving.</li>
    <li> A great razor, designed by Braun,  who has a great Industrial Design Shop with vast experience!!</li>
    <li> My son loved this shaver.  It took a little while to ship, but it arrived well before Christmas.</li>
    <li> gave these as gifts to all the men in the family. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This one worked for one of my dogs. She rarely pulls when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver. You don&#x27;t have baggage with this shaver i.e. you don&#x27;t have an adapter to clean the shaver, nor do you have an adapter to charge the shaver. You get a close shave. I proved it. We did the cheek to cheek test with my bride. I like the zip up carrier that comes with the shaver. Not a bad shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> The Braun 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver proved to be a big disappointment. My 84 year old husband is ill and I have tried to help him shave using first a dry shave and then a wet shave. He lets me shave him about twice a week so his beard is thick and difficult to remove with an electric shaver. I have an aide from Hospice who used the Gillete Mach3Turbo with much more success.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband and he is still raving about how great it works a month later.</li>
    <li> One of the better shavers I have had in a while</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not bad as a trimmer, or when you&#x27;re in a rush, it actually takes about ten times as long to use this than to just go with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;br /&gt;Has a good charge, trimmer works fine, really ergonomic, but the above probably comes down to poor blade quality.</li>
    <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this shaver.  I have been a Norelco user for many years, and fairly happily until the last one which really was a disappointment. It got bad enough that I treated myself on weekends to a &#x27;blade and cream&#x27; shave just because it felt so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give foil cutter shaving a try, and shopped around.  The Brauns are a little pricey, but I decided to give it a go since the cheaper Norelcos turned out to be pretty expensive if you considered all the costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally settled on this older mid-range model because I didn&#x27;t want a lot of bells and whistles.  I got a couple of immediate surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this thing is hefty, but I mean that in a good way.  As soon as I felt the heft out of the box compared to the lightweight Norelco I thought to myself &amp;#34;...man, there is some serious Teutonic engineering in here&amp;#34;  - it felt like it might do a credible job edging my lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I was really amazed when my first shave out of the box with it was both faster than the Norelco by a long ways due to less &#x27;repeating&#x27; over the same areas, but also as close (or I think even closer in some areas) than my blade-and cream weekend shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a lot less hassle with this one - you don&#x27;t have to disassemble the thing to clean it which should help tremendously with the lifetime compared to the Norelco which required a rather ugly plastic-on-plastic snap on and off of the cutting heads to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the 18 months claim on the head unit to be a bit hard to believe, but time will tell.  For right now I am very satisfied with this unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic wet-dry shaver with linear motor. I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for the past 10 years, primarily because they were the only ones making wet-dry shavers and I like to shave in the shower. The linear motors on the Panasonic go at an extremely fast pace (13,000+ rpm), but the foil and cutting blades are not all that great, and required rather expensive replacement at least once per year; the batteries usually started going out after a couple years. The shave was always very close (due I think to the fast motors), but not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is just about the polar opposite. Where the Panasonic revved like a crotch-rocket motorcycle, the Braun sort of rumbles deeply like an idling V8. Both motors put down enough power, but they do it in different ways. The Braun just quietly and efficiently grinds through the whiskers, with more emphasis on comfort than efficiency. I&#x27;m pleased with the way it works; even though it does not shave quite as close as the Panasonic, it&#x27;s far more comfortable. The cutting block and foil may be equally expensive to replace, and as often, as the Panasonic, but it&#x27;ll take me some more time to determine that. Two months in, and I&#x27;m not regretting my choice of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to note: if you need to use the razor dry on occasion, then I&#x27;d highly recommend the Braun over the Panasonic. The Panasonic brutalized my face anytime I tried to use it dry, but the Braun can handle dry shaves well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a while now, must say, it has been some of the closest shaving every by an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used an electric, had several norelco and consider this razor an upgrade from the last one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this wet and dry, dry is actually better for me. When shaving wet, it does ok, but not like shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> Great wish I had bought it earlier</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I been shaving for over 40 years. It gives a very comfortable, close shave. The feature that lowers two of the cutting edges so only one sticks up is great for shaving the upper lip. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was better than electric razors I had tried over thirty years ago; those pinched and gave me a rash.  The Braun does not affect me like that.  I will use it when I&#x27;m not in a hurry because nothing beats a razor for a quick and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> My dad was very happy to receive this.  He shaved with it the night he got it and he just keep feeling his face and talking about how smooth it was.  Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> use it every day very good electric shaver</li>
    <li> i introuduce to buy 7 series. 3 series is too small, Braun is good enough for regular using.</li>
    <li> Have had Braun all my life except for the last one--I tried a Norelco, which does not compare. This simple, straightforward Braun gives a quick, close shave. Very affordable with no unneeded frills That&#x27;s what men want, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> Not enough power to get a decent shave. If you really want a good wet shaver get a Panasonic, otherwise get a 790-cc, even via dry shaving the results are much better.</li>
    <li> Worst Braun Electric Razor that I have ever purchased&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t shave even with a new head&lt;br /&gt;purchased over a year ago and I have tried many different things to see if it would change but it does not&lt;br /&gt;my old Braun that is worn out shaves better</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00517W45G Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;My Braun Series 1 Model 150 still works after 10(?)years, but even with replacement of the cutter and foil, it was taking me a long time to shave. I wanted a Braun replacement. I generally tend to choose products in the mid-price range. The 380S-4 gives a good, comfortable dry shave (I may try the wet option) in a reasonable period of time. Trimmer works fine. Razor feels good in my hand. The Model 150 does not have a charging stand. This is a plus with the 380S-4. (I would describe my beard as average.)</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I was a Norelco user but I grew tired of the irritation on my neck from using the shaver so I started shaving with a blade. Recently i bought the Braun 3 series and let me tell you right out of the box i got a super close shave and no irritation on my neck, I was really happy, Then i decided to try it in the shower, man I have super smooth skin, I thought it was great dry shaving, but in the shower hands down the best close shave ever. Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for a few weeks now and am very impressed.  In fact, I&#x27;m so impressed I just purchased a second one last night for my travel bag I keep with me in my car.  I only use it wet with Edge Ultra Sensitive Shave Gel after wetting my face with water as from past experience with other electric shavers that always provides for a far superior shave, hence why I wanted this wet/dry shaver.  If you&#x27;ve never tried a wet electric shave, have tough to cut hair, and you shave near a sink, I highly recommend trying it.  I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver dry, so I can not comment on its dry performance.  I primarily use this shaver for my upper lip and the area around my chin, my upper neck (which it still does an amazing job with), and lips since my hair grows even tougher in these areas, they&#x27;re hard to shave on, and I often end up gashing myself if I use a regular blade.  I do find I have to push pretty hard to get a close shave, and I&#x27;m wondering what that&#x27;s going to do to the life of the foil/cutters, but at least this shaver has yet to nick me!  As with other electric shavers (and to a lesser extend blades even), it may take up to 5-10 passes over my skin to cut my hair thoroughly, and I also make sure I pull/stretch my skin against the direction my hair grows in so that my hair pops out more off my skin.    I still use a blade in combination with this (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power) on the rest of my face, and for touching up.  I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers in the past - Braun, Norelco, Remington, Panasonic, and Sanyo shavers and they&#x27;ve all let me down, draining me of thousands of dollars.  I had been previously using a Sanyo SV-RX10 shaver for several years that I purchased several of since it was the best of the wet/dry shavers that I tried that would even semi-work with my thick tough hair.  Unfortunately though I had two of them that just died, the foil/cutter assembly didn&#x27;t last long, and the shaver itself was cheaper than getting the replacement foil/cutter assembly from only one of two sources that sold it!  I was hesitant to try a Braun again due to a bad experience with one of their higher end shavers in the $200 range that I ended up returning.  It was so loud it would wake up the entire house and I would have had a better shave running the edge of a pair of scissors down my face.  This Braun 380S-4 not only does an even superior job to the Sanyo I liked, but it&#x27;s also far quieter than the Sanyo as well as the previous Braun I tried, while still having lots of power in the motor.  Not only is the motor and blade motion quieter, but when I first used it I didn&#x27;t even think it was cutting my hair at all since with other electric shavers I&#x27;ve been able to hear them cut my hair.  It also comes with a nice travel case, though there isn&#x27;t space in it to hold the charger unfortunately.    My only concern so far with the Braun 380S-4 is the replacement foil/cutter (apparently part number 32s/b) that is available as of writing this is not of the same design (at least the foil) as included with the 380S-4 new.  So, I&#x27;m hoping the older design will be discontinued soon in favor of the foil design on this shaver with regular circular holes instead of the random sized/shaped holes on the older design that doesn&#x27;t let my hair through.    I can&#x27;t comment on extended use and the life of the foil/cutter assembly (which is always a gross exaggeration by manufacturers) since I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to even charge a second time, but I might update this review at a later date when I can provide some more feedback.  One last note: you can find additional reviews on Amazon&#x27;s UK site (amazon.co.uk).  This is where I read the inital reviews for this shaver since there was only a couple here at the time I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and is the best replacement for my old Braun razor. (Which I keep as an excellent back-up!)</li>
    <li> a VERY GOOD PRODUCT...CONSISTANT OVER THE YEARS ( WHICH IS A SURPRISE )</li>
    <li> Great product so far.</li>
    <li> Everything I was hoping for</li>
    <li> The Braun razor is absolutely best shave I have had in years.  I hardly ever use a safety razor anymore.  The braun cuts so close that I don&#x27;t need to.  I love the travel case and the charger.  Great Job Braun!!!!</li>
    <li> expensive razor. Works well in shower. Battery has gone dead exactly 1 year after I bought it. another piece of electronic waste. Save your money.  May 30, 2015. To be fair to Braun the unit had a 2 year warranty. I was able to find my invoice on Amazon. I called the regional repair center. I sent it there and they sent me a new(?) refurbished (?) one. We&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t shave as good as I thought it would. Have to keep going over and over the skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after extensive research into electric razor&#x27;s.  I have been using an electric razor for the last 20 years and this is by far the best one I have ever bought.  It is quiet, comfortable, easy to use and shaves well.  This is an excellent buy for the money!</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of saving some money on blades which seem to be made out of a precious metal only found on the surface of Uranus!  However, it takes twice as long to shave and can still feel stubble once finished.  In addition, I also shave my head every other day.  This does not even come close to being able to handle even the simplest of tasks, let alone trying to keep the dome smooth.  Wasted money! :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as my old No***co!</li>
    <li> A gift for my son, he loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the top brands over the years. The last one I had was from the Panasonic ES series. This shaver is much quieter than the Panasonic and does a great job. The shave is faster and cleaner. I don&#x27;t get the shadow so early in the day. It comes with a nice case. I would feel better if they also included the plastic head cover which would provide added protection when I travel with it. I&#x27;m very satisfied and recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> UPDATE, November 2015  I gave this razor/shaver 4 stars when I first reviewed it.  I&#x27;m dropping that to three, and have considered dropping it to two stars.  Why: the cutter head became unusably dull after less than six months use, as opposed to the 18 months that it is claimed to last.  I tried to buy a replacement cutter head, but found them out of stock everywhere, despite many vendors selling on Amazon claiming that they were in stock.  This is a significant problem to the man who needs to shave every day and doesn&#x27;t want to pull his beard out by the roots for any longer than necessary.  Further, a new Braun cutter assembly has always, previously, restored the performance to nearly new.  The new cutter that I finally bought did nothing of the sort.  It&#x27;s better than the old one, but significantly inferior to the original that came with the shaver.  See update at end of the review for a more pungent analysis. -----------------------------  I bought my first Braun in Germany around 1966.  Plug in only; no battery; no recharging; and very sensitive to the frequency of the alternating current (I had to change a spring when I got back to the US).  But solid, rugged as the dickens. And it gave such a close shave that for many months I had to dig out ingrown hairs from my beard.  Lasted about six years until I just wanted a rechargeable model.  I&#x27;ve had a bunch of Brauns over the years.  Until Procter and Gamble bought them from Gillette, which had bought the whole company many years back, Brauns were superb.  Since then some have been gimmicky and downright fragile.  Others pretty good.  I wanted to change brands in protest against the wretched customer service two years ago, and bought a Norelco 3D 3-head rotary shaver.  It had a number of design problems which made it less useful (the teensy sideburn trimmer, for example).  I finally needed a third cutting head (one spare came in the package), and clicked on Amazon to buy it.  Surprise.  They had redesigned the assembly, cheapened the design, and made such a poor one that most Amazon commenters down checked it severely.  Not wanting to shave with that, I decided to try Braun again and thought the 380S-4 was pretty neat, esp. at last week&#x27;s $69 price.  This shaver is a nice friendly shape, with confidence inspiring solidity and a nice hand position.  At least the first few shaves left my cheeks baby-smooth, and that lasted for about 14 hours before getting a bit sandpapery.  The sideburn trimmer is well designed for the job of cleaning up really long hair that sometimes grows on my lower neck.  The shaves were quick too; just 2-3 minutes for a whole face (shaving with &#x27;Lectric Shave prep).  Some have been a bit dubious about the foil lock switch on the razor.  I&#x27;m not; I love it.  I have very sensitive skin and very tough whiskers under my nose and beneath my mouth.  With the lock &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;, it gets those whiskers with one pass; my late (and now unlamented) Norelco failed that test completely.  I had to use the teensy pop-out trimmer which really doesn&#x27;t work well.  All in all I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the 380S-4.  Time will tell about battery and cutter assembly life.  For that you need about a year of shaving.  I do hope I&#x27;ll never need customer &amp;#34;service.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll update when I have more information.  UPDATE:....... I&#x27;ve owned the shaver since last spring, roughly April.  The &amp;#34;18 month&amp;#34; lifetime for the cutter assembly is a joke.  By early Novemer I was in the hunt for a new cutter.  A joke, that.  None of the Amazon dealers had it in stock. Several said &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34; but each of those said not in stock or back ordered when I tried to buy one.  The maker refused to sell me one directly, although they did send me a gift card for $30 to make up for the laughably short blade life.  A routine check of Amazon a few weeks later showed one dealer who did have the cutter and would sell it to me, and actually did deliver.  Surprise! That didn&#x27;t restore the originalperformance as advertised. (Did you think it would?) I don&#x27;t want to spend the bucks for a new shaver, so will endure the poor shaves and pulling of hair and burning of cheeks for at least a bit longer. The new cutter did improve things quite a bit, but not enough to satisfy.  I got the distinct feeling the model could be being discontinued shortly since cutters were in short supply.  Another update: &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  I&#x27;ve been shaving with the new cutter for a couple of months. It pulls hairs a lot and doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did the day I got it. The power of the shaver motor seems less than it was.  We&#x27;re this a cheap shaver I would just toss it. But it is not.  I guess &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the Braun of old.  I would save my money and look for some other maker of foil shavers; I do prefer them to rotary mechanisms.  Originally I gave this shaver a lot of stars; in view of the short lifetime and the difficulty of finding parts and service, I&#x27;m degrading it to two stars and will keep monitoring that until I settle on a replacement.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Update, February 2016. The motor is slowing a bit. Even the new cutting head and foil didn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s pulling beard hairs all the time, and my face is complaining.  The higher line Brauns are getting ferociously expensive. Does anyone have any suggestions for brands and models. I have to change razors pretty darn soon. What about the Panasonic ARC 3 or 4?</li>
    <li> Changed from Norelco no comparison!</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had in a row.  It shaves just fine.  However this shaver has the worst battery life of any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I used to take my last one with me in the car or travelling and the battery would last for at least two weeks.  For its entire life of maybe eight years it never lost a bit of charge capacity.  This 380S-4 will lose its charge after 2-3 uses.  If you leave it in a cold car it will be almost dead after 2 days and just one use.  I have to take it inside every night and recharge it.  This is really difficult to believe.</li>
    <li> The recharging base is a piece of fragile junk that&#x27;s as cheap as a kid&#x27;s toy. The power cord keeps dislodging from the base at the slightest movement. It does an ok shave but not much better than a less expensive Norelco. Like every product today, even German ones, this is made in China.</li>
    <li> I am a regular electric razor user with a pretty heavy beard, and have owned primarily braun products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest was a Series 3 Braun 370 that I had for a few years and which was not working very well anymore. Leaving lots of strays, and the trimmer was acting up. So I decided to try this wet/dry razor since it was a Braun and had a good sale price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did my first shave with it. Shaving half of my face dry, and trying the other side with shaving cream to see what difference I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both sides I got a very smooth shave, better than my older Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet vs Dry&lt;br /&gt;Wet Pro: The wet side seems to be just a slight bit smoother than the dry, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;Wet Con: I missed quite a bit of whiskers on the wet side because I did not see them with the lotion. So I had to go back and clean those up. It was also a con for me that I had to wash all of the lotion off my face after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have always shaved with a dry electric razor, so this might be a learning curve. I think I will probably shave wet if I am going to be hoping into the shower immediately after, but otherwise will stick with dry, which works just as well, just a very slight difference in closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for comparing against my other Braun. It is pretty much the same. Looks like it comes from the same mold. Looks pretty much the same. There is only a couple differences.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it might have a little more plastic? Seems slightly lighter and the part with the foil that pops off seems more plastic. Not sure if this will impact the longevity?&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cord only connects to the charging base. So you can&#x27;t shave while charging. This is kind of annoying. But the instructions say that it takes only 5 minutes for a quick charge for 1 shave. Plus if you happen to have an old series 3, it seems like the charging chord on my old Braun works on this one. I plugged it in using the old Braun chord and got a green charging light. But have not tried to do a full charge yet.&lt;br /&gt;And it is a bit louder than my older Braun. This seems like it is due to the fact that it has more power (is faster). Could also be because there is more plastic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am pleased with the purchase, especially at the sale price. Will try to remember to update after I have used it more.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3 Series 380S shaver is fantastic. The batter life lasts for about 10 to 12 shaves. It does it&#x27;s job efficiently and smoothly. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m someone with light colored, slow-growing hair, but I still wanted to clean up every morning. Rather than lather up this provides a good shave either wet or dry. I also have pretty sensitive skin, but so far this hasn&#x27;t been an issue. Definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> i needed a travel shaver and this fits the bill.  i have a 7 series but didn&#x27;t want to lug the cleaning system around.  only issue is that the head pops off occasionally</li>
    <li> Good quality product, a little bit pricy and one charges last for couple week.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have always been a Norelco fan but someone gave me an inexpensive Braun and I used it when traveling because it packs well.  It did a quite decent job and when it became time to replace my home shaver I decided to go with Braun because the round head Norelcos have always given me a problem getting a straight trim line on my beard and mustache.  So when I received this Braun I was pleased with the grip and trimmer and started using it daily.  The first time I took the head off to empty the clippings, there were no clippings to empty.  I rechecked the instruction booklet and the way I was installing the head and this shaver just doesn&#x27;t collect the trimmings!  It allows them to drop onto whatever surface I&#x27;m shaving over.  Messy.  Next, there is no head cover with the shaver.  It does come with a hard shell travel bag but it seems to me that there should be a head cover because there is a charging stand, so when I&#x27;m not traveling there it sits in my bathroom with no head cover and I think that&#x27;s exposing the head film to damage is something is dropped on it and also quite unsanitary.  Next issue is that it has a feature where one head can be withdrawn so the other head can be used for close quarters trimming.  Well, that feature doesn&#x27;t actually disable the second head, it just pulls it in a bit, so when I&#x27;m trimming around my beard or mustache I still cut gaps into them when I get a bit too close.  And finally, after a couple of weeks of giving this shaver a chance to train my whiskers and get the closest shave possible, I can carefully shave with this piece of junk, then go over the same area with my OLD Norelco and get a closer shave, proved by feel and by the accumulation of trimmings in the Norelco.  This was a pricy shaver and inferior to my Norelco in every way.</li>
    <li> Very capable razor. No prepreperation is required and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric shavers: Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, and foreign makes I don&#x27;t remember.  This is my second Braun, the first was a 5612 which I still use for a quick shave. I should first state that I hate shaving, always have, although my beard is light. Men&#x27;s beards are as varied &amp; individual as there are men. Generally, I believe that a heavy coarse beard is inappropriate for an electric shaver, and I have not changed my opinion on that. Consequently, the shaver must be appropriate to the beard and man. Don&#x27;t blame the shaver for an unsatisfactory result. The shaver and beard must be matched. Spend some time researching the shavers before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, this Braun 3 series is an amazing shaver. The key is the shaving head with three independent floating heads. They really due float across the contours of your face effortlessly, delivering the closest to a blade shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, without a nick or razor burn. The first time I used it I was really surprised, and still am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;First, vibration is much less than my 5612, almost comparable to my Panasonic ES T251. Shaving is best if the shaver just barely caresses your face, no pressure needed. The 380S-4 can be restricted to just one floating head for use under the nose-mustache area for hard to reach places. It works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Second, cleaning is similar to the Panasonic. While both shavers advertise just rinsing under the faucet with warm water, I find that removing the head is more thorough, especially with the Braun. Shavings tend to collect in the Braun head due to the single foil/head design, so I rinse it separately. I do find that removing and attaching the head is a bit more difficult with the Braun. Fit must be exactly correct. Don&#x27;t use the little bush included to clean the shaver handle. Just hold the handle under the faucet with the head removed. Works great for a fast cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Third, there is no manual, just the quick start.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, charging takes about two hours and lasts about a week, shaving every other day. A charging cable &amp; a stand are included. Charging may be done with the stand or without. I use the stand. No, you can&#x27;t shave with the cord attached, it is a cordless shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, The Braun comes with a soft zipper pouch that I really like, protected yet soft to the touch, easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, the led lights remind you the strength of the remaining charge.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the shaver is attractive and masculine styled with a blue finish. Nice!  Recommended&gt;Fourth, charging takes about two hours and lasts about a week, shaving every other day. A charging cable &amp; a stand are included. Charging may be done with the stand or without. I use the stand. No, you can&#x27;t shave with the cord attached, it is a cordless shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, The Braun comes with a soft zipper pouch that I really like, protected yet soft to the touch, easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, the led lights remind you the strength of the remaining charge.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the shaver is attractive and masculine styled with a blue finish. Nice!  Recommended</li>
    <li> I cannot express enough how AMAZING this fine piece of machinery is. If you&#x27;re contemplating this shaver, DO IT! Not only is it a gorgeous piece of machine in person, but it performs above and beyond. When I shave, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it, for it&#x27;s such a soft and smooth shave. It removes all the hair off my face with ease and leaves zero irritation, zero razor bumps. This is the best shaver I have owned and I absolutely LOVE it. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone in need of one. It comes with a nice little carrying case for the shaver, comes with a little bottle of oil and brush to clean out the hair. The charger has a nice wire that won&#x27;t stiff up on you and it seems durable. You can connect the charger cord directly into the shaver or into the charging stand and charge it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself has lights to indicate how far along your current charge is holding up. There&#x27;s even a light that indicates when it is time to purchase a new shaver cartridge to maintain its effectiveness!! This is seriously a great shaver and I recommend it fully.</li>
    <li> I can shave faster &amp; better with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I have had a Norelco in the past, and it didn&#x27;t trim along the edges of my beard very well.  This shaver does a much better job.  I am glad it for the &amp;#34;shave before wetting your face&amp;#34; instructions.  I get a nice shave that way.  On the down side, the &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; switch is exactly where my thumb sometimes hits it and turns it off while shaving.  I am learning to adapt.</li>
    <li> Ok, so i am 42 years old and i haven&#x27;t used an electric razor since i was in the army and i only used one when i was out in the field for a quick shave. that was over 20 years ago. i prefer a twin blade razor cause it gives me a closer baby butt smooth shave or as i call it a perfect military shave. so after all these years of never breaking my shaving routine i decided to give an electric shaver another chance and specifically went with a wet/dry shaver. after researching a few i went with this one due to the price range and good reviews it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well...once i used it(with shaving gel) i wasn&#x27;t all that thrilled with it. it didn&#x27;t give me as smooth a shave as my twin blade razors and it missed a few spots. i had to go over some places under my jawline to make sure it was smooth and for some reason this thing knicked my face in a couple spots. that i couldn&#x27;t believe. if i wanted to cut myself i would have stuck with twin blades. also, the sideburn trimmer is pretty useless on my face. i really have to dig this thing into my skin to get it to trim and even then it is soso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, i have decided to only use this thing on my days off to knock hair off my face so i don&#x27;t look like a caveman. but for days where i really want to look my best and baby butt smooth i will stick to my old trusty traditional twin blade razor. i really hate to write a negative review on this product cause i really wanted to like it but that&#x27;s how it is.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  It gives me a close shave and battery life is good.  I previously had a 340-s, and often had trouble with the head popping off while shaving, because my old face is not really smooth in many places, and to get a close shave, I have to press hard.  This model has a &amp;#34;head-lock&amp;#34; that solves that problem...well worth the extra few $.</li>
    <li> Works shaves good easy to clean</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and highly recommended.  I purchased this to replace a year-old Panasonic LT-41, which was difficult to use and failed to live up to past Panasonic shavers.  This Braun is a delight to use and feels &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; in my hand.  Fast and effective, I&#x27;ve cut my shaving time almost in half compared to the Panasonic.  It has a sturdy trimmer that doesn&#x27;t flex and wobble as you use it, unlike the LT-41 where the trimmer always felt like it was about to bend and break off. The Braun also includes a neat feature that lowers one of the two cutter heads, making it easier to save under your nose with the other cutting head.  Definitely a plus.  The shaver itself cuts smoothly, without much face drag and quickly clears areas of my beard -- you can tell it has because the sound of the cutter changes as the beard is removed.  Using the supplied brush, the head and its attaching point clean up quickly.  There&#x27;s nothing I don&#x27;t like about this shaver.  Braun really has it all figured out.  I&#x27;ve given up on Panasonic and now I&#x27;ll use a only Braun shaver.  I should have switched sooner...  Update:  5/29/2015 I&#x27;ve used this shaver daily for the past month and I love it now more than ever.  Being able to lower one of the shaver heads (it has two) is a godsend for shaving under my nose.  I&#x27;ve never owned an electric shaver that was as easy to use as this one.  In this price range, this shaver is the one to beat.</li>
    <li> I had the Panasonic ES8103 which was ok, but it started to malfunction after only 5 months. It also did not give the close shave that many other reviews pointed to.  I like using a wet/dry electric, and saw the Norelco 1160x at Costco and used it for about 10 months.  It did not give me as close a shave as even the Panasonic.  I was ready to settle with that though, as I did not know there were other companies making a wet/dry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Braun 380S-4 through online research and have had it about a week.  I am really pleased so far.  It gives the closest shave of any of the wet/dry razors I have tried, and I like also that you can lower one of the shaving heads for getting to my upper lip.  I recommend this razor, and believe that this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great experience, for the first time to use this razor of Braun, grasps the feeling is also very good, easy to operate,</li>
    <li> As always, Braun really rocks!!! i bought a Braun when i was 18 yrs old and that shaver is still holding great charge and gives a close shave after 14 yrs! it would be still working without a hitch if i had not dropped it so many times. I recommend the Series 3 for its price and premium quality. i tried series 5 but i did not like it as much.</li>
    <li> Years ago I inherited an old Braun. It was an amazing shaver, durable, good battery life, and great shave. Since then I&#x27;ve tried several other shavers. This is the second Braun since and no where near as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good:&lt;br /&gt;- battery life is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good.&lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to get all the stubble. Lots of to-ing and fro-ing across your face before you can call it good.&lt;br /&gt;- thin foil damages easily, and replacements aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;- difficult to figure out which of the several replacement options to choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the razor doesn&#x27;t do a good job shaving. Blades and foil are meant to be replaced every 18 months, making this a rather expensive way to get a bad shave.</li>
    <li> A great razor at a great price. Far outdoes my two Panasonics. Great engineering. Love it!</li>
    <li> works like a charm!! blades stay sharp longer.</li>
    <li> I tend to go back and forth between electric shavers and traditional blades.  The electrics were always tempting to me as I travel in my work and not having to carry shaving cream is tempting.  The problem was I had difficulty getting close, non-irritating shaves.  This Braun changed that.  Still not quite as close as a traditional brush and cream with blades shaver, but acceptably close.  I have a medium beard, and I still feel presentable by the end of the day (although I can feel a bit more stubble that with a blade shave).  Battery life seems acceptable.  After one month of use, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> First broke within 30 days, returned it for a replacement and so far is fine.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, long battery life.</li>
    <li> prefer the older models....by a long shot.</li>
    <li> Not at all what we expected especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I had an entry level Remmington prior to buying this and it works much more efficiently. I have to keep going over the same area where the Remmington was done in one or two swipes. I don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shaver for a few months now and I am pleased with the performance.</li>
    <li> Its a great tool. It has a large hair pop out tool (that&#x27;s not advertised very well), it is waterproof, it has good battery capacity, and it has a feature where you can lower half of the blades to only shave with the top piece (necessary for upper lip under nose). It also comes with a nice carrying case, a charging dock, and a little oil for in the blades. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, however, to comment on extended use.</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  While pricey at $100, it gives a close shave in the shower.  It replaced the self-cleaning razor my wife bought me (also Braun) 5 years ago.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Coming from a Braun 7505, this shaver blows it away. I should upgrade more often! Very smooth shave, very impressed, leaves a razor like smooth closeness like nothing I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor. Worth every penny. Only downside is that you can&#x27;t use while plugged in so just hope the battery lasts many years as far as holding a charge. Right now I&#x27;m good for over a week on one charge just remember to fully drain the battery after the first full charge as per manufacturer recommendation. This apparently helps it keep a longer charge.</li>
    <li> After trying Philips 8240 for over 6 months I got tired of not only very long shave times but also not close shaves either. Decide to return to Braun and their system and design is so good that I am fully satisfied. With this shaver shaving time was cut in half and cleaning is a breeze. Excelent product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my husband. I have never bought one before, so far so good he&#x27;s used it for 2 weeks now and is very happy with it only thing is you have to constantly clean the inside or else it will clog up with hair and break your screen so make sure you take care of it while iUsing and clean it. yes I would recommend this.  price was very good considering what the others go for. Braun is a good brand</li>
    <li> I had an old Series 3 for along time. I hated to retire it but fixing it was more than a new one. So through reviews I chose this Series 3. The thing that is not revealed is that the German Company at least for this model is made in China. Be that as it may it still works well. I shave my face and head with it so it gets a hard work out. One thing I don&#x27;t like about the head is it doesn&#x27;t come apart. Tapping it dry will clear some but not all. And a rinse and some tapping( In the sink ) works a little better. The best I have found is if you have a sink sprayer it will get it very clean. The cutters move in the head when your tapping, So a little extra tapping one way or the other will line them up. It has a nice case but not room for the cord. I just repurposed the case from the old one for the cord. Once completely charged it has about 45mns of shaving time. My face is about a medium coarseness and my head is very course. I shave twice a day ( face and head ) and it works well. Not as well as a blade but safer if you don&#x27;t have the time for a blade. I use it dry not in the shower so I cant comment on that. I have big hands and its easy to hang on to. Im sure folks with smaller hands will be satisfied also. The trimmer works well. I&#x27;ve had the razor since the end of April of 2015, So far so good. When I get a replacement head I may try to dismantle the old one for cleaning purposes. The heads are supposed to last 18months. Giving its pulling double duty who knows? For a medium of the way razor on the Braun ladder its worth it. For me it works much better than a Norelco or any other rotary type razor. I hope this helps anyone that&#x27;s riding the fence of decision.&lt;br /&gt;After six months ten days of use the razor itself is good but the head failed its supposed to last 18 months at least</li>
    <li> QUIET.  Finally, I have a razor like my older Braun 5614 that doesn&#x27;t deafen me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 6 other razors including 4 panasonic models, and only the braun and and the panasonic es 8103 were not deafeningly loud from day one, and painful after 3 months&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, like the 5614, feels more like a grazing rabbit on my face than it does a planer.  All the high-end braun and panasonic models boast 10,000+ oscillations, so you can shave quicker, but at the cost of your hearing.  And they get louder as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave any less closely than the 760cc or the ES-LA63, but does take a little longer.  I don&#x27;t mind spending 3 minutes more time shaving if it preserves my hearing.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  On first use, it obviously takes longer to get a close shave, but I was prepared for that based on the reviews I read before purchasing this product.  After a week of use, I&#x27;m getting accustomed to what it takes to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the ability to get this shaver wet in use and to clean it.  The initial charge has this unit running strong after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that it is difficult to get a good close cut near my goatee.  I will find a work around.  I&#x27;d rather Braun continue making a good solid shaver and leave the trim work to other devices.  Simpler is better.</li>
    <li> So far I like the razor.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple weeks and it gives me a close shave, especially compared to the Norelco.  It will be interesting to see how long the blades stay sharp.  Norelco blades get dull in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Son has a heavy beard.  Cut shave time in half.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is simply superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery:&lt;br /&gt;I clocked it at 13 shaves before the battery finally kicked, which is going to be extremely convenient for traveling. No travel size bottles of shaving cream to get through TSA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness:&lt;br /&gt;I have to shave every day regardless if I&#x27;m using a straight razor or electric shaver, but the 380 definitely performs well. It can be a little difficult to get some of the hairs on the first pass, but this is more a function of how to glide it and at what orientation across your face than anything relating to the mechanics of the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the 380 is nearly double the price of the 340, but having the extra switch to drop the middle and third shaving head to get in close is something I would refuse to give up. This is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave yet, but the fact that this is waterproof is definitely appealing. Don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it in a sink or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I have the luck to try both this highly rated Braun AND the Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3).  One of the two works well the other not so much.  But faces and facial hair vary too.  Another factor manufacturers have in their favor.  I have thin, fine facial hair. If allowed to grow longer it curves at an angle then I can have trouble.  So I am shaving clean my neck, chin and mustache area as I  want neither a mustache or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both for 90 days separately the Panasonic was clearly the closer and more effective shave.  I had to rake the Braun over my face over and over again.  Where the Panasonic cuts much closer.  No contest.</li>
    <li> I am almost 67, and have struggled with shaving most of my life.  I have a very heavy, coarse beard.  My favorite electric shaver (until wet/dry shavers came along) was a Braun; so, I was thrilled to find out that Braun now makes a wet-dry shaver.  If you have a coarse beard, it is definitely the way to go.  You use shaving cream just as if you were using a safety razor.  This shaver is incredibly comfortable on the face, is easily cleaned, and charges rather quickly considering that you can get at least 4 shaves from one charge.  One difference:  I found in the instructions that Braun suggests shaving BEFORE you wash your face.  It took a little getting used to, but you wet your face, apply the shaving cream, and shave.  The results are definitely better if you follow that suggestion.  I could not be more pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I owned a succession of Norelco and Remington shavers before settling on Braun about a dozen years ago.  While the other Brauns were good, the 380S-4 is the best one yet, and by a considerable margin.  It shaves smoothly and completely, is easy on my face, cleans quickly (I don&#x27;t use water, but instead tap the bottom of the cutter head on a hard surface), and holds a decent charge.  The only thing I can complain about even a little is the trimmer on the back, which works well but rattles a bit.  I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works. I am very happy with this shaver.  So, I got a second one for travel.  You may have different face, so be careful. The charge is great &amp; lights let me know when to recharge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had panasonic and norelco razors before this one.  Every morning I would dread shaving due to the irritation and inevitable ingrown hairs.  I have thick very coarse hair and shaving would take ten minutes with multiple passes and ,afterwards, I would even have to apply hydrocortisone just to make my face less red before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;With this Braun shaver, shaving is easy.  There is no irritation or ingrown hairs, even under my neck. No more red bumps! I wish I could lobby for a law that would require Braun to continue making this shaver for as long as I live.  Now I see why it has such great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Slightly louder than the norelco razor I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great close shave with less passes than my prior panasonics and norelco razors; No irritation; Very precise trimmer piece that cuts sideburns easily and quickly; Looks high-tech; Ergonomically designed; Just feeling this product you can tell it&#x27;s quality</li>
    <li> I had a previous Braun model for 10+ years.  Bought this one knowing I was getting a quality product. This one works very well and gives a quick clean shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor about three months ago.  I wanted to give it a good trial before I gave a review.  I bought it based upon other favorable reviews.  This is my first Braun razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once so far and I use it every second to third day.  It shaves very smoothly and gently as long as you don&#x27;t get in a big hurry.  It&#x27;s easy to clean-I just tap the disconnected shaver head on the bottom of the sink and blow off the the remaining residue.  The trimmer works well on sideburns.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor.  The razor was purchased at an excellent price.  I hope this review helps you make your decision.</li>
    <li> Really fair price. Great close shave, what i was expect. I bough this one because i get a discount of 100$ compare to walmart canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything well package, in discrete box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close shave this one are better then the circle shaver. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wan spend much dollars for a 4series 790 at 200$ close, this one will make the jobs done as the 790. (My step brother got the series4 790, and i didn&#x27;t found any difference to be honest, except the 790 got the auto- wash  include)</li>
    <li> Nice shaver and does a good job wet and dry</li>
    <li> Awesome. It works. Buy it.</li>
    <li> shaving not something I dread anymore. smooth &amp; comfortable with long battery life</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 2ND BRAUN RAZOR.MY OLD LASTED 7 YRS. I REALLY LIKE THE NEW RAZOR IT REALLY WORKS REALLY GREAT. I WOULD TELL EVERY ONE TO BUY ONE .YOU COUL NOT GO WRONG.</li>
    <li> Just OK my husband was not impressed he said it dosen&#x27;t do the job. As it was quite expensive I feel it was a bad buy. it did come on time and was packaged properly</li>
    <li> The 380S-4 is my fourth Braun shaver.  I purchased this one to replace a model 7505 I&#x27;ve used for some years now, going through several replacement cutter/foil sets along the way.  I decided it was time to replace the 7505 because its battery would no longer hold enough charge for more than a few shaves (and the battery is not replaceable in any reasonable sense).  I chose the  380S-4 for two reasons: 1) user reviews indicate it shaves well and 2) uniquely among Braun shavers it is set up for travel (I have a couple of trips each year that take me away from home for about a month).  For most purposes the actual shaver is no different than Braun&#x27;s 340S-4 (there is an extra charge indicator light and a \\&quot;precision setting switch\\&quot; that lifts one of the heads to better shave under your nose - in my estimation neither of these is a significant enhancement).  Unless you just want Braun&#x27;s travel case, I suggest you go with the 340 and save yourself $20 (the 340 has a plastic clip on hood to protect the shaver head, and so should also be travel worthy in an after market case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaver the performance is impressive, a bit of an improvement over the 7505 and in operation the unit is considerably quieter.  I&#x27;m finding it to do a better job of getting pesky neck hairs and am able to achieve a better outcome overall without any significant skin irritation (and I have fairly sensitive skin).  My beard is moderate and I shave daily, so take that into consideration.  Also I only \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave, although the unit is designed for wet or dry shaving.  The 7505 required periodic cleaning of its blade assembly with a brush.  For this model, the blade assembly and foil are integrated and so can only be truly cleaned by rinsing under running water.  Since I live in a hard water region, I&#x27;ll be curious to see how it holds up to the mineral assault.  The unit has a light that won&#x27;t come on until it is time for a new cutter head assembly but it is simple minded (a internal countertriggers the light, presumably around 18 months - it is easily reset by pressing in the on/off switch for 5 seconds; i.e., the unit can&#x27;t actually tell whether or not the head needs replacing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that the unit only operates off of battery, but supposedly can charge sufficiently in 5 minutes for a single shave (I suspect that since the shaver is designed to be used wet/dry, Braun decided that if configured to operate corded, some idiot might choose to use it that way while in the shower).  My only real beef is that the travel case supplied with this model has no means for accommodating the power cord, although it is very well designed to protect the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/1/2012 update:  I&#x27;ve actually become more impressed with this shaver.  Not only is it holding up under my hard water assault, but it has an interesting feature not otherwise mentioned.  Namely, the power circuit uses a voltage regulator so the unit runs at the same speed regardless of the amount of charge on the battery.  For this reason, it quits rather abruptly as it is draining the last bit of juice out of the battery (this kind of technology is used in good quality LED flashlights and will fully drain the typical AA alkaline battery without any loss of light output until the battery is kaput).  This is precisely the reason a 5 minute charge is sall that is needed to put enough juice back in the battery for a shave.  That&#x27;s a really nice feature.  One other thing.  I noted that over time a haze of very fine grit accumulates which rinsing doesn&#x27;t remove, but it is easily cleared by using a can of compressed air, something I&#x27;m surprised Braun doesn&#x27;t suggest when you want to completely return the shaver to like new appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/29/2012 update: One more thing, when it becomes time to get a replacement head be aware that Braun has several types of Series 3 shavers and the heads are not cross-compatible.  The replacement for this one is either Series 3 32S (silver trim) or Series 3 32B (black trim), whatever your color preference (I would just pick whichever is cheaper).</li>
    <li> Quality new in box, razor processed &amp; shipped quickly. Satisfied with the product and how well it works. I had the cleaning one that got lost in the mail. Purchased this one as a replacement. Cuts just as well but can also be used in the shower/with shaving cream. Overall I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a new shaver I scrolled through the many pages and read the reviews.  Only one was rated by everyone as 5 star so I bought it and I am so glad that I did. It gives me the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.  The battery lasts a long time and even when it is running low the shave is still high quality. It&#x27;s quiet and fits in your hand very comfortably.  It is an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Works well in shower and out.</li>
    <li> Great shave, fast ship</li>
    <li> The shaver has strong power than I expected. After comparison with Philips, Braun is much suitable for me. The whole purchase process is quite good. Amazon, a trusted website.</li>
    <li> Been a Braun shaver user for years. So when it was time to replace this is where I went. Extremely comfortable shave compared to my old razor and what a charge capacity! I can go almost,two weeks between charges. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, and it was awesome.  The receiver has done nothing but rant and rave about the look, style and performance.  I would highly recommend this for anyone you know.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has sensitive skin.  I love it! It works great wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric razors on the market. The shave is consistently close to the skin and smooth on the face. The shave lasts up to twenty-four hours and it will hold its charge up to five operations.</li>
    <li> Preformed ok, I&#x27;m just not use to an electric not a close enough shave so I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Been using this shaver for a month or two. Works good. Easy to clean. First couple shaves I had with it were kind of rough and lots of scratches. After about 3 times shaving with it though it works great now. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy or what but it took a little break in. Good deal, I don&#x27;t regret buying this shaver. My last shaver lasted me 8 years so I felt strangely sad switching to a new razor, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying a Wahl shaver last year with changeable heads for grooming, and that thing is pure junk. I was too cheap on myself. Now that I got a Braun, my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A great shaver. A little pricey but the shave I get is worth the money. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about 18 months ago to use when I travel...about once per month.  The unit gave an adequate shave though not nearly as close as when I  use my DE razors and lather.  About two days ago, I was on a trip, shaved in the morning, and since it had a full charge, laid it down on the dresser.  When I came back to the room after breakfast, I noticed a loud buzzing coming from the razor and found that it had turned itself on.  I pushed the on/off button with no success so I tried putting it back in the charger to see if that would somehow, turn it off. It did....FOREVER. Now, the unit shows a  full charge while in the charger, shows a full charge when removed, but will not turn on..though it did for split second when I picked it up...without pushing the button.  UPDATE:  After posting my review, a rep from the company commented..advising me to contact customer service for a new razor.  Since it was under warranty, I did so.  Within a few weeks, I received a Braun m60 mini shave as compensation and a packet for mailing my old razor in for replacement. The company did replace the faulty unit.  Their recovery was excellent and we shall see how this new unit does.  This was my first and definitely my last Braun product.  It gave an average shave and for the most part gave me at most, 40 shaves before dying. It is junk and I would not recommend wasting your money on it.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this one!</li>
    <li> So far..pretty good.  I have thick facial hair and this Braun tackles it effortlessly!  Very close and smooth shave.  I&#x27;m growing my beard out for the winter, but it still does a great job on the trim-up/</li>
    <li> The reviews I read prior to ordering the Braun 3Series 380S-4 were very high. I have not found my shaves to rate at 4 or 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the previous reviews rated the Braun Shaver to provide a shave close to that of a hand shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to ordering the Braun Shaver, i was using a Philips Norelco 8240XL Tripleheader Razor and I have not noticed any great improvement with the Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Ken S.</li>
    <li> My husband did his own research on an electric shaver for his Birthday and this was his choice. I just ordered it from my favorite internet shopping site. He is very pleased with it and it more than met his expectations!</li>
    <li> Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver very good,I like it.think you very much.Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver very good,I like it.think you very much</li>
    <li> After using electric shavers for five decades, I finally found the perfect electric shaver. I used it about ten times so far and today I tried it with shaving cream. In about three minutes I finally got a barber shop quality shave using this electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic Wet / Dry razors for maybe 20 years. My last one was a fancy one with a charging percentage indicator. The indicator light failed after about a month. I kept the razor (didn&#x27;t like Panasonic&#x27;s warranty policy which reads that they can replace the razor with a refurbished product - ick). I eventually started looking at the Brauns and settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the shave is better than the Panasonic, and it&#x27;s easy to maintain. Braun recommends shaving prior to showering, because they claim that one&#x27;s face swells after showering (I presume it&#x27;s harder for the razor to shave as closely). I ignored that advice for a while and then tried it once. They&#x27;re right! My shave is noticeably closer and better if I shave before showering. Who would have thunk?! Anyway, whenever I buy a new wet / dry, it will be a Braun.</li>
    <li> I found this shaver to be what I expected from Braun. It runs quietly, unlike a Remington I bought a few months ago. It handles nicely and I&#x27;m getting good shaves right from the &amp;#34;gitgo&amp;#34;. Worth the cost for sure. Thanks also for the prompt mailing, didn&#x27;t have to wait long before I received it.</li>
    <li> Great close shave, long battery life between charges.  Would recommend highly, replaced a Panasonic with terrible battery life. Love this shaver.</li>
    <li> It was a tossup choice between this or the panasonic but I am glad I went with Braun. So far I have zero complaints. Great for clean shaving although a bit tougher to get the areas under the chin but its as good as it gets for a fast and efficient electric shave</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an electric shaver that  works well?  Since my heart bypass, told to use an electric shaver.  But gave it up when I found  how poorly it shaved.  Might work better on others? I know many use them.  Does work well but left too much  behind.</li>
    <li> I have only had limited experience using electric shavers in teh past, and it was unpleasant. Always burned and got irritation. This one is surprisingly good. My beard is kind of difficult with ingrwon hairs in some areas and my neck tend t be oversensitive but the Braun has proven very effective. So far, used it a few times and the result is a smooth shave and no irritation at all. Overall I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00517W45G Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my new Braun 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver from my UPS man today.  I have been using Norelco Wet Dry Shavers for years now and have been very happy with them with the exception of my last one (Philips Norelco 8020X) which isn&#x27;t bad but I wouldn&#x27;t call it great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several disadvantages to the Philips Norelco 8020X is that you have to use it wet as the moisturizing fluid keeps the shaving stubble from getting all over your bathroom sink.  The other issue is the difficultly it has always been in getting replacement containers of moisturizer for it, the shaver uses a propitiatory version of HS803 Nivea which not every store caries in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last negative I have is when shaving my neck area, despite the fact that all three heads \\&quot;Float\\&quot; I never get a close shave with the shaver even after \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; my face over and over again with the shaver.  It drives me up the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it today after the recommended 4 hour charge time and while the shaver is new I am not new to electric shaving.  This being the case I feel my skin is already adjusted to it.  I used the shaver before getting into the shower and so I shaved with it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several things that I already like about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. One can use standard, over the shelf shaving cream with it, which I consider shaving wet.&lt;br /&gt;Charges very fast: 5 min of charge will get you through one shave or 1 hour charge for 45 min of shaving which I think equates to 1 month of standard everyday shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I used and do like the built it side burn cutters.  The cutters are angled in such a convenient way as you dont have to hold the shaver in some strange angle and unlike my previous Norelco you dont have to snap the trimmer on/off every time you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Using the shaver on my neck area was a cinch, up/down Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The shave was very close and despite the fact that I didnt use any gel or shaving cream the shaving head captured all of the stubble.  A lot less mess now that I have to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. One more thing I like: The shaver feels very solid in your hand.  Its styled very nice, great color combinations and looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what the shaver comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver&lt;br /&gt;Power Cord&lt;br /&gt;Charging stand- Which you can use or not, the power cord plugs into both the shaver or stand (great for going on vacation, if you forget your stand your not outta luck)&lt;br /&gt;Nice semi hard case for both shaver and Power Cord&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Brush &amp; a small tube of oil for maintenance purposes.&lt;br /&gt;User Manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to many years of service with this shaverhaving head captured all of the stubble.  A lot less mess now that I have to clean up.  5. One more thing I like: The shaver feels very solid in your hand.  Its styled very nice, great color combinations and looks fantastic.  As for what the shaver comes with:  Shaver  Power Cord  Charging stand- Which you can use or not, the power cord plugs into both the shaver or stand (great for going on vacation, if you forget your stand your not outta luck)  Nice semi hard case for both shaver and Power Cord  Cleaning Brush &amp; a small tube of oil for maintenance purposes.   User Manual  Looking forward to many years of service with this shaver</li>
    <li> My husband is 91 years old and when I purchased this shaver for him, he was not sure he could shave himself close enough.  He was thoroughly surprised and loves his new shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he had tried an electric many years ago and was not happy with it.  I thought he should try again with the good reviews I chose the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to tell you that since he has had it he does nothing but RAVE about it.  He is very pleased that he has had no trouble with this razor, it is quick, does a perfect job and NO nicks or burns.</li>
    <li> This is my brother birthday gift.he like it</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with the closness of the shave.  I&#x27;m very happy it is quiet.</li>
    <li> - Nice razor, but if you have a beard the plastic side guard will catch beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The extra switch is worth it as it isolates a single foil making it easier to shave the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;- it charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time.  But when it dies it dies quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it. Shaves close and comfortable, took no time for my skin to adjust to and shaves three day stubble without a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new with this kind of producs but so far the best shave I ever got...ever</li>
    <li> the good&lt;br /&gt;* easy to clean head.&lt;br /&gt;* really like the trimmer on the back&lt;br /&gt;* works with shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;* overall shaving is faster &amp; more fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not so great&lt;br /&gt;* doesn&#x27;t really cut hairs below jawline&lt;br /&gt;* its not very effect after 5 days growth</li>
    <li> Because I really like a close shave, I use an electric shaver as a pre-blade shave on those sensitive or hard to reach areas.  This shaver gives as close of a shave as more expensive electric shavers.  I had a Braun 6500 model for many years and it finally died.  This is an excellent replacement for my old Braun shaver.  The quality and price make it a great buy for me, and the shaver is well engineered and constructed.</li>
    <li> I returned this product. I have always had Norelco shavers, but Consumers gave such high ratings to the Brauns that I thought I&#x27;d try one (and this was a high-end model). I found that even after 3 weeks, it did not shave as close as my Norelcos and was noisier. I subsequently bought a Norelco 4400. Not only is it quieter, it shaves closer than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and is easier to handle that the Braun.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this time I think it&#x27;s important, especially if your a rotary guy.  This Razor replaced a Philips 8000 3D Razor triple head I owned for about 2 years.  That razor was in general great, however, an accidental drop and one of the screens was no longer running smoothly.  Figured, oops, no biggie I&#x27;ll just replace head.  Boy was I shocked to learn that the original replacement part cost over $150 for just the screens, and the updated recommended part from Philip, though still over $50 was rated very, very badly by other purchasers.  My whole life, or at least the last 35 years shaving I&#x27;ve use rotary, however, I&#x27;m not spending $2-300 for a new razor that has a recommended head replacement yearly and that cost is half the razor cost.  Time for something new, so I&#x27;ve decided to try out Braun and a new style.  30 days now, and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  It&#x27;s a change in shaving style, but it does the job far better than I imagined.  Taking it in the shower actually is pretty cool as well.  It travels flat, has a nice case, and is easy to clean.  I&#x27;m really glad I made the choice to try something new.  So if your in the same boat, which from reading some of the reviews seems a common theme, this one might be for you.</li>
    <li> First time with a Wet &amp; Dry shaver and after a months use gives a great shave very quickly. Have had 2 Braun shavers before and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I like the flexible heads and the optional locking feature.  It also &amp;#34;pulverizes&amp;#34; whiskers much better than my old Braun, making it easier to clean.  The trimmer takes a little getting used to, but overall I&#x27;m pleased with the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  I have tried other brands and always returned to Braun. I am planning to buy my son this same razor in a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product!!</li>
    <li> one of the best finest shaver (razor) you can buy I have one and love it, it is so I  hear is used by many of the NFL football players!</li>
    <li> Does not reduce skin irritation, leaves strands of hair behind. I tried it wet and dry.  I would have returned it, my military assignment don&#x27;t end until 6/14/14.  Can I possibly return it for a refund after my assignment ends?</li>
    <li> Really nice close shave.</li>
    <li> works fine even for tough beards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about eight months. Like most products, it has good an bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: I like the shave quality, it&#x27;s a lot quieter than the Braun Series 5 that it replaced, and it charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Unlike the 5 series, the head does not have any kind of latch. If you set it down wrong, drop it onto the counter, or sometimes even when shaving the head can pop off, which makes a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to get the cheaper 340 model. The locking head &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; on the 380 is just a lame little plastic switch that is not worth the price difference. Better still, if you don&#x27;t care about wet-dry shaving, get the 320. It&#x27;s virtually the same product, for about 1/3 less money,</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver. Leaves my face feeling nice and smooth. Very user friendly design, easy to clean with a quick recharge. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun. Up to now I&#x27;ve been using both a Remington foil and Norelco rotary. The foil has always given me a closer shave but the rotary is faster when I&#x27;m in a hurry. Both are very old, which is why I needed a new shaver. It&#x27;s also a whole lot quieter than either of my other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already shaved an hour before the Braun showed up at my door. It had half a charge on it and I wanted to drain the battery before charging it up (always a good idea with rechargeable batteries, discharge them completely before recharging for maximum life and runtime), so I (dry) shaved again and was surprised at how much more hair the Braun had cut. I can&#x27;t compare it to a blade as I have not used one in some 40 years or so. I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with electric shavers as my facial hair is not all that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no protective head cover but it does comes with a very sturdy travel case for that purpose, which I think is better than just a piece of plastic that can fall off while in your suitcase, like on my other shavers. If you wanted a cover so you can keep the shaver in a drawer then you are out of luck. Besides, it comes with a stand, and it looks kind of cool sitting on the countertop. You can charge it with or without the stand, but it&#x27;s not designed to operate while plugged it, for safety reasons. Otherwise you just know someone somewhere would fry themselves in the shower trying to use it while plugged in, (&amp;#34;but...but...it says right on the box use wet or dry&amp;#34;) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a reminder light for &#x27;Foil and Cutter cassette&#x27; replacement that comes on after 18 months or when worn. You reset it by holding the power button down for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean, turn it on and rinse under hot running water, then turn it off and remove the cassette and let it dry. They say to apply a drop of machine oil (included) to the foil surface and side cutter once a week. There&#x27;s an included brush for cleaning under the cassetteas needed, but not to use on the cassette itself as this may damage it.</li>
    <li> My husband just started using and enjoying it. At first skeptical using it and has many complains - finally got the good result  and is happy using it now. - I got it right. A birthday present for him! I</li>
    <li> This was the first time I went for an electric shaver, with lot of expectations but this product failed to live up to it. It does not give as smooth shave as a regular Gillete Mach 3. I have to run it few times over on my face to get a clean look. However it is a toal failure when it comes to the neck area. Even after running over a few times it wont shave.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for just trimming it may be ok, but for regular shaves it doesnt work atleast for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery on time</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver for my husband who absolutely loves it.  What more need I say.  It gives a nice smooth shave with very little effort. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this after buying a replacement head by mistake for it.  Does not shave the neck or tighter place well.  Cannot be used with the cord.  Misses whiskers.  Does not have a protecting cover for the head for travel.  My wife thinks she can use it for her legs - I have a 8000 series and it is heads and shoulders better.  This should not have the Braun name.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard so for me it gives a very close shave and because it&#x27;s a wet or dry shaver it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water. It replaced a 19 year old Braun shaver that finally started to have some charging issues. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great Shave! Easy Clean! Reliable! Keeps A Charge! What more could a man want?!  HUGE upgrade over my old Phillips circular shaver!</li>
    <li> Real good shaver gives a clean shave easily. If the hair doesn&#x27;t cut the first pass go over it again gently and it&#x27;s a real clean cut with no irritation from constant shaving.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced a 5 year old Braun shaver, and it is everything I expected.Fast, smooth shave, good recharging time, and the conveninence of a &amp;#34;needs to charge&amp;#34; light make this a big improvement. Shaves well wet or dry. Highly recomended!</li>
    <li> The Braun razor and all other items were very satisfactory and exactly what I wanted and expected EXCEPT for Episode 3 (The Fire of Life), in &amp;#34;The Roosevelts&#x27;&#x27;. This DVD is cracked and can&#x27;t be viewed. So the period from 1910 t0 1919, 120 minutes, is missing. I would like it replaced but do not want to purchase the whole series again.&lt;br /&gt;I rated &amp;#34;The Roosevelts&#x27;&#x27; with 5 stars anyway because the other six DVDs are terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I give five stars to everything else I have obtained from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I did not go all the way through to rate everything, but I would give 5 stars to all if it.&lt;br /&gt;Owen Canfield</li>
    <li> i did&#x27;t expext it would work so easy. it looks like the item for lttle kids and not for real men.</li>
    <li> This is my first non-rotary shaver and am very happy with the switch. I have always used Norelco rotary shavers and recently purchased the Norelco 1150x and it was a bad decision, see my 1 start review on that.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is a much better shave, wet or dry. It is very gentle on my skin , easy to clean, quiet, re-charges quickly. This is the best shaver I ever owned. I am never going back to a Norelco rotary.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> I came from a cheapish $30 (or so) &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; of electric shaver. It worked but wasn&#x27;t great. Investing in his Braun 380S showed me that electric shavers really are worth the price of admission. Heck, just opening the packaging for this unit, you&#x27;ll realize that you&#x27;ve bought a high quality product that was well-designed and engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to buying this Braun model, I assumed that the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; shaver I used to have was a good enough representation of the electric shaving offers from all brands, however, I now realize that was a foolish assumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t grow a thick beard. My theory is my hairs grow shorter and thicker rather than longer. Similarly, when I used to use non-electric shaving methods, the disposable blades would always be rendered dull in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my old, non-obscure brand electric shaver, I&#x27;d inevitably have to make five or more passes on my neck to get a passable shave. With this Braun? I don&#x27;t need to make but one pass. The Braun 380S does the job how it should be done the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a critic-- I&#x27;m just some guy in college who wants a great shave. This Braun 380S provides that. I think I&#x27;m on the Braun train for good now.</li>
    <li> This thing is junk.  It worked a grand total of 2 months for me and then died.  I am NOT hard on razors and am very careful with them.  There is NO reason why this thing should not have lasted OTHER than the fact that it is JUNK.  I&#x27;ll NEVER buy another Braun razor.</li>
    <li> It did not give me a good shave and the middle  area of the top shaving part had come out when I received it.  My  previous shaver of the very same model gave me an excellent shave and that is why I ordered this one.</li>
    <li> Rapid charging, durable.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is clean, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I charge, has been used for 8 days, there are 50% power.&lt;br /&gt;Like shaving thoroughly recommend people to buy.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to shave and drives me nuts when I can see a hair and the razor won&#x27;t cut it. While it is quiet and looks good, I wish it would actually shave better. After 6 months I bought a new blade and not much difference was notable. So sad as my last Braun was so good that I wore it out over the years. Back to a Norelco, faster, cleaner and no more stubble at 3pm. Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much time with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is certainly the best shaver I have used. It is easy to hold, reasonably quiet, charges quickly, runs for an acceptable period between charges, and cuts closely and quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to relace a Grundig shaver that finally gave up, that is it became impossible to find the screen and cutter blocks for it. I chose this model because it is one you can use wet and with shave creams and gels.  I was looking at the higher series but this was the only one that could be used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  At first I just about returned it because I was not getting as close a shave as my Grundig, but after a few days that changed.  I am getting a much better shave with it now.  What I do not like is 1) this model was the better of two because it has a lock for the shaver head to work the harder to get parts of one&#x27;s face. However it does not have a plastic cover for the shaver head that the lesser model has.  This one comes with a case, but if I wanted to pack it for travel without it, one risks damaging the shaver head.  Fortunately the case does fit in the place where I normally pack the shaver in my travel kit, so not so bad.  2) It still takes quite a bit of time to get a close shave, and therefore,the battery only lasts a week if I am lucky.  My Grundig lasts, even several years old, at least 2 to 3 weeks on a charge.  Again, not a huge deal but I like to travel light and now I have to take the charging cable with it&#x27;s transformer for longer trips.  The battery may need a little &amp;#34;seasoning&amp;#34; running it down completely a few times to lengthen the charge time.  Time will tell.  It does give very comfortable shave and the trimmer is excellent.  I do enjoy the wet shaving abillity, that is something I never experienced until I used a small battery Braun shaver and hence looked for a new main shaver that can be used wet.  I may come back and update this review if I find the battery longevity improves and the cutter heads last as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my daughter to my husband.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> does not give a close enough shave-as reported by my husband</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for maybe 6 months out of the two years that I have owned it.  I started out getting about four, 8 or 9 minute shaves with shaving cream. Now I only get 2.5 shaves.  Be very careful because the battery does not seem to last like it should.  I usually use my Panasonic shaver in the shower.  So this one I use as a spare when I don&#x27;t take a shower.  I have to shave wet and not dry.  My dry shaves are very incomplete and not very close.  This shaver does give a pretty close shave when used wet. (for me)  Not as good as my Panasonic LA93. But even this Panasonic is starting to lose it&#x27;s charge holding ability.  Maybe 4 shaves per charge, 9 min each.&lt;br /&gt;  P.S.  I don&#x27;t know how people can get a good shave on using a shaver for 2 minutes as some reviews I have read. I takes me 3 minutes to just shave my neck area under my jaw line.(middle and sides.)&lt;br /&gt;  I called Braun service center to get a cost of the battery replacement.  Repair and shipping approx. $65.00.  So needless to say , it would be better for me to put up with the decreased battery life or buy a new one. (only used approx.  6 months out of 2.5 years)</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It work very good.</li>
    <li> Shave is definitely as close as a blade... EXTREMELY satisfied... GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It is very good , thanks</li>
    <li> Dos&#x27;nt shave under the chin. shaves at about 80%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s easy to clean and recharge is quite quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun shaver I&#x27;ve bought for myself (a woman).  I use it--alas--on my chin hairs and moustache.  Better than looking like the Goat Woman!  It cuts so well and is so gentle.  The charge lasts for two weeks, at least.  It&#x27;s washable, too.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as gifts.  The were well recieved and have functioned flawlessly.  They provide a very close shave and are easy to keep clean.  Ijust hope I can find a local source for the oil.</li>
    <li> It is my first time to buy a gift for my dad in amazon from US to China.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good purchase experience and  the goods is so good and deserve to buy.Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> After 3 months of use, this razor continues to impress me. 3 plus weeks battery life means I don&#x27;t have to take the charger along on trips. I use a shaving cream with it and rinse it often during shaving so the water proof feature is great.  Using a very light pressure gives me a close shave.  Rinse clean after every use and a drop of oil across the heads per instructions once a week seems to keep it running well. Noise is quieter than I expected.</li>
    <li> Nice electric shaver that&#x27;s OK to get wet.  Almost as good as a wet shave with a blade in a third of the time.  Easy to clean and keep charged.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I used a model 5614 shaver for many years, having to only replace the comb and cutter set occasionately as they wore out for lot&#x27;s of use. This model even outshines the old one, which I did not think possible. It gives a thourouh clean cutter in a gentle manner.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> Must be dull blades because it does not shave close.  I don&#x27;t know what if anything I am doing wrong, but I have had to go back to razors.</li>
    <li> Shaver work very well and is sharp the price is great, I doubt that the more high end shavers would best this or a good safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver, what more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it seems to take twice as long to shave as my old Remington which gave me a quick and&lt;br /&gt;excellent shave otherwise I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  It does however seem to be well made and looks cool and I suspect it will last  along time  This is the first time I&#x27;ve had one of these shavers.  All the others were the three head type.  Maybe it just takes time to get used to it and know how to use it correctly</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for probably 25 years. When I could no longer get new foils for my old Braun, I almost went with another brand shaver. But then I discovered this model with its elegant design, color and price, I immediately ordered it. This Braun gives the most perfect shave I&#x27;ve experienced in a very long time. No skin irritation, no shaver burn, just a nice, clean shave. It is the best model Braun I have owned yet. I even look forward to shaving in the morning!</li>
    <li> Like this much better than the rotary blade shaver.  Works great and the trimmer is high powered.  Great product, dont hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and my son kept using it, so I bought one for him. They both love it.</li>
    <li> I chose this 380S-4 shaver to compliment my 350CC series 3 dry shaver to use on my neck and head, however, I found it works better for the neck area to shave dry! In fact I received more irritation wet than dry on my neck, however, my face ended up about the same as dry but shaving wet on my head works just fine. I really like the lockout feature this shaver has to drop one of the foils for shaving under the nose so you don&#x27;t run over your lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one &amp;#34;knock&amp;#34; on this shaver is that it won&#x27;t work in my 350CC clean and renew system even though they are both 3 series shavers! I made my own formula to clean the shaver and oil it. I reccomend using the cleaning station because it leaves the shaver clean and smelling nice and it seems to shave with a little less irritation. I would reccomend buying the series 7 shaver if you have a heavy beard especially on your neck, however, if you have a medium or light beard it works just fine. I find the 380S-4 great for shaving your head with no irritation!</li>
    <li> I have virtually stopped using a razor.  I got it to shave my neck with less irritation - which it does well.  But, I shave my whole face with it, and only once in awhile touch up with a razor in the shower.  Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> My first wet dry shaver.  It gives a nice smooth shave with no irritation.  Easy to clean. Also has long battery life.</li>
    <li> Hi. I recently bought Braun shaver on your website. Unexpectedly it stopped working. Please help me out based on it&#x27;s warranty terms</li>
    <li> Really a good product.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Excellent in all respects.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. I was about to go back to double edge blade shaving, but I thought I&#x27;d give the new Braun wet and dry shavers a try. This is at a nice price point, I didn&#x27;t want to pay hundreds for a new shaver until I was sure the shave was good, and I really wanted to prove to myself it would be fine using it in the shower. And it is. What a shave that way! No irritation, the head just glides because of the water from the shower, and then clean up is easy, I remove the head and hold it up to the shower head to wash it out, and then set the shaver and head aside to dry. By all means by the shaver lubricant as it will help prolong the life of the head.</li>
    <li> Use it on an almost daily basis. I am 22, and get a lot of facial hair, works great with close hairs and does great on trimming my goatee.</li>
    <li> I had a Cruzer 3 before, and shaving with this is about 3 times faster, and twice as good a result.  I cannot be happier.</li>
    <li> Very good buy, best features are the long battery life and unexposed blades that allow you to clean it safely without getting cut. Very good value for money. I would recommend buying this as it is simple and effective.</li>
    <li> It is good but not great. I got what I paid for. I will pay a bit more to get what I need.</li>
    <li> I have been a straight razor user for many years now as I am clean shaven and also shave my head. I was to the point that I wanted to try something that may speed up the routine a bit. After reading the reviews on this site as well as reviews in Men&#x27;s Health on this razor, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try..&lt;br /&gt;The first attempt was dry shaving which was just ok. The closeness was horrible in my opinion. I had to go over numerous times and still felt stubble. The second attempt was in the shower after a face and head scrub.. This was better although it still was not that close. The third attempt was again in the shower with similar results. The fourth and final was another dry run which left me with razor burn and folliculitis... Needless to say, this thing was boxed up and back on it&#x27;s way to the warehouse! Guess I&#x27;ll just spend a bit more time to clean up in the mornings..</li>
    <li> I had a Braun for 8 years prior to buying this one and loved it!  Based on my experience, I decided to try Braun again.  I didn&#x27;t think I could get a better shave than the one I got from my old one but this one is twice as good as the one I had.  If any electric razor can give a closer faster shave than this, I would like to try it.  I&#x27;ll probably have this one for another 8 to ten years but when it dies I know what brand I will be buying next!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but ok I guess. I have to take a bit longer to obtain the type shave desired.</li>
    <li> Gift for my boyfriend, he loved it!!!</li>
    <li> really smooth shave...excellent buy and great product</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver or its latest model for a long time. It does the job very well and is not that expensive. I find that when one wears out it is less expensive to just buy a new one and skip the new shaving head. The motors do tire and so the new shave approach seems better to me.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun shaver that finally gave up the ghost and was looking for a replacement. I did not want to spend a huge amount of money on this, but I wanted another Braun. After some careful comparison shopping, I found this little beauty, and I would very highly recommend it. Battery life is the only thing that I might give it a slight demerit on, but it&#x27;s not even enough to knock it down half a star. I expected to have to charge more frequently than in the past, because I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is VERY close to blade quality for me. My beard isn&#x27;t quite as tough as it used to be, but it still needs a good razor to keep it in check. So far, I am finding this razor to be up to the challenge. Even at times when I have skipped a day on a weekend, this shaver still deals with it quite handily. One caution - if you have a heavy beard, I would shave daily, or your results may not come out as well. I really like the ability to change the cutter position for tight spots. The trimmer is fine, but I have a separate trimmer so I have not made a lot of use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a BREEZE. just pop off the foil head and rinse it out, and use the small brush provided to clean the area under the foils and cutter. It&#x27;s very easy to care for this quickly and efficiently (it&#x27;s a Braun, what would you expect?). Pop the shaver into the provided small stand to keep it out of the way until the next day. The shaver can charge on that stand as well when the time comes; just plug in the charging cord on the receptacle on the stand and you can see when the shaver is fully charged. Another minor thing - you can&#x27;t just plug the cord in and shave, as the shaver does not work while in charging mode. But you can do a quick charge, enough to shave that day, in about 5 minutes, and then you can do a full recharge in just over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a very good shaver on a smaller budget but don&#x27;t want to sacrifice quality, I would urge you toconsider this model very seriously.</li>
    <li> Simply stated I have been using this razor for 3 weeks since I purchased it and it does an excellent job. I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone. I previously owned a Braun, last purchased in 1997, and got 17 years of reliable service, so the brand has been dependable for me.</li>
    <li> There is no better electric shavers on the market than Braun. This one charges up fast and shaves almost as close as&lt;br /&gt;a blade. I usually only shave once a week using a blade shaver and this use this Braun the remainder of the week. It saves&lt;br /&gt;time in the early morning and feels just as smooth. I have used Braun shavers for at least 20 years and I always have been&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with them. They are a solid quality shaver and you can use them wet or dry. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Braun!</li>
    <li> I have not had an electric razor for many years, I like the fact that you can shave in the shower or dry.</li>
    <li> works better than I ever thought , have not used it with shaving cream or used in shower but know need to</li>
    <li> Very good product. .well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my sixteen year old. I was pretty confident getting this brand due to the fact that I previously purchased a Braun series 5 for my husband about 5 years ago. He continues to use &amp; loves it just as much as he did when he first got it. He&#x27;s only had to replace the head once and has never had to replace the battery. My son began using his father&#x27;s razor, so it was time for him to get his own. I figured the series 3 would be perfect for him. He loves his own razor &amp; has no complaints. Needless to say we are pretty satisfied with Braun.</li>
    <li> The shaver received great reviews from Amazon and other web sites.  Unfortunately, 1) it does not provide a close shave ... worse than my 10 year old Norelco and 2) shaver is &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; ... 1st time I used it, it hurt my ears.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied. Good item, high quality, fair price. I really like it. I always count on the manufacturer and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works as intended. Takes getting used to it.</li>
    <li> this is my first foil razor.  it works great wet or dry and leaves my skin smooth.  the only area it takes longer to shave is my neck.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the Braun shaver. There are two things that I am not crazy about; one is that the on/off button is right where your thumb rests while shaving which makes sense in one way but doesn&#x27;t in another-I always feel like I am going to shut it off while shaving. The other is that the charging cradle does not &#x27;lead&#x27; the shaver into it and you have to fiddle around trying to get it into it so that the charging terminal meets up with the shaver terminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver seems to do a fine job and gives a fairly close shave. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good product happy with the performance.</li>
    <li> first of all i want too thank everyone for helping with my purchase reading your reviews is so helpful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the blue and black design shaver has a beard trimmer on the back little hard to pull it out ;) lol&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t that loud as other in tested it to be unless i have a hear aid problem lol easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;it came with a charging dock stand small brush and oil for maintenance a case to put away&lt;br /&gt;owners manual stated one hour for a full charge but it was longer them that so i just let charge over night&lt;br /&gt;overall i am happy with it when it breaks down i am going to go for series 5 them series 7&lt;br /&gt;the price i got for was 71 bucks and its gone up crazy :) and the shipping was supper fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s an update on my shaver its been 17 days since its first full charge i am impress, i shave twice a day once in the morning and once in the night up and down motion works the best no circle rotation like other shavers make sure you clean it after every use and add oil and andis lubricant spray which i use because it cleans and disinfects and its smells good when you spay it :)i also use it too shave my arms be careful by elbow area it cut me lol other them that im still happy with my purchases</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 2 months now and it is just OK. I feel a bit cheated paying over $90.00 for it. The shaver leaves stray hairs that I have attempted to remove by continuously mowing over them.  I end up using clippers or a hand razor. I feel that a shaver should take all the hair off.</li>
    <li> I have not been very impressed with this shaver. I have used many Braun&#x27;s and I would return this one if I still could. I thought that the wet dry option would be great, but I find that dry it is too rough on my face and doesn&#x27;t pick up all of the hair unless one really works hard. Wet (with water or shaving cream) it doesn&#x27;t irritate, but again it does only an ok job. A blade with cream or a high quality Braun used dry would do a better job. I do acknowledge that this is a cheap razor for Braun - but was hoping that that didn&#x27;t mean that you only got so, so results. I wanted to note that I have been using the razor for about three months now, so I think that my experience won&#x27;t change much. Any break-in period for my face or the razor should be long past by now. I am upset that I missed the 60 period for return, as I think I would have used it.</li>
    <li> nice，but，it is made in China，I am a chinese…………</li>
    <li> Best Braun shaver yet. I&#x27;ve owned several Braun shavers before this one and I have always been very satisfied with them. The last one I had bought had to be about 10-15 years ago. It was finally giving out as it would not hold a charge anymore. I decided on this one as I do not use it on a regular basis. It works perfectly! I get a nice close shaver with it, plus I like the idea of being able to use it wet or dry. Clean up is a breeze as all I have to do is run it under some water and it&#x27;s all clean.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I shave my head, it is adequate, but not a really close shave,,,,I still have to use a razor forthat...this is ol for a quick touch up between shaves.&lt;br /&gt; rat</li>
    <li> This was a last minute purchase for Christmas for my grandson. It was exactly what he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy, made my day. He loves it. His old shaver could not compare with the close shave he receives&lt;br /&gt;and a comfortable shave, plus the easy clean up. Far exceeded our expectations. Wet &amp; dry, perfect.</li>
    <li> the charge seems to last through several shaves but it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as i thought it would&lt;br /&gt;It may be just me but i am  going back to the soap and razor</li>
    <li> It appears to be state of the art piece of equipment and it reflects its German design.  The shave is not as close as a razor blade but is acceptable for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Only works mediocre  Would be ok in a  hurry but you have to keep going over and over same area to come out clean and smooth</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver, gives a good close shave. I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews, and I think there is an important distinction to be made. Everything about this shaver talks about giving a good shave, even on a &amp;#34;3 day&amp;#34; beard. As in, shave every weekday and then don&#x27;t shave over the weekend, then shave again on Monday morning. If this is your pattern, it works great. But if you like to shave once a week, when your beard will be longer, it will take you 45 minutes to shave it all off cleanly with this shaver. It isn&#x27;t meant for 6 day beards, but it works very well on beards up to 3 days. And for the money, it works great.</li>
    <li> works good; hope it&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this shaver for Christmas. Now I’ve tried it out thoroughly.  I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are as other reviewers have said: (1) it takes longer to shave than with a blade; (2) the shave you get isn’t as close, and (3) it takes two weeks or more to get used to shaving electrically if you aren’t already.  On long days you can get a five-o’clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, this shaver has four decisive advantages.  First, it doesn’t pull long hairs or pinch skin like the electric I had when I last tried one  some thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it lets you stand up straight while you shave, instead of bending over a sink.  For someone my age (68) with a tricky back, that’s a crucial advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, unlike a blade, it shaves the tricky parts without cutting you, every time.  Between bending over and cutting myself, I had come to hate shaving so much that I wouldn’t do it on days I didn’t leave the house.  Now I don’t mind shaving and have made it an every-morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, I hated being beholden to Gillette for blades, to the tune of about $1.50 per day.  It’s not just the money, which really isn’t that much, but the constant worry about running out of blades and reordering.  Now, according to the instructions, I can take shaving for granted for 180 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the instructions and followed them carefully.  In particular, I discharged the shaver completely twice, to avoid problems with battery memory.  While I did so, I got over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves with no power at all.  Then I still had a bright red light which (according to the instructions) means you can finish your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance. Light weight, fits perfectly in the hand, easy to read instructions charging is quickly. Will recommend to those with carpal tunnel Syndrome.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have been using it for three weeks and shave is close.  Unit captures whiskers very well and it is easy to clean with running water.  Will probably have to recharge this week once unit runs down completely.  Holds charge very well.  Have not used the wet shave option but that is something I normally would not do.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a month with no issues. Quiet and does the job. i find it easier to unplug from stand and plug it direct to shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver does it all. Smooth close shave. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I  have used this product for about 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> The shaving heads work very well and the the shaver is not loud. A very nice and close shave. One complaint, the trimmer does not cut as close as some other shavers I&#x27;ve had. I would of given 5 stars if the trimmer worked as well as the main heads.</li>
    <li> Shaves smoothly and reasonably close on facial skin. Not so effective in shaving whiskers on neck, particularly longer hair. The long hair trimmer is effective in this area. Charge lasts as long as claimed and full re-charging is also as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to makers recommendation to shave before getting your beard wet, I found that shaving about 30 minutes after showering&lt;br /&gt;has provided better results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electronic razor for years, but the real razors were tearing my face up.  I am really impressed with this Braun and love it!  I get almost as close a shave as my blades... well worth it!</li>
    <li> Nice razor but shape of cutting edge makes it difficult to trim beard edges, impossible to trim mustache under nose etc.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Sanyo SV-RX10 but still decent.  If you have thick facial hair, this Braun is a decent choice.  Not the best but better than average.  Battery life is good, quietness is good, closeness is decent.</li>
    <li> lost years of my life using shaving blades</li>
    <li> This is a good razor; the only down side is that it caused ingrown hairs all over for the first 2-3 weeks of using it.  He had a braun before but this must cut differently or something.  Other than that, it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> Give it at least a month....... It seemed like my beard had to sort of grow into the way it shaves (totally different from my old Norelco triple head). Now, for the most part gives a smooth,close shave &amp; only charge it up about every 10 days,or so.</li>
    <li> For an affordable product.</li>
    <li> good results, never did well with electric razors, but this one is different.</li>
    <li> First thing I did was fully drain the battery before it&#x27;s first charging. You should always do this with rechargeable electronics such as phones, tablets, radios, etc. for maximum battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had to recharge it a handful of times in my six months of ownership, but I also only have moderate facial hair growth, so it&#x27;s not like it gets a real heavy workout every morning, but I do use it daily. Foil shavers do shave closer than rotary, just not as fast. If you are used to a rotary you might feel like it&#x27;s taking too long. For me it doesn&#x27;t feel long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to use it in the shower. I just never think of doing it. Shaving afterwards is just something I&#x27;ve always done. Besides, it looks better on the countertop than in the shower:) I love the design and blue/black/chrome finish. I would have preferred something to cover and protect the foil, but it&#x27;s not really needed around the house. The semi-stiff travel case appears to be adequate for protecting it while in your suitcase, and contain any fine cut hairs from getting on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned, thanks!</li>
    <li> The only problem I had is there was&#x27;t any instructions with it, or booklet to order replacement parts.  And I couldn&#x27;t get Amazon to understand this.!</li>
    <li> Very nice easy to clean and gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides an acceptable shave including the difficult areas around the mouth.  It holds a charge for multiple shave experiences.  The head is easy to clean.  The shave is not as close as with a classical blade razor but that should be expected for all electric razors.  Fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> The effective of the shaving is great as well as the blade for long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the re-filling battery is as declared and the time of the re-filling is short.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s attractive and handy.</li>
    <li> It is best to use the product I used, very good, I am very satisfied with it. For direct mail to China, very fast. I love it. I would like to second purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow, after years of using a Philips Norelco, I cannot believe the closeness of this shaver. I am not used to the shape of  this one yet, and goes over my face quite different from rotary. It is more powerful than my former shaver and I am still getting used to it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality shaver. It&#x27;s quite lightweight, fits easily into its charger base, and does a very good job with the actual task of removing hair from the face.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, my ownly problem with it is that I bought it 1 year and a half ago (March of 2012) and I use the trimmer only. Well its now Sept of 2013, and its making a very loud noise, meaning I have to replace it. Otherwise its a simple to use and good shaver with a nice vertical trimmer (unlike Panasonic). Well what do you know, its Oct 2014, and its making a really loud noise again. Need another one. So has a shortened life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my guess is, its as good as any shaver out there.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned. I love it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Model is fantastic, and I am so glad I picked this one. There is another low-end version of this shaver, but with this one has a great zip-closure carrying case and a more detailed battery light indicator: the low-end version has a plastic cover (to protect the razors) and a 2-light battery indicator (the high-end one I am talking about has 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the razer so good? Because its simple... and effective.&lt;br /&gt;This razer doesn&#x27;t have many breakable parts. It feels incredible sturdy, and the rubber really lets you have a good grip to shave. I can&#x27;t describe how sturdy this razor feels. It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or delicate in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razer has incredibly long battery life. No lie. It came to me half charged, but it said to charge it fully for 4 hours before I used it. Which is what i did, everytime thereafter it has charged fully in one hour. The battery life on this product is said to last a week with regular shaving, well, it didn&#x27;t last that long for me. It lasted 3 weeks. I shaved everyday, the little stubble that I had grown over night, and it seriously lasted me FOREVER. I was starting to think if I even needed a charger. This is great, because now when I go on a vacation or spend the night in a hotel, I don&#x27;t have to carry any cords around! Just this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back of this product is a sideburn trimmer. You just press a little button, and slide it up. It extended beyond the regular shavers, in case you were wondering. I would advise to turn the razer off before sliding up the trimmer, though. Just a little tip I think would help in keeping it last longer. This is a great feature, because now you don&#x27;t need to do anything else to trim up! Just pop it up, trim. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the best feature... ITS A WET AND DRY RAZOR. Seriously, how slick!&lt;br /&gt;If you need to do a quick shave to clear that stumble. Go for it. It only takes a few minutes, and you don&#x27;t need to use any cream. HOWEVER, if you want to have the closest shave ever... use some cream. I use super sensitive cream with oatmeal, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how close it was. No hairs, its like a baby&#x27;s bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this hasn&#x27;t already gotten you, I don&#x27;t know what will. There is an amazing case that comes with this, and the razor was well worth the money. You will not be disappointed with this product, in fact, you&#x27;ll love it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Hope you can experience this for yourself!</li>
    <li> It works about as good as any electric.  No irritation, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works great even when wet shaving - without shaving TOO close.  Easy to clean and lasts a long time on a single charge</li>
    <li> This razor is light weight, quiet, and cuts very close for a clean shave.. everything I could ask for in a razor!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. I&#x27;m entirely satisfied. Very good shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 380s-4 (with 100 - 240VAC Charger) last year because my other Braun Shaver (a 5610) has a 120VAC Only Charger, and I didn&#x27;t want to carry a separate transformer in order to charge my shaver while traveling in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 380s-4 shaves my face and neck just fine.  It took a bit of adjustment when trimming my mustache, since the angle of the trimmers are 90° different between the 5610 and the 380s-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find it peculiar that Amazon is bundling the 380s-4 with the &amp;#34;Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack&amp;#34;, which is very definitely NOT the correct Foil and Cutter for the 380s-4.  The correct Replacement Pack is the 32S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this info saves you the trouble of ordering the wrong part (30b), like I did.  Fortunately, the Cutter from the 30b fits my Braun 5610, but the Foil doesn&#x27;t fit either the 380s-4 or the 5610.</li>
    <li> Shaves really smooth, good price. Love the wet or dry feature</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- fairly close shave on most parts of my face&lt;br /&gt;- good build quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer was difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;- head is very large and does not get tighter spots well&lt;br /&gt;- not great on the neck area - takes a lot of passes, and never gets everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- though an overall fairly close shave, I could not get over the poor performance on my neck, and the awkwardness of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had in years of shaving with an electric shaver. Easy to use and clean. As expected it is a bit more noisy than the rotary shavers I have used in the past, but not by much. Delivery was quick, received what I wanted, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as closely as I would have expected from this brand.  I would not purchase this model if I had to done it over.</li>
    <li> Got high quality razor at good price. Does many other tasks. Can shave dry or in the shower. Very well built.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve used it for about three weeks and has only needed one recharge and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.  Works well.  My husband finds Braun shavers very good and likes this simple one better than the fancy self cleaning ones that provide more opportunities for failure.  However, it came without a clear cover for the head, so now I have to look for one.  Otherwise, it would be a 5.</li>
    <li> I have used razors for most of my adult life being now 52 years old. I had tried a cheap electric razor in my younger years but didn&#x27;t really like it because it didn&#x27;t shave very close. So I was reluctant to try an electric. Finally after frustration with regular razors not shaving close enough and even trying to grow a beard to avoid shaving all together, I decided that I would try the Braun Series 380S. After shaving only a couple of times I really believe that it shaves as close or closer than a regular razor. I am very happy with it. I have not tried it wet yet, but dry it does very well. I recommend it to those wanting a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with three headed shavers for years, but it seems the new ones are getting harder to reassemble after cleaning.  I couldn&#x27;t get the blades back in right and always had one that was loose.  I finally decided to try a shaver with only one long blade.  Like any new shaver, it seemed to burn and leave a little stubble in the first few uses.  But now that it&#x27;s broken in, it shaves comfortably and more smoothly than the triple headed brands.  It seems to be well built, so I hope to use this happily for many years.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3series 380s-4 gives a very close, comfortable shave.  I don&#x27;t have to fully dry my face before shaving since it&#x27;s a wet and dry shaver.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past weeks and it&#x27;s still on its initial charge...no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I bought this to shave my legs. Considering the women&#x27;s ones are weak and seeing these reviews I thought if men love it, it will be great for me. It didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING. After many passes still had a lot of long stubble left (about 4 days worth - I wanted to test this right). Now I&#x27;m dissapointed because I passed my return window because I kept trying to give it a chance. There went close to 90 bucks. If it works for men, great. Does NOT work for women&#x27;s legs. At least not women that have coarse stubble.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to save him time but the shave is NOT close. So he&#x27;s back to his regular razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver. The first one lasted over 20 years! This one is quieter, with a much closer, fatser and more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Very, very pleased.  Can put off shaving an extra day and get no pulling like my other electric razor. Easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for over two weeks and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. It gives me a closer shave than the Panasonic shaver that I was using before (even with new blades and foil installed).  I like the lack of swiveling head pieces as I always felt that those are more sales gimmicks and potential failure points than something that helps give you a close shave. Overall I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun&#x27;s since the 90&#x27;s and this is the best one yet with truly the closest shaves&lt;br /&gt;and it cuts through a couple shaveless days with no problem at all. I hope that the Foil&lt;br /&gt;holds up well, since my previous model developed holes in it regularly, which got to be&lt;br /&gt;expensive to replace a few times a year.</li>
    <li> Came from a Philips Norelco because this had a great sale and decent reviews so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery Life - Not good and not bad. Seems to last about 2 weeks of shaving fine. (I always charge every 2 weeks even if the battery doesn&#x27;t run out) Very similar to my prior shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Beautiful Design&lt;br /&gt;2) Easy to charge (However can&#x27;t charge when using unlike the Philips)&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to clean and reassemble (Literally just run under water after popping the blade section off)&lt;br /&gt;4) Travel Friendly - Comes with a travel case and a very compact charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Only 1 but its a huge one&lt;br /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t Shave well- I read and use as the instructions stated. However it leaves so much excess hair that my shaving time increased from about 2-3 min to about 6-7 min for a clean dry shave. Maybe my face is just contoured so that a Philips works better....</li>
    <li> Does an excellent, close shave! Really love it, so far!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. Met all my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.  Husband loves the close shave</li>
    <li> You get a great shave with this shaver.  Have not used it in the shower.  I have used a blade razor for over fifty years and now I ask myself why.  You cannot go wrong with this Braun Shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used all brands for over 50 years. Braun for the last 20.This shaver is the best of all of them.</li>
    <li> Save  money and buy a Norelco. I gave this junker a fair trial over a months use. Will not cut close, is noisy (expected), fair battery life. If it would only shave close it would be worth more!!</li>
    <li> Braun shaver for the first time, the fine janeun price performance will sseoboni&lt;br /&gt;Dont shave the chin yet making a push mower seems to be forcefully</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to spend $100 for a shave that make it appear as if you haven&#x27;t shaved then this is the razor for you.  Personally I found this to be completely useless and had to go crawling back to my regular razor and beg it to take me back.</li>
    <li> This shaver is in my opinion far superior to the Panasonic I had earlier(actually 2-different units). The Braun is much faster, quieter, and does not burn my skin so readily, nor does it nag me to clean it every shave.&lt;br /&gt;The wet capability is open to question.&lt;br /&gt;The S version, with the extensible shaver portion is not needed. There was not a good explanation of what this bit does, and not much is the answer, unless you have a 2&amp;#34; Snozz overhang!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, excellent machine, and the fact that they suggest an 18 month between cutter/head changes is a big savings there, should it be the case, which seems to be at this writing.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Great price good desl</li>
    <li> Very good shopping experience, rapid delivery time. Shaver feel good. Many functions, I just need the most simple functions, but it does not affect me like it.</li>
    <li> Most important:  It gives me a close shave quickly.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation.&lt;br /&gt;One charge lasts at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;Useful manual.&lt;br /&gt;Cute charging stand.</li>
    <li> works great, worth the money. Fast delivery. My Husband thanks you a lot, perfect product. Thank you so much. Sandra</li>
    <li> I was recently placed on a prescription that called for continual use of a blood thinning agent.  As such, the doctor recommended that I switch from a blade to a machine.  I was not too happy  . . . tried machines early in my life and hated them.  This one, however, is easy to use and gives me a cut which is close to a blade cut.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever owned. In addition to giving a great shave, the travel case is well made and compact.</li>
    <li> I had another Braun series 3 shaver, and I gave it to my nephew, who needed a shaver and he had admired mine. This new wet/dry shaver is wonderful. It is easy to use, and does an excellent job. I have a mustache/goatee, and the shaver does a fine job of trimming around my facial hair.  Another plus is the fast charging time. The shaver will fully charge in an hour or less. I recommend this shaver very highly. It also came with a cleaning brush, a zippered case, and a little bottle of lubricating oil. All in all, a very satisfactory shaver--and a good value, too!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver!! This thing eats whiskers like I&#x27;ve never seen man! Fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever given myself. Seriously, I&#x27;ve always used Panasonic cause they were a little less expensive. You won&#x27;t be sorry spending a little more. The built in trimmer is also excellent if you&#x27;re lazy and you get a little long! Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Braun has an excellent reputation.  This series 3 continues that performance.  Only concern was a squeaking noise when the on/off button was pushed.  Eventually the noise stopped.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I am a woman but I have chin hair and a slight mustache. I tried electrolysis and everything years ago. That left me scarred so I just used a straight shaver. It has been so much trouble but I have done that all my life. I decided to search for a shaver and wanted one that isn&#x27;t too big and would give me a close shave.  This has turned out to be just perfect. I just turn it on and zip zip 20 seconds and I am done.</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever from an electric razor. Gets the long hairs and is a pleasure to use.  I will no longer use a regular multi-blade razors! Trimmer works nicely too.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was so frustrated with the 700 series Braun that I used for almost a decade.  It never trimmed properly, but this was a charm in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  Nice design, easy on the grip, shaves very well, water and dry use, cleans up very well, the blades empeded so it doesn&#x27;t get exposed, the blade is sharp and doesn&#x27;t dull too quickly, easy to clean, nice holder and brush that comes with it, charge stays real long.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: No display, heavy</li>
    <li> Clean shave with no problems. Sometimes hard to go sideways. The trimmer is so powerful. Older one broke after 2 years. It may heat up after 10 mins of use.</li>
    <li> The shaving is very good, I like it very much,shave very fast and clean.i think the useful feature is support water wash.</li>
    <li> Compared to my 5000 series Braun 20 years ago this thing is like a Ferrari. Will miss the Made in Germany lettering.</li>
    <li> Gave this shaver to my 17 year old son for Christmas. The acne he was having on his chin was apparently caused by shaving with a regular razor, because it cleared up when he started using this one. He can shave on his way to school saving him time in the morning. He just loves it.</li>
    <li> my old Braun shaver is still working well after 10 years.  it&#x27;s a bit smaller and has become my traveling choice.  the new shaver performs well and i look forward to many close encounters.  the technology and construction is efficient and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both new and old consistently provide a closer and less irritating shave than a blade.  i have never had any problems.</li>
    <li> Overall a very nice shaver.  Not as powerful as my old Panasonic, but LOTS quieter.  A single charge lasts all week, great for traveling.  Cord without base is also easy to travel with.  The plug part has all the electronics and is typical of Braun units (toothbrush etc.), a bit of a large plug but not cumbersome.  I would prefer a larger trimmer width, and it could be easier to deploy the trimmer - really my only complaint.</li>
    <li> After may years with another Braun shaver I purchased this model. It has performed superbly with results comparing to a 4 blade razor without the prep hassle. I would recommend this shaver especially at the discount price of $70.00p.I have never got good results with the circular norelco cutting blades but these vibrating blades perform the best.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a fantastic job of cutting through dense forest-like beard growth.  If I haven&#x27;t shaved in two days my other electric razors couldn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but get closer shave with cheap Gillitte</li>
    <li> 3 round wheel shavers a wee bit better  this 1 has a tough time getting 2 curtain spots</li>
    <li> Performed well so far hoping the blades will last.</li>
    <li> This gives the best shave for an electric shaver.  Well made and easy to use, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Ive had this razor for about a month and it&#x27;s very nice. It&#x27;s a few steps up from my old Braun. So far I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband since his old one was about to play out.  He has used several other brands with varying degrees of satisfaction.  This is his first Braun and he loves it.  He gets a great close shave and it doesn&#x27;t pull or drag.  It&#x27;s also very quiet running.  He has had it about a month and it seems to keep a good charge.  Has not had to recharge it yet.  He would recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I do not like it. I also have a Norelco Senso touch that far surpasses the Braun. Braun used to mean quality-not to me.</li>
    <li> Shaves smooth and close.  Holds a charge for a long time.  Fully immersible.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on buying an electric shaver.  I thought the 380S-4 was the best choice.  I was skeptical that an electric could give me as good a shave as a razor.  This was about as close as it could get.  I have only used it dry and not in the shower.  I have used it now for about a month and am very happy with the results.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father because he always cuts himself shaving. He loves it. Nice close shave and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> My husband had one of these and then my son wanted one after he used it.  We&#x27;ve tried other brands, and Braun has just been the best for us.  Easy to clean and holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> Just the replacement heads for the Norelco shaver (Philips Norelco HS85 Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head) I&#x27;ve been using for several years were going to cost me the same as the price of this Braun shaver so I thought I&#x27;d give this shaver a shot.  The shave is every bit as close as the various Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve using over the last 20+ years.  And from what I can tell, the Braun replacement blades won&#x27;t be nearly as expensive as my past Norelco rotary blades.  I&#x27;m good with that!</li>
    <li> Been there done that. I originally had a Braun shaver, that still works fine after 10 years, but upgraded it to a Braun with the cleaning tank. The unit fell apart, the tiny trimmer broke so it wouldnt retract. I hated the stupid cleaning station and resented having to find and purchase the expensive refills that were nothing but alcohol and blue water. So-- I decided that a Panasonic would be the solution. The thing turned out to be clunky and awkward, the trimmer was terrible, and you could not get around the nostrel region. It didn&#x27;t shave all that well either, and forget getting the neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought the Braun Series3. This is a simple, straight forward unit, that has a great trimmer and shaves better than any of the others.I am delighted with it. If you are looking for a razor blade close shave, get a brush, shaving soap and a Gilette razor, no electric razor can match a blade shave.</li>
    <li> Husband reports he is pleased with this razor. Hasn&#x27;t purchased a new razor in many years and finds this to be superior to his old Braun. Would buy another if needed.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a month now. I have to say that changing from Rotary to foil has made me pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you thinking about making the jump from rotary to foil:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using rotary shavers for about 15 -20 years now. I have watched norelco try to innovate and fail miserably. My oldest norelco shavers were better than the new ones. Speed XL was a huge dissapointment. HQ8 blades did a much better job than the HQ9 blades( particularly around the neck area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This braun handles neck hair well, which has been the problem for me. Battery life does not last as long as my previous rotary shavers. But the overall shave is better. Only time will tell at this point how much mileage i can get out of these blades and how much I end up liking this shaver. But for now, it is a like.</li>
    <li> Works very well I have the must luck with the dry shave. Only issue I have is I have trouble getting close on my neck because of differing grow patterns.</li>
    <li> Very close shave and much better than my Braun series 1.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works great.&lt;br /&gt;Good value at the right price, about 60 dollars.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace an old Braun 5500 series I bought ten years ago.  Yes, my old one lasted ten years.  That sold me on buying another Braun.  So far, the 3 series shaver is plowing over my thick stubble with ease.  This is a no frills, simple shaver.  Charge and shave.  That&#x27;s all I want and need.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to clean. I use it dry, but can rinse as needed.</li>
    <li> I am a engineer and this a very bad designed razor.  The oscillating bridges keep falling off the razor when you take the screen off for cleaning.  The oscillating bridges are spring loaded and will fall off.  When I contacted Braun customer service, I found out that they have the worst customer service department I have ever had to deal with.  It took 3 months and about 30 emails before I got replacement oscillaing bridges.  This razor has given me nothing but trouble.  Save your money and do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow, closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver! takes a few passes to get everything but really is a nice shaver. battery seems to last forever too.</li>
    <li> Bought it a few weeks ago. I have two complaints so far: 1. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my previous Braun (8000 series). 2. The third time I used it, the foil/cutter assembly flew off as I was shaving, and one of the internal plastic pieces and a tiny spring came off. Luckily I was able to find both and reassemble it. On the positive side, I like the convenience of being able to rinse out the cuttings under the faucet.</li>
    <li> I must say I am disappointed with the quality of the shave.  I do not have a heavy beard, and the shaver just does not do the job.  I had a Norelco three headed shaver for years and it gave me a much better shave.  I liked the idea of a wet and dry shaver, but it under performs.  The battery does stay charged well.</li>
    <li> My dad love this shaver.</li>
    <li> pros.. the convince of shaving when I take a shower..ability to use the shaver on a charge or as a plug in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.. doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave and takes a long time to shave because I&#x27;m going over the same area.. Although I rinse of the shaver after each shave, it smells like a damp rag that&#x27;s been left out..I had a 5 series that gave a real close shave and lost it..I&#x27;ll re-order that one</li>
    <li> nice thing. When switching from razor fills like lawn mover &#x3D;)  will not come back to a razor!</li>
    <li> This electric razor gives a good shave. The battery charge lasts for about a week of shaves.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband, he seems to like it.</li>
    <li> After using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for quite a few years (and using electric shavers for almost 50), I decided to go back to Braun as the 380S-4 had been recommended by a friend. I purchased one from an official Braun dealer and have used it for 18 months. I have never been happy with it. For the first 4 months or so, it seemed fine and was shaving well. I do not have a heavy beard and so was surprised that I was only getting 6 sometimes 7 shaves out of a full charge. This is well below Braun&#x27;s own specs as a shave normally takes me only around 4 minutes. It also meant having to remember to take the shaver cord with me on trips of more than 4 or 5 days. After 8 months I found myself getting small facial cuts. If I did not shave for a couple of days, the middle blade would also sometimes catch and pull a hair instead of cutting it. With a new foil and set of blades, the shaves were better, but again that lasted only 4 months or so.  I have now just ordered a new Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this part of my face in years!  Years ago, the Remington Triple Foil was the gold standard.  This one is incredible because of the way it tackles long hairs-in the middle between the 2 foils is a valley that cuts any hairs that pass the first foil uncut: brilliant!  Also, being able to lower one side of the cutter so you can get it under your nose: brilliant also! (otherwise it&#x27;s like shaving with a brick under there).  Get it already!  Click!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son for his new hair growth. He is less intimidated by this than by a blade. I works great and he likes using it.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an almost nine year old Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job shaving and is very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> Summary: Although this is far less expensive than the Braun 5 or 7 Series razors, it holds its own and stands out as Braun&#x27;s only wet-capable shaver. I found it provided a better wet shave than my Panasonic ArcIV, Norelco AT830, and Norelco Sensotouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main review: I&#x27;m a big Braun fan, and have been a 5 and 7 series user for a number of years (before they were called the 5 and 7 series). I&#x27;ve always been impressed by their performance and build quality. However, I&#x27;ve recently started to prefer a wet shave and thought it would be interesting to give a Braun wet shaver a spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased that I did. This is absolutely the best wet shave I&#x27;ve ever had bar none, and a very good dry shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other wet shavers are the Panasonic ArcIV, the Norelco AT830, and the Norelco Sensotouch 3D. The Braun 380s beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, the Panny comes the closest to the Braun&#x27;s overall comfort performance, but the Braun wins out by not leaving any rough patches on the jaw line and neck areas. The Norelcos perform well on my neck and jaw line, but you need multiple passes which often leave me with some irritation and redness. The Braun, in contrast, is very gentle but still manages to provide a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best shave using a thin gel such as this:[[ASIN:B005ACNP5K Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Cooling Menthol Shave Gel  5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] ). You can see where you are cutting, and there&#x27;s very little mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m particularly impressed with the build quality of the 380s. Both my 5 and 7 Series are made in Germany, so this is my first made in China Braun. Regardless of where it was made, it&#x27;s put together very well - feels solid and has the good heft Braun&#x27;s are known for. Right before I got the 380s I was evaluating a Remington FR-750, which (at the time I&#x27;m writing this in July 2012) is priced exactly the same as the 380s on Amazon. What a huge build quality gap! As I noted in my FR-750 review, the Remington felt rather cheap. Compared with the 380s, it feels like a Cracker Jack toy. And it&#x27;s the same price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 380s has many design cues from the 5 Series. It&#x27;s about the same length but a bit wider. It feels comfortable to hold due to a rubber, non-slip grip. It also has one of my favorite 5 Series features: a push up trimmer. This is the best way to edge a mustache since you can see exactly where you are cutting, and is much easier to maneuver than a flip out trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not have a cleaning base like most of the 5 and 7 Series models. Although the cleaning bases work very well, it&#x27;s not a big loss since for the 380s since it&#x27;s easy to clean under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a stand, which connects to the cord so it charges when it&#x27;s put back in the stand. Although the stand is small, it has a non-slip base so it&#x27;s generally sturdy. I would have liked to see a bigger base, however, for a more secure hold onto the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a Braun user and want to shave wet, but don&#x27;t want to give up the feel of a Braun shave, this is a no-brainer purchase. Either get the 380s (this model) or the 340s. The only things you give up with the 340 is the display (slight more fancy in the 380), a carry case, and the locking head (you can slide a switch and the front foil and middle bar get pushed down so you can more easily shave tight spots such as under your nose. Not terribly useful, but it has some benefits). If the prices are about the same spring for the 380 if only for the carry case. If you can get a deal on the 340 go for that. The shave is the same for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if you only want to shave dry, don&#x27;t skip the 3 Series in favor of the more popular 5 and 7 Series. Yes, the 7 Series is still my all-time favorite foil. But while it does provide a closer shave than a 3 Series, the difference is not huge. Unless you&#x27;re really fussy about the quality of shave you get, or are a shaver nut like I am,save the bucks and get a 3 Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 Series is the clear choice over the 5 Series. Both are identical in terms of the shave quality, both have a wonderful push-up trimmer; both are comfortable and well-built. The 5 series is put together better, with more metal and less plastic. It also has a narrower head, which comes in handy in the tight spots. But given the cost difference, the 3 Series is the better choice. Plus, the 380/340 has a more flexible foil design which I find offers better cutting in less time than the 5 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you&#x27;re a confirmed dry shave fan, give wet shaving a try. If you use the right gel, it can be nearly as mess-free and quick as a dry shave, but will give you a closer, more gentle shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The proper replacement head for the 340/380 is either the 32s or the 32b. Both are the same, with the only difference being color (silver or black).save the bucks and get a 3 Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 Series is the clear choice over the 5 Series.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old Braun shaver for 15 years I think and never saw fit to replace it.  I tried several newer Brauns over the years but didn&#x27;t like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say here that I don&#x27;t need to shave every day and that makes a difference with these electric shavers.  Having said that, this shaver is great.  I wish I had gotten one awhile back.  It does work in the shower and cleans easily.  The slide out trimmer works good also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone that likes a nice dry shave or even a wet one as I tried it in the shower with shave gel and that worked nicely as well.</li>
    <li> Well i have a reasonably thick hair, when it comes to my beard. It&#x27;s off-putting when you&#x27;re told you look 28 when you&#x27;re actually 19 (at the time), Im 20 now and figured it time to put the razor down (tired of paying for expensive replacements) and try a foil shaver. This has to be the best choice I&#x27;ve made (thanks to reviews :D), OK so on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels great in my hands; well made and comes with a neat case ^-^. I use shaving gel due to my sensitive skin, and like i said in the title, it did what it was supposed to. My face only felt this smooth when i would stretch my skin to shave away tiny hairs with a razor, which would normally cause irritation and bumps but to my surprise this shaver didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize I&#x27;ve only used it once but hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to do its job. I&#x27;ll update when possible, hope i was of any help ^-^</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver a couple of months ago and from the get-go I let it run down completely before each recharge, just to see if I could make it last longer between charges than my last shaver. In particular I wanted it to last the full eleven days I planned to spend in Europe. Charged it fully March 3d the day we left and it didn&#x27;t run out until the 21st. I&#x27;m impressed - especially &#x27;cause the thing cost a lot less and gives me a better shave than any of my higher priced earlier shavers. Next I want to see how long I can get a good shave from the existing head.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it seemed like a good deal.  I used to have a Braun in the mid nineties which worked very well and gave me a nice close shave.  So I expected the Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver to work just the same.  The shave is not as close as I&#x27;d like it to be, perhaps I need to buy a pricier model next time?</li>
    <li> Cleans easy and cuts good.</li>
    <li> Convenient for a quick shave, but the trade-off is electric shavers don&#x27;t provide the closeness as manual shaves as others have noted. Well worth the money for those without lots of facial hair, just my 2 cents tho.</li>
    <li> Braun makes the best electric shavers! Very close shave and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This replaced a Panasonic which, after needing a replacement head, suddenly developed poorer shaves and the need for daily recharging. The Braun is great. Shaves super close and is much quieter than my previous two shavers. Cleans easily. And shaves quickly as well. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first order on Amazon, Gr8 shaver, Gr8 price, Gr8 experience ever, strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;the sound is little bit loud, but shaves very clean.</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun shavers over the years, and so far this has been one of the best. My first Braun served me well and lasted six years. The battery eventually wouldn&#x27;t take a charge, and I had to buy a new one.  The last Braun was a disaster.  It was a series 3, but I bought it at a retail store. It did not give a close shave, and the trimmer was a nightmare.  It only lasted about three years and literally fell apart.  I was reluctant to get another Braun 3 series, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The 380S-4 is very quiet, it shaves very close, (much better than any other foil shaver I&#x27;ve owned), the trimmer is great, and the ability to move two of the heads so you can trim between your nose and moustache is nice.  I&#x27;ve only had this two weeks, so I will update the review if I find I am having any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels solid, and unlike the last Braun, I don&#x27;t have to go over my face a million times to get a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zippered case is nice, but you can&#x27;t put the cord in it.  They also don&#x27;t give you a plastic guard for the shaver head to protect it.  I keep it in the case instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this shaver.  You can also use it wet if you like and you don&#x27;t have to use their Clean and Renew system for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 07/19/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 6 months, and still think it is a great shaver.  I&#x27;ve timed the battery life on two occasions and total shaving time comes to 45 minutes on a full charge.  There are two green lights that stay on when the shaver is charged. As the battery drains the lights go out one at a time.  The first green light goes out at approximately 13 minutes.  The second one goes out and the red blinking light comes on after 31 minutes. I was able to continue shaving for an average of 13-14 minutes after the red light started blinking.  The only comment I would make, would be it would be nice if you could shave while the shaver was charging.  If it stops, you have to plug it in and wait 5 minutes or so before you can finish your shave.  For me, the 45 minutes allows me to recharge the shaver about every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/19/2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for over 1 year now and still happy with it.  Battery life is still pretty good.  I didn&#x27;t let the battery run down all the way, but I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks without charging and a total of 42 1/2 minutes of use.  After the red light comes on you still have about 12-13 minutes of use.  I bought an extra shaving cassette to have on hand, but shaving is still close, quiet and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 01/04/2014&lt;br /&gt;Still like the Braun Shaver after two years.  Battery life a little shorter but still good for almost two weeks.  Here is a table of run time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Shaver - Purchased 12/14/2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date............1st Light.......Red Light.......Total Time.......Time after red light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/01/12.........13.00...........32.75...........46.50...............13.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/19/12.........13.50...........31.00...........45.50...............14.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/19/12.........12.00...........28.00...........40.75...............12.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/01/13.........12.00...........30.00...........43.50...............13.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/04/13.........11.50...........28.00...........42.00...............14.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/27/2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of what tph1983 thinks, I&#x27;m not psychotic nor am I am employee of Braun.  I hope my review is helpful.  Battery life is important, especially when this particular shaver will only run on battery and not with the cord plugged in. After two and a half years, the battery still runs for approximately two weeks (average 3 minutes/day) and a total of 42 minutes before it totally runs out of power.  The first light comes on at approximately 13 minutes, and the red light at 31 minutes.  The shaver charges fully in 1 hour.  It still gives a good shave, and I&#x27;ve only recentlychanged the shaving cassette.  I still would recommend this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00517W45G Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]</li>
    <li> This shaver works, simply put. Gets a close enough shave for me and the battery lasts for several shaves. Takes only 5mins for a quick charge. Very easy to clean also. Been using this shaver for about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that you CANNOT use while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> I wanted a shaver that doesn&#x27;t depend on &amp;#34;Cleaning systems&amp;#34; to work and raise the price for a decent shave. Gives a good shave and has a zip-up case too. Nice plug in charger and indicator lights that show when a charge is needed.</li>
    <li> I wrote this a year ago and I was SO wrong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is an excellent choice if you&#x27;re looking for a foil shaver that does wet-dry.  I prefer foil shavers to Norelco rotary and I like the wet shaving experience. If those two things are important to you, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine because my Panasonic ES quit working after less than a year. There are not many wet-dry foil alternatives to the aggravating Panasonic shavers. But this one is better in just about every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaves about as close as an electric can. That&#x27;s not because of a pivoting head or multiple motors: It&#x27;s because the blades are sized for maneuverability and the the shaver fits well in your hand. These are some of the other things that I consider major plusses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The indicator lights tell you how much battery charge is left. But there are no fancy icons telling you when to clean the shaver. And no numbers telling you how many minutes a shave lasted. I think simpler is better-- fewer digital features means fewer things to malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch is located in a position that makes it very difficult to accidentally turn on when traveling. At first, I wished for a \\&quot;travel lock\\&quot; feature like you&#x27;ll find on many Norelcos and Panasonics. But the positioning of the switch makes that unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike other Brauns, you&#x27;re not forced to use a cleaning system that requires expensive refills. This shaver is very easy to clean with your own alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love technology and care about advanced electronics or cleaning systems, this Braun probably isn&#x27;t for you. But if your priority is getting a great shave, the 380S-4 won&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I prefer wet shaving and have used various creams, soaps, and foams. These were nearly impossible to clean out of the cheap plastic parts inside the shaver. Every plastic part is crammed tightly into a space that cannot be reached. While attempting to cleanthese nooks with alcohol and a toothbrush, I managed to break two of the parts that were corroded and caked with soap residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: Braun built its reputation on dry electric shavers and is relatively new to wet-dry technology. I believe that this is their only wet-dry model at the time I am writing. It&#x27;s a decent foil shaver if you only use it dry. But if you use it wet, you&#x27;ll find it very difficult to clean and maintain. The plastic is cheap Chinese mass production at its worst. If you want quality wet-dry electric shaving, look at other brands.</li>
    <li> I have had a 7526 old faithful for about 10 years until finally the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I bought this wet &amp; dry shaver, and it&#x27;s soooo much quicker! Fits nicely in your hand, and sensitive skin irritation is reduced because it seems to clean shave in half the number of passes required before. The trimmer, while small, cuts more accurately than before. Only quibble is that often when shaving, my fingers accidentally hit the &#x27;off&#x27; switch, but that&#x27;s Operator Error. Another excellent product from Braun. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s website says this shaver can be used either cordless or corded, but it isn&#x27;t true. This shaver cannot be used when corded and connected to the wall. Thus, you cannot use it while it is charging. Also, the charging cord slips and falls out of the shaver way too easily.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to how well it cuts as I did not bother trying it out once I realized that it can&#x27;t be used while it is charging. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower and probably wont, but it&#x27;s nice to know I can if need be. Close shave. I&#x27;ve been using Braun for 20 years now.</li>
    <li> Thie shaver works well. It holds a charge better than I expected so I can travel for a wek and not take the cable. I have a tough beard and I found that using it wet with shave cream works the best.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave.  Quiet.  Easy to clean.  Holds a charge for a week.  What else is there.  It looks good and feels great in your hand.  Makes me look good too, and I like that.  Would recommend.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it so far.  Most likely, I may be able to give it 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> For the price this Braun wet and dry shaver is very nice with a good shave. I had an expensive Panosonic shaver and it was not as good as this one and the Braun I could buy almost 3 shavers for the price of one Panisonic</li>
    <li> Not very impress with this model</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it already....I am very pleased with the shipping and The product.  Thanks to Amazon for making my shopping easy..</li>
    <li> Like it except cutters will occasionally pull a hair rather than cut..</li>
    <li> This shaver is ideal for my husband.  He cannot shave himself anymore because of Alzheimers disease, so I am the one who shaves him.  I like it beause there is no danger of cutting him with it and it gives a nice smooth shave quickly.  It seems like the hum of the razor calms him and he is peaceful.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and I love it. The only issue I have with it is that it leaves some hair on the neck area but if you stretch you&#x27;re skin like the instructions say then it makes it easier to shave them.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husbands birthday. He loves the razor. It doesn&#x27;t cause his neck to break out from shaving irritation.</li>
    <li> The shave is good from this unit, but since it&#x27;s a non-pivoting head unlike my several other Braun shavers that wore out over the years, it takes a bit of getting used to changing your grip to change the shave angle to get the best shaver-to-beard contact. With all electric shavers you must go slow over your face to give it time to cut properly. This shaver is no different. Cleaning it is also more difficult since the cutters and screen are one non-seperable unit, unlike the more expensive pivoting head Braun shavers. I&#x27;ve found the best way to clean it is to remove the screen/cutters from the shaver, tap it on the side of the sink to make the beard particles fall out, then flush it with hot water under the faucet until the remaining beard particles come out. Also important is the fact the price fit my budget. If you have any other older Braun screens and cutters around your house, they wont fit this unit since it&#x27;s a totally different design. Only the recommended 32s or 32b will fit as per the owners manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 11, 2013: Just wanted to let you all know the screen finally developed a hole in it this morning, so the life of the screen/cutter assembly was about 2-1/2 months. Useage conditions were not as a wet shaver as can be done with this model, but using standard method, i.e., Williams Electric shave lotion as lubricant and rinsing the screen under hot water until all the particles come out.</li>
    <li> Braun has the best foiof razor. Great quality product. The special feature on the 380S model is a switch that pulls down the first 2 rows of the head. Then you can use the one protruding foil to shave with more precision in difficult areas, like under the nose/upper lip.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this.  It fully gets the job done.  Only thing I do not like about it is that it will not work simply plugged in.  It only works from the battery.  So when that battery goes bad I guess it goes in the trash and I will buy another brand.</li>
    <li> No way is this thing even close to a norelco shaver. This thing is a joke for shaving... Will never buy any other products made by Braun.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best electric razor I have used. It cuts deep without leaving redness on my skin. It still can&#x27;t cut my neck hairs but no razor can and I have a thick beard hears too. Combine it with a gillette razor and its a fast easy shave.</li>
    <li> For a quick dry shave it&#x27;s ok but it does not leave your face smooth, it still feels rough. As for a wet shave, it&#x27;s horrible. Better to use a blade.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars if you use a pre shave product before using. Only 3 stars without.</li>
    <li> had it about 3 weeks and really like it.  it works good you do have to go over your face a few times but works great.  biggest thing for me is it does not leave any burns on my face  ok finally used it wet....not good at all, I was very disappointed with the razor using it wet.  not only did it leave burn marks it took twice as long as a razor would have.  still recommend for dry but not for wet  I am now almost 2 months in and I am trying to return this product   It never got any better,  It takes a long time to shave, I could do it faster with a razor  I am returning this and going to try something different  About the same shave as $29 Norelco as far as I am concerened  Just takes too long and you have to go over the hard spots many times  expect more for this price of razor and its cheaper at taget</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift.  I have had no feed back.</li>
    <li> It is very affordable, but there really isn&#x27;t anything that I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> Gives me a good close shave, I would recommend this one if you like shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve owned in 20 years and I&#x27;ve tried them all...Remington, Norelco and Wahl.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Razers in 5 years.  The quality is second to nun.  The recharging is very fast, and last for more than a week.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SHAVE....I bought this razor to replace a Remmington that I had for less than 2yrs. and would no longer accept a charge. I&#x27;ve had this razor only about 2 mos. so I cannot attest to its&#x27; battery life, but it is quite comfottable in the hand and the closness of the shave is much superior to my previous shaver. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor in years.  I will start by saying that your skin does really adapt to the razor over the first couple of weeks. Shaves get closer and the amount of time it takes to shave decreases. The amount of time it takes is about the same as a shave if you use hot water and lather up properly than carefully shave. It takes me about 5 minutes to shave, down from 7 or so when I first bought the razor. I use an alcohol based toner to help my hair stand up and stretch the skin while shaving against the grain. It shaves almost as close as a blade on my chin, jaw, and cheeks.  My neck is what really adapted to the razor after about two weeks. At first you could feel stubble and see it after shaving.  Now that the razor and I have grown accustomed to each other, I can feel stubble when rubbing my neck against the grain on a couple of neck areas, such as the Adams apple, but cannot see it after shaving. One plus is that I no longer get ingrown hairs after switching from a blade to this razor. This is a caveat of the electric razor, and one I can live with. It does not miss hairs and I have a very thick beard. I do recommend trimming your hair with the built in trimmer if it gets long from not shaving, as it will pull hairs that are approx 1/8 of an inch or longer. The trimmer is also precise for edging up a goatee or sideburns. I wear a fumanchu and find it very easy to get the foil up to the edge to shave all the hair.  I have sensitive skin and experience no irritation at all, but I do use a face lotion after I shave.  It is very easy to clean and can be dry brushed or rinsed out. I prefer dry brushing so I don&#x27;t have to lubricate it as often.</li>
    <li> Man, how many Braun company reps had to create fake accounts to give this POS a 4 star average rating? This has to be one of the worst products (not just razors) in existence. After running the product through my thick luxurious stubble maybe three dozen times, pressed firmly against the skin, I had not made any discernible progress in actually SHAVING. The only evidence I had that the product worked at all was the few stray hairs it left in the sink. This would make an excellent birthday present for Hitler, but unfortunately the man&#x27;s been dead for some time, and as such I can&#x27;t think of any possible uses for it.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever had including previous Braun razors. It shaves closer and faster. I have used it for 2 months.</li>
    <li> Best &amp; closest shower electric shaver I have owned.  Leaves your face as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.  Thanks for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving in the shower. It&#x27;s a tad on the heavy side if you run it horizontally across your face; then again, my medium-sized manly hands can handle it.</li>
    <li> my husband used this for a few months, shave terrible.&lt;br /&gt;didnt get all beard.&lt;br /&gt;he kept trying.&lt;br /&gt;finally, he went back to his manual blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;wish i had returned it first 2 weeks...</li>
    <li> As a gift the person said he got a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;He has coarse whiskers so it does real well</li>
    <li> Second one of this series, gave the first to my wife as she can never find a &amp;#34;Ladies Shaver&amp;#34; that works for any length of time or nearly as good. My wife and I would have no other.&lt;br /&gt;I always purchase through Amazon, always delivered on time with ample packaging, plus accumulate &amp;#34;Points&amp;#34; toward next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, I have developed my own cleaning process besides removing the head and taping lightly into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Pick up a wide mouth jar at Walmart, I call it &amp;#34;Apothecary Jar&amp;#34;  about 4 inches tall with wide opening lid with rubber seal. Pour in about one inch of denatured alcohol, Once a week submerge the head of the Razor running for one to two minutes. Wipe dry then lightly spray with a can of cleaner and lubricant purchased at most beauty shops or Barber shops. Change the alcohol once a month. Very inexpensive and works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great and super fast shipping. My son loved it.</li>
    <li> Works great charge lasts a good while and gives me a close shave. Easy to clean too. For the price i am very happy!</li>
    <li> I switched from a rotary due to a dead battery and I like this shaver better. A little more compact and holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it; provides a nice clean shave which I enjoy!</li>
    <li> This electric will get you as close to a blade shave as you can get with an electric shaver. Foil is smooth and grabs alot of hair. No irritation after and solved my ingrown hair issue.</li>
    <li> I switched from Gillette blades after 30 years.  This works fine using a pre-electric shave lotion, not so well without the lotion.  Either way I get a more comfortable shave.  The final result is not as close as with a blade, but the razor rashes are gone.  I should explain that I have a full beard, and shave my throat up to the jaw, and an inch or so under my sideburn, plus a little cleanup on my cheeks.  Quick and easy, no fear of cuts, no annoying rashes.</li>
    <li> Ouch! would give this razor a Zero if I could. Have had a Rotary norelco for years with good results. Heard many comments that a foil razor did a closer better job.I would have returned it, but thru out all the packaging. All I have are the case, the instructions, and of course a lousy razor, that at every use, pulls at least one hair out. Braun should put out a warning label.  !!!</li>
    <li> As excellent electric  razor.  My first move from Noralco in decades and it was a good one.&lt;br /&gt;Herb</li>
    <li> Best razor my husband has ever had. Very smooth shave. Not sure how it would work in the shower (wet) but as for using it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it is great!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It works very well, it is fast, easy to clean, and more reliable that Panasonic shavers. I used to only use Panasonic wet-dry shavers but their batter dies after a year or two and you cannot replace the battery. This wet-dry shaver works better than the Panasonic ones, it is easier to maintain, and the batter lasts much longer. Also, the cutters and foil are one piece. From now on, I will be buying Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me razor burn and the precision trimmer is stuck after several uses, making it useless. I will be staying away from Braun in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and works better that what it replaced.  I do not have much use for the head locking feature but it is there if I need it.</li>
    <li> I switched to this foil type razer from the norelco three headed thing. Its a little more difficult to get a good shave under my neck with this type of razor and its a little loud. My beard grows in really thick so I am sure that doesn&#x27;t help any. When this razor dies I would go back to the other one, although, I hear they are having quality issues.</li>
    <li> workes good. i don&#x27;t use it everyday  but it is an ok shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well wet or dry. Close shave and quiet operation.</li>
    <li> Good overall shaver to use on those days/occasions when you do not want to use a razor.</li>
    <li> I had been using a triple head rotary shaver for the past couple of years. They generally provided a comfortable shave, but when the heads needed to be replaced, I decided to switch to a foil wet/dry shaver and selected the Braun primarily based on brand name and reviews/advertisements. I associated the higher price compared to Panasonic and others as better quality, comfort, and closeness. The quality is there, but not the close shave I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;After 2-3 weeks of use, I was enjoying the comfort of the wet/dry shave. However, after 6+ months of use, the Braun consistently leaves a heavy stubble on my chin, jaw bone and cheek areas, immediately after shaving and certainly by the end of the day. I have regularly cleaned and lubricated the shaver according to the instructions, but the shaver is not living up to its name and I&#x27;m ready to try a different foil shaver, or possibly return to a rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a Braun shaver I had for more than 20 years. I really like this new shaver - it has a great feel and does a good job on regular daily stubble. Looking forward to 20 years with this new Braun.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about.  It&#x27;s okay.  Small cutting head.  I was replacing a Panasonic which owned over 10 years with flawless operation.  Would not purchase another Braun.  I have given it a year to prove itself.  It is going into a drawer and I am going to purchase another Panasonic.  It did perform as described.  If I had nothing to compare it to, it might have gotten a higher rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short. This is a really good electric razor. My beard isn&#x27;t swarthy but it&#x27;s not peach-fuzz either. I have to shave every day and this razor shaves as close as the &#x27;razor club blades&#x27; I had been trying. I don&#x27;t know what other bells &amp; whistles you could want, and the shape is classic, not goofy futuristic, like most of the other (more expensive) models that I considered. I really like it a lot!</li>
    <li> So there I was, I needed a new shaver. I read all the reviews and the comments about battery issues on this one and decided to try it anyway. Sure enough, they reviews were spot on. I don&#x27;t grow a lot of facial hair but still need to shave at least weekly. I also have a need to shave 3 to 5 consecutive days at least monthly. This shaver started out great but the more I use it the more I am not sure if I like it or not. Compared to the &amp;#34;cheapie&amp;#34; Norelco I bought from BJs a year ago, I have to shave twice as long to get all the hair. I thought, maybe it&#x27;s just me, maybe I am doing it wrong... So I read the instruction manual that comes with it and sure enough, I am doing it right. Apparently it just takes longer to get all the hair. I also had an issue with the battery; I carried the shaver with me every day for a week and used it twice. When I went to use it the third time, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. The battery light was just blinking red. I had to plug it into the charger to get it to come back on at all. Luckily, I was at home where the charger was, otherwise, I was not going to be able to shave. IT would be nice if it worked, even slowly, when the battery is low. Anything is better than not working at all... What if I was halfway through a shave on my way to work when this happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to say this is all bad, it does have some redeeming qualities... I love that I can use it in the shower. IT is very powerful when you first use it from the charger. It is easy to clean and the long hair shaver is great for close haircut shape-ups. Would I recommend this to someone else, Not without reservation. If you habitually shave in the car, better make sure you keep the charger or a manual razor handy in case it decides to quit on you. In summary, it is a good shaver but not a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Unit works excellent, very satisfy but 2 weeks after my purchase you lower the price.&lt;br /&gt;When I requested to be given a credit for the $23.00, Amazon said no, that I will require returning the unit and then purchasing the same unit at a lower price. It looks to me like a waste of your time and my.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a nice electric razer that charges quickly and performs very well.  This Braun replaces my 26 year old Braun that was a workhorse and simply would not die, hopefully the 380S-4 will last as long (and outlive me!).  :)</li>
    <li> While not as close as a blade it is far better than any rotary shaver.  It is quick, that is, it only needs a couple of passes.  I also like that it can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband as a gift. He loves the shaver. It has its own stand so that it can be placed to charge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was not with the shaver, but with the Amazon recommendations for added products. They recommended buying this cleaner/lubricant for the shaver. The description was not very clear, and when I received the cleaner pods, I quickly saw that they would not work with this shaver as it does not have the type of stand required. Unfortunately, as these are considered hazardous materials, they could not be returned to Amazon, so unfortunately, that was $21 wasted.</li>
    <li> This razor was exactly as described and functions great. Only caution: I bought this as a replacement for series 330 with the self cleaning base, this razor will not work with the self cleaning feature. Otherwise good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular shavers and recently upgraded to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot express the happiness this brought me. It&#x27;s so easy to use and gets the job done super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Started out great but after 2 1/2 years the trimmer became detached from the body.  E-mailed to inquire about repair and found it would probably cost as much to repair as to purchase a new razor.  This is a disappointment after nearly 30 years of using Braun razors, each of which lasted 8 to 10 years.  I will probably switch to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Have not used an electric razor in 10 years since my last Braun died.  Figured I would give it another shot based on the great price of this series 3.  Worked right out of the box and my first shave was excellent.  No rash or irritation, which was the problem I was having with the old one.  Have not tried the razor wet, only used it dry.  I dont plan on using it wet since I do not have irratation.  Good value for a Braun.</li>
    <li> I gave up on electric shavers for a while and then I got fed up with a blade shaver so I looked around and found this one.  I wash my face in the morning and before rinsing off the soap, I run this thing around a little bit and voila, I&#x27;m ready for the day.  Just rinse this off in the sink.  I haven&#x27;t had it on the charger for 2 weeks.  Best shaver I ever found.</li>
    <li> When using the Braun Wet and Dry shaver it takes longer than my other Braun dry shaver. It does give a close shave, but you must continually run the shaver over you skin to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Does a much better job than I would of ever imagined! I highly recommend this shaver. Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but it works great dry.</li>
    <li> Daily personal care is sometimes a tedious drag. A 3 in 1 shampoo, body wash, and shave gel reduces time. So does the Braun wet/dry electric razor. Lather up with a 3 in 1 wash, and shave in the shower. Razor cleaning as simple as holding the device in the water stream, shaking dry and done.&lt;br /&gt;The razor provides an close, clean shave. I purchased a three head shaver, which easily maneuvers around the contours of my face.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this was such a good product that I had too.  I have had numerous different brand razors over the years, including Braun.  They only worked so so such that I always take a dry blade over my face to take off what the electric razor left behind.  I don&#x27;t have to do that with this razor any more.  I am so impressed with it and think the price point is so good that I am buying one for each of my three sons.</li>
    <li> I have tried other razors but I have always come back to Braun. This Braun is no exception ! Buy it !</li>
    <li> Does the job for me. Had an older Braun which gave me good service until the battery wore out. Replaced with this newer version and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Love that I can go more than 2 weeks between charges.  The dual heads really result in a great shave in less time than I&#x27;ve experienced with other razors.  UPDATE: While I still love this razor, mine stopped working after 10 months. Repair under the 2 year warranty means you pay to ship it to their repair center.  Customer service is poor.  I had to call and email several times to get the status of my repair after they had it for a week with no communications.  They eventually sent me a new razor.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this Braun shaver. I have owned many Braun shavers throughout the years and have no complaints. They are comfortable and durable. It was just as described.</li>
    <li> Consider this is my first electric Braun Shaver, it is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use is just nice with no scratches at all. The shaver is also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It was made in China and everything is Ok</li>
    <li> I have had Braun shavers before. This one is a lot nicer then the one I replaced it with. I call it training my hairs because it takes a little while to completely shave the whiskers close because its a different foil.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but when I use this Braun shaver the foil head pops off and whisker shaving go everywhere. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for the same model thinking that there must be a defect in the one I purchased. The store glady replaced it with the same Braun model. A week later the foil flew off again while shaving. No more Brauns for me; back to a Norelco.</li>
    <li> It shaves nicely but I expected more. I had a Brown shaver in the 1990s, along with a Philips rotary. The Brown broke at some point, the Philips still works. I still chose the Brown this year because the rotary system is less pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had expected that a bit more progress had happened in the 20 years since my last Brown. It still works pretty slowly compared to wet shaving, and it isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or quiet. The long hair cutter is the same detached thing. I thought this would have had some new thing to maintain a 3 day beard but I guess what they meant is that it can shave one off. I think the description was a bit misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest disappointment is weight and size. This thing is pretty big, bigger than my old Braun and bigger than my Philips. The weight and size go into a large battery.  That is not the tradeoff I would have picked.  The battery is not large enough to take the thing on a trip without also taking the charge cable.  But it significantly cuts into your carry-only packaging. For no reason IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good new is that although it has a charge station you aren&#x27;t forced to use it. You can detach the cable and just take the cable. Which makes the large battery issue even more annoying.</li>
    <li> The Braun replaces a Panasonic wet/dry that leaked water inside.  The Braun gives a more comfortable and closer shave than the Panasonic.  During a wet shave with gel the Braun foils feel like they are on rollers.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my father, didn&#x27;t work - complete junk.  Not sure I can even return it as I bought it months before the holiday, haven&#x27;t checked into the warranty yet.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Extremely useful. Since I spend a great deal of time driving, I keep this with me in the car. I shave going to work, or a meeting, or even to the grocery store. Saves me a lot of time. It shaves very close with very little skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used a rotary electric razor for years. Thought I&#x27;d try a foil and I love it</li>
    <li> I was told by the gifted recipient that this razor is the best he&#x27;s ever had. He also stated that he&#x27;s owned Braun electric shavers previously and he&#x27;s always gotten a close, clean shave with no nicks on his sensitive skin. He&#x27;s on blood-thinner meds., so it was imperative that the product be of high quality for safety reasons, as blood thinners can cause excessive bleeding if a person gets cut. He also told me that this newer Braun series is his all time fav. For it&#x27;s price range and features (wet/dry shaver, carry case, charging system and more), it&#x27;s the clear choice.</li>
    <li> great shaver clean shave</li>
    <li> My husband says he has never had an easier or faster shave.  He has been a Braun user for years but says this new one is much improved over all the others.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After too many self-sacrificial shaving sessions with a blade, I settled on a Braun Series 3 to reduce the carnage. I have owned Panasonic and older Braun shavers as well as a Norelco Tripleheader. I have tried dry and wet shaving using Edge gel. I got the closest shave wet. The motor is quiet and the cleanup is a snap. I am estimating a 40% closer shave then with my triple blade wet razor using Edge gel!&lt;br /&gt;For a sub 100$ razor, this would be hard to beat. The blade and foil are to be changed every 18 months. Likely it will make it longer with my beard which is average caliber.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now have been using this item for over 6 months...I can barely say that it&#x27;s &#x27;O.K&#x27;, and in fact, I&#x27;ve just ordered another Panasonic razor to replace it!&lt;br /&gt;I should have ordered one to replace my previous Panasonic which I&#x27;d had for years, but...this seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well...</li>
    <li> Not as good at shaving as my previous model:  Grabs beard and pulls.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Horrible shaver.  I&#x27;ve owned multiple Brauns over the years, including a 7 series that is amazing.  This is underpowered and essentially pointless.  Sounds like sick bee buzzing around my face while simultaneously not shaving very well.  I hope that I have a defective unit, but I&#x27;m afraid it is just woeful compare to the 7 series.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but the head keeps popping off.  All plastic construction is a disappointment, especially since the head pops off frequently.  A more secure head attachment with better materials would make this a better item.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> needs very little charge and stays sharp</li>
    <li> Works great...This shaver does such a great job. I have owned a few shavers before but this by far is my favorite. A great value.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, this Braun shaver is just great. - look forward to many more good years of smooth shaving, too!</li>
    <li> I am from customer of China. My Dad like it. it&#x27;s so useful. Sorry for too late to review, because of I got the goods during the  the Spring Festival.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing just as expected--shaving is comfortable and clean..  My husband is very pleased.  A great purchase for the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> VERY VERY GOOD!! IT&#x27;S SO BEAUTIFUL AND VERY NICE!!&lt;br /&gt;braun razer get from low price! so very happy!!&lt;br /&gt;my wife is good choice!</li>
    <li> Have had it about a month now and so far I am extremely satisfied.  Used to use a blade but decided to try this instead of my older Panasonic.  VERY glad I did.  Shave is just about as good as a blade with little to no irritation.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am just not so satisfied. it is very noisy and does not shave as well a I hoped for it to do.</li>
    <li> For me this Shaver didn&#x27;t work properly particularly at my Jaws and at the curves I can&#x27;t shave it properly with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on cheeks it&#x27;s gives nice shave.</li>
    <li> When judging an electric razor, whether it is a foil or rotary razor, the final rating should be about comfort and closeness of the shave.  I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could rate the Braun 380S-4 a 5 star razor.  I have been using electric razors for about 20 years, and have tried just about all of them, Panasonic, Norelco, Remington, and now Braun.  My favorite is the Remington MS2 390.  I have 2 of them and they&#x27;re getting old so I bought the Braun as a future replacement.  I can&#x27;t buy the Remington MS2 390 anymore so I bought a Remington F5 which is almost identical to the Braun 380S, and also gets a 3 star rating.  The Braun will give you a &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; shave, but it will not give you a &amp;#34;date&amp;#34; shave.  I use it for going to work, and for special occasions I use the Remington MS2.  The Remington MS2 would get 4 stars for closeness.  If you&#x27;re looking for average, here it is.  This razor is well constructed, has a comfortable rubber grip, is quiet, and is water proof for wet or dry shaves.  It seems like it will last a long time.  Good battery life.  Will not function plugged in.  So there it is, I use the Braun for work, and off days around the house.  If I go some place special, I use the Remington. Sorry, 3 stars, no more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a month or so, but so far it has met every expectation. The shave is super smooth and comfortable and the pop-up trimmer is so much easier to use than the one on the old Braun I was replacing. The fact that I can rinse the thing off in the sink is awesome. Time will tell regarding durability, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Love the Braun razors. This is my 3rd Braun razor and I&#x27;m been very happy with all of them. Gives me a nice smooth shave, unlike some other brands. I&#x27;ve tried others and their all 2nd rate to the Braun. Very happy with my newest razor and the price was great as well.</li>
    <li> I had been using a rotary shaver recently but grew tired of it biting my neck. So after some study I decided to try the Braun 380S-4 since the premium razors had features I just wasn&#x27;t interested in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun razor many years ago and it was an OK razor but I feel this new Braun razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It is a  quiet razor for a foil type razor and cuts my whiskers closely &amp; smoothly with no razor burn and it doesn&#x27;t bite my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the Braun 380S-4 and the foil / cutter replacement is a snap with no fiddling with a delicate foil and risking kinking or denting it.  It uses the replacement cutter  32B.</li>
    <li> Pleased with shaver, really do not notice that I&#x27;m able to get a closer shave that with my old Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does really hold a charge for much longer than expected.  I always run it down entirely before re-charging.</li>
    <li> Does a great job if you shave daily, if you let the beard get about a week old then it doesn&#x27;t shave as good</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest, easy to use electric razor I have ever had and I have used many brands over the years.</li>
    <li> Works really well! A good deal too.</li>
    <li> This Braun works well - a razor may be better - but since illness has intervened, we do the best and easiest we can.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this shaver.  Well worth the money and it actually works.  Can&#x27;t say that about one of the competitors top of line product which I tried and had to return (it pulled my hair and did not cut).  This Braun series 3 gives a very close shave for a very affordable cost.  Braun is the way to go hands down.</li>
    <li> I have used rotary shavers for years, but when my last one wore out on me I decided, after doing some research, to try out a foil type shaver.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  I picked up the Braun 380S-4 and I must say I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull anywhere near as bad as the rotary shavers do.  The extendable trimmer on the back is great as well. The only problem I had was figuring out which part number I needed for the correct foil/cutter replacement.  Amazon&#x27;s web site shows it as #30B, but this is incorrect.  The correct foil/cutter replacment is #32S, although you can also use #32B if you wish (it&#x27;s black instead of silver outside).</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift over a year ago.  He uses it almost everyday in the shower!  I love how smooth he is!  The trimmer on the side is great also!</li>
    <li> shaves closer than my gillette bladed razor!</li>
    <li> The only razor that I now use.</li>
    <li> My husband is very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Much better than my 30$ Philips nelreco but isn&#x27;t very good about getting places around my neck. Does a good job on face but kind of sticks when used in the shower.</li>
    <li> NOT REALLY WHAT I EXPECTED. IT DOESN&#x27;T SHAVE VERY CLOSE WET OR DRY. IT&#x27;S A LITTLE AWKWARD TO HOLD. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have owned Braun, Panasonic (the most noisy of the bunch), Remington, and Norelco shavers, and none, but none, can compare with the closeness of a blade.....none.  I will say that I have been impressed twice since 1970...first with a Braun double-foil shaver built for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch that I bought in 1970 and a Norelco arcitec 1000 in 2008.  I bought the Braun 3 Series on the promise of the reviews, looking for something revolutionary, but it offers nothing new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my routine stands as it has for many years...use any shaver (I&#x27;ve reverted to the Norelco) to do a quick once-over before showering, shower, then dry-shave lightly with a Schick ST2 razor.  You can clean the razor by pressing the clean-out button, and for me it lasts about 3 weeks.  Cleaning the Norelco heads with alcohol occasionally seems to help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pitch here, just wanted to share my experience and resultant opinion.</li>
    <li> Good razor...much smoother in the hand than 4 or 5 year old Remington and gives a better shave.  Hard-sided travel pouch a definite plus.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Like the water clean feature.  Shaves great especially if you use pre-shave lotion.</li>
    <li> A fast clean shave. Easy to clean. A good design that feels well balanced in your hand. I haven&#x27;t had other electric razors to compare it to but can&#x27;t imagine them to be much better, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver whose price did not &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; you.</li>
    <li> bought this is as a gift for spouse and doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as other electric razors he&#x27;s had in the past, but since it was a gift - he will not be as truthful to me, but I can tell when I feel his face after he&#x27;s shaved.  I was a little disappointed with the outcome, but it&#x27;s very portable in it&#x27;s carry case, it has great features, and of course it&#x27;s still being broken in so that&#x27;s my report to date.</li>
    <li> This is just an early review, as I have had this shaver for just a few days, and have used it four times so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver was a Braun 8985, which I would rate as the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I have had it for about ten years or so, and the battery is starting to go. (it&#x27;s still good for a full shave, but it&#x27;s noticeably laboring by the time I finish, and that&#x27;s after being in the charger since the day before)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly based on the good reviews. It&#x27;s quite different from the 8985, as it can be used in the shower and with shaving cream, and can be cleaned by running water over the shaver head. So far, I have done none of those things, and have just used it on a dry face, prior to showering, and I am very impressed. It gives a close shave (as close as, or closer, than my 8985, of which I&#x27;ve had no complaints), quite quickly, and comfortably. To clean it, I&#x27;ve just removed the head and brushed away the stubble. My 8985 used the Renew electric cleaning system, which worked well, but if one ran out of the fluid and had to clean the razor manually with a brush, it was pretty messy. For whatever reason, there seems much less stubble caught in this razor, and it is a breeze to clean. (it can also be cleaned by holding it under running water, but I have not tried this method yet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been mentioned in other reviews, the shaver also feels exceptionally well built and solid. If I get the same longevity from this as I did from my previous two Brauns, I will be quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was looking for replacement head for an electric rotary shaver. The replacement heads have gone up to a price about equal to the price of this razor. I thought the triple head rotaries were much superior to this type of shaver. But after reading the reviews I bought this one. It&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. It&#x27;s a much closer shave. I don&#x27;t see any handicap using this type of razor over the rotary head at all. I think this razor is much better than any I&#x27;ve had. Even though the others cost three times as much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a friend whose husband had a stroke.  They are very pleased with the job it does.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. Smooth and great. No more scrapes and cuts! Don&#x27;t even have to use preshave.</li>
    <li> Vast improvement over my old Remington electric razor. Operation is quiet, it is easy to clean. The long hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t hurt my face, and the single screen pop-up is nice for the sides of my mouth and under my nose. The included case is very nice as well. Highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> Like many of you here browsing these reviews you are torn between shavers and razors. I had a friend who swore that the new electric razors would give a shave as good as my Gillette Fusion razors. They give me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had and no skin irritation. I thought my friend was full of it but since he is normally a pretty straight guy I thought I&#x27;d do my own research into it. He suggested checking out a Braun shaver in the mid-$200 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t exactly how much I wanted to drop over $200 on a razor but it got me thinking. So like many of you I started reading all the reviews. I read so much junk that I was overloaded by info. One overriding impression I had was that newer electric shavers have come a long way. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy one. Again I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune but wanted a good enough one that it would be representative of what they have to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really pushed me into the electric shaver test was a recent international trip. I was in a country that didn&#x27;t seem to have any warm/hot water with any frequency and I can&#x27;t shave without it. I had already suffered through a number of cold shaves to the point that I wanted another option and the electric shaver seemed like a good one. I also thought that maybe if this razor didn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended) so to speak that maybe the Series 7 or a Panasonic might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTOH I love shaving when I am in the shower. So I started to explore the wet-dry options out there. I ultimately ended up with the Braun 380S-4. I searched around and found one locally. I really was set on the 340 but I scored a great deal on the 380 and glad I have the case the precision trimmer option for close to the nose shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this doesn&#x27;t really matter if when the rubber hits the road (or shaver hits the beard in this case) and nothing works as planned. In this respect I am totally surprised. During my research I saw some videos on the best way to use the shaver such as, don&#x27;t wash my face (if dry shaving, to pretreat with something like William&#x27;s Lectric Shave (waited a few minutes after applying though), etc. I did all these things and amazingly I got a very good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would stress from anyone going to an electric shaver from a razor is you may have hit your hair from different angles to find the best cutting stroke. In some areas it took me 2 passes to find the best way to shave an area. I would say electric shavers might be more sensitive to the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of your hair. I have a pretty heavy beard and have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if I shave at 6 or 7 in the morning with a good normal razor. The 2 blade throw-aways basically give me 11am shadow, it didn&#x27;t even wait until 5 o&#x27;clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise when at the end of the workday my face looked just as good as my normal razor. I was totally amazed to say the least. Quite honestly the shave from the 380 might have even been slightly better. The day before I shaved with my normal razor and now I am into my first week of shaving with just the shaver. My face hasn&#x27;t broken out anywhere. All in all I am virtually ecstatic. I honestly can&#x27;t see spending the extra $$$ on the Series 7 yet as my expectations so far have been exceeded. I might try it just to see if it is really any better. I think with time I&#x27;ll get an even better shave once I use it for a while. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to shave with it wet yet but so far I have no buyer&#x27;s remorse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I started to think about. While the Gilette Fusion Proglide blades worked great for me, they are expensive. I was considering shaving clubs and the like. I normally got maybe a week to 10 days out of a blade. I was going through about 30 or so a year. It won&#x27;t take long for me to come out ahead financially with the Braun and even soon when I factor in some other grooming I did with blades. Just to shave my chest and stomach would use an entire Fusion blade! In less than a year I&#x27;llbe ahead not even factoring in the hot water I can save by not shaving in the shower. The 2-3 minute of hot water would add up in both water and energy costs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am glad I took the gamble. I&#x27;ll report back in a month or so. For me the extra cost for the 380 over the 340 was worth having the case, more intelligent battery display (business trips) and the precision trimmer lock. If I was going to be over $100 I would have seriously looked at the Series 7 or Panasonic. Main reason I really didn&#x27;t jump on the 7 was the lack of a wet shaving feature even though I haven&#x27;t used it so far. It is nice to have the option.</li>
    <li> Great razor at a reasonable price.  We had an older model 7 series which lasted more than 25 years....being over 85 I settled for the 3 series...and it&#x27;s fast, easy and does a fabulous job.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the performance.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve had that experiences the problem of the foil popping out. This occurs during regular shaving with minimal force applied, which is extremely annoying.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy shaver. It is heavier than previous Braun 7505 but shaves a bit closer and smoother. A good buy!</li>
    <li> I have no basis for comparison since this is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever used an electric razor, but I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> CHEAP!  I have an older series 3 Braun that is just worn out.  This one feels cheap, lacks substance, is lighter, does not feel sturdy.  It vibrates so much your fingers will go numb before finishing the shave.  Equally as important the old one would let you plug it in and shave if the battery ran down or you forgot to charge it in.  This one is only useable if charged.  Will not turn on if plugged in.  Save your money and get something of better quality.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Product is okay.  For the  most part it works but for me, it has some trouble getting the hairs on my neck.  I&#x27;ve found that my old Braun 1775 shaver works much better.  I find that the Braun 1175 gives me a closer shave too.  After using the Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet/Dry Shaver, if I use my Braun 1775 right after, it will give me a closer shave (and I haven&#x27;t changed the blades on the Bran 1775 in years... so that tells you something).  Also, I&#x27;m not that familiar with this... but I assume because this is rated as a wet / dry shaver and some individuals aren&#x27;t that bright, it doesn&#x27;t work while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun for many years.  It was one of their first self-cleaning models.  I liked it thought the cleaning solution was kind of expensive.  But what really did me in was the replacement heads.  They became very hard to find and before I got this model, were about $50.  I checked around and decided to take a chance with this one as the replacements are much cheaper and this unit new was just a bit more than my replacement head.  Well...Happy to report that shaving technology has apparently improved.  This unit shaves very well and holds a good charge.  Cleans well as it is wet/dry.  The heads aren&#x27;t too much.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This was gift for our son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good electric razor and trimmer. Haven&#x27;t used it wet but it is very good at removing with minimum effort my difficult whiskers. Recommend it as this is my second Braun electric razor and the first one is 20 years old. Like me, the first one is ready to retire.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon back in February 2014, My Old Norelco will out shave this Braun Series 3 mo# 380s . I should have bought another Norelco, I had heard good things about the Braun,  I thought I would try it and wish I did not.  Never again, I will stay with a winner. .</li>
    <li> it shaves very clean, and not noisy.&lt;br /&gt;the only problem is the battery, not very long as expected (panasonic or some others)</li>
    <li> Great Razor - Best price that I could find anywhere.!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I will be using for years and years to come. Never again will I use a razor.</li>
    <li> Borderline five star, I just tend to save fives for fantastic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a long time safety razor guy.  Post Shower, shave oil, badger brush, top quality cream, and a fresh German blade.  Thing is, that routine takes a while and I was only shaving every third day or so.  Not really the look I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Braun, I can get a good shave (doesn&#x27;t compare to the blade) FAST!  I&#x27;m still slightly bristelly on the neck but with the trimmer, you can do a nice quick job on your sideburns and nose/ears.</li>
    <li> Gives me a great shave and doesn&#x27;t irrate the skin of my neck like other shavers I have bought and tried.  I am very happy with the job it does and glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase thank you</li>
    <li> It was a gift purchase and the recipient is extremely happy with it.  He stated that one of the best features is it can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Smooth quiet and flexible</li>
    <li> Only had for 1 week. I replaced a previously owned Braun that I had for over 8 years and had replaced foil and blades several times in the past and loved. It&#x27;s finally time to move on as the battery now needs replacing again.  This new Braun shaver fits my hands much better, is easier to hold and the shaving head has a better shape making it much easier to trim around my beard line on my cheeks and under my jaw. Although it makes slightly more noise than my previous Braun, it gives me a much cleaner shave without pulling hair or irritating my skin. Beard trimmer on back works well as does the drop down blade feature where you only use one trimmer blade.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;bwc</li>
    <li> The battery in my old Panasonic shaver was just about lasting for one shave so I knew it was time to invest in a new shaver. A shaver can have all the bells and whistles possible but it&#x27;s the blades that do the job and the Panasonic blades didn&#x27;t seem to be any different from the ones in my old faithful. So time to look for something different. I tried a Norelco shaver which proved to be useless on my beard so I returned it and bit the bullet and went for the Braun. I didn&#x27;t want the fancy cleaner system so the 380S-4 fitted the bill though I don&#x27;t use it as a wet shaver. That kind of defeats the object of an electric shaver in my view. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and can say that it performs very well. I get a good close shave, no irritation, my shave time has been reduced by a few mins and it is a bit quieter than my old Panasonic too, probably due to the reduced revs. How fast does it realy need to rev to do a good job anyway! Cleaning is a breeze, just unclip the blade cassette and brush the bits into the sink after every shave. The only gripe I have is the recharge cord. It is a bit short as a coil cord and the weight of the socket forced me to find another outlet to plug into so it wouldn&#x27;t keep falling out. Having solved that issue I&#x27;m good to go. Update 7SE13. I&#x27;ve used the shaver for over a year now and the other day I noticed a little light appeared to glow that I had not seen before. Low and behold it is a reminder to replace the blades. I had bought a new blade cassette at the same time I bought the shaver so I popped out the old and plugged in the new. Press and hold the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button for 5 secs and the thing is reset. Good for another year. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of bumps, like when I used a regular razor. like the power it comes with.</li>
    <li> excellent value.  works better than my more expensive braun.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I recently switched back to electric shaving after many years of either not shaving or using a manual razor.  Following the recommendation of Consumer Reports I tried the Panasonic 8103 so this review is a comparison of the Panasonic 8103 and the Braun 380.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the build quality of both are very good with the slight edge to the Braun with the slightly heavier feel and premium rubber handles on the side.  The Panasonic, to me, looked pretty cheap only with the chrome accents.  The Panasonic&#x27;s shave head is very large and makes the unit look very top-heavy and the Braun about as streamlined as you can expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging of the units was about the same in term of the time it takes to get a full charge (about 1 hour) but hands down the Braun holds a charge much longer than the Panny (I could get about 1 week of shaves with Panny and am consistently getting about 2 weeks with Braun).  The only advantage the Panny has on charging is that it has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; lcd display of the amount of charge left (i.e. 50%, 10%, etc).  Both units do not allow you to shave and charge at the same time due to water/electrical hazard which is disappointing but understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 380 comes with what I would a term a very serviceable case (somewhat of a hard case with a Braun logo on the side).  The Panny does not come with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving experience is where I believe the Braun really shines through.  I shave in the shower so have no idea how well this unit \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaves.  I use a clear King of Shaves gel so I can see where I am shaving and the Braun powers right through the water/gel combination with little to no resistance.  The Panny also has very little resistance when shaving but misses a lot of whiskers under the chin (neck area) and is very average at shaving in the mustache area.  The Braun may take a few extra strokes on the neck area but ultimately gets all the whiskers but is extremely impressive in the mustache area.  I can manage a full shave in about 7-10 mins with the Braun and about 8-12 with the Panny (takes a lot more strokes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is identical other than Braun recommends the use of a supplied oil once/week if you clean your shaver under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have for both units is that I ultimately have to use a manual razor below the side burns to get a close shave and straight edge on the side burns.  I, personally, like to have a very clean look on my extended side burns so this is not a huge inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I think both units are great shavers but the slight edge to the Braun 380 for the reasons listed above.  Braun has a 60 day satisfaction guarantee so I recommend trying the Braun out first so it gives you sufficient time to see if it&#x27;s a fit.  Panny does not have such a guarantee but you can certainly use the 30 day return policy with Amazon for a test period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.in the mustache area.

    <li> I am very impressed with this razor.  It replaced a Braun that was many years old.  This razor shaves very, very close--the closest I have ever had with an electric.  2 of the 3 shaving surfaces retract so I can get a great close shave below my nose; that was an unexpected benefit.  The charge right now is lasting well over a week of daily use.  I am very pleased with the value of the razor.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. This is my first straight-edge razor. I&#x27;ve always used Norelco razors with the triple heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it gives a pretty close shave even on my neck though it takes a few passes to get all of the hairs. It pulls the hair on my chin if I have a few days worth of growth, but it&#x27;s not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand works as expected.</li>
    <li> Bought it few months ago. Works OK. I am using it only for dry shave.</li>
    <li> With out a doubt the best shaver for your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about three weeks and have been very pleased with it.  It feels comfortable in my hand and does a terriffic job of cutting my whiskers.  I particularly like the feature that allows you to drop one-half of the shaving head (thereby narrowing the cutting surface) permitting closer contact with areas such as under your nose.  The sideburn trimmers are precise, as well.  All in all, very satisfied, although I have not tried it as a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
    <li> At first i didnt know how I felt about this razor, but once i realized how much better it was to do this in the shower then life just got a whole lot easier.  I only shave in the shower now.</li>
    <li> The cutter is not very sharp but still cut where is need so I can only give 3 stars is not worth the money</li>
    <li> I use it every day. It holds the charge very well! I have had this for over a year, and the charge still holds for about 20 minutes worth of use. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well...doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I thought the first one didn&#x27;t work, so I returned it.  2nd one is the same, lousy.  I can go over an area 10 times, and the hair is still there.  After I rub myself raw, and it finally does &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair, not shave it, its like a 2 day stubble length at best.  Are there really any cutting blades in this thing?</li>
    <li> I have several electric shavers and two of them are Braun, but this one is superb! I may just toss the others and use only this one.</li>
    <li> I have heavy growth on my face and I have spent well over $1,000 over the years to find the right electric razor. The reviews were very good, so I took the plunge and brought the Braun 3Series 380S-4. I am not impressed at all. The battery life is not great. It cuts no better than than 2 year old Panasonic, (with a dull blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be good for light growth gents, but if you have a heavy beard, and hate a constant shadow, this razor is not for you. Keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also one recommendation. The replacement razor blade and foil kit, listed on Amazon will NOT fit this razor. I brought the kit as an addition to the razor. It is for an entirely different Braun 3Series 380S-4 razor...perhaps an older version. In summary the recommended replacement kit will not work with this razor.</li>
    <li> This lighter will last over a week once fully charged.  That a great benefit if you travel not to have to carry your charger and know you will be able to use it for at least a week.</li>
    <li> Great price! Smooth cut and easy to use abd clean!  Love It!</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  It shaved nothing no matter how hard my husband pressed on his face.  Since he couldn&#x27;t use it I even tried to use it as a leg shaver.  That didn&#x27;t work either.  We tried both wet and dry shaving. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace a many-years-old Braun Series 5 electric razor. Extremely disappointed at how poorly this performs. Requires multiple passes on dry skin to cut through 3-day old growth, and no matter how many passes I make, invariably I&#x27;ll find a few whiskers left behind. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He said it&#x27;s a nice electric razor but for almost $100 he expected it to contour to his face better.</li>
    <li> Two problems: First, the power button is where my thumb wants to be. Turning the shaver on and off by accident so many times takes time away from other activities. Second, when I bear down hard the foil cutter head goes flying into the air. Next time I will keep the toilet cover down.</li>
    <li> The razor performs well if I shave every day. If I wait longer it does ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in Nov 2014 after my Panasonic&#x27;s battery finally died.  I wasn&#x27;t real happy from the start as the foil shaver didn&#x27;t do a great job of evenly shaving my face.  It really struggled with curves and longer whiskers, often leaving random long whiskers randomly on my face.  As I only shave every few days, I needed to use the trimmer to shorten the whiskers before I could go over them with the foil.  The trimmer is cheaply made and often pulled the whiskers rather than trim them.  Recently, the trimmer broke as the cheap plastic near the blade broke away from the handle rendering the trimmer function useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service to explain my dissatisfaction.  Their only recourse was for me to pay to ship the product in to get fixed.  When I expressed my displeasure in how poorly this unit performed and that I really didn&#x27;t want it fixed, they only spoke about how it is their policy to fix, not replace, or refund.  They also did not offer a solution for how to shave while my unit is being repaired.  I could not be more disappointed with this product and especially Braun&#x27;s lack of customer service or desire to stand behind their product.  Luckily, I bought this unit from Kohl&#x27;s where they have a lenient return policy and I am not stuck with being out my money.  To all others, buyer beware.  And for me... back to searching for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Very good!Shaves clean!</li>
    <li> I was warned that this company sold out to a Chinese knockoff.  Wished I had taken the Amazon review more seriously.  For about $85.00 I purchased a nice looking wet/dry razor that does not provide a good shave.  I spend more time every morning trying to finish my shave.  I often have to clean up with my old rotary electric or a blade and cream.</li>
    <li> I like it for lazy days,  I don&#x27;t think it cuts any closer than the Remmington Micro-screens from the 1990&#x27;s did.&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds a charge, I use it once or twice a week since January and only charged once so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, by 3 or 4pm, my beard is looking shaggy, so a blade shave it is not.  (I&#x27;m not exactly a 4 o-clock shadow guy).&lt;br /&gt;IT is very nice to give the once over if we are leaving the house late in the day weather I blade-shaved or electric shaved in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CUT IS COMFORTABLE.  and it is somewhat quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT cut as close as I had hoped, and it is not exactly a time saver, blade shave or this takes about the same time... at least with this I don&#x27;t need to get wet.</li>
    <li> Works so good it makes me wonder if they can really get better if you fork out more money</li>
    <li> Due to poor construction. Thin plastic tabs holding the shaver together will break from the vibration rendering the beard trimmer non functional. This same thing happened to my father&#x27;s, which is pretty much the same only black so this is a design flaw, or intentionally designed failure even. Who knows, people do some dumb things in the name of profit</li>
    <li> Excelent shaver - I prefer to use it after shower for perfect shave using a towel to dry face before.</li>
    <li> It works as expected, holds charge for more than couple of weeks and does the job. I just wish the blades were easily come out for better cleaning.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had</li>
    <li> Disappointed,,, does not shave well around the chin and neck.</li>
    <li> We bought this razor for our eldest grandson.  He seemed really pleased by the gift, but I haven&#x27;t spoken with him since ~ will this coming weekend, so I&#x27;ll ask him and report back to you if you ask again.</li>
    <li> In my opinion Braun excels in design, durability, price and overall quality- but in shaving closeness, they cannot beat the Panasonic shavers. Only reason I tried this shaver is because Panasonic has gotten incredibly expensive with their models and the durability of their foils and cutter is awful. Right now I&#x27;m holding on to this model Braun- but eventually I think I will need to shell out the bucks and go back to the Panasonic shavers. :(</li>
    <li> Very good on tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE EVER OWNED</li>
    <li> very easy to use and I can save shaving time every morning.</li>
    <li> really doesn&#x27;t work well at all, very unhappy with this item and would love to return it and find something else.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun razor in a little over 15 years. I had the same Braun for years and it was great!! The only thing I had to do was change the blade and screen once a year or two. It finally stopped charging completely and the trimmer didn&#x27;t work that well. I decided after 15 years to buy a new Braun. I decided on this one and although it works great I&#x27;m wondering just how long it may last. This new one is much more inferior in terms of the parts. Everything is made of plastic, even the top portion which is meant to look like chrome or something. I&#x27;m sure this new one will be fine but I doubt it will last 15 plus years like my old better made Braun. Companies are finding ways to make things cheaper yet charge you more. I can&#x27;t rate this more than three stars right now.</li>
    <li> My Doctor put me on an aspirin a day program for my heart.  I had always shaved with a blade because electric razors always left me looking shabby and partially unshaven.  The Braun 3 series wet/dry  shaving system when used in the shower with Remington king of shaves gel is fantastic.  My shaves are at least as close as the blade shaves were and no more bleeding.  I know there are more expensive systems out there and I had in the back of my mind to treat myself to one of them someday before I used this shaver, but I now feel this one will be as good as I will ever need. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Provides a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this shaver. I&#x27;ve been a Remington man for almost 40 years, but the last Remington shaver I had left me frustrated. I researched the best shavers of 2014 and this shaver was on multiple lists of the top 5. But all the others on the list cost at least twice as much. This is a very comfortable and close shave. It does the job quickly and efficiently. It even gets my neck around the Adam&#x27;s apple well with its flexible head. My first charge lasted me 5 weeks of shaving every day. I charged it again, and I&#x27;m now another 4 weeks in without a charge. Easy to clean. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> First ever electric razor and should have gotten one sooner.  Convenient, easy to use and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I had about ten shaves with this device.  Though indicating a full charge, it then would not turn on.  Subsequently sitting untouched, it would turn itself on, and sometimes let me turn it off, but wouldn&#x27;t let me turn it on.  Junk.</li>
    <li> It was a birthday present for my son and he seems to be very happy with it.  He&#x27;s had other Braun shavers and has liked them all.</li>
    <li> This was for my son, he says he likes it just fine.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun that I have owned and I really like it much better than the previous one.</li>
    <li> I had previously given my husband an electric shaver, one of the most advertised on the market, but after the first time he used it, his neck looked like someone had scratched him, like he had a fight with a cat, so needless to say, I returned it, and this electric shaver was the 2nd he had tried with no luck, to the fact that he told me not to give him anymore electric shavers, he was done with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the high cost of shaving blades, all the hussle, I sign in to Amazon and started looking for yet another electric shaver that would work for him without taring his skin apart, so I reviewed many, read comments for people who had bought electric shavers, and this one caught my attention, specially when the person who bought it and used it talked about his neck being left intact and being very happy with this shaver, and my husband loves it, so a very good buy and a very good electric wet/dry shaver.</li>
    <li> I use it for light stubble and to clean up my skull.</li>
    <li> For us old guys with sagging chins, it is great, fast and smooth!</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is much better tham my ancient Micron S which finally died after probably about 30 years service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I think could improve it would be a different battery gauge.  This model only has two LEDs to show the level of charge.  Apart from that, it is very good.</li>
    <li> I read some review and I was in doubt if it can work with but this shaver working good above my expatiation.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this it has a a terrible flaw with the product&lt;br /&gt;The foil sets onto three plastic prongs with springs underneath them and if they are of a cheap build quality if one of those happens the razor will no longer perform as intended and their are no replacement parts for the plastic detachable prong and spring.</li>
    <li> The Cadillac of razors. Nice, close shave, no irritation to sensitive skin around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Badass better than I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting very smooth shaves with ease of cleaning and several hours of shaving per charge.</li>
    <li> it is very well .l like it very much !</li>
    <li> It had been decades since I shaved with an electric razor--I didn&#x27;t have much time in the morn. to shave so I bought this to shave with in the shower--all I can saw is thing shaves me as close as a blade--and around the A-Apple--superb--face is evenly shaved with consistent grow-back.  I initially started using this as a polish-up for my DE razor but soon made it the daily shaver.  Talk about saving money--I recommend using a lotion to shave with like Aveeno--good lube w/ no irritation.  This razor rocks and is easy to clean--Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the music, plus it is the original singers unlike Jersey Boys for more money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers since I first grew a beard. I&#x27;ve always marveled at their efficient simplicity.</li>
    <li> this machine is just that----a well designed machine that does a great job.  Havent tried it with shaving cream or in the shower thus far, but I do use an electric shave pre shave, and I give it very high marks!  I replaced a 20 year old Braun, and wish I had done it earlier.  The carrying case needs a pouch for the cord is my only suggestion.</li>
    <li> As it will always be said electric razors aren&#x27;t as good as a close razor &amp;gel shave or razor shave. But it does have a very close shave like all electric shavers you have to pull the skin you want to shave and go over it several times, but it does leave a clean shave. And i&#x27;m black and have coarse hair.</li>
    <li> great shaver, better than my sunbeam or my remington</li>
    <li> Shaves very well. But trimmer cuts loosely.</li>
    <li> Delivers a great shave, wet or dry. I highly recommend this electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Wet, great. Dry, not as good. Can&#x27;t shave neck very well. Holds charge.</li>
    <li> I have used mostly Norelco rotary shavers, but had heard that Braun was \\&quot;the best\\&quot;. When my last rotary (a Remington) finally fell apart on me, I decided it was time to see if people were correct. I checked the Braun website, looking for their best model that did not include a cleaning system. I didn&#x27;t want the extra equipment or cost of refill solution. The 380S-4 seemed to be the one I should try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: This is a solid, apparently well-made shaver. There is some heft to it. It is easy to hold, with rubberized grip areas where one needs them. One simple button for on-off, one simple slide for the trimmer, the head assembly just pulls off and clicks on. The only gimmick is a slide that lowers one foil and the long-hair clipper, leaving one foil high for ease of &#x27;precision&#x27; shaving. The charger cord either plugs in to the bottom of the shaver directly, or attaches to a small drop-in base. Seems to hold a charge for a long time, though I haven&#x27;t timed it. I use it dry, can&#x27;t comment on wet use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: The pop-up trimmer has to be the best I have ever seen on a general-purpose shaver. Maybe dedicated trimmers are better, I have no experience with them, but they&#x27;d have go some to beat this one. It is sharp and precise, a joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Not a very close shave. I usually suffer irritation, especially on the neck, when using any kind of shaver. This doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it is probably because it isn&#x27;t very close. There&#x27;s no coarseness adjustment, you get what you get. It shaves evenly, just not real close. Also, when I skip a day or two it takes some going over and over to get everything. It does it, just not on one pass. This shaver seems to be fine for daily shaving, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to handle several-day-old growth well. That may be typical of foil-type shavers, I never noticed it on my rotaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-so: There is no protective cover for the foils. There is a hard-side zippered case that form-fits the entire shaver, so maybe the foil cover isn&#x27;t necessary. The charger cord, however, doesn&#x27;t fit in the case with the shaver, could present a problem for travelling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A solid, basic shaver for daily use, with a trimmer that&#x27;s better than most.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;If i one more buy, i will be buy this one again without no hesitation.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  It is fast and easy shaving, and I love it because he shaves every day now. He has tried other methods and this is the most comfortable for him.</li>
    <li> Great shave and ez to clean nice shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver on a whim to replace my [[ASIN:B000UK2VRK Philips Norelco 8040X Moisturizing Shaving System]], which gave me the closest shave I ever had from an electric.  The shaving lotion appears to have been discontinued so I was looking into the Braun 7 series.  But before I could pull the trigger on the [[ASIN:B004BD8QEO Braun Series 7 Series 7-720S Pulsonic Shaver, Black]], I found the Braun 380S-4 at a good price.  I decided to try it out knowing that I could use the 60 day return policy.  I like this shaver but there are a few things that could be better.  First, the pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  For the 3-Series (low end model), the shaver does not feel cheap.  I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for over a month now and it seems well constructed, although the power button encasing (silver circle around the button) has started making a clicking noise if you touch the top part of the circle.  The sensofoil (name of the foil on the 3-Series) does not cause any visible irritation on my skin.  This is a huge improvement over the old [[ASIN:B000G1785S Braun Series 5 (8985) Men&#x27;s Shaver]] (AKA 360 Complete) I used to own which left red marks all over my neck.  I even went running immediately after using the 380S and when I returned there was no irritation on my skin, which used to happen all the time with the 360 Complete.  I like how I can clean this shaver under the tap like I used to do with my 8040X, something I couldn&#x27;t do with the 360 Complete.  One of the best things about this particular Braun is that it comes with a charging stand, not to be confused with a clean and renew stand.  I find this accessory invaluable for those that don&#x27;t want to have to purchase the cleaning solution to use with the clean and renew stands because the stand allows the shaver to be stored vertically on the bathroom counter, which I think helps with drying.  Plus I don&#x27;t like leaving the shaver laying on the counter.  The stand can be used to charge the shaver by plugging thepower cord into the base, but the cord can be plugged directly into the shaver for charging, which is nice if you don&#x27;t want to bring the stand with you when you go on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Being that this shaver is the 3-Series, one feature it lacks the \\&quot;Contour Adaptive Shaving Head,\\&quot; which ensures that the shaver foil is always contacting your face at a 90 degree angle, ensuring the most contact between your face and the foils.  This feature would be best served when shaving over the jawline, removing the most hair.  It also lacks the active lift feature, but on the 360 Complete, that feature was useless.  It is supposed to help cut longer hairs that are laying down, moreso than the middle trimmer on the 3-Series shavers.  The feature may have improved over the years, but I can&#x27;t comment on it with the current 7-Series shavers (note: 360 Complete has been retroactively categorized as part of the 5-Series).  There are other other features that are not included when compared to the 7-Series that I cannot comment on (pulsonic, sensitivity modes).  As far as the shave itself, it does not appear as close as the 8040X, although it is pretty close.  The shave will leave patches of stubble, so you will have to go over some areas repeatedly, which costs time but does not really add much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, if the 720-S came with a charging stand, I would trade in my 380S in a heartbeat.  But I confirmed with Braun customer service that the 720-S does not include such a stand.  I think that I will stick with the 380S for now, but I am still tempted to try the 7-Series or a high end Panasonic model.</li>
    <li> I researched shavers online before purchasing. Husband and Son both love the razor for its performance and ease in packing for travel. Doesn&#x27;t need a counter charger.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Norelco Razors for the past 20 years and just now made the switch.  I&#x27;ve had the Braun 380S-4 for exactly two weeks and I love it.  Shaves closer than Norelcos and the heads last up to 18 months.  Norelco says change theirs yearly and maybe should be changed more often.  Also, I can&#x27;t wait to shave in the shower with this baby.  I&#x27;m sure it will shave as well wet as it does dry.  It does get closer than a rotary shaver.  It&#x27;s very ergonomic too.  I paid $106 for it here on Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It will not shave while plugged in and charging, but that&#x27;s fine.  It will charge enough in five minutes to do a shave.  Keep your wife away from this if she shaves her legs.  I do really like this razor and after all it&#x27;s a German brand and Germany does make good tools.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, better than my old Philip shaver but just a little short of my expectation. The shave isn&#x27;t that clean and precise.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver looks like the right item for travelling.  It&#x27;s not as close as a shaving razor w/ shave cream, but I want to travel as light as possible.  A buddy in the Fire Dept had one and it served him well.  This one will go one step further because it is wet/dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller...</li>
    <li> .shaves great with first shave ,have similar one that I shaved with for one or two years then with new heads the good shaves did not continue</li>
    <li> not bad still getting used to it .</li>
    <li> Have been a confirmed safety razor shaver all my life.  Wanted to try a simpler shave... big mistake.  Leaves too many hairs and must go over the same area several times and still leaves hair.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
