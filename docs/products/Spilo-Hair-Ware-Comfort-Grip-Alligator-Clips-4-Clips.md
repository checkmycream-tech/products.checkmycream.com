      <li>High recommended if you need that strong hold &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Seperates the hair to make it a lot easier to achieve a salon worthy blow out</li>
      <li>Quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These work great to keep your hair up out of the way when in the hot tub&lt;br /&gt;Recomend to anyone with long hair and a spa</li>
      <li>and they are so reasonably priced!!</li>
      <li>strong clips great to hold my thick hair in place</li>
      <li>They were worth it though...</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I think the normal clips that are used do just fine.</li>
      <li>You could use more clips but these are much bulkier than regular clips (although fairly light).  </li>
      <li>Her hair is very dense and full, which rules out any weaker clips.</li>
      <li>had no idea of any of this at first, until those problems went away after buying this clip.</li>
      <li>These are the exact clips my hair stylist uses when he&#x27;s blow drying my hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
      <li>These clips are the only ones I have been able to find that are strong enough to hold my hair.</li>
      <li>They work really great for thick hair!</li>
      <li>I have found metal clips with teeth that are low profile and hold my fine hair in a bun very well.</li>
      <li>have a lot of hair and these clips can hold as much hair</li>
      <li>Very loose fitting and just did not work for me.</li>
      <li>I hope this is a \\&quot;freak\\&quot; happening, otherwise a very short-term</li>
      <li>I wanted to love these alligator clips, but they have some slightly ragged edges on the bottom part of the clip that snag my hair when I slide them in, so unfortunately I do not use them.  </li>
      <li>They are made of plastic, but are slightly hinged on the top as well as one end of course for opening them.</li>
      <li>They do not hold my hair up like my older clips.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this clips for all hair types.</li>
      <li>and they hold everything back very easily without slipping at all and without ANY tugging or scraping.</li>
      <li>Good grip on long thick hair.</li>
      <li>They are large enough to hold a lot of hair to the side.</li>
      <li>Wow, I wish I had discovered these years ago.</li>
      <li>I bought two packs of them with my long thick hair, I really could have gone with one pack, but I&#x27;m glad I have the extras in case I lose one.</li>
      <li>And the grips to open them are coated so if my hands are wet or have product on them they open easily.</li>
      <li>Also, 2 of the clips are smaller and not really sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use them.</li>
      <li>I can pull them right out when I&#x27;m done and they glide out of my hair without pulling at all, which has never happened with any other clip or claw or barrette.</li>
      <li>and I saw these at high end salon recently.</li>
      <li>I have middling long hair, with Spilo Hair Ware Comfort Grip Alligator Clips, blow drying my hair has become much easier.</li>
      <li>It might be impossible to improve upon this design, and the price was great.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the teeth on the bottom, they always get caught if I am not extremely careful...</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and my hair slips out of most clips but not these.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately they broke VERY easily.</li>
      <li>highly recommend these clips over other brands.</li>
      <li>They also don&#x27;t hold hair as well as normal clips due to the &amp;#34;extra grip&amp;#34; area being much smaller than regular clips.  </li>

<li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend them, just be careful.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without them!</li>
<li> and I come from a long line of hairdressrrs!</li>
<li> but I like to use one or two of the clips when I blow dry the lower portion of my hair.</li>
<li> I have LOTS of hair so finding a clip that is strong enough to hold it all is very difficult.</li>
<li> My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that they only could be ordered in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/5/2013:</li>
<li> For example, they might be heavy, but were tolerated because they seemed to need to be very heavy to actually hold her hair properly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clamp as tight as my other clips, but works</li>
    <li> These are great and at a good price. I use these for hair maintenance while hair coloring, root touch ups, trimming my hair cut and also when deep conditioning. They work flawlessly. They hold the hair solid, there is no slippage, pulling or snagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for something like this for years. When I saw these I decided to try them, I am glad I did. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that they only could be ordered in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/5/2013: While clipping my hair this morning, one of the clip&#x27;s plastic pieces, holding the spring snapped. One out of three now a goner. I hope this is a \\&quot;freak\\&quot; happening, otherwise a very short-term purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The seller sent me replacement clips, for the broken one. If another one breaks I&#x27;ll update again and recommend another brand, hopefully just a problem with one clip.</li>
    <li> Best gator clips I&#x27;ve ever used and I come from a long line of hairdressrrs! They stay in firm but don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair. and they are so reasonably priced!! Worth it!</li>
    <li> Good grip on long thick hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair ... Find something else !</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair and these clips can hold as much hair and I want with easy and comfort. I highly recommend this clips for all hair types. Def does a good job keeping my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t slip or damage hair.</li>
    <li> These are great if you want to avoid getting your hair caught in clips (I have almost waist length hair and the other clips tend to lead to tangles very easily) BUT these are not great for thick hair.  You could use more clips but these are much bulkier than regular clips (although fairly light).  They also don&#x27;t hold hair as well as normal clips due to the &amp;#34;extra grip&amp;#34; area being much smaller than regular clips.  Not as great as I had hoped they would be.</li>
    <li> Nice hair clips, but they catch my hair. I think it&#x27;s the teeth on the bottom, they always get caught if I am not extremely careful... I&#x27;ve never had this problem with alligator clips before. But these are DEFINITELY the best constructed alligator clips I&#x27;ve used. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend them, just be careful.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and these looked like clips I have used in the past. They do not hold my hair up like my older clips. Very loose fitting and just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding things to keep my hair up that are unobtrusive. I hate the normal claw clip things you can get in the hair section of most grocery/big box stores. I have found metal clips with teeth that are low profile and hold my fine hair in a bun very well. The only problem is they are very pointed on one end and can actually be dangerous. I wanted something not quite so dangerous but still did the same job. I hvae not found anything similar until now. Enter these alligator clips. They are made of plastic, but are slightly hinged on the top as well as one end of course for opening them. They could be a little longer as they do a fairly decent job of holding all of my hair, but it takes some maneuvering to get it just right. Also, 2 of the clips are smaller and not really sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use them. For those of you using them at your hair salon, well quite frankly I think the normal clips that are used do just fine. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Use these almost every night to pull my hair back when washing my face. Strong clips that get the job done and I saw these at high end salon recently. Only complaint is that if you leave them in wet hair too long while styling, your hair looks a little crimped because of the alligator teeth.</li>
    <li> These are great hair clips. I had 4 already but I loved them so much that I got some for my mom. They work really great for thick hair!</li>
    <li> I have LOTS of hair so finding a clip that is strong enough to hold it all is very difficult. These clips are the only ones I have been able to find that are strong enough to hold my hair. High recommended if you need that strong hold &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love these clips! I have thin hair and my hair slips out of most clips but not these. And the grips to open them are coated so if my hands are wet or have product on them they open easily. Amazing value!</li>
    <li> I never used them was a gift and I have not heard anything as of yet ,I&#x27;m sure they are fine.</li>
    <li> These are the exact clips my hair stylist uses when he&#x27;s blow drying my hair. They are awesome, very strong and don&#x27;t make kinks in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great item at a very reasonable price. I have short hair but I like to use one or two of the clips when I blow dry the lower portion of my hair. Dividing the hair with the clips makes it a lot easier and the end result is always better.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these clips over other brands.</li>
    <li> These grip alot of hair(mine is very fine. I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without them!</li>
    <li> I loved to use them in my hair. Unfortunately they broke VERY easily. I&#x27;d just be opening them and they would pop apart.</li>
    <li> These work great to keep your hair up out of the way when in the hot tub&lt;br /&gt;Recomend to anyone with long hair and a spa</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair but it never falls out of the grip of these clips. The matte finish is great too. I have some other clips that look like these but they&#x27;re shiny plastic that rattles and feels cheap. I&#x27;ve bought these twice, I&#x27;ll probably buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love this clips! These are perfect for doing my hair in the morning. I can curl/straighten it in layers without getting a crease in the layers I clip up. Excellent quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> grips nicely, gets the job done.  Seperates the hair to make it a lot easier to achieve a salon worthy blow out</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted it to be. WAY better than the butterfly clips I was using.</li>
    <li> strong clips great to hold my thick hair in place</li>
    <li> I use these every day, Can&#x27;t find them in stores, again it is the only thing that holds my hair up because my hair is long and thick.</li>
    <li> These clips are just like what your beautician uses. They hold a lot of hair, and don&#x27;t fall out. They also don&#x27;t pull or catch your hair when you take them out. I plan on buying more for gifts! Once you have these, you will not go back to the department store ones. I bought two packs of them with my long thick hair, I really could have gone with one pack, but I&#x27;m glad I have the extras in case I lose one.</li>
    <li> They broke to easily.</li>
    <li> Wow, I wish I had discovered these years ago. I color my own hair and these are ideal. I have long thick hair and they hold everything back very easily without slipping at all and without ANY tugging or scraping. I can pull them right out when I&#x27;m done and they glide out of my hair without pulling at all, which has never happened with any other clip or claw or barrette. They are large enough to hold a lot of hair to the side. Four is a good number to have. I use all four on my coloring days. Absolutely perfect clip.</li>
    <li> Love these clips! Sturdy and effective.</li>
    <li> Love using these while blow drying my hair in the AM. Also wonderful for helping separate the hair while styling.</li>
    <li> They have a strong spring and holds your hair just where you want it until you move it.  They are amazing.</li>
    <li> These clips work perfectly for my needs. Item also came fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> These clips are fabulous. I have middling long hair, with Spilo Hair Ware Comfort Grip Alligator Clips, blow drying my hair has become much easier. They stay put in my hair which is the biggest difference from other clips I&#x27;ve used and they don&#x27;t leave crease marks. They enable me to dry my hair straight without frizz by holding up my somewhat thick, naturally wavy hair and keeping it out of the way. My only disappointment is that they are now $3 cheaper than when I ordered them! They were worth it though...lol.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these alligator clips, but they have some slightly ragged edges on the bottom part of the clip that snag my hair when I slide them in, so unfortunately I do not use them.  If they could smooth those out I am sure the clips would be much better.</li>
    <li> My wife tells me she feels alligator clips are the best kind of clip for her, versus a scrunchie for example, but still they all left something to be desired, until this Spilo Hair Ware product. Before this she would accommodate for some kind of disappointing trait of another alligator clip. For example, they might be heavy, but were tolerated because they seemed to need to be very heavy to actually hold her hair properly. Her hair is very dense and full, which rules out any weaker clips. They might make it hard to lay down without the piece poking her head. And, leaning her head against a bathtub wall might defeat the purpose of relaxing in a bath, if the hair tie burrows into her head, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea of any of this at first, until those problems went away after buying this clip. Watching her, the clip seems perfectly shaped and really well thought-out. It looks great, it is light and flexible, and yet it seems to mold itself precisely to her hair and head. It might be impossible to improve upon this design, and the price was great.</li>
