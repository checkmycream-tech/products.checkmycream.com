<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product looks exactly as shown in the picture, very long hair peice, beautiful shiny and it has a nice curl, bounce, to it. However, it does look a tad bit \\&quot;fake\\&quot; being its SO shiny, in comparison to your natural hair! Other than that, it was a great price for the value. For anyone who just wants to glam up their look without having to invest a ton of money in extensions, this is the ticket.</li>
    <li> i got this extension and it looks exactly like tthe pic. i liked it a lot. it looked like real hair. its shine is nice, its a long hair for sure. for thick hair u shud probably get two of these. i hav thick hair and i got only 1 and prom is coming soon and dnt feel like waiting agn.</li>
    <li> The worst ever , first of all it&#x27;s only 1 clip and it&#x27;s not human so u do the math... What would I do with one clip smh</li>
    <li> Looks fabulous.  I ended up taking off the clips and creating a halo instead.  I too had my stylist trim a bit to have it blend better.  Excellent quality for an alternative to human hair. No one can tell the difference</li>
    <li> Love love my hair extensions they feel like real hair I cut them down to my shoulders so it could look more natural and the shine put some baby powder and shake off or with a towel  I love everything about this hair its bouncy and what I also like is the hair clips don&#x27;t hurt your head  for the price is great for this quality  I love wearing them and order two more  I use to wear the 7 piece hair extensions and don&#x27;t miss them at all just did not like the way they feel around the neck part and it does not bounce like the one piece I&#x27;m so very very happy I bought this my hair is short and when I get up in the morning to get ready for work it all I have to do put on my makeup  and put my hair extensions and it looks like I spend all day curling my hair I highly recommend you buying this I&#x27;m so going to order more</li>
    <li> Very nice. Strong. Long. Shiny. I would recommended. I&#x27;m ordering another 2 pieces to match the color of my hair.</li>
    <li> Item was not at all what the image perceived the extensions to be. Uneven measurement of clip placement and terrible job done sowing on the clips. Product looked like it had been thru hell and back when I received it. Tangled so bad it was unrevivable.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair is short, so I wanted to make it long. But I think this ones works better with already long hair and only if you want to make it more voluminous, otherwise your hair will look fake.</li>
    <li> MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES HOW EASY TO JUST PIN ON HEAD WITH LITTLE OR EFFERT AND WILL NOT PULL YOUR OWN HAIR OUT. iT IS PRETTY AND WILL NOT LOOSE IT&#x27;S SHAP AND WAVES YOU CAN ALSO CURL IT FOR TIGHTER WAVES.  gLAMEROUS GIRLS.  ALL I CAN SAY IS &amp;#34;GET YOUR BEFORE CHRISTMAS</li>
    <li> I adored having long hair again for a night! This was simple to use and so much fun! It held it&#x27;s form perfectly and was a great success! I&#x27;m still utterly delighted!</li>
    <li> This hair would be great if I were white or Asian. It&#x27;s not recommended for blending into black-textured hair.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Because it&#x27;s curly it gets knotted up alot.  Nice texture though.</li>
    <li> my hair is jet black, and this hair is brown.&lt;br /&gt;it does straighten really well.</li>
    <li> It blends with my hair and they look good for the price.</li>
    <li> very nice:) looked exactly like the pictures and description</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who loves to play around with her hair.  She wears it when she wants to look a little more grownup.</li>
    <li> It took almost a month for the hair to come in and only 1 of 2 hair extensions I purchased arrived. Some of these reviews say they got theirs early so it depends (patient/impatient). I&#x27;ll talk about the 1st hair extension I received. The hair extension came tightly enclosed in a package. When I first took a look at the hair, I was shocked and happy by how much hair and how really pretty the curls were. The quality of the synthetic hair is great, it looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t look fake, and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap either. You CAN straighten these but in very low heat. As it said in the description, it will endure heat BELOW 180. Anything above 180 will literally melt everything together that&#x27;s why some of these reviewers say it gets ugly and it&#x27;s a waste of money. IF YOU KNEW how to care of your own hair, you&#x27;ll know how to care of hair extensions considering the fact that you know not too straighten them in high heat as it can damage the hair and it explains in the description how much heat it can take. When you straighten the hair extension it&#x27;s actually about 26-30 inches long as supposed to being curly 20 inch hair. Which is really good for those who want to straighten these and add length to their hair. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it does get a little nappy at the ends, it does get tangled, and you do have to constantly keep brushing. But it also depends on how much you plan on wearing them. These aren&#x27;t top notch high end hair extension(s), you get what you payed for; it&#x27;s pretty decent for the amount of hair and length you&#x27;re getting. The down side about this, the hair sometimes falls out, the tracks that are sewn in to the bigger head track piece gets loose, and the clips are poorly sewn in. But that won&#x27;t be an issue if you&#x27;re considering to buy this since you can tighten the clips and the tracks by sewing more thread in. I&#x27;m waiting for the second package because the seller forgot to put in the second hair extensions along with the first. The seller is really nice,is very understanding and will do anything to make the customer happy. Over all, I give this product a 3, because it seems like a fair rating since there was 50/50 positive and negative. Would I buy more hair extensions from this seller? sure, it was worth the 3 bucks I payed for. I&#x27;ll be making a second review for the second hair extension when it comes in to see if it&#x27;s any different from the first.</li>
    <li> Pros: I pretty much loved it XD it was long and even though it was tangly and shedded a bit, I just shampooed and conditioned it and it was really soft and didn&#x27;t have any problems at all!&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: it only came as one, so I need to buy another one because of all my different crazy layers in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that&#x27;s about it!  Bye c:</li>
    <li> on one of the ones I ordered, a clip was broken in half. It&#x27;s a lot thicker than I expected though. It&#x27;s difficult to blend in because the color doesn&#x27;t match, but that&#x27;s not their fault. It&#x27;s def black! I cut layers in it so it looks like a have three layers in my hair. I seriously love it. I have worn it five times so far and it&#x27;s holding up well. It&#x27;s on the shiny side and hair falls out pretty easily so be careful.</li>
    <li> This item was ordered for my wife. it was not for me I cannot give you any other rating other than what she said.</li>
    <li> received my hair in one week fast delivery.  Once you open the package the hair is soft to the touch.  I think the only problem is its too shiny.  So it can look a little fake.  I received 1b hair which is a brown /black which matched my hair perfectly.  You can put a little low heat on the hair if you want to straighten it.  I put two clips in and it was alottt of hair.  One clip was fine for me.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great buy I loved it. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Kevin was wonderful he was kind and helped and notified me about my purchase. My extensions were 👏GREAT QUALITY👏 honestly not what I had expected. DEFINATLY A GREAT BUY👑</li>
    <li> Ok who sells someone one extension like seriously it&#x27;s literally they sell you one extension what&#x27;s one extension supposed to do to my head it will make it look like someone&#x27;s messed up weave like really r u seriously going to give someone one extension that&#x27;s like giving someone one fake nail really I have nothing good to say about that</li>
    <li> I really liked them, for such a cheap price they are fantastic, they are kinda shiny but they feel soft and i cant even tell that they are fake hair.</li>
    <li> only purchase these if you are using them for a play or something.. do not waste a cent for real usage.</li>
    <li> These extensions are amazing! I got them today! they came in 11 days! way before the estimated date! you can not tell that they are fake! they look so real. on top of that they are shiny. not in a fake way but as in if they were real and healthy(; overly excited!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product, not real hair, but i knew that when i bought it.. great price for a peice to play with.. a little extra touch when wanting to dress up..doesnt brush very well, but its not real hair... good product for the price</li>
    <li> this hair piece is long, black, sexy and easy to use  and its re-useable too and the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> This hair is very fake. Acceptable as a costume but not as something to wear as weave. And clips came off after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say but my wife haven&#x27;t got her shippment yet, I talk to some one who was sending this product and they said they are sending my wife another shippment that it possiable it got lost during deliever, wel, like I said she order it aug31 2013 n we waited for entire month n now we waiting on the second one the claim their sending my wife another we have wait...I will wait 7 day if we will inform other people who shop on this web. Ty</li>
    <li> i love love love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;there amazing i use them like everyday!&lt;br /&gt;thank you.&lt;br /&gt;this is a real late review, im super sorry.</li>
    <li> the price is great, but what your paying for is TANGLES!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color was great and only a small portion on the top had a soft smooth texture, besides that it was nothing but tangles, everytime i tried to comb em out it would only shed and it would make the end messed up, never buying this product again its nothing but tangles and im very upset!!!</li>
    <li> It was falling apart when I pulled out package! I just threw away! Useless but what can&#x27;t complain to much about the price.</li>
    <li> its great product..looks so natural, i got tons of compliments. easy to comb n style.&lt;br /&gt;well 4 stars because i need two of these to get the desired volume.</li>
    <li> its pretty obviously plastic hair, gets verrry tangled easily. does NOT look like the picture. its somewhat thick, but the width isnt long enough, it wraps like 1/3 of my head. it doesnt look right worn alone. id say buy two, but for the price of two you can find real human hair extenstions that will look much better. would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> pretty cute and cheap! recommend! you get a decent amount of hair and its wavy nice! great purchase! if you need fake hair this is the one</li>
    <li> Yes got mine there long I have to dye my hair black which I do all the time they look nice and no one knew they were fake I work in a restaurant so my hair is always up.</li>
    <li> The hair is too straight and you are not able to curl or do anything to the hair.  It only slips out my hand every time I try to do something with it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even tell she was wearing anything under her real hair. Blended in just right she liked it. A lot</li>
    <li> Came in fast but it looked fake when I had it on</li>
    <li> I did happen to get it about 3 weeks earlier than expected, which was awesome for me because I didnt want to wait 2 months. I have thick hair so I bought 2 pieces so it would match my hair a little better. It is synthetic hair, so if you choose to straighten it, the heat needs to be below 180 or you will burn the strands. My flat iron only goes as low as 370 so I only use it while it first starts to heat up. There is a shine to the color and to be a true match your hair needs to be extremely black for a match. After I straighten my hair, I put hair serum to give my natural hair a shine to be similar to the clip in. You can tell that it is cheaply made, the hair does shed depending on how you care for it. I dont have special brushes so while its clipped into my hair I have to gently brush from bottom to top to untangle it, and spray in a little hair serum to keep it soft. It came with a netting, not sure what it was for. But when I store the hair, ill tie a scrunchy on the top, tightly braid it, a scrunchy on the bottom and wrap the netting around it. That helps it to keep its big curls ans stop from tangling and shedding when not in use. I didnt realize it was so long. I believe its 21 inches, so when I put it in my hair, I cut it to fit my frame. In my hair, I can braid it, wrap it in a bun, put it in a pony tail, its really not bad for being 5 bucks a pop. It was my first ever hair extension, id recommend it for someone who wants to experiment, but I do want to get real hair for the durability and higher quality.</li>
    <li> After a whole month waiting I finally got it in my mail today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on after I opened up the package. It makes my hair look amazing! I have a full length hair myself, dark and full, this extension adds some wave to my hair and makes me more girly looking. For the price I paid for it I think it totally worth it! Thinking about to get another one.</li>
    <li> Came SO early I was happy! The product came SUPER curly, but it&#x27;s beautiful curls! I did straighten it, it took me awhile to straighten it, because it is synthetic! Its hard to brush, but for what you pay it&#x27;s not even a big deal! I bought two thinking by how cheap it was it would be thin, I really only needed one I couldn&#x27;t bealieve how thick it was! I left one curly because the curls were so beautiful and straightened the other, I had to cut it because when you straighten it, it is literally down to you&#x27;re belly button in length! I would def purchase again! Doesn&#x27;t look fake at all!</li>
    <li> super soft! Got here amazingly quick! And I&#x27;ve bought way less hair for two to three times the cost. Its a little shiny but who cares, I&#x27;m a werdo with tons of colors and weird shiny bits in my hair as it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice I like it blend in my hair but it&#x27;s too long for me ! Since I have layers in my hair you can notice it&#x27;s not my hair lol</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it...A clip fail out with just one use..Actually I was just trying it on..You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> It feels pretty real, and while I have no idea how to take care of/use extensions (it got tangled like crazy), the clips do attach well. Just be warned that this black wig is much darker than Asian hair (which I&#x27;ve learned is dark brown). &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I my hair texture could not ever blend with this. It reminds me of cheap doll hair and i guess I was expectign the feel of the synthetic hair that is heat resistant. It tangled right out of the bag.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this but I was so happy with it.  it is easy to attach to your head and it Blends really well.  I love it.  I have worn it for by bellydance performances and it stays in place.  This was a great find. To this day.. my friend do not know I was wearing a piece!  ;-)</li>
    <li> the weaving come lose.. the hair sheds everywhere.. shed is immediate. wife wife put them on to test them out and was covered in after she has never worn them since trying them on...</li>
    <li> Is not a human hair, is sintetic but doesnt looks like plastic, is pretty good, my wife is expert wearing extensions and she said this is good hair to use for special occasion, not to wear everyday, if you wanna a strong hair to daily use, you need a bettter brand. This hair have a nice curls, is long and you will have a nice and fresh look in seconds. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> this item became unuseable after one day of use, Complete waist of money. The piece was also very heavy and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I work at a beauty supply store and I see women spend a lot more than 3 bucks for extensions like these. The quality is great for synthetic hair. Granted my current hair color is a dark/reddish brown and doesn&#x27;t exactly match the extensions, but that is totally fine! I&#x27;ll just dye my hair black/darker brown. These extensions are so fabulous and really make my hair look so beautiful and long. Also helped that they arrived a little early ;)</li>
    <li> good for costumes looks fake</li>
    <li> Well.. you are all probably wondering, is this even a good product? I say yes. Yes it is. The product can not have heat to it. DO NOT use heat! I did use heat on it and they are all messed up now. That;s probably the only bad thing about this product. I would defiantly buy it again but not use the heat. They are very pretty the way they are. Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed with this - I thought it would be a wig for a costume but it&#x27;s a single track made to fit the front half of the head. A single, thin track at that. HOWEVER, I was able to make it work for my costume but it&#x27;s otherwise useless because it&#x27;s so thin. The hair itself was true to the length as shown, was an off-black/deepest dark brown color which I wanted. It&#x27;s texture is very similar to doll hair (like Barbie) - it&#x27;s soft, super fine, very shiny (like plastic shiny), and easy to tangle. It was half-way decent enough for Halloween but for the effort, the frustration, and hassle I could have done better at the beauty supply for the same amount and KNOWN what I was getting.</li>
    <li> it looked much different in the picture. the hair tangles and is not made to brush through or comb through. the hair is synthetic and very fake looking. I gave it to my five year old daughter to play with. for only five bucks...you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> it got really tangled and notty after about 3 days of use i dont know if i can wash it so i just left it alone for the price i wont comlain.</li>
    <li> I love them had to order more thank you</li>
    <li> was not black more like a dark brown...also I ordered the same one from a different seller I liked it better because it was jet black and a lot longer  much better quality!! I do not recommend buying it..</li>
    <li> buying 2 is a great idea. looks real, very soft, very long just cut if you need it shorter. DONT USE HEAT ON IT! I frayed the ends and even tried different temps. Bad idea gotta buy another.</li>
    <li> Looks like real hair and feels like it to. Didn&#x27;t blend in to well but is worth getting if you can match it to your hair.</li>
    <li> The ad is wrong. This is not a full wig it&#x27;s one set of clip on. If u have thick hair might want to get three pieces. The hair tangles easy but you get what you pay for. For the price though the hair is long and I have found a way to mAke it work. I love the way it looks. Just need to take extra care if you want to make it last long.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting. I have tried many brands of hair extentions and wanted to try a much cheaper brand. For the price, the item was amazing. But it tangled quite a bit and the hair was hard to manage and almost too long. You get extremely hot too, when wearing them. The hair falls out sooooo bad too. I like them but I prefer more high end hair extentions now that I have tried this product. Hello Gorgeous hair extentions are amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these, expecting 1 not to be enough, and I was right. You absolutely NEED 2 of them. With only 1, people WILL be able to tell that you have extensions in (and you&#x27;ll look horrible). All of the hair is on a single track, by the way, which I find to be more convenient than having individual clips to place all over your head. They also arrived on time, packaged securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, without doing the following things, they won&#x27;t look as natural as mine (I posted some customer photos on this page).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If your hair isn&#x27;t dyed jet black, either dye your hair jet black, or don&#x27;t buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I blended some baby powder into the extensions to take some of the shine away. Without doing so, they&#x27;ll be VERY shiny and look like fake, Barbie doll hair. With the baby powder blended in, it takes away a majority of the shine. Just blend it in well (while avoiding tangling the extensions), so it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I cut a few inches off of the ends of the extensions (looked unnaturally long on me, unless you like the super long hair look). I also cut descending layers into them, along with a facial frame. If you don&#x27;t know how to cut hair, bring them to a stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. YouTube search &#x27;How to put on clip-on hair extensions&#x27;. If you clip them into your hair the right way, they will blend in well. If you clip them into your hair the wrong way, that will be obvious. It&#x27;s all about how much of your natural hair you separate to put under and over the extensions themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sick of spending $100 for extensions (real hair) at Sally&#x27;s every few years, because they thinned out quickly. They also didn&#x27;t include enough hair in a single package, so I&#x27;d have to buy two. Now if and when these thin out, they are extremely affordable to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have these, I prefer synthetic extensions (these) to real hair extensions. I&#x27;ve always found it gross wondering where the real hair extensions came from anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on my hair. Nobody had a clue that they were extensions when I told them. So, I highly recommend these and they are worth the effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME TIPS: You can style these on low heat. You can also use hair styling products on them. Avoid brushing them or running your fingers through them too much, because like ALL extensions, they will thin out if you do this. When you&#x27;re done wearing them, hang them up somewhere. Don&#x27;t sleep with them in, unless you plan on braiding them first. When you wake up, take the braid out and they will be especially wavy. Braiding the extensions before bed (if you absolutely need to wear them to bed) will avoid the hair from tangling in your sleep. They are a little heavy on your head (especially wearing 2), but if you wanna look fabulous, you&#x27;ll get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE Google search and YouTube search &#x27;How to take care of synthetic hair extensions&#x27; for more tips (like washing them, etc.), before leaving a bad review, because those leaving bad reviews clearly have no idea what they are doing.real hair extensions came from anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on my hair.

    <li> Just received the extensions today, I ordered two of them about 3 weeks ago. The black matches my hair perfectly and the hair is so bouncy and healthy looking! I&#x27;m in love and can&#x27;t wait to wear out. The length is perfect and hasn&#x27;t shed at all when I ran my fingers thru. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love them they are the right color and length. And I did successfully straighten them under 180° heat. I bought two because I have very thick hair and the worked perfectly for the occasional outting.</li>
    <li> Love!! They match my hair perfectly. I bought 2 as per some of the other reviews saying only 1 looks like you can tell you have extentions in, however if your hair is thin or fine with some body 1 was plenty. 2 for me was way to heavy on my head but 1 was perfect!</li>
    <li> Worked well. I got two and looked very nice.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten something very different from everyone else; my product tangled easily, the hair is very fine and knots and kinks and is impossible to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as matching hair color and texture, everyone is different. This hair is very light and flyaway, not meant to be silky and slinky. Would probably work best if it&#x27;s not combed too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other styles from this manufacturer are much silkier and slinkier and easier to brush and comb. It&#x27;s affordable enough, so you&#x27;re not out much if it doesn&#x27;t happen to work for your hair.</li>
    <li> This hair piece was so tangled and when I tried to comb it more hair would just fall out horrible never again !!</li>
    <li> i love it love it love it omg i didnt know i could look so beautiful with clip on hair piece. ....i love it loveit love it....i will buy more when it goes bad i love it love it</li>
    <li> I like the hair but it&#x27;s too long for my comfort. I wish it had been just 10 inches.</li>
    <li> I was told it would take over a month to arrive, but then it arrived only a couple weeks after purchasing so that was pretty sweet. I bought two of them and that was just enough ;-) I love the hair!!!</li>
    <li> I had to wait for 10 days for the product to arrive. It did arrive and then one of the clip in it doesn&#x27;t even work. It sheds, not a big deal. Not worth the money or wait. Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if it was not on the amazon.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wedding cause I wanted some more length but didn&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for real extensions. I got these and they looked shiny in the package, then when I opened them I noticed that they were wet. I hung them up to dry and when they dried I noticed the hair was extremely matted up and tangled and crunchy. I try to comb it our carefully and when I did alot of hair came out and all the curl came out...so I tried to curl it with a curling iron and it became completely straight. I wish I could give this negative 5 stars. Ugh!</li>
    <li> Love this wig. Worth more than what I paid</li>
    <li> CAME SHIPPED WELL AND IS VERY PRETTY, EASY TO USE, LOOKS JUST LIKE IMAGES SHOWN, BLENDS WELL. ITS VERY NICE</li>
    <li> I hated everything about this product and order. Hair was wayyyy too obvious that it was fake, pulled my hair out, worse extensions i have ever had!</li>
    <li> Perfect length and looks natural! Super cute and blends well. Apply dry shampoo so it isn&#x27;t shiny and it will be perfect :) it does tangle like synthetic hair but nothing you can&#x27;t fix. Take care of it like you would take care of a wig</li>
    <li> looks too fake. I am Dominican and my hair is very nice and kinda dry. ( very natural )  But with these extension it makes me look ridiculous. I guess is only for those girls with really really shinny oily hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an extension and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do,my hair looks longer at the back, and you can iron it too .</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair piece!!!!!would buy another one! Very Pleased!! I give this a A+ would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Very soft hair, no shedding.  Not as full as I thought it would have been, so I will be ordering more clip in pieces!</li>
    <li> The hair is great but the title says  clip on wig, so I thought it was more of a half or full wig clip on, so it turned out not being what I wanted, but great product</li>
    <li> These extensions came In within 2 weeks after ordering them. There so soft and shiny ! Definitely way better than I how I expect! Bought two packs because one would be very thin. But I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> Before I had dyed my hair a different color, my hair was naturally jet black and it matched the color of these extensions very well. I bought just one because my hair was already very long and I wanted it to be a bit thicker. The extensions have five clips going across which are easy to use. The clips hold on very well and they are still in good shape today, a year later! The hair that comes along with it is a combination of both curly and wavy. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to fall out easily which I found amazing considering the price. I would definitely suggest taking care of it more than I did because after a while, it starts to get a little tangled and kind of frizzy. I&#x27;ve never worn it outside but my sister has and she gets a lot of compliments. The only problem I really have with this product is that it&#x27;s extremely long so much so that it seems unnatural.</li>
    <li> ...I only liked it a little bit cause it wasn&#x27;t even my color...it is the nicest fake hair I&#x27;ve ever seen and it does look real. The only thing is its toooo shiny...but for the price it&#x27;s great. What you see is what you get. :)</li>
    <li> Worth the wait of shipping! Just BEAUTIFUL!!! I&#x27;m going to place another order soon. Want to have this product on hand for when its needed. Thank you</li>
    <li> Easy to put in but not as thick as I was hoping and it tangles quite easily. Nobody has noticed that it isn&#x27;t my real hair so it does blend really well. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m basically happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is literally four inches of track hair with clips on it. The hair was a tangled piece of mess.</li>
    <li> I love it ;) I&#x27;m in love with this hair I got myself two of them that&#x27;s how much I love it and the price is excellence , I can&#x27;t believe the quality of this hair for that price is like it cost hundreds of dollars because the hair looks so natural people think is my real hair even when you touch feels like human hair I&#x27;m in love with this hair.. The hair is not to shiny or looks fake the only thing I cut the hair a lil bit because it was too long for me but besides that is the best product ;) il recommended %100</li>
    <li> I love hair extensions and this one worked great...it lasted me like 6months...iv have gotten this item 3times now....it isn&#x27;t perfect....you do have to take extra good care of it... It tangle alot...but if ur patient with it it will work just fine for you...</li>
    <li> i love this, just a heads up the color of the hair is jet black, not natural black so if you do decide to get this item and want it to blend well into ur hair dont get it if ur hair isnt completely very black, also one of these clip ons will not be enough if you are planing to fill in ur whole hair, i would recommend at least getting 3of these, after receiving this item i realized it wasnt as full as it looks in the picture, so i came back and ordered 3 more. last thing, this clip in may get very tangled so if it gets to the point where you decide u want or need to comb it, start from combing on the bottom then work ur way up. enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Basically, you get what you pay for. They looked good and did just fine for my one-night event that I used them for. But after I got home and took them out, they were to the point of no return (but probably because my hair do a a braided, hairsprayed, bobby-pin&#x27;d mess post dancing for 4 hours) While in use they were pretty and soft but they can start to look messh easily, lots of finger brushing throughout the night but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I ordered 2 pieces and they were still a little thinner than my natural hair so if you have really think hair I reccomend 3. 1 is really thin. I got many compliments on my hair though. I would reccomend these for a cheap quick one-time use kind of thing.</li>
    <li> I love them, they&#x27;re a little heavy but i can take it lol. I was just expecting them to be longer (curled up they&#x27;re the same length as my hair I had to straight them so they could be longer</li>
    <li> Real nice I loved it wanna order more</li>
    <li> horrible, not even sure if it was hair more like some type of long fur that stuck together, even before i brushed it and right out the box it was tangled. not even tangles it like matted.</li>
    <li> They sucked! They were very shiny, and looked very fake. Maybe for a costume or something you aren&#x27;t going to wear daily.. but if you&#x27;re expecting them to look natural, these definitely don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this its completely changes my look. this is like 3 inches longer than my hair so it gives me length and volume. it looks and feels real, the only issue is that its not jet black more like a natural black but besides that it is great!!!</li>
    <li> It Was Good ... It Blended With My Hair Perfectly But It Was A Bit Tangled Though</li>
    <li> It holds in place quite well!  I thought that after a while it would move or fall out...NOPE!  It held GREAT!  It&#x27;s manageable and easy to style!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the service, price and quality&lt;br /&gt;you buy two and my daughter is very happy and look great</li>
    <li> Very disappointed lost curl first day and frizzed at bottom so bad. Cant wear it again. Was not at all happy.</li>
    <li> gorgeous and well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair piece overall. Easy to snap on and easy to snap off. Blends well with black dyed hair. The length is good.</li>
    <li> THIS ARE GRATE AND CHIP IF U DYE UR HAIR NIGTH BLACK ITS EXACLY THE SAME COLOR AND EVEN SHINES THE SAME&lt;br /&gt;TOTALY WHAT I WWANTED</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two months and I still haven&#x27;t recieved it. Good price but don&#x27;t know how the product is cuz I haven&#x27;t recieved it.</li>
    <li> Most of the time, I can usually order black and it will be in-between shades 1 &amp; 2.  The picture above is probably a #2, NOT the #1 that is sent to the consumer.  This piece is straight up #1 black, almost raven.  Regarding quality, I noticed stray hairs straight out of the package and was dismayed that I can&#x27;t even detangle this using a wide-toothed comb without it shedding at least 25 - 50 hairs each time. This is an inexpensive item to see what your hair *might* look like at certain lengths, but this isn&#x27;t a piece you will be wearing for years to come. Now I am stuck with 2 pitch-black hair pieces I can&#x27;t alter. Still, it isn&#x27;t the color that I am ranking 2 stars - it is the quality of the piece which merits its low marks. Invest your money in something that will last more than a few wearings.</li>
    <li> I just want to say mine looked nothing like the picture. Mine was shorter and was thinner then hell. I could of dealt with all that if most of the hair hadn&#x27;t fallen out within a week or so of me wearing it. l would definitely not buy this piece again, but hey money spent lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I gave this product two stars because the hair itself wasnt terrible, but I had three major complaints that made me want to give it zero stars!&lt;br /&gt;1) This hair was suppose to be black, but when it came it was brown #4 printed on the package. If you know extensions there is a big difference between black (#1 or #1b) and #4 brown. There was no way it would match!&lt;br /&gt;2) It is called a wig but it is just one thick track. Maybe the thickness of two tracks sold together. There wasnt enough hair to use alone and the track itself (only four clips) could not even make it to the front of my hair! The entire front of my hair had zero extensions!&lt;br /&gt;3) The shipping was WAY to long to be real!&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me looking for a quick fix for the night, keep looking! this product is not going to work as one piece.</li>
    <li> the hair was very long but very satisfied and looked almost real, I was able to straighten it as well!</li>
    <li> Great for the simple reason the hair looks awesome. The arent black they are more like a dark brown but, overall excellent! The hair came much quicker than I expected. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair extention for the price. It looks real and matches my hair perfectly! It gets tangled easily and some of the hair falls out but for the price I am very pleased! Shipping takes a while because it is from overseas but it came earlier than the expected delivery date. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of my money. I only rate this item with one star because it did not meet my expectations at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hair extensions, but knew that for a novice like me, a clip-in is the best thing. It&#x27;s goof proof, and great if you have thinning hair. I have asian straight hair. To blend my hair with the extension, I curled my own hair and then wore this. Positioned right, no one will guess it&#x27;s fake unless you tell them. I wore it for special nights out, and dared to wear it to the office for about 3 days. it put up very well. Color matched perfectly. I actually would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but...I wish it lasted longer! After about a month&#x27;s use, the hair started to tangle and no amount of special wig conditioner would help. Oh well, Great while it lasted- would buy another for the price.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with these and will order many more. I know they arent reall hair but i can brush them and recurl them on low heat or make the curl with my fingers. My hair is just barely black maybe a shade or two light and they match perfect. I cut my a little make it less noticable the difference in lenghth. i get compliments all the time. I bought similar ones at sallys for 90 dollars. you have to have the right brush to take care of these.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate this because the extensions were not 23&#x27; in long. Very thick which is good because my hair is thick also.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong color and when I told them they said they were going to send me the right ones and I NEVER got anything, not even my money back or the ones that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, they&#x27;re too short, and extremely curly (NOT THE ONES ON THE PICTURE)</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 and waited over a month for them. When my packaged arrived I only had one. It&#x27;s nice but I can&#x27;t use it with only one.</li>
    <li> yeah, it&#x27;s not real hair. it&#x27;s black but it&#x27;s ok because my hair is jet black... but this gets tangled a lot :o</li>
    <li> I choose a 3 star because it was okay. I like it all but the ends were uneven and the hair was shiny. The end clips don&#x27;t really stay in your hair but the middles do and its not that obvious. And i change my hair color to ombre so it doesn&#x27;t match it anymore. I let my friend wear them and she loves them. Also it never told me if i was able to die the hair or not. My recommendation to you is to have your hair curled when you do where them because it looks way better.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and are thinker then i thought. Just takes too long to get here :) They are exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> It looks so real,, its fast and easy to put on.  I cant wait to try other clip on hair pieces.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add volume to my hair and I must say, for the price, it&#x27;s a beautiful piece! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> received very pleased with the product a best buy if you need a quick style for a little money or if you want longer hair without the glue or thread and braids</li>
    <li> I will NOT BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN. IT WAS SHORTER THEN IN PICTURE. This really was a disappointment for me as I was expecting muuch more hair than what was given to me. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my $$</li>
    <li> These extensions are actually a lot better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;They are quite long, about 20 or so inches.&lt;br /&gt;There are five clips as described, and it covers my entire head. Very easy to use if you know how.&lt;br /&gt;They are shiny, but not the fake plastic-like shine. It has a natural shine.&lt;br /&gt;The extensions blend very well with my hair, which is short and shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;Although these extensions tangle easily, a detangler will make them smooth and silky again.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with shedding, it has been over a week and only a couple strands had fallen out (I use them daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that bothered me, however, was the color wasn&#x27;t exactly the same as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I hoped it had the brownish tint like it did in the picture, but it was jet black.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they weren&#x27;t as thick as I thought; the extensions are quite thin, but not overly thin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very voluminous hair, I recommend you buy two. If your hair is medium or thin, one should be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these extensions get a B+ to an A- range.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth my money, and I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> The worst product ever! Only gave it one star because I had to! If it didn&#x27;t make you give a star it would have been negative 5 stars! This hair never even lasted a day or an hour for that matter. It feel apart after it tangeled up in knots.</li>
    <li> I brought one to try out if it good or bot, but it turn out very awesome. It match my hair color and easy to clips on. It looks very natural. So I came back and brought another one :) I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and soft and hold the curl very well. It&#x27;s stayed perfect for the whole time I had it. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the bag hair was already falling out, which I am not happy about. I haven&#x27;t even wore it once and some of the ends look raddy. But, you get what you pay for. It is definitely not human hair but, it is not overly shiny like other clip ins I&#x27;ve seen. Also, I ended up getting a dark brown color rather than the Black. I am not really upset about that because it does match my hair color really well. It did take awhile for it to be delivered but it came a week before the expected delivery date. With that being said, I would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with the quality of this product. The hair tangled as soon as I took it out of the pack to use. I would not purchase this burly clip again, however, I would purchase this brand if it was straight.</li>
    <li> They were great. Great service, Pretty hair extensions. Shiny, but not to shiny. Just like my own hair. Lol. But But</li>
    <li> the hair is not human hair but is ok , i like and is a beautiful hair , hope buy you again</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a VERY small box, but didn&#x27;t matter, the hair was in perfect condition, I don&#x27;t think this is for many uses, but I have one special occassion coming up and for the price it is perfect!</li>
    <li> the extensions straighten,curl,and clip just fine but they are sooo thin! also,I ordered brown and they came in black!!! So now  just use them for practce</li>
    <li> I bought this as a tester to see if it would be worth buying the whole package. They are great! Soft, beautiful and thick!!!!</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I received mine in the mail today, Their very soft and shiny. Longer then i expected but i love them</li>
    <li> Its obviously not real hair but it still looks pretty real. I feel like you should buy 2 or 3 if you want it to cover your whole head but its still a very thick piece and the hair is pretty</li>
    <li> It doesnt sit it my hair or any of my friends hair well at all, it contatnly falls out. Also took a long time to ship. I have had it for a few months now and never was able to actually wear it out.</li>
    <li> i used this piece for a wedding and it did tha job.!&lt;br /&gt;just curl or straighten with meduim heat.. use hair spray (if curling).. and it stays all night.&lt;br /&gt;its worth paying the ten dollars</li>
    <li> When i got this item it was so amazing i put it on write away nice and long n wavy i got plenty of compliments on this item its easy to put on and take off jus love it i wear it everyday :) thank u n i will be buyin more</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s perfect....it is very dark and black, shiny but not an unnatural shiny.  My hair is dark brown so I need to dye my hair jet black for it to blend it perfectly but that&#x27;s not a problem for me, I&#x27;ve dyed my hair black before</li>
    <li> Yes i know it was a low price, however I feel as though I did not get what I payed for. In the photos the hair looks like it blends well, when I put it on it was VERY obvious that it was fake. Also, its so thin. It doesn&#x27;t even cover my head. I would need 2 or 3 to give the effect shown in the picture. Overall I was very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Just tried it on (unassisted), it was fairly easy though it&#x27;s going to take some getting used to getting it on by myself. I already have hair down to my waist* and wanted this product to increase thickness*, which it does quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the length is long* the extension was heavier than I expected and my hair felt pulled at the points where it clips in, though that might have been due to the fact that I can&#x27;t see the back of my hair to clip it in properly yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is sold as &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; but what I received, though very dark, was clearly NOT black. (This is the reason I only gave 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Though it can give the illusion of a BIT more length, you&#x27;ll want to already have enough natural hair length to reach  at least the last 4-5 inches of the extension to get the best results. Also the curls/waves tapered down toward the ends so it&#x27;ll be trickier to blend if your natural hair style ends bluntly or in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Extra tip: long hair tangles easily toward the ends, whether its natural or an extension and especially if it&#x27;s curly or wavy. So use caution while sitting or leaning against the backs of chairs or walls, even leaning forward will slide the hair over your shoulder and possibly cause tangles.)</li>
    <li> THEY LOOK GOOD IN MY HAIR I ACTUALLY PUT HEAT ON THEN AN STRAIGHTENED THEN AT 450 WITH MY CROC HAIR STRAIGHTENER .... VERY GOOD IVE USED ALMOST EVERY KIND OF EXTENSION REAL FAKE CLIP IN AND PROFESSIONAL THESE ARE REALLY GOOD...THEY LOOK GOOD... ITS THICK... I DID HAVE TO PUT A FEW SHORTER ONES IN FOR A LAYERED LOOK... AMAZING LOTS OF COMPLEMENTS... VERY HAPPY... THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This extension looks nothing like the picture shown.  Good advertising on their part. The clips just hurt and the color was off. I wont be spending $$ on extensions like this again.</li>
    <li> I had bought these extentions so long ago and i still have not got em its really irrritating.&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna buy extentions and get em fast dont buy these i havnt gotten mine yet and its not even worth it.</li>
    <li> i dont know how to use them yet but i hope i can figure it out soon cause i would love to wear them soon</li>
    <li> It took very long to receive the extensions. The extension was very pretty. I love the one piece, easier to place on your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is like Halloween hair. If you wear it down it gets tangled very very easily and when you go to brush it hair comes out. It isn&#x27;t all that easy to brush either. For the price I guess it is ok.</li>
    <li> For the price I was expecting something I&#x27;d have to fix and wear once. WRONG. I pulled this out and it was beautiful. Soft, silky and well sewn.  Ive worn it many times now and it blends in wonderfully with my real hair.  The color was just as stated. Ive now bought one more and single strip extensions from this seller. I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA:&lt;br /&gt;Ive now had this piece over 2 years and its still as silky and pretty as when I first put it on. I treat it just like real hair by washing and letting it air dry after every 6th wearing.</li>
    <li> Initially I was hesitant because of the price and the fact that it was synthetic but I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s so easy to put in and looks and feels very natural. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Luxiouious-ness! Not too heavy on the head and so full and natural looking. I get compliments aLL the time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because its not 100% human hair and it was not 7 clips it was only 5</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. My friends have also purchased it. It takes a little while to get but with the price, it&#x27;s totally worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This clip on has 5 clips. It&#x27;s very shiny! Will blend in very well in the dark i usually wear it when i go out to the club or somewhere fairly dark. its not too curly but consider curling your natural hair in order for it to blend well inless your hair is super short then buy 2 clips.</li>
    <li> wow i did not get my order yet but i must say they are very easy to get a hold of and that&#x27;s great!! so impressed!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this crap, it&#x27;s a waste of damn good American money!!! I waited more than a month and still haven&#x27;t got it yet !</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it its not real hair it burned when I curled it with a curling iron  and the hair falls out</li>
    <li> I ordered this beauty and it arrived on my birthday...I haven&#x27;t taken it off.It is beautiful, not only was the price within reason I am absolutely in love with it. The compliments haven&#x27;t stopped.</li>
    <li> Nice but to shiny..great piece</li>
    <li> The quality is ok. The price wasn&#x27;t bad but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in the daytime. Definitely looks fake.</li>
    <li> Honestly love them so much, They came in 11 days from the day I ordered and I am in California. My first time using hair extentions and they are working out great!</li>
    <li> My hair is already long, but it&#x27;s pretty thin and I wanted a little bit longer length. I easily clipped this hair right in and it looked natural and gave beautiful volume and a couple inches added length to my hair. Looks wonderful. I do not suggest this if you have short hair, it will not be enough hair to look natural. Also, the color is black and you know black always matches black. I love this!!!</li>
    <li> honestly i don&#x27;t even know what i was thinking buying this lol.its defiantly not made for an African American type texture of hair.I feel like if your hair is already straight and kinda curly this would totally work.It is VERY synthetic all they way so be careful when you wear it.don&#x27;t play with it too much and do have people diggin in it -_-.anywho,so yeah it&#x27;s not for my hair but im pretty sure it&#x27;s worth buying from silky type hair :)</li>
    <li> It sheds pretty bad tangle kinda bad but other then that its good I like it alot :) :) .</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these. The first one I received in just two weeks (very quick), however the second hadn&#x27;t. BUT when I emailed the seller, they mailed the second one I&#x27;d ordered. I&#x27;ve worn these extensions for a few weeks now. The clips are strong. The hair doesn&#x27;t thin out so far. They look soft and natural.</li>
    <li> I the quality of the hair is okay. It is very shiny and looks almost like real hair. To get the same volume as the picture, however, you will need to order more than one. I ordered one the first time, I ordered two more just in case. I got here early however!</li>
    <li> looked nothing like the picture</li>
    <li> It looks fake and gets tangled easy but it&#x27;s good for what you pay for it. To keep the curls, I braid my extensions and then place them in the hair net provided.</li>
    <li> So , it&#x60;s so really good but i wanna buy some diferents colors because i like to change hair color , but it´s so good!!!</li>
    <li> In the picture it looks so pretty but in real life, it sucks!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Trust me ,I bought it ,and I just put this in the corner and waste my money!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are not jet black, like a dark brown. Very thick and great for the cost. Great buy, I would do it again.</li>
    <li> Blends in with my shoulder length black hair. Only lasted for two months of daily wear then got &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> They arrived when they said they would,BUT I ordered black because I have dyed jet black hair and the extensions came in a dark brown color they are BEAUTIFUL though!i haven&#x27;t tried heat and I don&#x27;t plan to the curls are nice and big.the only thing wrong with them is the color, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s supposed to be that but maybe be careful buying them in black.everything else is great no hair falls out either.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say you get what you pay for! I liked it the first time I wore it then after that it was just a tangle rats nest. I do not reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> it knotts easily but very nice other than that</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprising. Absolutely beautiful hair. Only problem i had was the clips after wearing it for only 2 hours i started to get a headache and found out once i have pressed on to my points wear i had my extentions it would be quite sore. Other than that it is a  definate steal ! (:</li>
    <li> Sad experience .Took forever to come and it was like someone cut a piece of track off and sent it .Did not cover half of my head</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful all my friends think it&#x27;s my real hair and it looks so nice. The price was so cheap I love it.</li>
    <li> well dis it a gud item n it is really wat u c on d picture n i am realy happy wit it i lov it</li>
    <li> I paid little to nothing for these yet people think it&#x27;s my real hair all the time I wash, straighten, curl, etc. They&#x27;re great! They do tangle easily and of course some hair comes out when you brush it but for so cheap they&#x27;re amazing! I will most definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and the hair is soft and shiny. You should treat this hair with special care because it tangles so easily. Don&#x27;t flip it around too much and when it tangles just hold on to the roots and finger detangle it. When you are not wearing it you should twist it or clip it to avoid tangles. I tried curling it and it worked on low heat. On high heat I started smelling a weird smell but it did not melt. I wouldn&#x27;t curl it on high heat. The hair is down to my butt and I am  5&#x27;9, I will soon post pictures. Overall it is a good product and I probably will order this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not wearing it because the curls fell. Note that I did not wear this hair but twice between the time I bought it and the wedding. The combs on the clip had skinny teeth and it kinda pulled my hair out when I used that method. I then used bobby pins to hold it and it worked fine. The hair is just too heavy and I would just purchase something else.</li>
    <li> do not expect more for this product, I thank my money back since February made this purchase, nor the seller responds, it has the same state says Chinese port, need my 8.80 dollars, to buy another product.</li>
    <li> After a month the ends started looking frayed and frizzie had to trim it bought real hair extensions and there awesome .</li>
    <li> Not at all what I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> I loved these extensions! It is very nice and soft, as well as curly! It&#x27;s in great quality and it looks natural! I am so happy. It took a almost a month to get here, but it gets the job done doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> These are great for making hair look thicker and longer.  Easy to clip in and they do a pretty good job of staying in place without being noticed.  The hair is a bit glossy but looks fairly natural</li>
    <li> I have purchased synthetic hair previously and this was horrible  it feels dull and scratchy. not soft at all. from the second it came out of the package it was snarley and knotted on its own  I had it on for two minutes and immediately took it out. it was a really bad idea. I gently tried to comb thru the knots and it  got even worse and shed most of the hair. not only was that an issue but there were no curls, just awkward dents I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. this is going right to the garbage!</li>
    <li> After waiting almost two months to receive my clip in extension, it was the wrong color I ordered black and I received a medium brown. I am very upset with the ridiculous amount of time it took here and then to receive something that I cannot use because you can&#x27;t dye the hair without losing the curl makes me very upset.</li>
    <li> Bad experience with this product and when we try to return it, the customer service advise was, &amp;#34;will be too expensive and you have to pay for&amp;#34;. Sorry but, no good</li>
    <li> wish it was alittle thicker so for really thick hair u may to buy two...but other than that color was great and the price is great  !</li>
    <li> the product doesnt look at all like the picture. the extensions are thin, hard, and you would need about 5 of these little packets to get a full head of hair that probably would look that great.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I was ecstatic. It didn&#x27;t look fake, nobody knew it was extensions. But after a few times of wearing it, it got nappy at the bottoms. I tried to comb it, alot of hair came out, so i tried to undo tangles with my fingers, which didn&#x27;t help. But for the price I paid for it I guess it&#x27;s just as well. However, I would buy another product because it&#x27;s under 5 $ and it&#x27;s beautiful while it lasts.</li>
    <li> Very long and wavy lots of shine to it it would be obvious it was an existention but it would look great if you didn&#x27;t care about that and i only say that because of how shiny it is</li>
    <li> The product is great for the price, however after worn only twice, one of the clasps broke. Again though, great for price, feels real and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Wish I never bought this , it was so fake looked fake &amp; messed up the same day I wore it ..</li>
    <li> I like it alot, but i ordered it in black and i have dark brown hair. So i just use it occassionally.</li>
    <li> i really like it and it matched my hair i can comb it like if its my own hair... would buy again</li>
    <li> These Extensions are excellent! They&#x27;re my first ones and they are easy to apply and remove. They are a bit static-y, though i guess i shouldn&#x27;t be surprised in winter. They are fairly long and i can put them in a loose braid and it looks lovely! Also the curls were a bit Tight so i used a Hair Straightener (on low heat) to loosen them up a bit, They look even better now! (especially since my hair is strait  to begin with!)&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest these to any friends or family who are new to extensions!</li>
    <li> I must say! this is a wonderful item for the price obviously. It is not natural hair is more like a wig but its worth it. I must also say its heavy but it will do as extensions i am very glad i bought this. I recommend it if you&#x27;re planning to use it for parties only not an everyday use because im sure it wont last long. hopefully i helped. If you want real hair just spend 100+ on real hair(sallys) and yeh dont wine about what you were willing to spend. okay bye (8</li>
    <li> It took a long time to get it, but so worth it! Beautiful piece! I am in my forties and have thyroid issues which make my hair thin and brittle. I am getting married in a few months and wanted to have better than ordinary hair for the pictures and the day. This fits the bill, in fact, I am purchasing a couple more today. Outstanding high quality product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star only because my hair is shorter than this piece and when i clip it in you can tell the length difference, i have to clip it about eyebrow height just to look like it&#x27;s natural and then it defeats the purpose of lengthening my hair but it does add beautiful volume and curl</li>
    <li> i really like the product, but just take a little big long to get the shipment, i wish i can select the faster shipment method.</li>
    <li> I received my clip on extensions a few weeks ahead of schedule and I can say try h as t I as m very pleased. I would definitely recommend these clip ons!! Thank you</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I thought it was a wig. BUT ITS NOT A WIG!  Its an extention. Its AMAZZZIING! I seriously love it. Sadly it only came with only one. it wasnt enough so I ordered more, now I have to wait for the rest. I&#x27;m so excited to see how my hair is going to turn out!!!(: I also got it earlier than what I thought so that made me sooo happy. Buy some youll seriously love it.</li>
    <li> The clips were not sown in when i got them. the hair is already falling out in chuncks and i have only worn them twice. I liked the idea of them working but i pretty much wasted my money</li>
    <li> hair is pretty, but one of the clips boke after the first use. I am buying a new clip and sewing in myself. but not everyone would know how to so rate 2 stars. Easily tangles i cannot be brushing out my weave every hour- at school, at work, at dinner..  its obnoxious but comes with the territory i guess? not all of my extensions tangle like this. anyway its cute i get compliments.</li>
    <li> I loved the curls. What you see is what you get! So gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with this product I immediately put it on and went out.&lt;br /&gt;It looks and feels so real! If you&#x27;re wondering if you should get it, I&#x27;d recommend you do.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Extentions are actually pretty great. Very long so can cut any length.  Shiny.  And had clip ons already.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair extension, which is close to my hair color(Asian and wavy).&lt;br /&gt;Almost like human hair. Package arrived on  time. Will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived in a little over a week. Fast! I prefer this fake hair over cheap real hair extensions. Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CAN brush this fake hair- it will remove some of the curl and it might knot at first. Would not recommend brushing more than once per day, and brush prior to putting in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep brushing until all knots are out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some shine spray for your natural hair, as these extensions have a little bit of a glossy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a tiny bit of water on your hands to tame frizz. Do not brush at the sign of slight frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can straighten these on medium low setting .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store in a ziplock plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 of these clip ins and only received one. Thought about contacting the seller, but the quality of hair isn&#x27;t worth the effort. It&#x27;s essentially Barbie hair. And no, dry shampoo didn&#x27;t take away any of the synthetic shine like other customers have mentioned. I purchased this hoping to be able to use it on certain occasions, but the only thing it be good for is a costume.</li>
    <li> As with most synthetic hairpieces, more care is required to make sure it looks natural. My hair is naturally jet black with some grays and this blends in wonderfully. You can opt to blend in some baby powder if it looks too shiny when you&#x27;ve got it clipped in, though. I like the softness of the hair and the movement. You&#x27;ll probably want to either cut in some layers or take it to a stylist so the way it falls looks natural. Stoked with what I got for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extension is a bit on the thin side, so if you&#x27;re looking for volume, I&#x27;d suggest buying two.</li>
    <li> excelnte article, I&#x27;m a little late but what else was excellent, I recommend it</li>
    <li> It feels silky and good for the price you pay, i have not yet used any heating tools on it but its not to curly for it goes with thin straight hair. i will be purchasing more in the future, if you have thick hair purchase 2.</li>
    <li> Okay item....but the curls didnt last long and the sewing of the hair needs to be tighter. At the end once its properly snapped on it looks great!</li>
    <li> The hair got tangled fast. It got ruff on da end to quick I just did not like  da hair! !!!!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The shipping was two weeks earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;2. These extensions are really long and silky and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;3. Can easily blend, but I recommend buying another (like I did, its waiting arrival) if you have multiple layers in your hair like I do. Then the extensions just stick out like a sore thumb. Since its only one long extension. ( I don&#x27;t read xD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I first used, the clips are poorly secured and one fell off the netting. I fixed it with a needle and thread and now its perfectly great. So no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;And 2. They were very easily tangled. But I can&#x27;t judge them just right out the package. So I washed them, and now I could actually run a paddle brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars. I would reccommend to few people but not really Idk xD</li>
    <li> I ordered 2. I am surprised at how much better these are than I was expecting! Shipping took 3 weeks but I knew that when I ordered. They are long, &amp; they are thick! They are much thicker than a set I paid $85 for at a salon, &amp; thicker than a set my friend paid $60 for at a beauty supply store. The black is black, it Isn&#x27;t a very dark brown. They are shiny, but not the fake looking, scary, overly shiny that I&#x27;ve seen before. I suggest getting 2, and starting them on the sides by the temple, they will overlap in the back, but it&#x27;s better than just wearing one on the back of the head because they are not wide enough to wrap around to the front. I will definitely be ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> It is not the same color as in the picture. It also feels very fake and cheap and also looks it. This is not what I expected, I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
    <li> love them they are full thick does not tangle up and looks great on me perfect for me while my hair grows out very happy with the quality. I SEEN SOME BAD REVIEWS ON HERE ABOUT THEM AND WAS SCARED THOUGH PURCHASE TWO OF THEM AND THEY BOTH ARE GREAT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE I AM SHOCK</li>
    <li> This extention got to my house real quick and I wore it on a night out. Looked great and felt real soft</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive them... until they actually came. They came faster than expected but that was about the only good thing about them. They were not the color I expected, they were a lot thinner than expected, and the hair fell out as soon as I pulled them out. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> Considering that it is synthetic, I wasn&#x27;t expecting for it to be Remy, Indian, or any other high quality human hair. It matched my hair pretty well, but was no where near as long as advertised. And it isn&#x27;t curly, it is more of a very loose wave, which was okay.</li>
    <li> Took way to long longer than,date told. I ordered 3 and I&#x27;m still waiting for the last pair. I did although cut it into pieces to fit my head better. the hair is soft but,it starts to fall out and you can&#x27;t really brush it. it gets frizzy and you can&#x27;t add heat to,it. it&#x27;s good if you want to braid,your hair or put it,up something like that. not good for down styles. you can&#x27;t really part the hair either. overall 1 star for time quality etc. not too bad for price though, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It was actually better than i anticipated. Takes a while to receive but all worth it! Word of advice, if you have thick hair like me, i would suggest buying more than one. I will absolutely be buying more of these!!!</li>
    <li> This hair is really good and feel soft and light while it still maintains such a full and bouncy look</li>
    <li> The picture of the product is exact but if you want fullness then,  I would recommend two hair pieces and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> It looks very natural, and im really happy with this product it looks very good and natural i love it i would like get one of those but straight extensions</li>
    <li> It was sort of a more dark brown color but it matches my hair perfectly. It came within less than a week, which I was not expecting, so that made me very happy. It was hard to put in because I didn&#x27;t know how to and my hair is buzz-short, but once it gets longer and I learn how to put it in I&#x27;m sure it will look great! I would recommend this to anyone with brown shoulder length hair</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how nice they were for the price I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price. Looks exactly as the picture. Very soft, somewhere in between thick and thin. If you want thick extensions, buy two. Completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Takes long to recieve but nice hair cool hair diny knis if its real ir not though havebt curled yet</li>
    <li> Im happy with your service because It was sent on the date as informed by. Im satisfied with the item, it was in great condition and better then what I would have found in any near by wig store. Thanks</li>
    <li> Its long and nice color. It does get tangled real fast. I put hair oil in it to stop it from happening so quickly. It was worth the low price I paid for it. I teased my hair and then clipped it to the teased part for extra support. Glad I orderd it.</li>
    <li> Decent extention. Not as thick as in picture but still nice. It&#x27;s good for the price so why not (:</li>
    <li> OK i just got my extensions and their soft and beautiful but i did have a huge problem with the shedding just two strokes and a chunk of the hair came out which was a big disappointment but soft to the touch doesn&#x27;t cover my whole head like i saw on the other reviews. the length was like 19inches or so delivery before the due date so that&#x27;s a plus well yea this is my review on the extensions.</li>
    <li> loved it the textor looks like real hair. the only thing is that it is brown and not black. maybe just an error. but i stil kept it because its so beautiful. I just spray it black</li>
    <li> looks too much like doll hair. it shines to much. but it&#x27;s still wearable. Took a little longer to get here to me. But it&#x27;s only good  for a one time wear. Hair on it falls out so bad. I&#x27;m constanly having to brush all the hair off my legs and shirt because the extensions keep shedding./</li>
    <li> I use this piece for a messy bun. The black color matches my dyed jet black hair color. I was very happy with the amount of hair and the security of the 5 clips. I have long afro-american mixed grade hair.  When my hair is permed, flat ironed &amp; has oil sheen.... this hair piece is a close match to my own hair.  I install the hair upside down to achieve a high pony tail then create a large messy bun.  Because my hair is already long (but thin at the ends) ppl don&#x27;t know I have this in.  I haven&#x27;t used in the normal way with the hair flowing down my back, just as a super fly messy bun. I gave my review 4 stars because it did start to shed within minutes of brushing out to use for the 1st time. For the price, the heaviness of the hair, lenth and security of the clips....this is a really great buy!</li>
    <li> Terrible, need more info on them before you sell them people. And also those extensions shed like crazy, weren&#x27;t very good for cutting. Just terrible all around.</li>
    <li> I bought these hair extensions for my teenage daughter and she liked them very much. She has straight black hair and these gave her the option of changing it up. Quite happy.</li>
    <li> Looks really fake I: It&#x27;s far too shiny, it just didn&#x27;t match up well. Darker than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Not bad for $3+, but not great either. I ordered two based on previous reviews and it was thick enough. Great color. After only 2 wears however, no heat or product and only for a few hours (maybe 4 - 5 hrs at a time) the curls got very tangled and look less fresh after brushing out the tangles. These are fine if you just plan to wear them a few times but for long term use save your money</li>
    <li> the extentions were great but after  a while they notted up and got really bad and they dont even look good at all anymore</li>
    <li> I did not like the hair they were too heavy and felt like fake hair. I am not happy with this product and won&#x27;t order them ever again.</li>
    <li> i hate it horrible they don&#x27;t allow you to return it</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift she&#x27;s very excited</li>
    <li> First off the extensions do not look like what the picture shows! They came packed in a tiny box and the curls are tight not loose, looks like fake Barbie hair; I should have known they would look this way considering they aren&#x27;t human hair and were only 10 bucks, can not say I&#x27;m too happy about them, most likely won&#x27;t use the unless I need another piece in my hair when curling my other extensions. I suggest buying two pieces that way they are easier to blend with you hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality hair. Easy to clip in. Remains in place. Length and amount of curl exactly what I expected. But the hair was too shiny, unnatural looking for my hair, I can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> Not Real But Fake! There good fake extensions. First and only extensions I have ever owned. These ones are really long! You CAN STRAIGHTEN them but use temperature 15 or lower!!! ALWAYS TEST OUT OF THE END STRAND FIRST!!!! There SUPER THICK! I say 100% Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> No, didn&#x27;t like it.  The color is VERY black. My hair is pretty dark, but still doenst match. Fine.... its says in the description it&#x27;s black, but what I really didnt like is how much hair it is. Its not hair enought... it looks just weird when you use it... you can totaly tell it&#x27;s fake. Doubt it I&#x27;ll ever really use it. Might return it.</li>
    <li> It is one that you can wear everyday! If it gets to shedding too much you can always buy another one at this great price!!! But so far that has not been an issue. It has just enough wave and curl when you are not wanting that much! Its really a pretty extension! Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try an extension for the first time! And its not a heavy piece!</li>
    <li> I really love this product - I ordered 4 so I could work them into my hair and cut them different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;They are lovely and a rich dark BLACK - look great and natural</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around a year, and this still holds up fine. It it very shiny, but so is my hair, so it blends pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;After a good bit of wear it is frizzy and sheds a lot. I just comb it out with a wide tooth comb and wear in it a side braid. I feel that it still looks fake, but everyone always thinks that my hair magically grew out within like a month of seeing them when I wear this lmao.</li>
    <li> Good for the price although is definitely not real hair... it is very shiny and dark but I still think is a good for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tok a long time to be deliver</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing. They look just like real hair, even though im pretty sure they&#x27;re synthetic so I don&#x27;t recommend uaing heat on them. They do not shed nor do they tangle easily. I cannot believe I got such a great product for such a cheap price. It took forever for them to arrive but trust me, so worth it. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying these, do it before someone else does! These are amazing!</li>
    <li> the first time i wore it it was awesome. The second time a clip broke off. the third time was an embaressment.</li>
    <li> i like this extension set up! it looks real and the color blends with  mine. there were a few things that im not fond of though..&lt;br /&gt;they tangle pretty easily, the clips are sewn in that well and some of the hair fell out a couple days after i opened it. overall though i like it!</li>
    <li> What a waste of $$  regret I bought this it looks so cheap I would not recommend this at all</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. The clip came off one of these already!!!Gonna have to buy more expensive extensions I guess.</li>
    <li> I just got them in the mail today, oh my goodness it&#x27;s so awesome!!! They&#x27;re so soft and silky, they look legitimate. Definitely my favorite buy in a long long time. I highly recommend them to everyone and anyone considering getting extensions. I&#x27;ve been wearing them for years now, and I must say these are my favorite so far. Other ones i&#x27;ve bought from different stores were very cheap feeling. But THESE these are wonderful! :D&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally worth investing in these. AND the clips help out a lot as well, it keeps them very secure on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love it!!! :)</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for the price. Its synthetic and retains the shape as long as you take care of it. just a little shinny but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. It really needs to be trimmed a little to blend it with your natural hair but it&#x27;s beautiful shiny and if you have black hair it&#x27;s so perfect.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing for the price, to be honest I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to look so real and as soon as I opened the package I loved in the conditions it came, I&#x27;m In love with these hair extensions you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I received my hair today, and it was awful, pieces were falling out literally as soon as I pulled it out of the bag, the color was NOT black it was a dark brown! The hair was very tangled and did NOT look like it did in the photo at all, I even ordered 3 and they still looked horrible, will not be purchasing from this misrepresenting seller again!</li>
    <li> Good review for this product.  It really was dark brown, which is an issue i have faced in the past.</li>
