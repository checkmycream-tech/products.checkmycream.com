      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice item, I needed this to make a homemade pain relief cream.</li>
      <li>but to each his own.</li>
      <li>It is good for so many things.</li>
      <li>Smells so nice.</li>
      <li>I use it in making my own tooth powder</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really strong!</li>
      <li>- 100% fix that needs reapplication every 6 hours or so- and NOT long term solution but superb for days / weeks remedy.</li>
      <li>And to top it all off, it did nothing for my toothache.</li>
      <li>but I need more, at times.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a different brand that has been wonderful.</li>
      <li>(I love the smell, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me).</li>
      <li>Of course, I still had to go through antibiotics and a dentist appointment, but clove oil brought some relief until I was able to go to the dentist.</li>
      <li>Dabbed some on a q-tip and applied to the offending tooth and along the gum line and pain went away quicker and better than the ibuprofen.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I kept creating more of the clove oil mixture and adding it to the bowl until the fish were still and sedated, and then I overdosed the fish with more mixture to make sure that they would die.</li>
      <li>Buy this stuff :)</li>
      <li>That way the clove oil doesn&#x27;t get crossed over into your healthy tank.))  </li>
      <li>Try to look at your fish&#x27;s gills to make sure they are not breathing.</li>
      <li>IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE TREATMENT TO ELIMINATE THE PAIN.</li>
      <li>If I need it again, I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more.</li>
      <li>We are using ours in a diffuser and its better than any candle we have ever burned.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but based on research and reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will do the job it should.</li>
      <li>Bought for tooth aches, works much better than over the counter products like Orajel.</li>
      <li>It offers great</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The Doctor gave me an antibiotic and STRONG pain meds.  </li>
      <li>It is also a very powerful anti oxidant and infection fighter but do not use this as oral drops.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this would ruin whatever you were using it in.</li>
      <li>I use all the special toothpastes, etc.</li>
      <li>and I finally got a good nights sleep.</li>
      <li>It would be good to use for mild pain, not major, like i had myself</li>
      <li>I was happy when this shipped so fast and there was plenty to make several batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>and it helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>Genuine oil, much useful at right time...</li>
      <li>a few drops was all that was needed for the pain to be gone, great product...</li>
      <li>Once anesthetized ethanol is added to the water (grain alcohol or vodka) and the fish calmly slips away.  </li>
      <li>The cost is worth it for some comfort in your toothaches.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it for the pain to be gone..</li>
      <li>Overall this is a fantastic product that I will be buying more off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
      <li>It works great, but make sure to only use a COUPLE OF DROPS on a cotton swab or cotton ball, and be careful to wash your hands after using.</li>
      <li>put a couple of drops in your vacuum bags for a nice smell.</li>
      <li>A few drops added to the recipe makes about 7oz of toothpaste and is very effective.</li>
      <li>Other wise the pain is gone.</li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t get in to the dentist right away.</li>
      <li>For those who usually/only experience pain at night and end up tossing and turning all night because of it - put this on your teeth/gums right before you go to bed</li>
      <li>That tells you right there that this stuff isn&#x27;t diluted at all.</li>
      <li>For those who usually/only experience pain at night and end up tossing and turning all night because of it - put this on your teeth/gums right before you go to bed</li>
      <li>It is very pure.  </li>
      <li>Remember, after the fish are lying still at the bottom of the bowl, you must be sure to add even MORE clove oil/water mixture, so that you know the fish are really dead from the overdose, and won&#x27;t wake up.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping with the weekend</li>
      <li>Smells rough, but amazing.</li>
      <li>He spent all kind of money at the drug store on stuff that didn&#x27;t help in the slightest.  </li>
      <li>At least this is what i experienced.</li>
      <li>In this case, in many cases of different uses, it is surperior of any we have purchased.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s exactly what happened:  </li>
      <li>However, when a toothache arose, I was willing to try anything.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Clove Bud Essential Oil has many uses.</li>
      <li>My fish were sent to fishy heaven peacefully.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I was worried that this was the wrong type of clove oil, but this stuff worked beautifully!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hubby didn&#x27;t believe me that this oil could help with a bad toothache till he got to the dentist.  He spent all kind of money at the drug store on stuff that didn&#x27;t help in the slightest.  He was amazed.  Worked really well but being 100% pure clove oil, you can smell it a mile away for a while</li>
    <li> Had a severe toothache and this took the pain away!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My girlfriend and I have severe tooth pain. When we apply to the area of pain, it&#x27;s gone almost instantly and lasts longer than the ambesol type products. The only down side is it&#x27;s awful tasting but it&#x27;s well worth it for the pain to be gone..</li>
    <li> I recently had an Oscar (a large tropical aquarium fish) that sustained internal injuries from which it would not recover.  Rather than let it continue to suffer, I decided that euthanasia was in order.  Research on the web indicated that fish could be easily anesthetized with a weak suspension of clove oil in water.  This makes sense as clove oil is a long-time home remedy for toothache pain.  Once anesthetized ethanol is added to the water (grain alcohol or vodka) and the fish calmly slips away.  That&#x27;s exactly what happened:  no struggling, no signs of distress, no more suffering.  I recommend this product should you ever find yourself in a similar situation.</li>
    <li> Havnt tried yet heard good things tho.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this was the wrong type of clove oil, but this stuff worked beautifully! My fish were sent to fishy heaven peacefully. This is great if you don&#x27;t have the stomach to smash your fish with a hammer or cut off it&#x27;s head. I know I could never do that!  I had 2 very sick neon tetra that I thought should be euthanized to put them out of their pain and save them from their slow deaths. I put some tank water into a glass bowl, and then added the sick fish to the bowl. Then I took a small container with a lid and added some tank water to it, as well as a few drops of the clove oil, and I shook it up until the mixture looked cloudy white. I added this mixture to the bowl with the sick fish to calm them down and sedate them. I kept creating more of the clove oil mixture and adding it to the bowl until the fish were still and sedated, and then I overdosed the fish with more mixture to make sure that they would die. Remember, after the fish are lying still at the bottom of the bowl, you must be sure to add even MORE clove oil/water mixture, so that you know the fish are really dead from the overdose, and won&#x27;t wake up. ((Note: Don&#x27;t dip your small mixing container into your healthy aquarium. If you need more water to make more clove oil mixtures, just scoop it from the bowl that your sick fish are already in. That way the clove oil doesn&#x27;t get crossed over into your healthy tank.))  Try to look at your fish&#x27;s gills to make sure they are not breathing. You may want to let them sit in the bowl for an hour to be extra sure they&#x27;re dead. Remember, start off slowly with the clove oil to gently sedate them, but once you&#x27;re ready to put them down completely, do not be stingy with the oil! I had no problems with this particular oil, and I still have a LOT left over!</li>
    <li> The description says this is supposed to smell like actual cloves, but this stuff has obviously gone bad. There is a very small hint of cloves, but that is definitely overpowered by a very strong, awful &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; smell. It&#x27;s seriously enough to turn your stomach. I&#x27;m pretty sure this would ruin whatever you were using it in. I was hoping to use this with cinnamon bark and orange essential oils for some Christmas products, but I believe I&#x27;ll leave the clove bud out until I get some more that actually smells like cloves. The cinnamon and orange oils that I got in the same shipment smelled wonderful though, and the shipping and packaging were great!</li>
    <li> It helped with a toothache. it really helped the pain and I finally got a good nights sleep. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I felt other products that are over the counter to be far better. I needed a root canal and this didn&#x27;t t help me. I used&lt;br /&gt;Anbesol, extra strength and it helped tremendously. I tossed this stuff in the trash. It was almost useless after five min.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Was looking for the purest form I could get for my needs and this was it.</li>
    <li> Got this for tooth pain from an exploded wisdom tooth until I can get to a dentist. It works great, but make sure to only use a COUPLE OF DROPS on a cotton swab or cotton ball, and be careful to wash your hands after using. If you have a paper cut on your hand (or an open cut anywhere you apply it), use gloves or don&#x27;t use this. It is undiluted, and it WILL HURT if you aren&#x27;t careful. It stings a little at first, but then it numbs the spot quite well. I find that two drops from this bottle on the tip of a cotton swab works great for spot-on numbing.</li>
    <li> Smells great ! Very strong so be careful how you use it. We are using ours in a diffuser and its better than any candle we have ever burned.</li>
    <li> oil is so weak you can hardly smell it right against your nose.&lt;br /&gt;would not order this oil again ever</li>
    <li> I have suffered from tooth pain for month, but with clove oil the pain gone.</li>
    <li> What else can I say? I loved this when I had an abscess tooth. I now keep it in our emergency box.</li>
    <li> One of the best clove oil ! The taste is great and not overpowering !</li>
    <li> As far as I know, clove oil has pain-killing and antimicrobial (antibiotic) properties, because for the toothache I had for which NOTHING else seemed to work, clove oil worked. It was definitely an abscess, and the swelling went down and the pain went away after several applications of clove oil. Of course, I still had to go through antibiotics and a dentist appointment, but clove oil brought some relief until I was able to go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who swears by all things natural for pain relief.  He uses this for nagging toothache, said it worked great.  I thought the smell was foul and wouldn&#x27;t have used it on my dog..but to each his own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works like a charm to ease tooth pain. Easy to use. The product is exactly as described. I appreciate the careful packaging and delivery of product was super  fast. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Really works for tooth pain, dilute 5-6 drops to an ounce of water. Can gargle with for sore throat too.</li>
    <li> Clove is an evergreen tree, which produces a flower bud that has numerous medicinal properties.&lt;br /&gt;Clove Bud Essential Oil has many uses. We use it a lot as an antiseptic. It is great for toothaches. It is my beauty secret when it comes to puffy eyes--I add a single drop to my eye cream and use sparingly. It offers great relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clove bud essential oil has a warm, spicy, woody, with a slightly fruity top note smell.</li>
    <li> I gave it to a relative who had terrible tootache and she kept it cause it was helping so well. I got myself another bottle of the same one. I use it in making my own tooth powder</li>
    <li> My daughter had all her wisdom teeth pulled and this was the only thing that have her any relief.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T CARE FOR THE SMELL OR TASTE. BUT, THAT&#x27;S NOT WHY I BOUGHT IT. I HAVE TWO PLACES IN MY MOUTH WERE IT HAS EFFECTIVELY KILLED THE PAIN. I DON&#x27;T HAVE DENTAL INSURANCE AND LIVE ON DISABILITY INCOME SO I CAN&#x27;T AFFORD TO RUN TO THE DENTIST.&lt;br /&gt;YES, IT TASTE BITTER AND IT SMELLS. I APPLY IT AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH. IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE TREATMENT TO ELIMINATE THE PAIN. I NOW CAN CHEW IN THE AREAS TREATED AND HOT OR COLD DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME.&lt;br /&gt;MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE SMALL AMOUNT THAT COMES WITH EACH PURCHASE. IF IT CAME BY THE GALLON I WOULD BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews before ordering, and was informed that it didn&#x27;t smell or taste great, but I was not prepared. The smell alone started to gag me. The taste..terrible. Ambesol doesn&#x27;t taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. This stuff is nasty! And to top it all off, it did nothing for my toothache.</li>
    <li> This came rancid. The smell was so terrible it made me gag and my husband had the same response when he smelled it. I was pretty disappointed and returned it to amazon without any hassles. I purchased a different brand that has been wonderful.</li>
    <li> Before I had my wisdom teeth removed, one was impacted and every few month it would get inflamed and I would be in so much pain. I applied this with a q-tip and this worked ten times better then taking advil every few hours.</li>
    <li> The way I use it is apply with a Q-Tip for 30-60 seconds. You can spit out the excess fluid or swallow it. I swallow it because psychologically I think it may have beneficial effects. It probably  doesn&#x27;t. It stings when applied, but not in a bad way. It doesn&#x27;t add any pain to your tooth pain. After about a minute or two you feel this awesome relief and you can feel it working on the nerve pain of your tooth. The taste stays. It&#x27;s cloves. I like it. This stuff works 7,000 times better than Orajel or other OTC meds. This should be a staple for dental pain relief. I&#x27;m going to buy more. To aid in the application of the stuff I rid my mouth of excess saliva before applying. I feel it works better if your mouth is dry when applying. Good luck. Buy this stuff :)</li>
    <li> This was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Originally bought it for toothache.&lt;br /&gt;Used it for cold sores in the early stage and the tingling stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Also used it for mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Perfect when you have a toothache and you can&#x27;t get in to the dentist right away. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Recently cracked a molar and was waiting to see the endodontist so I tried this instead of my ibuprofen standy. Dabbed some on a q-tip and applied to the offending tooth and along the gum line and pain went away quicker and better than the ibuprofen.</li>
    <li> I no longer have toothache. I apply two drops of oil onto the tip of my finger and apply directly onto the sore area in my mouth. Well within a couple of minutes the pain fades away. It taste very bad, keep that in mind, but worth having.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very sensitive.  I hate it.  I use all the special toothpastes, etc. but I need more, at times.  I used this and it worked well.  BUT, it tastes of cloves, of course.  If you dislike cloves you won&#x27;t like this.  I use a cotton tip to put it on my gums and let it &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; before closing my mouth.  That way the taste is much less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Bought for tooth aches, works much better than over the counter products like Orajel. Has a horrible taste, but takes the pain right away.</li>
    <li> good price,potent product,fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice item, I needed this to make a homemade pain relief cream. I was giving them as gifts for Christmas. I was happy when this shipped so fast and there was plenty to make several batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author:Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> My husband developed a toothache--of course on a Friday night!  He used the clove oil to get him through the weekend.  He  claims that it helped.  Not a cure for a toothache, but definitely helps until you get to a dentist.</li>
    <li> Put a couple drops on a Q tip and set it on the sore tooth then bit down to hold it in place. Worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> 100% essential oil, lived up to it&#x27;s name. I used it as a spray for dust mites, by mixing it with water and spraying it on bed-sheets. Just whatever you use it for, don&#x27;t use too much. It&#x27;s really strong!</li>
    <li> Great for toothaches!</li>
    <li> I needed oil of clove for tooth ache relief. This brand did not disappoint. I found it to be superior to other brands I&#x27;d previously purchased. I will be checking their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;CD Smith-Schoen</li>
    <li> It is very pure.  It is good for so many things. You might say because only 10ml, do not use too much. In this case, in many cases of different uses, it is surperior of any we have purchased. Use sparingly on amount and you still get same results.  Will order again</li>
    <li> It helped somewhat with my tooth pain, but holy crud, the taste is HORRIBLE! It would be good to use for mild pain, not major, like i had myself</li>
    <li> This is a great product for tooth aches , Grandma was right , only don&#x27;t use for a long period of time it will make the gums around your teeth a bit raw. Other wise the pain is gone.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; for your medicine cabinet.  Smells wonderful and works great for dental pain.  This will always be in our medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> Genuine oil, much useful at right time...thanks to shipper...A++. I had severe tooth pain because of cavity, my tooth affected by cavity and its loosen. I can&#x27;t bear the pain and applied oragel and tried some other stuff, nothing use and all of temporary cured. But this clove oil I applied for only two days using with ear buds and its help a lot.</li>
    <li> Best toothache relief ever :)</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for tooth aches, and it is a natural oragel! The first time I mixed in a few drops with some coconut oil and used it and the effect was mild (would be good for kids). The next time, I just tipped the bottle over onto my finger, and dabbed it on my gums and around the tooth straight. It was instant relief. It has the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feel, like you are eating strong cinnamon, and the taste is not the greatest, but it works!!!</li>
    <li> Great after having wisdom teeth pulled! Soothed the pain after having impacted wisdom teeth pulled. I Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have abscesses on my gums because I&#x27;m too chicken to go to the dentist. The Doctor gave me an antibiotic and STRONG pain meds.  They just made me loopy but the pain was still there. My miracle Clove Bud Essential Oil arrived today. I put it on my gums and teeth...ZAPPO, the pain left immediately. It stung like a bee when I put it on, but then instant relief.  Now, dang it, I have to go to the dentist as soon as I&#x27;ve taken all the antibiotic and the infection is gone.  If you need help while you wait to see the dentist, take this. Just a friendly word of advise, keep those dentist visits and avoid all the grief.</li>
    <li> Needed something for a tooth ache &amp; read numerous reviews that clove oil would work.  Although my pain had almost cleared up by the time I received it, I tried it and was impressed.  If I need it again, I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but based on research and reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will do the job it should.</li>
    <li> If you use this product consistently through at least one full day, you&#x27;ll start to experience tooth ache pain relief.  It does relieve the pain as soon as you apply it, but it takes multiple applications over time for it to really start neutralizing the bacterial activity that is causing the tooth pain to begin with. At least this is what i experienced. It will make your mouth water profusely and can even give you an unbearable burning sensation at times.  But if you have the kind of excruciating tooth pain that i was experiencing, you&#x27;ll understand what i mean when i say this burning sensation almost feels good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend swallowing any of this stuff, keep spitting it out if it&#x27;s making your mouth fill up with saliva. My tooth ache was completely gone only 2 days after using this oil and stayed gone until i could make it to the dentist almost 3 weeks later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a bit skeptical about this but heard so much about it for toothaches. However, when a toothache arose, I was willing to try anything. The pain went away instantly! This stuff is amazing. Smells rough, but amazing.</li>
    <li> Along with Redmond Clay.  It tastes great and works well as a numbing agent for toothaches.  A few drops added to the recipe makes about 7oz of toothpaste and is very effective.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to have on hand as an emergency toothache treatment until I can get to the dentist!</li>
    <li> Clove Bud Essential Bud, works great, no more pain in my tooth....a few drops was all that was needed for the pain to be gone, great product...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this clove oil.  I have a type of neuralgia that just happens manifest pain in my teeth and this clove oil saves my life from such debilitating pain.  Pain relievers, narcotics and any other type of pill for pain does not work at all.  But this clove oil gives me the relief I need to get through these attacks!  The tiniest bit along the gum line works perfectly!  If you suffer from any dental pain or neuralgia that manifests pain in your teeth, you must try this product!  Thank-you plant therapy!</li>
    <li> Smells so nice. I bought this as a way to humanely euthanize a fish I had. ( It was very sick and I just couldn&#x27;t see it suffer like that) I had almost the whole bottle left afterwards, and have used it to add to a natural spray to deter dust mites, I added to a simmering crock pot with cinnamon, and orange oils to sent the house. Clove oil is supposed to help with tooth ache pain ~ you should only use a dab, and you should avoid using it for prolonged periods—in other words, it&#x27;s no substitute for seeing a dentist. A 2006 study published in The Journal of Dentistry where researchers conducted a blind study with a clove gel, topical benzocaine, and a placebo. Long story short, the researchers found participants who got the clove gel fared just as well as those who got benzocaine. I am sure there are lots of other uses. put a couple of drops in your vacuum bags for a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Terrible, just terrible. It was horribly rancid. Many others have complained about this as well from the reviews so it&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s an issue they are ignoring or not dealing with.</li>
    <li> Great value! Product was packaged well and delivered quickly. I bought it to use in a fragrance diffuser and for some craft projects.</li>
    <li> First off, kudos to the seller, Plant Therapy Essential Oils, for shipping this out so quickly. I ordered it on Thursday and received it today (Monday). Very fast shipping with the weekend included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some toothache issues and from time to time (especially the night time). I get an uncomfortable pain in my mouth that causes me to toss and turn in frustration all night. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get to a dentist right away, so I needed some sort of solution to help cope. Unfortunately, it seems Tylenol/etc don&#x27;t really help with that kind of pain, at least not to a somewhat comforting level. Upon doing research online, I found out that clove oil is great for toothaches. Although it may be a little pricey, I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item today. It comes in a small 1/3 fl. oz (10 ml) bottle. At first glance, I thought, &amp;#34;This is not going to last long&amp;#34;. However, upon opening it, there is a drip cap that allows you to control the number of drops of clove oil to let out. Be aware that this strongly smells like cloves (like your grandmother&#x27;s potpourri - to be expected), so if you can&#x27;t stand the smell of cloves, you&#x27;re going to have issues with this (I love the smell, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me). Since this is undiluted, what I did was take a q-tip, put 2 drops of clove oil on it, then a few drops of water over that. I put it on the toothache and it has helped tremendously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, as getting it on your gums can cause a slight burning sensation, but it quickly goes away after a minute or so. I also was careful to avoid my tongue, as I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers share their disgust with the taste. If you are desperate, like I was in regards to toothaches, I definitely recommend you give this a try. Trust me, I know the pain you&#x27;re going through and it&#x27;s not fun. The cost is worth it for some comfort in your toothaches. Good luck and may you have some comfort soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: October 6th, 2015&lt;br /&gt;7 months ago I ordered this product and it was the best thing I found to help cope with my tooth pain at the time. I still have half a bottle of this stuff, as a little bit goes a long way. I haven&#x27;t had to use it lately, but when I did, it helped calm my pain down to a much more bearable (almost non-existent) level. For those who usually/only experience pain at night and end up tossing and turning all night because of it - put this on your teeth/gums right before you go to bed so you can minimize the pain and maximize your sleep. Hope this review and update helps those who are looking into ways to help calm down raging teeth and gum pain.this product and it was the best thing I found to help cope with my tooth pain at the time.

    <li> This clove bud oil improved the pressure and pain of an earache I recently had. I definitely recommend it for ailments.</li>
    <li> I had a filling fall out (large one from molar in the back) -the pain was severe and radiated throughout my entire upper and lower jawline on that side. Tried ibuprofen, aspirin, topical otc remedies, and could not suppress the pain. As soon as I applied this using q-tip and applying directly on tooth and where filling had been the pain disappeared inside 15 seconds. It is also a very powerful anti oxidant and infection fighter but do not use this as oral drops. DO NOT USE THIS AS ORAL DROPS-ONLY FOR TOPICAL TOOTH USE. - 100% fix that needs reapplication every 6 hours or so- and NOT long term solution but superb for days / weeks remedy.</li>
    <li> Bought for too thick but found it absolutely useless.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a last ditch effort to help cure the extreme tooth pain I was having due to a cavity. I told myself if this doesn&#x27;t help the pain then I&#x27;m dragging my stubborn a$$ into the dentist. Upon opening I was shocked at how pungent the smell was. That tells you right there that this stuff isn&#x27;t diluted at all. 100% clove oil. Took a q-tip, oiled it up and set on my tooth. Within seconds all pain was virtually gone. I was shocked that it worked so well and so fast. I use it every couple of days or when I have a flare up to keep the pain away. I&#x27;ve read with continued use you can kill the exposed nerve of a tooth so we will see. Overall this is a fantastic product that I will be buying more off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If using for tooth pain be careful not to get any on gums/tounge/cheek area as it will burn and numb the skin</li>
    <li> I had a tooth extracted and then developed an infection.  The clove oil took the pain away and the swelling.  I was giving antibiotics as well, but once I started applying the clove oil the pain went away.  Excellent product and I recommend anyone with toothaches to get it.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the hype. I have massive issues with my teeth and this product offers a repreive from the pain. Oragel couldn&#x27;t compare. The only downside is the actual skin searing sensation if it gets on things like your chapped lip or unintended mouth tissue. Overall A++++++</li>
    <li> Had a tooth that was bothering me and put a bit on the tooth and after a minute pain stop hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
