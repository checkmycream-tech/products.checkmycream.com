<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. Love the fragrance.  Good for men and women! Four more words required.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked me to find Dove Burst bars with Nectarine for her, because she couldn&#x27;t find them on the shelf anymore where she lives. I couldn&#x27;t either, but I did find them on Amazon! I ordered a box and split them with her. I love the smell...and, of course, it&#x27;s Dove...so it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased this soap from Kmart but can no longer find it there.  Still have a few bars but was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Fantastic scent, Dove recommended by my dermatologist.  Hope this is not a discontinued scent.  Also love Dove&#x27;s Grapefruit and Lemongrass scent.  Terrific products.  Thanks for keeping these in stock.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite soap bars and they are discontinued. This is the only place I can find them and for a great price too!!</li>
    <li> I love Dove the smell, moisture, and it leaves your skin feeling soft. Excellent for people with sensitive skin. Go fresh burst is now on the top of my favorite dove list. Gotta get some more!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. Glad I was able to fine it here. Very very happy</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in great condition. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this product and many retailers in the Mid West have discontinued this particular scent.  I buy this scent and all my soap needs as a result strictly from Amazon. Great leakage for Amazon as Kroger, Meijer, Target, etc no longer get my bar soap business or that trip.</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed using the Nectarine Dove for the past 2 years.  Usually get it locally but this summer it disappeared from local shelves (WalMart, Sam&#x27;s Club).  Turns out Dove has rotated it out for other scents and types.  While I&#x27;m sure the Dove itself hasn&#x27;t changed, I prefer a citrus scent.  Tried the Cucumber and it seems a bit overpowering.  Hadn&#x27;t yet tried some of the newest scents though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for other retail sources for the Nectarine scent, found this available through Amazon.  While not as inexpensive as in regular stores, I gladly paid a bit more to get plenty of supply - 3 x 14 bar packs.  That should keep me going until they reintroduce it, or I order some more, whichever becomes reality.  When I find a good thing, I like to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order came in within 1 week in good shape, shipping was not too bad considering the weight for shipping.</li>
    <li> I cannot buy this locally anywhere. Either it&#x27;s sold out or Dove no longer makes it which I will not be happy about if true. I love the smell and use the after shower spray to enhance the beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Love this product - the scent is just wonderful - clean, fresh and slightly citrusy.  Lathers well and has a creamy texture - highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product! Works great exactly as described. Going to order it again too. Very pleased too. Great!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap that Dove made, I am sorry to hear that some of our retailers do not care this product anymore I wish one of the stores would reconsider and start back selling this item in the stores. Thanks to amazon that I am able to still purchase this product. You will not go wrong when purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why my local store suddenly do not carry this product that alleged me to check online and luckily; I found it, I will recommend to anyone who like a nice fresh flavor soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a long time now.  I love the fresh scent and I love how smooth and soft it makes my skin feel.  No tight, dry feeling from this soap.  Just a nice hydrated clean feeling.  My scent of Dove Burst has been discontinued I think because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Thank goodness for the Internet!  I also use the deodorant and body spray in this scent and I also purchased both of those since I&#x27;m almost out of everything.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when this is gone.  But one thing I do know is it will definitely be a Dove product!!!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite kind of soap and the local stores simply will not stock it.  So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> For years our dermatologist has been recommending Dove Soap, especially for our son&#x27;s sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;We had been using the unscented bars for years until these Go Fresh Burst scent came out.  It was in instant hit.&lt;br /&gt;I cant&#x27; think of a single shopping trip where this soap wasn&#x27;t in our shopping basket, until recently, when it was discontinued&lt;br /&gt;I would have loved to have purchased every bar Amazon had, but our budget allowed for only 2 14 bar packs at this time.&lt;br /&gt;The scent it mild but exhilarating and the soap leaves your skin clean but soft.  No itchiness after a shower with Dove.&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see the product leave Doves line</li>
    <li> Not happy, the bars you can tell are old and the individual boxes where not sealed I am pissed that I paid 28$!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is great, with a very subtle scent. Like all Dove soap bars, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. But the scent of the other ones is stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had seen they had this package at Bed, Bath and Beyond before I bought it from the seller at Amazon (beautyline). They sell it for $14, not $20!</li>
