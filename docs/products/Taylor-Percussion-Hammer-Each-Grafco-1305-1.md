      <li>Great affordable tool for medical students who do not want to spend a lot of money on something</li>

      <li>Good product, works well, doesn&#x27;t smudge like the red one.</li>
      <li>Good enough for it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and at a great price.</li>
      <li>Quality is pretty decent although there are better hammers out there.</li>
      <li>It has a nice solid feel and works well.</li>
      <li>But it took nearly 3 weeks for it to be delivered,  way after I needed it any more.</li>
      <li>The percussion hammers I needed for a lab came quickly and were just what I needed and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly as described an came quickly.</li>
      <li>I dont use this for medical purposes, I using it as a tool in our lab to tap containers that hold various powders and works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work for medical uses, too.</li>
      <li>I have purchased 20 of them to give as gifts and I will order more in the future now</li>
      <li>and I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Received exactly what was advertised.</li>
      <li>My major issue with it is the strong smell of the rubber.</li>
      <li>Looks long lasting and built with good materials.</li>
      <li>The rubber head on this has such a strong smell of rubber.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough to handle easily</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say much ,well finished work ,for reflex checking.</li>
      <li>Not a great product, but great for its price.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t gripe too much for the price.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about a reflex hammer.</li>
      <li>In real practice, not in health school, you will can just use your stethoscope rim to test reflexes.</li>
      <li>So, when I saw this and it was so reasonably priced, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
      <li>Not fancy, but has a nice round pointed blade tip for eliciting Babinski and abdominal reflexes.</li>
      <li>I love the black look and it has no smearing like I heard the red/orange ones do.</li>
      <li>Still decent for the value.</li>
      <li>I am glad that as an ordinary person this can be used for imrpoving my health, rather than just checking on the animal&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>I have already donated one of my old stethoscopes to her as well.  </li>
      <li>My 5 year old is going through a Doc McStuffins phase.  </li>
      <li>I got this for a doctor kit I made for my 9 year old doctor to be.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cool alternative to the usual stainless with orange rubber reflex hammer.</li>
      <li>(I have big hands), survives in my bag, and is exactly what it needs to be to test deep tendon reflexes.</li>
      <li>Bought it to complete my son&#x27;s doctor set, and it seems even sturdy enough for a 6 year old!</li>
      <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t complain too much as it does what a reflex hammer should do, but I may look for an alternative next time.</li>
      <li>but once u use it you will notice the rubber in this hammer is too soft and it&#x27;s of low quality</li>
      <li>Handle appears cheaply made, bottom tip is very sharp (you could easily cut the bottom of a patient&#x27;s foot while checking the babinski reflex) and it was the wrong color (pink tip).</li>
      <li>Individually packaged potato chips travel better than this product, since at least potato chips have air protecting them, and cost 6 times less to ship.</li>

<li> Black is a good color that&#x27;s different from the usual gray or the ugly orange.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s all black.</li>
<li> Look like the typical reflex hammer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would give 5 stars, but the hammer was rusted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for nursing school and used it to practice health assessment skills.  Inexpensive tool for such great quality.</li>
    <li> Not a great product, but great for its price.  The rubber was weird, and was not well finished, but the product works!</li>
    <li> I bought this item together with the weighted tuning fork and Snellen Eye chart from BP medical at an affordable price. The merchant also has a free shipping order the time I bought these items.</li>
    <li> The rubber head on this has such a strong smell of rubber.  It is so strong that I would like to return it.</li>
    <li> The hammer has been very useful during my clinical rotations because many clinics don&#x27;t have any and providers use their stethoscopes to check for reflexes. The seller provided prompt service.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not a neurologist, this hammer will get the job done. It&#x27;s a standard, inexpensive reflex hammer. One big plus though - the black rubber doesn&#x27;t rub off on your white coat like the red hammers often do.    Pros:  Standard reflex hammer  No color bleed  Inexpensive    Cons:  Visibly cheap construction    Bottom line: Not a neurologist? Need a basic reflex hammer? This will do.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my accupresure points.  It is sturdy and well made.  I am glad that as an ordinary person this can be used for imrpoving my health, rather than just checking on the animal&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well, doesn&#x27;t smudge like the red one. I was a little unhappy about paying more for the black color compared to the cheaper price of the red color. But at least I don&#x27;t have a stained white coat.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my EMT son.  Has held up well in the field.  Quality product for pre-hospital providers.  I didn&#x27;t like it enough to purchase for my UC office.</li>
    <li> I bought this reflex hammer for nurse practitioner school. It has worked great! The head of the hammer is made from a very firm, durable rubber material. The handle is made from a strong metal. This hammer was cheaper than some of the other options on Amazon. Don&#x27;t waster your money on the more expensive choices, especially if your a broke student like me! I have been very pleased with this reflex hammer and I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised. These are very good quality for the money. I have purchased 20 of them to give as gifts and I will order more in the future now that I have seen the quality of them. Thank you I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect as a basic percussion hammer. Not fancy, but has a nice round pointed blade tip for eliciting Babinski and abdominal reflexes. Cleans easily, too.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about a reflex hammer. It has a nice solid feel and works well. My major issue with it is the strong smell of the rubber. If you touch the rubber head, your hand will smell like rubber. Overall, I can&#x27;t complain too much as it does what a reflex hammer should do, but I may look for an alternative next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all black. It&#x27;s a cool alternative to the usual stainless with orange rubber reflex hammer. I&#x27;ll definitely buy one another for my future practice.</li>
    <li> Love this tool, it works great and does not rub off color as I have read others similar to it do.  Works just fine for what I need it for.  I would buy another without hesitation if I needed it.</li>
    <li> I dont use this for medical purposes, I using it as a tool in our lab to tap containers that hold various powders and works great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come in black. The one I got was orange. Some what a downer. But serves its purpose. More to come if it breaks.</li>
    <li> Received exactly what was advertised. Purchased for a health assessment class and will be used minimally only, but I cannot see and problems with this product.</li>
    <li> This hammer seemed fine, except that the synthetic rubber used for the head smells really really bad!  The smell is like car tires and really really strong.  I washed it with soap and water and that didn&#x27;t appear to make any difference.</li>
    <li> Good for play doctor kit!</li>
    <li> What do you say about a percussion hammer? It&#x27;s large enough to handle easily (I have big hands), survives in my bag, and is exactly what it needs to be to test deep tendon reflexes.</li>
    <li> This hammer&#x27;s head was warped and misshapen. I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. I&#x27;m going to have to replace it with a better hammer.</li>
    <li> Not the color shown in the picture and not the weight as advertised however it get the job done and I can&#x27;t gripe too much for the price. If needed to I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I got this for a doctor kit I made for my 9 year old doctor to be. It was exactly as described an came quickly.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  I will be in the neuro clinical setting next semester and will use this a lot.  Light weight and fits in lab coat pocket nicely.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the percussion hammer and I use it on my musculoskeletal patients in my outpatient clinic</li>
    <li> It does its job and comes at a good price.  The black rubs off, so not the greatest of quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s looks good but once u use it you will notice the rubber in this hammer is too soft and it&#x27;s of low quality</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t even used it yet and the rubber is coming apart. Still decent for the value.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old is going through a Doc McStuffins phase.  I have already donated one of my old stethoscopes to her as well.  So, when I saw this and it was so reasonably priced, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  The item arrived sooner than expected!  This is a great addition to her &amp;#34;clinic&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Reflex Hammer was fine.  But it took nearly 3 weeks for it to be delivered,  way after I needed it any more.</li>
    <li> It does the job and I like the black color.</li>
    <li> The percussion hammers I needed for a lab came quickly and were just what I needed and at a very reasonable price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Leaves black smudges on your white coat.</li>
    <li> Ordered this reflex hammer and did not receive anything like what was pictured or described. Handle appears cheaply made, bottom tip is very sharp (you could easily cut the bottom of a patient&#x27;s foot while checking the babinski reflex) and it was the wrong color (pink tip). Thought about returning and ordering another with the hope of receiving the item pictured but they removed prime shipping as a choice...what a joke. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Good reflex hammer.  It has not rubbed off on my white coat after having it for a little over a year.  Plus it comes in black.</li>
    <li> Great percussion hammer!</li>
    <li> As expected. They took a long time to arrive but eventually made it.</li>
    <li> I love the black look and it has no smearing like I heard the red/orange ones do. Feels like good quality</li>
    <li> Simple but great! Looks long lasting and built with good materials. I would definetely recommend it to medical students or doctors.</li>
    <li> Lightweight so not a problem to carry around in your coat pocket.</li>
    <li> Love it, just what I needed for nursing school at a affordable price. Worked great for assessments on my partner.</li>
    <li> bought two of these one each for dr.daughter and colleague. can&#x27;t say much ,well finished work ,for reflex checking. quite inexpensive .</li>
    <li> Great price and quick service.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but perfect for what it is, matches the price.  I bought it for my son&#x27;s Doctor bag.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> the hammer arrived to me in perfect condition.  this product was very inexpensive and perfect for what it is used for</li>
    <li> works as it should! smells like rubber in the beginning but i just washed it off and it was fine</li>
    <li> The reflex hammer was fine, except when I checked my bill, my shipping was 3 times the cost of the product.  Had the product been wrapped in gold and sang a little song when opened, I would have accepted the price.  However the product literally came in plastic bag like how people pack snacks to work.  Individually packaged potato chips travel better than this product, since at least potato chips have air protecting them, and cost 6 times less to ship. Plus you can eat them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just check your shipping price, and if it $8 like me, just buy another one from another vendor. In real practice, not in health school, you will can just use your stethoscope rim to test reflexes.</li>
    <li> Great affordable tool for medical students who do not want to spend a lot of money on something you&#x60;re mianly just getting so your attending does not get mad at you for not having it.</li>
    <li> Simple and well built tool. Exactly what I expected and at a great price. I have no complaints as of yet.</li>
    <li> The hammer came dirty right out of the package and the finish is not good. The hammer had this dirt-like substance on it. The edges were not smooth at all. They sell for $3 at the student medical store here, so I don&#x27;t understand why this one is so poorly made. I&#x27;m not sure if that is a seller issue or if all of these hammers are really that poorly constructed. That being said, I&#x27;m just a 1st year med student, so it will do.</li>
    <li> Fits description and easy to use and elicit responses.</li>
    <li> Just received it today, seems very sturdy and good quality. Bought it to complete my son&#x27;s doctor set, and it seems even sturdy enough for a 6 year old!</li>
    <li> Look like the typical reflex hammer. Will put to good use.  Black is a good color that&#x27;s different from the usual gray or the ugly orange.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product, which works well for my students to test their reflexes. I&#x27;m sure it would work for medical uses, too.</li>
    <li> Broke within in few weeks, with slight pressure!</li>
    <li> Entrega a tiempo, vendedor responsable. Producto de calidad, sencillo, cumple con las necesidades.&lt;br /&gt;Sin quejas. El paquete llegó en excelentes condiciones a Venezuela.</li>
    <li> The end is to sharp on the metal handle.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry around. Good enough for it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
    <li> Quality is pretty decent although there are better hammers out there. For the price, and how much I was going to use it for class, this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I needed one for a medical kit i am a surgeon in training and take pride in learning about medicine. for what it is and the price it is a good investment it works came good and is sturdy only problem was the finish but for 2.50 im not gonna complain it&#x27;s an excellent starter tool</li>
    <li> I am a neurologist and this tendon hammer is very light, does not carry any weight and very difficult for me to assess deep tendon reflexes using it.</li>
