<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says.  It plumps and thickens, not to mentions holds my thick curly hair beautifully without making it crispy and stiff.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for years.  I have a shorter/spikey-type hair style and this product not only holds the style all day with no touch ups but it shows the texturing done on the cut.  If that wasn&#x27;t enough - it also puts a shine on your hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used!  I have very fine hair and this adds lots of volume and makes my hair appear thicker. Do not hesitate. Please never stop making this product Nick...it is truly the best!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite spray! Its amazing, however the price here is RIDICULOUS! You can get it on QVC for almost HALF the price. Comes with 2 full size cans as well as a smaller travel/purse size which is amazing!</li>
    <li> TOO STIFF - LIKE A HELMET</li>
    <li> This spray is really good for holding lift or a curl. Very easy to use and I really like the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it is great.  The price I paid this time was less then I&#x27;ve ever paid. Very pleased~[[ASIN:B002RC83GC Nick Chavez Beverly Hills Plump N Thick Thickening Hairspray 10 oz (284 g)]]</li>
    <li> Because I want them all to myself!!!!!! I&#x27;m never using another hairspray for as long as I can find this!! Nick Chavez products are the best!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, and it is the best hair spray on the market today.  I buy this for my daughter, and she loves it also.  It holds beautifully and you can brush it out in the morning and your hair still looks lovely.  It never leaves a sticky feeling. All \\&quot;Nick Chavez\\&quot; products are just great.  Nick Chavez Beverly Hills plump &amp; thick hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it not only gives it body but holds very well.  My daughter turned me on to this product and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love Nick Chavez products.  Plump N Thick makes me feel like I have a head of hair.  Best hair spray ever.  I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I LIVE IN LOUISIANA AND IT IS SO HUMID HERE. THIS HAIRSPRAY JUST DRYS OUT AND LEAVES A DULL FINISH AND WEIGHT HAIR DOWN. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HUMID WEATHER.</li>
    <li> I have been using Plump N Thick from Nick Chavez and have never had a bad hair day since its use. Be sure to not spray on too much, less is better after blow drying, styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hair spray for about a month. It definitely holds well and makes my hair look and feel thicker. It&#x27;s a bit stickier than expected but I be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It has too strong smell and it doesn&#x27;t work what I expected. I couldn&#x27;t stand with the smell at all. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product a long time.  Love it.  Valve has tendency to clog.  I rinse it with water after each use.</li>
    <li> A spray that works!  A bit pricey, tho only need to use small amount!  I have &#x27;re-ordered ...Will take on my upcoming cruise.</li>
    <li> do not need to get a perm.  holds curl, even with humidity.  also like nick chavez shampoo &amp; conditioner. great product</li>
    <li> The very best hair spray for fine hair. Adds  lot of volume without all the extra weight. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good product but pricey. The product does what it claimed to do.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of holding if you like helmet hair.  Which I occasionally do, but not all the time.  Plus it has a very strong fragrance.  But it does a good job of taming the frizzies.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it. Used to be able to by several cans for less, is getting harder to find.  But I really like it so will have to keep seaching.</li>
    <li> I do like the spray, I don&#x27;t like the scent, last time I ordered it seemed to smell different, the container is&lt;br /&gt;different, hope I just did get old stuff...</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it is just right for my hair. Easy to use and I was relieved to find it on Amazon.com. Will buy it again. Thank you</li>
    <li> If you seen the infomercial don&#x27;t fall for it. I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t do anything any other hair spray doesn&#x27;t do. I tried it a couple of times now and I found that this spray actually weights my hair down and doesn&#x27;t make my curls hold. It does make your hair stiff and not shinny.</li>
    <li> All his hair care products are great and this one gives you volume, I have fine hair and it adds body and volume to my hair ! I suggest trying all of Nick Chavez hair products !</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the clogged nozzle. You have to use hot water and a pin to unplug. My hair will do anything with this working hairspray. Makes my hair plump up and I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nick Chavez hairspray for a while now.  I have tried many other hairsprays but this is the only one that holds my hair (I have very fine flighty hair) and does not dry it out.  The only complaint I have is the expense.</li>
    <li> I have every thin and fine hair.  I have been using this hairspray for years and it holds my hair all day.  I have tried other cheaper brands and they just do not compare.  I do not know why it has to cost so much but I keep looking for a bargain on it where I can find it.</li>
    <li> Plump &amp; Thick is awesome for styling my hair, too expensive, but the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this hair spray. It has a wonderful smell and adds volume to you hair as stated. It does not leave hair looking stiff and gives it a soft feeling. I would recommend this product to anyone that use hair spray on a regular basis</li>
    <li> Chavez hair spray is awesome, light with great hold.  As others have noted, you must rinse the nozzle with each use to prevent clogging.</li>
    <li> This has become my very favorite hair spay.  it does give my hair volume and body  I will reorder as needed</li>
    <li> This is the ideal product for middle age thinning hair.  I can actually spray with my hair upside down, let it set a minute and style with my fingers.  It is not stiff and works just like the advertisements show.</li>
    <li> Hair gets flat after about a half hour and this stuff is seriously flaky also hard to comb through. Was not impressed.</li>
    <li> The only hairspray I have ever found that holds my fine, thin hair.  Not sticky or stiff.  No smelly fragrance.</li>
    <li> The original formula was wonderful. They have recently changed the formula to something called &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; which is not nearly as good. It&#x27;s a real shame that they had a great product and somehow  managed to ruin it. The new formula does not hold or add body any better than most drugstore hairsprays. If I am going to pay over $20.00 for hairspray I expect it to be better than something I could buy at Wal-Mart. Ever heard the old saying &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it?&amp;#34;  I have tried to find a contact number to call the company but have only been able to find an e-mail address that doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than their lousy new &amp;#34;advanced formula&amp;#34; Plump and Thick hairspray.  Shame on you, Nick Chavez.</li>
    <li> his product is the bomb! It really works on my fine hair! Just stays in place with height and volume. When I comb it out it&lt;br /&gt;not show product. Keeps shine and does not get sticky. I just hope Amazon keeps this on order!</li>
    <li> Nozzle plugs and need to use a needle to try to get it to spray again.  A lot of costly spray wasted as part can gets thrown in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Nick Chavez&#x27;s products.  This is the best for thickening hair.  Can&#x27;t really be without it. Thanks Nick for a great product.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is the only one that will work on my very fine, thin hair.  It gives me volume and height, and my hair stays in place all day. I have tried every firm hold spray and Nick Chavez Plump N Thick is the only one I will use.</li>
    <li> Two us tried this and it&#x27;s ok but not as great as advertised.  It really makes the hair stiff with loss of softness requiring a daily shampoo to start fresh.  It does hold the hair in humid and rainy conditions.  If you have naturally dead straight hair with no wave or curl, this will hold any curl you apply.  It isn&#x27;t that easy to work with, since once the hair is sprayed, it becomes rigid and difficult to style. It does add fullness to hair, but you have to prepare the hair prior to applying the product in order to gain the desired look.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is amazing.  It not only provides a great hold, but it allows your hair to move and truly does &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up your hair, proving lift and body.  I&#x27;ve yet to find any other hairspray (even at salons) that compare.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome~makes hair  thicker and fuller, and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this spray to many women I have met. It does not leave hair sticky or stiff.  Can easily brush out and re-style the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.....</li>
    <li> This product does add volume and is indeed a firm hold although it is very expensive. I still keep buying it</li>
    <li> Nick Chavez products are very good, but I find them to be very costly compared to others on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Paul Mitchell spray for a few years now.  I like it because I only wash my hair once or twice a week and the spray doesn&#x27;t build up at all, and I can always brush through it.  That said, I&#x27;m always looking for more hold, particularly in the summer.  The reviews on this spray were sensational, so I decided to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ack!  First of all, just one light spray and I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair without it breaking.  The very next day my hair, which was actually just freshly cut and conditioned, felt like straw.  I&#x27;ll have to deep condition it.  Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> Was so happy to find this product !&lt;br /&gt;I think Nick stopped making it, as OVC no longer sells.&lt;br /&gt;The best if you have thinning hair</li>
    <li> This is great hairspray for giving thinner hair more volume.  Sets very well without using alot of spray.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because I was spoiled by a trial of the previous formula.  I have thinning hair and I need a little boost in the morning and throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product because it&#x27;s the best that I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is the film that the spray leaves.  My bathroom has a powdery film everywhere.</li>
    <li> product holds fine hair and gives it lift if needed, appears to add some thickness to the hair, would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray for me....I bought it for a good price, the shipping was fast, customer service was excellent.  I have to stock up on this hairspray, as I don&#x27;t want to be left without it.</li>
