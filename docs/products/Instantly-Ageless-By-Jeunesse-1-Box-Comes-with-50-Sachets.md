      <li>Yes very good love it.</li>
      <li>He arrives at work bright eyed and bushy tailed.  </li>
      <li>I loved the years it took off my face, but still adjusting to the amount of product to apply.</li>
      <li>I suppose it could be good for a photo shoot but again...</li>
      <li>as most are looking for lol</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It is a great product to reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>It is amazing</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>amazing  </li>
      <li>goes before I got used to how to use it effectively but</li>
      <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>one sachet lasts me a whole weekend which makes me VERY happy</li>
      <li>but it is a temporary fix but effective when used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>but it sure helps with bags under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it works for some people, but it did not for me.</li>
      <li>Love this product, will keep buying</li>
      <li>and I was able to ably a powder over it</li>
      <li>This product comes out of the tube in kind of light brownish color.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT, AND</li>
      <li>Amazing at first.</li>
      <li>It feels like it is filling  the  fine lines like a filler.  </li>
      <li>I do feel if extended use of this product can  defiantly make the appearance and improvement of fine lines, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Received quickly!</li>
      <li>I also tried this on a  huge pore that I can  not get to close and it filled the pore up</li>
      <li>But, its okay for a quick, fresh look.</li>
      <li>Unbelievable and fabulous !!!!</li>
      <li>Once applied don&#x27;t move your face and blow cool air over the area for a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>Younger people who look good but are trying for perfection probably won&#x27;t get the effect they want.</li>
      <li>authentic product and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Finally I feel good about the way my eyes look again.  </li>
      <li>I loved ageless, but the sachet is too small, I have to use two sachets each time, but I liked very much!</li>
      <li>Once applied it dries quickly and tightens the skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Seems to work great for a few hours.</li>
      <li>COMPLAINT--the packaging it&#x27;s in individual pkts (which is more than I need so</li>
      <li>It is a product that does exactly what it said it does.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>I used exactly as instructed.</li>
      <li>Packets dry up after opening, supposed to be able to use up to 3 applications.  </li>
      <li>When you put your makeup on it leaves dry particles on your face and most of it&#x27;s effectiveness is gone.</li>
      <li>It literally tightens your face so you can see the stretching of the skin in certain spots.</li>
      <li>It really reduced the bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>I think some of the complaints are from people who used it incorrectly or who don&#x27;t really need this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really get the hang of it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really smooth &amp; shiny ONLY in the spots you put it so you can tell where it is.</li>
      <li>I was simply amazed at the significant difference I could see in my lines and wrinkles; and the effect was almost immediate.</li>
      <li>As long as she likes it,its fine with me.</li>
      <li>BUT, it leaves a sandy feel, and a hard sparkle like kind of finish where it has been applied.</li>
      <li>I already have great skin, not flawless, so it shouldve been easier for the product to keep up with.</li>
      <li>The trick is to put it on one finger and gently rub it with another finger until the product turns clear before applying to your face.</li>
      <li>That means trying to apply foundation for a smooth overall appearance is not possible.</li>
      <li>The look after application however makes a marked improvement, but presents drawbacks.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;People having been giving it negative reviews BC</li>
      <li>Instantly Ageless complimentary  for  me to personally try  and review and give my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you&#x27;re ok with trading your dark circles for very visible white residue under your eyes.</li>
      <li>A small fan or a hair dryer on cool setting works well.</li>
      <li>My husband is a pilot and works long and very early hours.  </li>
      <li>It is slightly on the high end as far as price</li>
      <li>The product absolutely reduces the dark under eye puffy look.  </li>

<li> My husband is a pilot and works long and very early hours.  </li>
<li> It is slightly on the high end as far as price</li>
<li> The product absolutely reduces the dark under eye puffy look.  </li>
<li> Do not buy this product in these little packets because they dry up and become lumpy quickly even when sealing them as tight as possible and putting them in a container.  </li>
<li> Dried like concrete and flaked.</li>
<li> you will have to apply it again possibly thru out a long day but that depends on your body.  </li>
<li> As long as you understand that this is only temporary</li>
<li> We have timed how long they last through the day and we give it about 8 to 10 hours.  </li>
<li> You only need a little bit in the areas of lines, dark circles, large pores and areas where your skin has lost elasticity.</li>
<li> And it was shipped earlier than expected!  </li>
<li> Only use very little or you will get a white ring under your eyes, I usually put my moisturizer on first then the Instantly Ageless then after it has dried I finish applying my makeup.</li>
<li> Makes skin feel dry.</li>
<li> Apply to dry skin and and pat on evenly.  </li>
<li> It helps a lot if you can use a fan or a piece of paper to help dry it faster.</li>
<li> The product does in fact work at getting rid of dark circles and bags under your eyes, however it leaves a crusty white residue wherever you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
<li> The only down side is that it&#x27;s temporary.</li>
<li> If you like this product buy it in the vials only or else you will be losing half of the product to the garage can.</li>
<li> you face the stuff cracks like dried plaster &amp; leaves a crusty white film in it&#x27;s place.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
<li> I used this on my dark circles and seen that it help hide the darkness.</li>
<li> if I used less, just a little bit, the eyes bags still here, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> Terrible product, does not work on any kind of wrinkles.  </li>
<li> Waste of my money.</li>
<li> it creates waste).  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your  money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really get the hang of it but the idea itself is very great</li>
    <li> Worked until I put make us on then it desolved</li>
    <li> Works like magic, it&#x27;s really incredible!!</li>
    <li> authentic product and fast delivery. It did take a couple of goes before I got used to how to use it effectively but one sachet lasts me a whole weekend which makes me VERY happy</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The product does in fact work at getting rid of dark circles and bags under your eyes, however it leaves a crusty white residue wherever you&#x27;ve applied it. I watched several YouTube videos on tips of how to apply it , the amount of the product you use or what you apply it with makes no difference, I still got the white residue everytime and ended up washing it off. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you&#x27;re ok with trading your dark circles for very visible white residue under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Did not work like advertised</li>
    <li> Too difficult to apply. Dried like concrete and flaked. Want to return it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what anyone else says about this product... It works if you apply it correctly.  I have ordered 2 times and both shipments were great.&lt;br /&gt;Yes you will have to apply it again possibly thru out a long day but that depends on your body.  No its not a miracle cream  as most are looking for lol but it sure helps with bags under my eyes.  Very Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product. Makes skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> i guess I was expecting miracles......not happening.  But, its okay for a quick, fresh look.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable and fabulous !!!! The effects are immediate and you gets one appearance 10 years younger ... Perfect !!!</li>
    <li> Yes very good love it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product in these little packets because they dry up and become lumpy quickly even when sealing them as tight as possible and putting them in a container.  If you like this product buy it in the vials only or else you will be losing half of the product to the garage can.</li>
    <li> This is everything it says it is....my husband and I share these, but don&#x27;t use them everyday.  As long as you understand that this is only temporary but we are amazed.  We have timed how long they last through the day and we give it about 8 to 10 hours.  My husband is a pilot and works long and very early hours.  His bags literally disappear when he puts this on at 4 a.m. before heading out on a trip.  He arrives at work bright eyed and bushy tailed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this stuff ia amazing  Finally I feel good about the way my eyes look again.  In minutes the under eye bags are gone.  And I get 2 or 3 days from each packet</li>
    <li> I was sent this sample of Instantly Ageless from Dr. Valerie Schecher. I have heard a lot about this product and have seen some very wonderful results from this cream. You only need a little bit in the areas of lines, dark circles, large pores and areas where your skin has lost elasticity. Once you apply this cream to the areas that you need, allow your face to rest emotionlessly while the product dries. It helps a lot if you can use a fan or a piece of paper to help dry it faster. I used this on my dark circles and seen that it help hide the darkness. I also tried this on a  huge pore that I can  not get to close and it filled the pore up and I was able to ably a powder over it and you couldn&#x27;t even tell I had it. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It cracks if you apply makeup over it</li>
    <li> The product is GREAT!  The price was GREAT! And it was shipped earlier than expected!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It is a great product to reduce fine lines. I have been using this product for 30 days. I do see a difference in my appearance especially crows feet. Once applied it dries quickly and tightens the skin around my eyes. I do feel if extended use of this product can  defiantly make the appearance and improvement of fine lines, puffiness and wrinkles. You can only use a small amount !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The formula is lightweight and contains minerals that evens skin tone. It immediately dissolves into the skin reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  It feels like it is filling  the  fine lines like a filler.  Instantly Ageless comes in sachets.&lt;br /&gt;You can visit their website they have a  video that describes the product and how it works.  I received  one months supply  of Instantly Ageless complimentary  for  me to personally try  and review and give my opinion.  It is slightly on the high end as far as price but I do see a difference.</li>
    <li> This works just as it promises!  Great item!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Saw the video and was impressed. Got this product and was even more impressed!</li>
    <li> Love this product, will keep buying</li>
    <li> Terrible product, does not work on any kind of wrinkles.  Feels awful on skin.  Packets dry up after opening, supposed to be able to use up to 3 applications.  Garbage!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;People having been giving it negative reviews BC they don&#x27;t know how to use this product the correct way!&lt;br /&gt;It clumps when you use a lot of the product. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife. As long as she likes it,its fine with me. Will not work for me,i&#x27;m past the point of repair.</li>
    <li> I loved ageless, but the sachet is too small, I have to use two sachets each time, but I liked very much!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a joke. Sorry instantly ageless but unless you want to remain expressionless all day...the moment you move you face the stuff cracks like dried plaster &amp; leaves a crusty white film in it&#x27;s place. It looks like dried cum! Umm yeah not so attractive. It&#x27;s also really smooth &amp; shiny ONLY in the spots you put it so you can tell where it is. It literally tightens your face so you can see the stretching of the skin in certain spots. I suppose it could be good for a photo shoot but again...only if you remain totally expressionless!</li>
    <li> The product absolutely reduces the dark under eye puffy look.  BUT, it leaves a sandy feel, and a hard sparkle like kind of finish where it has been applied. That means trying to apply foundation for a smooth overall appearance is not possible. The look after application however makes a marked improvement, but presents drawbacks.</li>
    <li> I could get the same results with a bottle of Elmers glue!!  What a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. I am sure it works for some people, but it did not for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great for a few hours.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. It really reduced the bags under my eyes. The only down side is that it&#x27;s temporary. I think some of the complaints are from people who used it incorrectly or who don&#x27;t really need this product. My needs are obvious. Younger people who look good but are trying for perfection probably won&#x27;t get the effect they want. I found a video showing application tips that I found helpful. This product comes out of the tube in kind of light brownish color. I&#x27;m not sure what results you get if you apply it in this form. *The trick is to put it on one finger and gently rub it with another finger until the product turns clear before applying to your face. Once applied don&#x27;t move your face and blow cool air over the area for a couple of minutes. A small fan or a hair dryer on cool setting works well. You can feel your skin tighten.</li>
    <li> I loved the years it took off my face, but still adjusting to the amount of product to apply.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received quickly!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really works! Takes 10 years off and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT, AND THE PRICE ON AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I was simply amazed at the significant difference I could see in my lines and wrinkles; and the effect was almost immediate. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> When I used it, a layer of white glue on my eyes.  if I used less, just a little bit, the eyes bags still here, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Only use very little or you will get a white ring under your eyes, I usually put my moisturizer on first then the Instantly Ageless then after it has dried I finish applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. When you put your makeup on it leaves dry particles on your face and most of it&#x27;s effectiveness is gone. I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Work just as described.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  money</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations.  Apply to dry skin and and pat on evenly.  It is amazing and I do not know why anyone would not love it.  Improved my eye area within a few minutes and I get compliments everyday on how youthful  I look,</li>
    <li> Amazing at first. Leaves a bit of a crust as the day wears on. Wish it lasted a bit longer. Only lasts about four hours.</li>
    <li> It is a product that does exactly what it said it does.Happy with the product but it is a temporary fix but effective when used.</li>
    <li> Returning this after 4 try&#x27;s. Dries in the face and looks like peeking after 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Great product, works like temporary Botox, you can feel the product working and tightening.  COMPLAINT--the packaging it&#x27;s in individual pkts (which is more than I need so it creates waste).  Dries up when saved so they need to repkg and not be greedy with the individual pkts.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! I used exactly as instructed. Twice. Lasts maybe 30 minutes if that. I already have great skin, not flawless, so it shouldve been easier for the product to keep up with. It failed. Waste of my money.</li>
</ol>
