      <li>/&gt;- PERFECT for at home use, OR</li>
      <li>Comes with some great attachments.</li>
      <li>great for mens necklines</li>
      <li>and the price is really great.  </li>
      <li>Wireless / comes with a charger: great if you using it once a day on yourself</li>
      <li>Great light weight clipper and gets everywhere</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;One more thing.</li>
      <li>i have used this tool and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS TRIMMER.</li>
      <li>you cannot have an inch of hair (or more) and expect the manscaper to remove it.</li>
      <li>Dont rate it if you dont know how to use it &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I think they tried to get this thing to do more then just a clipper.    </li>
      <li>THE ROTATING HEAD MAKES IT EASY TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and maneuver.</li>
      <li>I love the results, he loves that its pain free and super easy.</li>
      <li>maybe if a woman bought this to shave the fine hair on her arms it would work fine.</li>
      <li>(im a barber) and have used it on one guys hairy knuckle after I used the WAHL stylist trimmer and the results were as smooth as a babys bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>WORTH MORE THAN ADVERTISED PRICE TO ME.</li>
      <li>This trimmer has the potential of being great in a barber shop setting, because it&#x27;s easy/quick to use and sanitize/clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cut to close to the skin and left for a great look.</li>
      <li>easy to use, not bad for the price, it works pretty well considering the price.</li>
      <li>this is for fine detailing and replaces the very unsanitary and out-dated straight razor.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>but I expected more for what I paid.</li>
      <li>Hubby says its waaaaay better than using an old electric face shaver (never mix &#x3D; gross!)</li>
      <li>After I sent it back at my own expense, I never received a credit for the amount I spent to purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ve been able to use it just once and even during that first time it was not able to do the 50% of the job.</li>
      <li>The Foil blade (and all other heads) can be easily sanitized by taking apart the top and cleaning the little hairs out, then spraying a sanitizing spray</li>
      <li>Charges quickly, and stays charged for long periods.</li>
      <li>but I know that the 5-Star Foil Shaver which is BUILT TO LAST will never be fully clean or sanitized in the back of my head</li>
      <li>I primarily use it for the clipper or trimmer, to keep the chest hair down and in order.</li>
      <li>This tool is great for men with thick dark hair that have the &amp;#34;5:00 shadow&amp;#34; issue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is meant to be a professional tool.</li>
      <li>Same thing with the smaller &#x27;detail&#x27; or nose-hair clipper, it&#x27;s just not quite right.</li>
      <li>use the &amp;#34;foil head&amp;#34; and will mainly review this item based on that specific function.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: IMHO, you would only want to use the foil head after first trimming the hair with the regular trimmer head.</li>
      <li>If you are unsure and have sensitive skin, I would suggest watching a youtube video prior to using any trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ALSO, be very careful that you only use the trimmer head while using an &amp;#34;underhand grip&amp;#34; and turning the trimmer upside down to clean the neckline.</li>
      <li>This will help give a smoother feel without the risk of a straight razor or open blade shave cut, and it is specifically made for the average man to use!</li>

<li> The charge last a long time, you can&#x27;t over-charge the battery (some units say &#x27;charge for 3 hours&#x27; and going longer can damage it).</li>
<li> overall rating is a 5 - BECAUSE - it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;Manscaper&amp;#34; and clearly not meant for all day every day use.</li>
<li> The blades are really sharp, it&#x27;s fast to charge and holds it well, there are tons of attachments and it all sits in a little circular stand so you don&#x27;t lose any parts.  </li>
<li> you can select how long and how dense you want it.     </li>
<li> This is very similar to the &amp;#34;WAHL *5-Star* Foil Shaver&amp;#34; and this might be the smaller less &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34; version.&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought at Sally Beauty as did the other reviewer who&#x27;s didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
<li> It also never held a charge for very long.  </li>
<li> Its total waste of money.</li>
<li> Works as expected.  </li>
<li> Tgit is described as being a product to trim a man&#x27;s body hair, but the blade is entirely too narrow to serve that purpose.</li>
<li> Believe me its total waste of money.</li>
<li> While using the Foil Blade, you can easily go up and down without worrying about cutting yourself or someone else and hear the stubbles being cut</li>
<li> The blade was not very wide and not really suitable for head shaving, which is what I used it for.  </li>
<li> Mine lasted 3 1/2 then died - as with the other review wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and it was not under the 60 warranty -</li>
<li> Not fit for long term use without being plugged</li>
<li> I noticed several times the motor seemed slow to start.  </li>
<li> Comes with a little stand to keep it out of the way</li>
<li> The Charge stops holding after a few weeks of non stop use at a shop.&lt;br</li>
<li> The Cons will not affect a man using it a few times a week or even once a day.</li>
<li> Hard to find parts for it, unless you reach out to WAHL directly&lt;br</li>
<li> I UPGRADED FROM AN OLD NORELCO THAT HAD A BAD SWITCH FROM DAY ONE.</li>
<li> Since then even if you connect it to power switch its motor does not work and even if start working its so slow that you will be in pain.</li>
<li> I found the shaver to be almost useless, it won&#x27;t compare to a dedicated shaver....</li>
<li> Do NOT BUY THIS CRAP.</li>
<li> I hate wasting money</li>

    <li> This is kindof a touchy review since, well it&#x27;s a &#x27;Manscaper&#x27;....anyways, I purchased for my husband at Xmas b/c nothing says \\&quot;love\\&quot; like a tool to have your husband groom himself.  I love the results, he loves that its pain free and super easy. Have not had any issues with it.  The blades are really sharp, it&#x27;s fast to charge and holds it well, there are tons of attachments and it all sits in a little circular stand so you don&#x27;t lose any parts.  Hubby says its waaaaay better than using an old electric face shaver (never mix &#x3D; gross!) and the price is really great.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local Sally Beauty Supply with a 60-day return policy.  I noticed several times the motor seemed slow to start.  The blade was not very wide and not really suitable for head shaving, which is what I used it for.  It also never held a charge for very long.  On about day 53 it died outright.  I will not be buying another one.</li>
    <li> I like not fighting with a cord, the only downside is that the caddy that organizes the attachments is flimsy.</li>
    <li> Tgit is described as being a product to trim a man&#x27;s body hair, but the blade is entirely too narrow to serve that purpose. It is a bit deceiving and I didnt like the fact that I paid for the shipping charges to and from in order to return a product that was unacceptable. thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. After I sent it back at my own expense, I never received a credit for the amount I spent to purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a jack of all trades. I found the shaver to be almost useless, it won&#x27;t compare to a dedicated shaver....but for simple stuff it seems to get the job done. Same thing with the smaller &#x27;detail&#x27; or nose-hair clipper, it&#x27;s just not quite right. I think they tried to get this thing to do more then just a clipper.    I primarily use it for the clipper or trimmer, to keep the chest hair down and in order. You get 5 different &#x27;heads&#x27; to put over the clipper and everything about this works very solid. For this alone, I&#x27;d give it a solid 5...you can select how long and how dense you want it.     The charge last a long time, you can&#x27;t over-charge the battery (some units say &#x27;charge for 3 hours&#x27; and going longer can damage it). Quality is solid, for the price the value is there.</li>
    <li> I ve been able to use it just once and even during that first time it was not able to do the 50% of the job. Since then even if you connect it to power switch its motor does not work and even if start working its so slow that you will be in pain. Do NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Its total waste of money. Believe me its total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great light weight clipper and gets everywhere you want it to go. Easy to handle and maneuver. Charges quickly, and stays charged for long periods.</li>
    <li> feels sturdy. battery lasts. works well. why a 4 instead of 5? bc the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34; head simply does not work. maybe if a woman bought this to shave the fine hair on her arms it would work fine. but for my courser her it does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;but I bought this to trim up and have no complaints in that department.</li>
    <li> easy to use, not bad for the price, it works pretty well considering the price. Attachable heads work well except i have not found luck with the shaver attachment</li>
    <li> I will pick a different one next time.</li>
    <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;Didnt cut to close to the skin and left for a great look. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice shave</li>
    <li> I bought at Sally Beauty as did the other reviewer who&#x27;s didn&#x27;t last.  Mine lasted 3 1/2 then died - as with the other review wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and it was not under the 60 warranty - I hate wasting money</li>
    <li> whal man scaper I heaply made you get what you pay for I would not recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Comes with some great attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my face, the girlfriend likes the stubble look, but this just won&#x27;t do it like my $20 Remington.  I guess it&#x27;s ok but I expected more for what I paid.</li>
    <li> This tool is meant for VERY VERY short stubble. basically the hair that your trimmers or clippers dont remove. you cannot have an inch of hair (or more) and expect the manscaper to remove it. this is for fine detailing and replaces the very unsanitary and out-dated straight razor. i have used this tool and LOVE it. great for mens necklines (im a barber) and have used it on one guys hairy knuckle after I used the WAHL stylist trimmer and the results were as smooth as a babys bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is meant to be a professional tool. Dont rate it if you dont know how to use it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I UPGRADED FROM AN OLD NORELCO THAT HAD A BAD SWITCH FROM DAY ONE. I LOVE THIS TRIMMER. THE ROTATING HEAD MAKES IT EASY TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO. YOU CAN USE IT WITH OUT ANY GUARDS AT ALL AND NOT NICK YOUR SKIN. WORTH MORE THAN ADVERTISED PRICE TO ME.</li>
