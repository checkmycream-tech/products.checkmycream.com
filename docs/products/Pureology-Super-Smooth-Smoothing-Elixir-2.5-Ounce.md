    <li> I like so many, have tried every product on the market. I have wavy, frizzy hair. I use the shampoo, conditioner, friz control, blowout my hair and it is beautifully straight all day. No heat like irons needed and your hair is healthier. A must have for and hair product collector.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology Super Smooth Elixer!  My hair is frizzy if I don&#x27;t use it.  It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or weigh it down.  This is exactly the same item I usually buy at my salon, but it costs less on Amazon.</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d it in a couple of days - my hair is fine and this is great especially when you are blow drying!</li>
    <li> Unless you want to wander around reeking of floral scent, avoid these products.  I had used this previously, and liked the way it worked.  However, they have revised the formula, it now contains salycates, which can cause allergic reactions.  I wont&#x27; buy it again.</li>
    <li> The only product I use now to straighten my hair!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my daughter - she loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have a huge collection of hair products purchased in hopes of softening and smoothing my wavy thick hair..  This one does everything I could wish for.  It is definitely worth the price.  Now I want to try the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I wish it was not discontinued.  Buy it up while its still around ;) It makes your hair shine so you look like a fashion princess</li>
