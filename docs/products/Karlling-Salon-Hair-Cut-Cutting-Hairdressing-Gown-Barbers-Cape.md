    <li> It was like in the picture</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Before we bought this, my husband would literally sit bare butted on a kitchen chair while I buzzed his head. Then he would go take a shower. Now...we can just use this and not have to worry about freeballin on the kitchen chair.</li>
