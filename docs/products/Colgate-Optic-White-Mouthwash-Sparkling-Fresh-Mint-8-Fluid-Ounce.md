### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If you are traveling this is the ideal size, and really a good price for it&#x27;s size.</li>
      <li>The flavor is great.</li>
      <li>This mouth wash is not as good as Crest 3D</li>
      <li>This mouth wash is perfect to use and cleans with a fresh Colgate feeling that provides a whitening effect on teeth.</li>
      <li>But just for a nice mouthwash, it will do.</li>
      <li>It works great makes your mouth feel clean</li>
      <li>This is the most vile tasting substance I have ever had the misfortune to put in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Love this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>AND WE LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I received a free bottle of this from Influenster to try and give an honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I got better results from using the 5mintue bleaching system for getting whiter, brighter teeth.  </li>
      <li>I am not even sure if it is FDA approved.</li>
      <li>taste is better after like 10 seconds though.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ALONG WITH THE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE.</li>
      <li>Too cheap to return.</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s feeling so much better and has fresh breath too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I would have done to keep my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>and it makes my mouth feel clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>Works and does whiten when used in combination with whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves breath feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Colgate puts out another quality product.</li>
      <li>I was warned by dentist relative about this kind of product, however, that would not be significantly by just rinsing it in the mouth.</li>
      <li>However, I will admit that my teeth feel pretty clean when I do use it- even for hours upon hours after using it</li>
      <li>However, I am not crazy about the 360 toothbrush so that may have been what was causing the sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I have to say I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results as far as toothpaste and mouthwash go.</li>
      <li>After using this mouthwash for about 3 months, I find that I like it because it keeps my breath fresh for a couple of hours</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products.</li>
      <li>I am willing to use almost anything, but not this.  </li>
      <li>I am sure this works really good with the optic white toothpaste, but I just can&#x27;t get past the taste....</li>
      <li>I only used it once because it was way too strong.</li>
      <li>this mouthwash keeps my breath fresher than most others (though it has a kind of weird taste to it)</li>
      <li>I will admit that I was really put off by the taste.</li>
      <li>WORKS REALLY FAST</li>
      <li>It felt and tasted like I was gargling straight bleach.</li>
      <li>As title stated, I did not see much effect from this product.</li>
      <li>Unless you like your mouthwash really strong, or plan to dilute it, I would steer clear of this and just stick with the Optic White toothpaste for whitening.</li>
      <li>I am all for trying new things especially if it means they might be better than what I currently use.</li>
      <li>not your normal tasting mouth wash....</li>
      <li>It is a very strange taste, a bit salty and sweet?</li>
      <li>I have absolutely no idea whether it makes your breath smell better, or if it whitens your teeth, because I simply could not keep the mouthwash in my mouth for more than a few seconds.</li>
      <li>but my mouth got use to the new product and that sensation went away.</li>
      <li>I actually like it much better because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my mouth as much as other mouthwashes.</li>
      <li>will say that the first couple times I used it my gums were a little sensitive</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to keep it in my mouth for the full 60 seconds, it was just too painful.</li>
      <li>However, this is not expected from a company like Colgate.</li>
      <li>Luckily I grabbed it to take with me on a 16 hour round trip drive that turned into a 3 day trip due to an unexpected blizzard.</li>

<li> Luckily I grabbed it to take with me on a 16 hour round trip drive that turned into a 3 day trip due to an unexpected blizzard.</li>
<li> I have been using mouthwash for a very long time.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it which does dry the mouth.</li>
<li> I have to spit several times to get it all out but for whiter teeth I&#x27;ll spit a few extra</li>
<li> Another disappointment is, despite that the product says it is alcohol free, it burns and it is not just a little tingle, but it burns just the same as mouthwash with alcohol.  </li>
<li> In only a few days I have noticed a difference.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t worry about the taste which is just a little different than other mouthwashes.</li>
<li> Unlike a lot of other mouthwash&#x27;s</li>
<li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I would have with the mouthwash is that it makes your saliva thick.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like to waste a penny, and will use almost anything, even if I don&#x27;t like it, since I spent money on it.  </li>
<li> I bought 2 bottles and poured them down the drain.</li>
<li> I could barely keep it in my mouth for as long as the directions stated because the taste was so bad.</li>
<li> Not pleased for the price.</li>
<li> It has whitened my teeth, kept my breath fresher longer and did not dry out my mouth, which can be a cause of bad breath.</li>
<li> Sorry for such a bad review</li>
<li> She also suffered very badly from dry mouth which even caused her lips to stick to her teeth.</li>
<li> I am sorry I purchased it.</li>
<li> sorry</li>
<li> It tastes so bad it makes me wonder if something was actually wrong with the bottle I purchased.</li>
<li> I know mouthwashes are notorious for tasting bad, but this is something else all together.</li>
<li> My mother is undergoing chemotherapy and had really bad halitosis.</li>
<li> it works but it tastes so bad and makes my eyes water</li>
<li> I have been using Colgate toothpastes since childhood and have never been disappointed.</li>
<li> The base of my teeth where there is some yellowing has already started to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it tasted horrible.</li>
<li> This mouthwash is awful tasting.... like soap.</li>
<li> The taste is very awful, tastes like some chemical.</li>
<li> But this one is the worst.</li>
<li> This thing tastes awful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you like the taste of Hydrogen Peroxide, you may like it! It left the need to spit repeatedly. Sorry for such a bad review but it wasn&#x27;t for me. I threw the bottle away!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using mouthwash for a very long time. I have tried many different products. But this one is the worst. The taste is very awful, tastes like some chemical. Will never order it again.</li>
    <li> I know mouthwashes are notorious for tasting bad, but this is something else all together. Used it once and poured the rest out.</li>
    <li> It spilled everywhere in the package when I got it and it tasted horrible.</li>
    <li> It works great makes your mouth feel clean and you can actually feel it working so i will continue to use it</li>
    <li> If you are traveling this is the ideal size, and really a good price for it&#x27;s size. The flavor is great.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is not as good as Crest 3D neither is their toothpaste. I am sorry I purchased it. I will from this point on stick w/ Crest 3D as it actually whitens. This DOES not!</li>
    <li> This thing tastes awful! I am not even sure if it is FDA approved. I have been using Colgate toothpastes since childhood and have never been disappointed. However, this is not expected from a company like Colgate. I will definitely not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I am sure this works really good with the optic white toothpaste, but I just can&#x27;t get past the taste....not your normal tasting mouth wash....I don&#x27;t think I can recommend it......sorry</li>
    <li> this mouthwash keeps my breath fresher than most others (though it has a kind of weird taste to it)</li>
    <li> This is the most vile tasting substance I have ever had the misfortune to put in my mouth. I have absolutely no idea whether it makes your breath smell better, or if it whitens your teeth, because I simply could not keep the mouthwash in my mouth for more than a few seconds. It tastes so bad it makes me wonder if something was actually wrong with the bottle I purchased.</li>
    <li> I am willing to use almost anything, but not this.  It tastes like soap or cleanser.  And the taste doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth.  I don&#x27;t like to waste a penny, and will use almost anything, even if I don&#x27;t like it, since I spent money on it.  But after trying this once, I poured it out.</li>
    <li> Works and does whiten when used in combination with whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves breath feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Colgate puts out another quality product.</li>
    <li> Did not burn my mouth or tingle or anything. I did not notice a whitening of my teeth</li>
    <li> As title stated, I did not see much effect from this product. I was warned by dentist relative about this kind of product, however, that would not be significantly by just rinsing it in the mouth.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a teeth whitening product on a budget and recently bought the Colegate Optic White collection: toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush. I have to say I am pleased with the results thus far. In only a few days I have noticed a difference. The base of my teeth where there is some yellowing has already started to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the first couple times I used it my gums were a little sensitive but my mouth got use to the new product and that sensation went away. However, I am not crazy about the 360 toothbrush so that may have been what was causing the sensitivity. I switch between that and my regular toothbrush now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I would have with the mouthwash is that it makes your saliva thick. I have to spit several times to get it all out but for whiter teeth I&#x27;ll spit a few extra times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the results I would recommend this product. I am satisfied with the results as far as toothpaste and mouthwash go.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. It has whitened my teeth, kept my breath fresher longer and did not dry out my mouth, which can be a cause of bad breath. It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it which does dry the mouth. My mother is undergoing chemotherapy and had really bad halitosis. I gave her a bottle and now she doesn&#x27;t have any mouth odor at all. She also suffered very badly from dry mouth which even caused her lips to stick to her teeth. Now she&#x27;s feeling so much better and has fresh breath too. Don&#x27;t worry about the taste which is just a little different than other mouthwashes. I actually like it much better because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my mouth as much as other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> Came with mysterious liquid all over the bottle! Not pleased for the price. I don&#x27;t even know if I want to use it the bottle looks scratched and is leaking. Too cheap to return. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my sample from Influenster. Luckily I grabbed it to take with me on a 16 hour round trip drive that turned into a 3 day trip due to an unexpected blizzard. If it hadn&#x27;t been for this mounthwash I don&#x27;t know what I would have done to keep my teeth clean. This mouthwash saved the day! I used it as a rinse and also dipped washcloths in it and scrubbed my teeth with it. Unlike a lot of other mouthwash&#x27;s I did not find this to be overbearing and can use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this from Influenster to try and give an honest opinion. I only used it once because it was way too strong. I wasn&#x27;t even able to keep it in my mouth for the full 60 seconds, it was just too painful. It felt and tasted like I was gargling straight bleach. Unless you like your mouthwash really strong, or plan to dilute it, I would steer clear of this and just stick with the Optic White toothpaste for whitening.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is awful tasting.... like soap. I bought 2 bottles and poured them down the drain. Do not buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this since I had bought the Colgate Optic Toothpaste and I didn&#x27;t like it. I will stick to my regular mouthwash since this one didn&#x27;t freshen my breath like my regular mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is perfect to use and cleans with a fresh Colgate feeling that provides a whitening effect on teeth.</li>
    <li> Tastes funky and was smaller than I thought (that&#x27;s my fault).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is better after like 10 seconds though. Would consider buying again.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ALONG WITH THE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE. WORKS REALLY FAST AND WE LOVE IT. WE WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> it works but it tastes so bad and makes my eyes water but i can deal for the white teeth, yo.</li>
    <li> I received this product through an Influenster box and I was eager to start using it. I am all for trying new things especially if it means they might be better than what I currently use. I will admit that I was really put off by the taste. It is a very strange taste, a bit salty and sweet? I could barely keep it in my mouth for as long as the directions stated because the taste was so bad. However, I will admit that my teeth feel pretty clean when I do use it- even for hours upon hours after using it (I am trying to get paste the taste to see if the product will actually whiten).</li>
    <li> After using this mouthwash for about 3 months, I find that I like it because it keeps my breath fresh for a couple of hours and it makes my mouth feel clean after using it.  But it did not receive the five star rating because, unlike it claims to do, my teeth do not appear whiter.  I got better results from using the 5mintue bleaching system for getting whiter, brighter teeth.  Another disappointment is, despite that the product says it is alcohol free, it burns and it is not just a little tingle, but it burns just the same as mouthwash with alcohol.  So if you&#x27;re looking for mouthwash without the burn and for whiter teeth, this is not it.  But just for a nice mouthwash, it will do.</li>
