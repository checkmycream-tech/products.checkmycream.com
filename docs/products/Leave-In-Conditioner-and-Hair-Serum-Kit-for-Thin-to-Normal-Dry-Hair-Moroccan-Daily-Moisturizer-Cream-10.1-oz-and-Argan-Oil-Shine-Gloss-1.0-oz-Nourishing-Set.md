      <li>Thank so much</li>
      <li>Gentle Pleasant&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a mild pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;After the shower, while your hair is still wet, add a few drops of argan oil to your hair, from roots to the ends to hydrate and moisturize.</li>
      <li>mainly for my frizzy ends and to sleek my hair</li>

    <li> I have extremely long hair that is very thick. I&#x27;m always trying new products to use on my hair....mainly for my frizzy ends and to sleek my hair so it&#x27;s not so full looking. This is a wonderful products! It makes my hair so soft and easy to manage. I&#x27;ve even used it on my husbands hair to make it soft to touch. I recommend this for hard to manger, frizzy, corse,  fine, dry, or just difficult hair. You can also put a good amount on your hair, work it in, put a shower cap on, and let sit for a few hours. It restores lost nutrition in no time!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have searched for a product like this for years. It&#x27;s NOT greasy, it controls my frizz and it smells divine. It gives my hair LIFE. I always struggled with dull thin hair but this has made a huge difference, it also gives it tons of body. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>

    <li> This product smells amazing &amp; has done wonders for my hair &amp; scalp. I am going to be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> This made my hair a bit fuzzy...and smells like a very male product.  Could be the Argan itself I suppose, I&#x27;m not sure how that smells.  Don&#x27;t want an artificial smell, but don&#x27;t want my towels, clothes and hair to smell like a man.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product by writing a review and i would like to say i do say try this product it is great if you have hair problems like me my hair is thick and so hard to make stright and not frizz the ARGON  oil is the best just a drop or 2  and u have stright shiny great looking hair it also smells great and dont forget the conditioner its the best leaving your hair soft and frizz free so try this its great a perfect gift for christmas  or any time you can order this on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products trying to get my frizzy, curly hair under control and this leave-in product gives my hair a great shine and softness whether I leave it curly or straighten it.</li>
    <li> great conditioner, pleasant mild order, would order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is thin and very fine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down . I would recommend this to my friends and family, actually anyone.  I plan to order this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing food for my hair!! I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Great on my hair, it&#x27;s just awesome!</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels very silky and soft.  I have locs and my hair looks shiny and fresh with a very light oil tint not that oily heaviest look very light.  I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products my daughter&#x27;s curly dry hair. I seen a difference the first time I tried it. I&#x27;m on mythird day now and her hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been with no oily feeling. This is now my go to product.  I love it</li>
    <li> I received this product for free for my unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have issues with my hair. It has been permed, colored, and damaged by heat. A lot of leave in conditioners I do use leaves my hair nasty and greasy feeling so even after doing my hair I end up throwing it up. I used the leave in conditioner just about every day since I have received it. And my hair looks better than ever. I have received many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get that nasty greasy feeling when I use it. Best part about it you don&#x27;t have to use that much for a good turn out and I have long thick hair. So it will last me awhile which is a bonus! I recommend applying after you wash your hair and dry it a little. So damp hair as it says on the bottle. It does say you can use with dry hair but I have yet to try it out with dry hair. I will be trying that when I run out of time in the mornings. I will continue purchasing Argan Hair products!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this several times since Christmas and has had nothing, but great things to say about it.  It makes her hair so soft she straighten her hair all the time with a iron or curling iron.  Great product I highly recommend you give it a try too!</li>
    <li> i received this product for free for my honest and unbiased opinion.  I thought this was an awesome conditioner, left my hair feeling very refreshed and manageable.</li>
    <li> really happy to have tried this system! i have really frizzy ends and after getting out of the shower run a small amount of the leave in through my ends and then style as usual. i then use a small amount of the oil in my palms and lightly go over my hair to tame fly aways and the end result is really pretty hair! i love that it only take just a little bit for big results. this has lasting results too! my hair is staying tamed even with all the rain right now! it also smells wonderful and it feels like a treat to use! highly recommend natural beauty argan oil leave in and serum as well as the entire line!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I really like the little bottle of oil that came with it.  I have to use it when my hair is damp and once it dries it feels so much softer then before.  It isn&#x27;t as frizzy and it smells nice to.  Never makes my hair look or feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter who has thick coarse hair. It has worked awesome! He hair gets softer each time! The leave in cream is excellent for styling her short hair cut. ☺</li>
    <li> I have long hair to my waist and often have to buy leave in conditioner to help maintain and keep my hair from split ends or breakage. Argan oil is what my hairdresser recommends for providing  nourishment for healthy hair. This leave in oil works wonders for my hair. It leaves my hair silky smooth but not greasy and oily. It helps moisturize my hair and gives it a healthy shine. This is perfect for all hair types and styles. It has a mild pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;After the shower, while your hair is still wet, add a few drops of argan oil to your hair, from roots to the ends to hydrate and moisturize. It’s especially nourishing if your hair is dry and frizzy from daily use of a blow dryer, straight-iron or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;It also can be used when your hair is dry, use as a styling product by adding a few drops of argan oil to the palms of your hand. Rub your hands together and run your fingers through your hair to create shine and tame frizz. You only need a small amount because a little goes a long time.  It lasts all day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to everyone, and to all hair types for silky, smooth radiant, healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> As a product reviewer of other hair products on my blog, (including those I have tried and sold and the ones that I just tried) I can say with great confidence that this product is superior to all the rest. I&#x27;m tough on deciding what to use in my hair since I have a thyroid condition and lose certain amounts of hair when I wash and condition it. I wash my hair once a week because my hair is in incredible condition (even though the individual hairs fall out from my thyroid condition). Hair dressers are always in awe of the condition of my hair and that I use no color at age 54! I have no grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an animal activist, I am always looking for products that not only are not tested on animals, but are vegan if at all possible. So when I was presented with the opportunity to review this product I was also looking for a product to change to. My last conditioner is really not of this quality. Because I have found this product I will be able to share it now with at least 30 vegetarian and vegan friends on the Internet and in real life. And they can share it as well. I will be sharing it in the social media, not only on my blog, but in the various groups where my vegan and vegetarian friend are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I will be trying other products in this Aya line here on Amazon.com This is where I do most all of my shopping now days because I find quality products on Amazon and trust the reviews!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely outstanding!  I have short, thick hair.  The leave in conditioner allowed for easy styling.  I think&lt;br /&gt;my hair fell in love with it instantly, leaving a bright shiny look and soft manageable texture.  The scent of this product is&lt;br /&gt;wonderful.  I am pretty picky about hair products and I am delighted I found this one.  Yesterday I used the small bottle of hair&lt;br /&gt;serum - the treatment achieved similar results as the leave in conditioner.  I want to look and see if they have a product for&lt;br /&gt;my husband&#x27;s hair type.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> great product I enjoyed the way it worked on my hair it just smelled a bit at first but the tone got down after I dried my hair Thank so much</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner and hair serum to review and I am so impressed. I absolutely LOVE the smell. It&#x27;s mild but very pleasant. Many conditioners (and shampoos for that matter) often have an overpowering scent but this conditioner is just right. I used in place of my regular conditioner and I&#x27;m thinking my regular conditioner may become a thing of the past. This left my hair feeling soft and silky, but not oily. I also used the hair serum and it actually made flat ironing my hair easier than normal. Definitely recommend buying this product. I&#x27;ll be buying the accompanying shampoo soon.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The smell is addicting.</li>
    <li> This product is a little bit misleading it&#x27;s definitely not argon oil it&#x27;s not 100% and it doesn&#x27;t work like 100% argon oil does work.  The real deal is a lot lighter absorbs much better and is a lot more hydrating this is okay it&#x27;s definitely not what it portrays to be and for a little bit more money you can get the real deal and it will last you a long time and your hair will immensely benefit.</li>
    <li> its amazing for natural hair and to use as a deep conditioner</li>

It made my hair softer and healthier looking than what I was using. I felt like I could run my hand through it and it was like gliding my hand over silk. Where I am located the weather does a number with my hair. It is a lot of the times unless I use salon quality and priced products on my hair to control my frizzy. With this I had considerably less frizzing. I am noticing when my hair likes to have static electricity and is not controllable with this I don&#x27;t feel like I have put my finger in socket. I feel this product put better nutrients into my hair follicles and as a result is growing better. I have been looking for something with better ingredients and this fits the bill completely. I don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful stuff to hurt me or my family. If I want to let someone else use my stuff when they stay over I feel comfortable with that. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this leave-in conditioner! As a woman with extremely curly hair that has a mind of its own this conditioner has been the best that i have used. It really helps to manage and shape my curls and eliminates frizz with out weighing it down! with other leave-ins i always have to use other products but not with Argan Hair Nourishing Leave-In Cream. I love my curls and this product helps me set them free! i would recommend this prodcut</li>
    <li> i love it..would buy again</li>
    <li> I only had the product for less than a week. However, prior to the purchase my hair was so dry and unhealthy looking. Also, my hair had static electricity that was so annoying. Since using the product my hair is manageable, healthy looking, soft and the static electricity is completely gone. I&#x27;m glad that I made this purchase.</li>
