<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this product every time after washing, keeps my hair shining and manageable for styling.. Love all the body it gives.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but I use something else now.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner. My hairdresser highly recommend I purchase this conditioner. My hair is fine so she said it is very good product for people with fine hair. I have not used it at home as yet but I know it will do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better for thin or virgin hair. Kinda light for my hair. Need something with more moisture.  Other products are a bit better</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Inoacolor  at a salon in San Diego. I bought this and I think it did help my color to last a full 8 weeks. No fading at all. I will be using only this so I am delighted to find it online here</li>
    <li> This conditioner is o.k.  I did not see much of a difference in using this or a less pricey version.</li>
    <li> Nice smell.  Not heavy.  Effectively untangles my hair and keeps my color healthy looking.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I love it but I can&#x27;t justify using it daily based on the price (I have to wash my hair daily because it&#x27;s naturally super oily).</li>
    <li> What a great price for this product that works so well!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is damaged from coloring.  The Inoa makes my hair soft and smooth. Prior I had been getting the Keratin treatments give my hair a softness and shine.  At $150 to $200 every 3months I new I had to find a better solution.  The L&#x27;Oreal Inoa Line has made all the difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great color care product that conditions and helps maintain your color longer than other color conditioners. I also use the Inoacolor Care Shampoo. They work great together!!</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel like butter.....doesn&#x27;t strip color... hair is left healthy and shiny...worth the money-- amazing product</li>
    <li> My colorist uses Loreal Inoa products. I was curious about the Inoa shampoo and conditioner and ordered both from 2 different vendors on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m jaded from high priced color protection products that do nothing but this stuff gets big kudos. My color, almost 4 weeks old, washed a minimum of 4 times a week, is luxe, soft and in super condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. Loreal, I&#x27;ve discredited you for far too long. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great condtioner, love the flagrance and the fact that it is sulfate free.  I use it with the INOACOLOR shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo! My hair has incredible volume and color has stayed nicely! I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  Since I began using it, my fine hair has gotten stronger, thicker, and longer.  Although, I also switched shampoos, began washing every other day, and use a thickening serum at night - so I&#x27;m not sure if this did much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the shampoo that goes with this conditioner.  I just LIKE this conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t wow me like the shampoo, but it&#x27;s nice.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s worth the price, to be honest.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not - I&#x27;m just not sure.  Be forewarned that the bottle is smaller than you&#x27;d expect.  :)</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky. There is no residue left behind.  This conditioner rinses out well and also helps retain the color in your hair.</li>
    <li> Sooooo heavy! Left my head with a film on it and super itchy! I do not recommend this at all, especially if you have a dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of times and must say it works well for making the color last a little longer for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> ITS GREAT ESPECIALLY AFTER A BRAZILIAN TREATMENT.  ITS ALL I USE ALONG WITH THE SHAMPOO.  BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. You can buy the same thing at the grocery store. Expected extra conditioning shine anything. It was a disappointment.</li>
