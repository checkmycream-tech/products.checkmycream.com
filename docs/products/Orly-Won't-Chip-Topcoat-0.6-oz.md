### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Beautiful, thank you!</li>
      <li>Both times look great.</li>
      <li>For those who did not have a good experience perhaps it was because the layers underneath weren&#x27;t well done?  </li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking that it would not chip my nails, but it chips them even more than what they were doing on their own.</li>
      <li>It doesnt have any more non chipping qualities though.</li>
      <li>Just an over prices top coat</li>
      <li>I applied they bonder as directed so the Orly nail polish would stick to it better.</li>
      <li>I am mystified why anyone wouldn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
      <li>They dried quickly to a FLAWLESS glass-like shine.</li>
      <li>So far I have the best luck with putting super glue in plain cheap top coat.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a top coat that doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss look and will last roughly 8 hrs this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>You are better off applying two clear coats of whatever you have.</li>
      <li>Makes polish stay on a couple days rather than chip right away</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried putting on more or less of both nail polish and the top coat</li>
      <li>It looks great going on, but after about a day, its cracks and peels off leaving my nails looking worse than if I used a normal top coat.</li>
      <li>You would be better off trying a different topcoat, like Seche Vite.</li>
      <li>First let me say I bought this product from Wal-Mart, not this seller.</li>
      <li>tested again with no base coat and a different Orly nail polish.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t beat my hands up that much.</li>
      <li>and it still chips faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>6 days later 9 of my nails looked good except for my right index finger which just had small chips from the tip.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that it lasted any longer than a usual top coat.</li>
      <li>so I guess technically it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chip\\&quot; at first</li>
      <li>I had a professional manicure which always lasts one day before chipping.  </li>
      <li>After applying , this polish gives the appearance as though they were professionally done at a salon.  </li>
      <li>Second, I read on the instructions that it works best with some \\&quot;bonder\\&quot; base coat</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re lucky, your nail color will last 2 days, but no more if you are in constant contact with water.</li>

<li> let dry for an hour before I went to bed.</li>
<li> After that was dry</li>
<li> After allowing it to dry I put one  coat of this Orly product on my nails.</li>
<li> This product does not live up to its name.</li>
<li> suddenly I started to see slight signs of missing nail polish, but not noticeable to others.</li>
<li> Considering I was testing this out; I applied two coats to one hand and one coat to the other hand.</li>
<li> I bought this product in the hopes that my manicure could last at least a week.</li>
<li> but I guess you can accomplish that with another product like the 2-in-1 base and top coat.</li>
<li> Just as the previous time.</li>
<li> It started chipping in less than 12 hours.  </li>
<li> So I spent like 12 USD in both products for nothing!!!</li>
<li> It makes my nails harder (even though I have naturally hard nails), but then after a couple of hours, the polish cracks and you can see lines in my nail polish where it starts to chip.</li>
<li> I think you wasted your money.</li>
<li> Sooo a waste of 7 bucks.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this top coat.</li>
<li> I painted them a few hours before bed and noticed they were chipped in the morning!</li>
<li> Just because something is pricey doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s quality.</li>
<li> Not a good product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very hard on my nails; cleaning, typing, shampoo every day, etc.  </li>
<li> If you buy, polish will be ugly in 2 days or less.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad I bought this, had a nail chip within 12 hours.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> It recommends that you use the Orly Bonder Base Coat, WHICH I DID, but nothing.</li>
<li> She didn&#x27;t use a base coat.</li>
<li> This crap does NOT work.</li>
<li> Thia stuff is horrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Finally, a topcoat claim that is supported by actual customer use--meaning me and you, too, after you try it. Moreover, it eliminates flaws in the underlying nail color.  For example, last night my polish bubbled. After allowing it to dry I put one  coat of this Orly product on my nails. They dried quickly to a FLAWLESS glass-like shine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that it would not chip my nails, but it chips them even more than what they were doing on their own. It makes my nails harder (even though I have naturally hard nails), but then after a couple of hours, the polish cracks and you can see lines in my nail polish where it starts to chip. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had a professional manicure which always lasts one day before chipping.  I applied the Orly, hoping for two days!  6 days later 9 of my nails looked good except for my right index finger which just had small chips from the tip.  I&#x27;m very hard on my nails; cleaning, typing, shampoo every day, etc.  For those who did not have a good experience perhaps it was because the layers underneath weren&#x27;t well done?  I am mystified why anyone wouldn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Orly bonder and the Orly won&#x27;t chip topcoat at Sally&#x27;s. Thank God for Sally&#x27;s product guarantee. I am returning both. I cleaned my nailed with nail polish remover to ensure there was no residue or oil on them.  I applied they bonder as directed so the Orly nail polish would stick to it better. After that was dry I applied the Orly nail polish. After 20 mins of drying I applied this Orly Won&#x27;t Chip Topcoat.  Considering I was testing this out; I applied two coats to one hand and one coat to the other hand. let dry for an hour before I went to bed. Next morning no chips. Two hours later no chips.  Lots of hand washing, cooked breakfast, shower, washed hair, dish washing etc. suddenly I started to see slight signs of missing nail polish, but not noticeable to others. dinner time I am peeling a garlic. the nail polish started chipping off on the garlic. That&#x27;s gross.  I also applied it to my daughter&#x27;s nails. She didn&#x27;t use a base coat. She used sinfully nail polish with the Orly Won&#x27;t Chip Topcoat.  After school she said &amp;#34;mom I think you wasted your money. my nails started chipping before gym class&amp;#34;. So I removed my polish. tested again with no base coat and a different Orly nail polish. Both times look great. Doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss. Just as the previous time. It started chipping in less than 12 hours.  If you are looking for a top coat that doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss look and will last roughly 8 hrs this is perfect.  Unless you are wearing gloves 24/7 doubt your nails will last 24-48 hrs without chipping.</li>
    <li> First let me say I bought this product from Wal-Mart, not this seller. Second, I read on the instructions that it works best with some \\&quot;bonder\\&quot; base coat and I didn&#x27;t see that until after I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. it just doesn&#x27;t work! That&#x27;s all there is to it. It forms a pretty hard acrylic feeling coat on your nail and after about a day (I wash my hands a lot, I work at an automotive repair, which is why I was looking for a product like this) it started to literally crack. so I guess technically it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chip\\&quot; at first, it just stays cracked looking for a while and then starts to chip away. This is after two days. Sooo a waste of 7 bucks. So far I have the best luck with putting super glue in plain cheap top coat.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that it lasted any longer than a usual top coat. Lasted a day before it chipped</li>
    <li> Nail polish chipped after a day. Does not prevent chips</li>
    <li> It picks up the color from polishes and bleeds if your wearing two different nail polishes. It doesnt have any more non chipping qualities though. Just an over prices top coat</li>
    <li> Nail polish does chip had it on for one day !!!</li>
    <li> My nails still chip when I use this polish. It may be because I type a lot at work, but it&#x27;s supposed to not chip.</li>
    <li> Thia stuff is horrible! It looks great going on, but after about a day, its cracks and peels off leaving my nails looking worse than if I used a normal top coat. I don&#x27;t beat my hands up that much. They chipped just cooking dinner. I would NOT recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the hopes that my manicure could last at least a week. Mind that if you regularly use water (washing hands, washing dishes, washing your hair daily) it won&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product. It recommends that you use the Orly Bonder Base Coat, WHICH I DID, but nothing. So I spent like 12 USD in both products for nothing!!! If you&#x27;re lucky, your nail color will last 2 days, but no more if you are in constant contact with water. I only give it 2 stars because I like the polished glossy finish but I guess you can accomplish that with another product like the 2-in-1 base and top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll paint my nails and put this on then watch a movie and when the movie&#x27;s over my nails are all chipped! I&#x27;ve tried putting on more or less of both nail polish and the top coat and it still chips faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad I bought this, had a nail chip within 12 hours. I painted them a few hours before bed and noticed they were chipped in the morning! I literally didn&#x27;t do anything with my hands during that time as I&#x27;m on vacation. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to its name. It makes the nail shiny. However, After a day what happen, my nails were chips. After the third day. I just re polished my nails. Does nothing. You are better off applying two clear coats of whatever you have.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this top coat. Instead of being clear, the dried edges from the polish have turned white and my nail color has chipped after 2 days.</li>
    <li> After applying , this polish gives the appearance as though they were professionally done at a salon.  Long lasting and protects polish.</li>
    <li> Makes polish stay on a couple days rather than chip right away</li>
    <li> This crap does NOT work. Just because something is pricey doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s quality. Made my polish chip FASTER than polish/top coat alone. If you buy, polish will be ugly in 2 days or less.</li>
    <li> stil chips and peels of</li>
    <li> Polished chipped within 24 hours. Not a good product. You would be better off trying a different topcoat, like Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> WON&#x27;T CHIP....my a$$! This product is a joke. I used it as at 5:00 pm the night before and woke up with chipped nail polish. As of 4:30 pm, the following day, my nails look horrendous!! Will NEVER buy this product again!!</li>
