      <li>I hope they never stop making this awesome spray.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>Product is great- arrived without a cap.</li>
      <li>and it looks great every time.</li>
      <li>Great beach waves.</li>
      <li>This smells wonderful and leaves a nice texture within your hair.</li>
      <li>This does a great job of holding it in place.</li>
      <li>great product for the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I bought this product on recommendation from a classmate who has gorgeous wavy hair every day.</li>
      <li>followed by the Bumble and Bumble, but I thought I&#x27;d check this one out because I&#x27;d heard good things about it.</li>
      <li>Not too drying, and gives a good amount of volume without being crunchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>And anyone who says &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; to the chemical smell - have to be honest, that smell sits with you all day and its not so nice.</li>
      <li>My hair is still kind of frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Daughter likes it, has a nice aroma to it.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, works so good</li>
      <li>While the packaging is nice and the spray provides an even mist</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something called WAX for that kind of sculpting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like this, but it smells good and the clean design looks nice in my shower.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I love their shampoo too.</li>
      <li>this is an interesting hair product.  </li>
      <li>love this</li>
      <li>Will re-purchase for sure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it anymore because of overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>Love this spray.</li>
      <li>And love the scent.</li>
      <li>I found that Philip B. Maui Wowie and Beach Blow Texturizing Mist work even better.</li>
      <li>This spray smells great and really helps my curls to hold.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is the Davines one,</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the one and only time I&#x27;ll admit my stylist had my hair&#x27;s best interest in mind.</li>
      <li>This may be a better option for people with thicker hair who don&#x27;t mind strong fragrance in their hair products.</li>
      <li>Love the way I can easily style my hair with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other salt/ocean sprays; this one is the best.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend if you need a volumizing product-</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my hair natural but very stylish~</li>
      <li>I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with very fine, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>but i also add it to dry hair for texture and a great scent.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Blinded by the halo of a good blowout, you succumb to whatever will sustain that newfound sense of confidence only to find that after day two, products a/b/c yield dismal results.</li>
      <li>I love different hair products and LOVE the ocean, so I thought, why not.</li>
      <li>Including about 30 years&#x27; worth of mousse, which was my go-to.  </li>
      <li>versatile and fun</li>
      <li>absolutely no complaints and a great solution to my busy morning routine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few salt sprays in my day and like most others this one is just okay.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz easily.  </li>
      <li>The spray adds tons of texture to my very very ultra-fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, flat hair</li>
      <li>This is my go-to product for the first two days after I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>With my hair damp, I flip it over, spray the underside, then flip it back and spray the top (scrunching it a bit as I go).</li>
      <li>better products are out there to do the same thing</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but a few spritzes of Ocean Mist gives it plenty of texture and body and makes it easy to style.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve all been a victim (sadly, more than once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so this product works very well on my hair and does not leave it oily at all.</li>
      <li>My hair is shoulder-length and straight with medium-thick thickness.  </li>
      <li>These two products have been a real boon to my tresses.</li>
      <li>This product will mess up your hair as if you&#x27;ve been to the beach, but your hair will smell very strongly perfumed.</li>
      <li>It did work, although I would recommend the other two products to work better.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and have tried many salt sprays out there.</li>
      <li>My hair is long (mid to lower back), layered, very wavy underneath, yet annoyingly straight on the top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>As she suggested, I usually spray this on my hair after a good post-shower towel dry.</li>
      <li>You really should not use too much of this product at a time, as if you spray in too much, it can weight your hair down and make it look</li>
      <li>My normally fine and limp hair had OOmpf.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair, I let it air dry for a few minutes and then spray what I would call a medium amount on my hair, lifting various sections and then one spritz right on the top.  </li>
      <li>It smells like Old Spice....</li>
      <li>Sometimes when I&#x27;m feeling fancy, I like to change up my natural part.</li>
      <li>I refuse to have another 3/4-full bottle take up crucial bathroom real estate.</li>
      <li>Others have complained about the smell, but I prefer it much more than the chemical smell of hairspray.</li>
      <li>Works great but terrible, cheap, &amp;#34;sport-y&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>and, while it&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>My hair has a natural wave to it if I let it air dry.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine blonde straight/wavy hair.</li>

<li> I have fine, thin hair and it did give me that wave look, but if you put it on wet</li>
<li> prefer using this on dry hair and scrunching it through the lengths for some extra texture.</li>
<li> It managed to make my hair dry and greasy at the same time.</li>
<li> This 5 oz bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
<li> Call me lazy or Sachajuan highly efficient, but I didn&#x27;t comb once in those 3 days.</li>
<li> I get a substantially noticeable difference in my hair and it really, really helps make it appear thick and fuller.  </li>
<li> Unlike other styling sprays, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crisp and hard to comb.  </li>
<li> , I did not get the same beachy texture that I&#x27;ve gotten from other sprays.</li>
<li> Then I blow dry.  </li>
<li> It just left my hair flat and limp.</li>
<li> and it only takes a little bit to work.</li>
<li> it has that wet</li>
<li> for me, i use it as directed on wet hair when i want to have a curly beach wave look.  </li>
<li> Before I purchased this, I gave Philip B. Maui Wowie a test run--noticeably stickier, the scent equally as unappealing, and within 15 minutes, my hair decided to fall back to its natural (ahem, limp) state.</li>
<li> Thought it would give it more texture, but it doesn&#x27;t.  :(</li>
<li> The latter products both have sea salt, but the Ocean Mist spray has the main ingredient as alcohol, so that was disappointing.</li>
<li> I usually straighten it but sometimes will blow dry it and curl with a wand.  </li>
<li> Well, I have long, really thick hair, so I had to use a lot of spray.</li>
<li> It works well, but the smell is a little medicinal.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like the ocean, but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, either.</li>
<li> As for the fragrance, it really doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad.  </li>
<li> Because my hair is thick, I knew I would need to help it get some volume, so I pulled my hair up into a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; bun after spraying.</li>

    <li> this is an interesting hair product.  for me, i use it as directed on wet hair when i want to have a curly beach wave look.  but i also add it to dry hair for texture and a great scent.  versatile and fun</li>
    <li> It works well, but the smell is a little medicinal. I found that Philip B. Maui Wowie and Beach Blow Texturizing Mist work even better. The latter products both have sea salt, but the Ocean Mist spray has the main ingredient as alcohol, so that was disappointing. It did work, although I would recommend the other two products to work better.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this product. It managed to make my hair dry and greasy at the same time. I have fine thin hair and have tried many salt sprays out there. My favorite is the Davines one, followed by the Bumble and Bumble, but I thought I&#x27;d check this one out because I&#x27;d heard good things about it. While the packaging is nice and the spray provides an even mist, I did not get the same beachy texture that I&#x27;ve gotten from other sprays. It just left my hair flat and limp. The smell is also as bad as some of the other reviews mention. This may be a better option for people with thicker hair who don&#x27;t mind strong fragrance in their hair products.</li>
    <li> Once it dries it does give the hair volume and that beach look. I have very fine, flat hair so this product works very well on my hair and does not leave it oily at all. but I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Product is great- arrived without a cap.</li>
    <li> Raise your hand if you&#x27;ve gotten a haircut, and afterwards, your hair stylist recommends you get products a, b, and c. Blinded by the halo of a good blowout, you succumb to whatever will sustain that newfound sense of confidence only to find that after day two, products a/b/c yield dismal results. Don&#x27;t blame yourself! We&#x27;ve all been a victim (sadly, more than once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very-expensive-difficult-to-refuse-handsome stylist *suggested I use this. NEVER! I refuse to have another 3/4-full bottle take up crucial bathroom real estate. That is--until day 3 when my hair looked as thick as it did after the blow-out. Call me lazy or Sachajuan highly efficient, but I didn&#x27;t comb once in those 3 days. Brazilians, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My normally fine and limp hair had OOmpf. Will it transform hair into Cindy Crawford&#x27;s mane? No. You need extensions for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Before I purchased this, I gave Philip B. Maui Wowie a test run--noticeably stickier, the scent equally as unappealing, and within 15 minutes, my hair decided to fall back to its natural (ahem, limp) state. Seriously guys, \\&quot;Maui Wowie\\&quot;--delusions of obtaining Barbie hair and a babe named Ken died at the age 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The trick--spray the roots, but sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sometimes when I&#x27;m feeling fancy, I like to change up my natural part. This does a great job of holding it in place. However, if you&#x27;re going for grease lightening, this stuff can&#x27;t sustain that altitude. There&#x27;s something called WAX for that kind of sculpting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one and only time I&#x27;ll admit my stylist had my hair&#x27;s best interest in mind.</li>
    <li> great product for the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; hair look!</li>
    <li> Besides the color of this product, I have no idea why they named it &amp;#34;Ocean&amp;#34;.  It smells like Old Spice....yuck! I have fine, thin hair and it did give me that wave look, but if you put it on wet it has that wet, gel look.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this spray. Love the smell, works so good and it only takes a little bit to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the first time. Love the way I can easily style my hair with it. And love the scent.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. Not too drying, and gives a good amount of volume without being crunchy. Will re-purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what I wish it would. My hair is still kind of frizzy.  Thought it would give it more texture, but it doesn&#x27;t.  :(</li>
    <li> This stuff should actually be called liquid gold. It&#x27;s amazing. It does for hair what a Kitchen-Aid does for whip cream, makes it voluminous and shiny. After using the product for a year I actually moved to Sweden and went to the Sachajuan salon where I met Sacha and Juan! They&#x27;ve been working in the same salon together for three decades. I love their shampoo too. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like this, but it smells good and the clean design looks nice in my shower.</li>
    <li> This spray smells great and really helps my curls to hold.  I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz easily.  I usually straighten it but sometimes will blow dry it and curl with a wand.  I can definitely tell a difference when I use this spray!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and leaves a nice texture within your hair. My hair is shoulder-length and straight with medium-thick thickness.  You really should not use too much of this product at a time, as if you spray in too much, it can weight your hair down and make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer using this on dry hair and scrunching it through the lengths for some extra texture. This 5 oz bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> This product will mess up your hair as if you&#x27;ve been to the beach, but your hair will smell very strongly perfumed. I don&#x27;t use it anymore because of overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> Works great but terrible, cheap, &amp;#34;sport-y&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on recommendation from a classmate who has gorgeous wavy hair every day. My hair is long (mid to lower back), layered, very wavy underneath, yet annoyingly straight on the top. As she suggested, I usually spray this on my hair after a good post-shower towel dry. With my hair damp, I flip it over, spray the underside, then flip it back and spray the top (scrunching it a bit as I go). That&#x27;s IT! I can let it air-dry the rest of the way and it looks great every time. My boyfriend loves it, my friends have complemented it... absolutely no complaints and a great solution to my busy morning routine. Others have complained about the smell, but I prefer it much more than the chemical smell of hairspray.</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with very fine, straight hair.  As in...not blessed.  I&#x27;ve used every concoction that comes along to help oomph-up my hair.  Including about 30 years&#x27; worth of mousse, which was my go-to.  Sachajuan Ocean Mist has actually replaced my use of mousse altogether.  After washing my hair, I let it air dry for a few minutes and then spray what I would call a medium amount on my hair, lifting various sections and then one spritz right on the top.  Then I blow dry.  I get a substantially noticeable difference in my hair and it really, really helps make it appear thick and fuller.  Unlike other styling sprays, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crisp and hard to comb.  It can be a bit drying, but not overly so for my hair type.  As for the fragrance, it really doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and, while it&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;ll definitely get this again.  Oh, and Sachajuan Hair Powder?  AWESOME stuff.  These two products have been a real boon to my tresses.</li>
    <li> Like the effect. Great beach waves. And anyone who says &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; to the chemical smell - have to be honest, that smell sits with you all day and its not so nice. Bareable, but not ideal. Again with the Saschajuan leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;m finishing the bottle but don&#x27;t feel the need to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair. I have thin, fine blonde straight/wavy hair. My hair has a natural wave to it if I let it air dry. I washed my hair one day and followed the directions and it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few salt sprays in my day and like most others this one is just okay. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the way it smells. Now my sister uses it too!</li>
    <li> better products are out there to do the same thing</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. My hair is fine, but a few spritzes of Ocean Mist gives it plenty of texture and body and makes it easy to style. I hope they never stop making this awesome spray. It smells divine as well.</li>
    <li> This is my second time order.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair natural but very stylish~</li>
    <li> After a recommendation from one of the design blogs I subscribe to, I decided to check out this product. I love different hair products and LOVE the ocean, so I thought, why not. Well, I have long, really thick hair, so I had to use a lot of spray. It doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like the ocean, but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, either. Because my hair is thick, I knew I would need to help it get some volume, so I pulled my hair up into a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; bun after spraying. Later on, I took out the bun and my hair looked wavy and ocean water-treated! I loved it! It wasn&#x27;t sticky like regular hair spray. I don&#x27;t know if I will purchase this product again, as it is pretty expensive, but I will say that it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product for the first two days after I wash my hair. The spray adds tons of texture to my very very ultra-fine hair. Strongly recommend if you need a volumizing product- I&#x27;ve tried other salt/ocean sprays; this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> Daughter likes it, has a nice aroma to it.  But hair not like you been swimming in the ocean like ad claims</li>
</ol>
