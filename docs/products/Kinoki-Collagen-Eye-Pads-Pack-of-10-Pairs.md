<li> I think if you are born with dark circles under your eyes and have regular puffiness under your eyes also, there is not much you can do about it.  </li>

<li> It also makes you take time to sit down and relax.</li>
<li> I have used these a few times now (4-5) and have not noticed any difference.</li>
<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> so not sure it works.</li>
<li> It works wonders for tired eyes, dark circles, and eyes affected by allergies.  </li>
<li> I had a hard time keeping the patches on I would pass on getting this item again</li>
<li> Other than that, its useless.</li>
<li> I did not wake up lazy and tired...</li>
<li> Kinoki has already been exposed for selling fake foot detox patches.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to make a difference but they feel good on. It might just be me. Wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think these do anything for under eye puffyness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for 3 times, but I think they are helping the bags under my eyes. I wear them overnight.</li>
    <li> Kinoki has already been exposed for selling fake foot detox patches.  I&#x27;m not buying these ....</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time keeping the patches on I would pass on getting this item again</li>
    <li> bought for my friend, so I don&#x27;t know exactly the status. i think it&#x27;s good items. I will suggest my friends to buy.</li>
    <li> They felt good but I like the foot pads a lot more.  I don&#x27;t know if they made much of a difference..</li>
    <li> Looks like it really makes a difference after using a whole pack of these eye pads. I even ordered another!</li>
    <li> I think if you are born with dark circles under your eyes and have regular puffiness under your eyes also, there is not much you can do about it.  Trying this product out.  You can only use them every three days.  When I have them on for the 15 minutes they feel great.  Nice and cool.  Hope they work!</li>
    <li> The Kinoke patches are a wonderful way to moisturize the delicate under eye skin. They are the perfect size to over the entire eye area.</li>
    <li> These do not stick nor function as they should.</li>
    <li> These work great for puffy eyes. Yes, I highly recommend them living in area full of allergens. Please try it.</li>
    <li> Great value but I haven&#x27;t really seen results after several days of usage. I will not be reordering these pads.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  I don&#x27;t know what I expected when I made this purchase.  Not what I thought it was.  If you want to walk around looking like a fool, this product is for you.  Other than that, its useless.</li>
    <li> Not moist enough so I bought a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have used up the package and have seen absolutely no difference.  Might as well just use an eye cream.</li>
    <li> Pros:  The Kinoki Eye Pads are amazing for a temporary fix! They are great for flights. It works wonders for tired eyes, dark circles, and eyes affected by allergies.  Cons:  The price was kind of high for only 10 packages and it is only a temporary fix. I will definitely purchase again, but only for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used these a few times now (4-5) and have not noticed any difference. I really wanted them to work!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t seem to have enough moisture by the time they arrived</li>
    <li> I like to use undereye pads for swelling and puffiness and to smooth lines.  I have used several different brands.  This one was very reasonably priced and fairly effective.  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have had much better, albeit they were much more expensive. I didn&#x27;t feel that there was much hydration, but they seemed to help with the puffiness.  I really like kinoki footpads so that is why I tried these.&lt;br /&gt;  For those of you who use lash extensions, be aware that these are cotton backed.</li>
    <li> Regarding Kinoki Pads--I have purchased many other brand names; Kinoki was by far the best pads.  The pads molded to your under eye and upper eye lids. I leave them on for about twenty minutes and that does the trick. It took care of the puffiness and wrinkles.  Rate it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
    <li> Takes away eye puffiness and stays on well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for detoxification under eye pads and got these by mistake.  I like them, will continue to use them in conjunction with the detox pads, like them as well.</li>
    <li> Keep under eye moist. As to dark circle - I do not see any result yet. The package was okay, I am not sure if this product deliver the result it claims.</li>
    <li> I do not see a difference when I use these.... so not sure it works.</li>
    <li> These have worked great! They are comfortable to wear and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and opens up your eye area after use. Applies and removes easily. No bad surprises here. Buy it.</li>
    <li> They came really dry... I thought they would&#x27;ve been a little wet when I opened the individual package. I added rose water... They weren&#x27;t very... Relaxing under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend a product called &amp;#34;frownies&amp;#34; eye gels. They&#x27;re moist on opening and you keep them hydrated with a rose water or whatever you like. Keep them in the fridge for a puffy eye fix. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Definitely make your eyes feel refreshed and firmer in only 15 min. It also makes you take time to sit down and relax.</li>
    <li> It appears to work for a short time... ... after the 10th pad, effects are not very long lasting. In a couple of days the issues returned;</li>
    <li> Probably need to use regularly to see real results.</li>
    <li> Dark circles under my eyes are gone for the day, in just minutes.</li>
    <li> The Kinoki eye pads are a dream sent., they really work.  They have really helped me.  It makes my eyes feel so refresh.  I love them.</li>
    <li> The product felt good to use, but no there were no visible difference with the  existing dark circles under my eyes</li>
    <li> These foot pads really wrk...I was a little skeptical at first but after using them..I felt a difference...I did not wake up lazy and tired...I woke up energized n rdy to go...</li>
