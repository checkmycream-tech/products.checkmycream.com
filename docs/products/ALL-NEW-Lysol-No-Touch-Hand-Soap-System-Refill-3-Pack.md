      <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>The product itself is good.</li>
      <li>It has a nice silky feel on your hands and, while it does have a fragrance, it is not as overwhelming as the others.</li>
      <li>price was good and the product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the No Touch hand system.</li>
      <li>I love the no touch system  and so do my grandchildren.</li>
      <li>I have one in the kitchen and bathroom ad everyone seems to enjoy it.</li>
      <li>If you like everything to smell clean and medicinal, this is your choice.</li>
      <li>It only had one kind in it</li>
      <li>My favorite of the 3-pack by far is the Aloe Vera, which is has a lotion/cream consistency.</li>
      <li>I wish the scents were a little more creative, but they aren&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
      <li>go through them fast in the Fall/Winter!</li>
      <li>It was a bit too fragranced for me at first</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cucumber Splash was the first I used out of the 3-pack.</li>
      <li>After a while, I hardly noticed the fragrance at all and found it pleasant to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Secondly, it didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>i could have gotten it cheaper at Dollar General but wasn&#x27;t worth the effort of returning it</li>
      <li>Price is too high - i found out after i got it</li>
      <li>Since that has been a while ago, I don&#x27;t remember a lot about it other than it is a gel consistency and that its fragrance was very strong, especially at first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will find new source.</li>
      <li>These tend to be on the expensive side - glad to see a mix without the huge price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, they sent three of the same product...</li>
      <li>Add a little plastic tab here and there and the soap doesn&#x27;t fit in the dispenser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was surprised when all I got was 3 aloe vera.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have even made it that far if I would have had another refill on hand, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>(I am fragrance sensitive).</li>
      <li>I like the convenience if only the they didn&#x27;t the dispenser so top heavy.</li>
      <li>Should have read reviews because apparently this seller does this often.  </li>
      <li>Apparently we have the hand and dish dispenser</li>
      <li>Helps to keep everything clean and makes washing those dirty hands fun.</li>

<li> For me, it was BY FAR the worst of the pack--I found its fragrance disgusting and off-putting.</li>
<li> got 3 cucumber splash instead :(</li>
<li> Will use them but disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this refill 3 pack based upon the photo and product description but what they send is 3 cucumber. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and have returned the last 3-Pack because I wanted a variety pack , not 3 cucumber.  The product itself is good.</li>
    <li> These tend to be on the expensive side - glad to see a mix without the huge price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We go through them fast in the Fall/Winter!</li>
    <li> First, they sent three of the same product... all aloe.  Secondly, it didn&#x27;t fit.  Apparently we have the hand and dish dispenser NOT the hand dispenser.  Maybe a goal of Lysol campaign to get us to buy all their products?  Add a little plastic tab here and there and the soap doesn&#x27;t fit in the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was good and the product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The product works, just got the wrong ones. I ordered this because I wanted the 3 different soaps.  got 3 cucumber splash instead :(</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these multi packs shown above &amp; received 2 packages of 3 all with aloe only in them</li>
    <li> My favorite of the 3-pack by far is the Aloe Vera, which is has a lotion/cream consistency. It has a nice silky feel on your hands and, while it does have a fragrance, it is not as overwhelming as the others. It was a bit too fragranced for me at first (I am fragrance sensitive). After a while, I hardly noticed the fragrance at all and found it pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Total Care refill smells like a combination of Pine Sol and Listerine. If you like everything to smell clean and medicinal, this is your choice. For me, it was BY FAR the worst of the pack--I found its fragrance disgusting and off-putting. In fact, I only made it through 1/2 of the bottle before I had to switch out with another refill. I wouldn&#x27;t have even made it that far if I would have had another refill on hand, but I didn&#x27;t. I had to order and wait for another refill to arrive before I could switch out. Total Care is a gel consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cucumber Splash was the first I used out of the 3-pack. Since that has been a while ago, I don&#x27;t remember a lot about it other than it is a gel consistency and that its fragrance was very strong, especially at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my fervent hope that Lysol will dial back the fragrance on its soaps in the future, especially now that I am stuck with two of the dispensers (one of the kitchen systems and one hand-washing system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this 3-pack again. However, I have instead ordered a 2-pack of the Aloe Vera soap on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> I love the No Touch hand system. I have one in my kitchen and it is great when i need to wash my hands after cutting raw meat to simply wave my hand and the soap comes out. It also helps my children from spilling soap after squeezing to muck out.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a variety pack and when it they are all the same. I wish the pictures actually show what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I love the no touch system  and so do my grandchildren.Helps to keep everything clean and makes washing those dirty hands fun.</li>
    <li> 3 Cucumber splash instead of variety pack.  I had read other people with same issue, but took a chance.  Will find new source.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3 pack based on the picture and description.  I got 3 the same.  Should have read reviews because apparently this seller does this often.  Will return</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I manage before this product. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Getting one for my sister-in- law tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This did not come as a variety pack. It only had one kind in it, I was a little dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is so expensive here. Individual packaged refills are cheaper at Walmart. A lot cheaper!!! Why would I wana buy these from here?</li>
    <li> Price is too high - i found out after i got it i could have gotten it cheaper at Dollar General but wasn&#x27;t worth the effort of returning it</li>
    <li> I wish the scents were a little more creative, but they aren&#x27;t offensive.  My hands always feel a little slimy after I use it, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s the moisture I&#x27;m not used to in my hand soap.  LOL  I like the convenience if only the they didn&#x27;t the dispenser so top heavy.</li>
    <li> I have one in the kitchen and bathroom ad everyone seems to enjoy it. I&#x27;d recommend this, because of sanitary reasons.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because it came with 3 different types of hand soap.  Was surprised when all I got was 3 aloe vera.  Will use them but disappointed. If arrived as advertised would have gotten a 5 star rating.</li>
