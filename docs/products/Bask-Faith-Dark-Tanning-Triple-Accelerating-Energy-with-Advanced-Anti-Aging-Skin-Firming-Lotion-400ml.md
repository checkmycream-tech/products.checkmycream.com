      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Not so good.</li>
      <li>Wanted a hot air brush and ordered this by mistake, but it is an awesome product</li>
      <li>It makes nice curls.  </li>
      <li>I liked that one a lot.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get to hot as others have said just the right temperature for the perfect cur.</li>
      <li>I have been using curling brush products for many years, so I am not a novice on how to use one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times.</li>
      <li>I love all my helen of troy products.  </li>
      <li>Love the ease of use of this product.  </li>
      <li>I probably do not replace them for 10 years or more.</li>
      <li>Works just fine on my longer hair.</li>
      <li>the size of the brush still works fine.</li>
      <li>I suspect that this is a cheap knock off as the Helen of Troy logo on the iron&#x27;s handle faded away within a week or two.</li>
      <li>The end knob rotates freely and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; kept falling out while using the brush.  </li>
      <li>I wish this would have worked better, gets hot.</li>
      <li>The teeth on this particular model appear to be more brittle and break easily if dropped or gets bumped.</li>
      <li>Some areas are totally cool to the touch.  </li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when my latest one was absolutely abysmal.  </li>
      <li>The appliance felt cheaply made, right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is exactly the size I was looking for and it looks to be a quality product.  </li>
      <li>hot brush, though.</li>
      <li>but I would prefer more heat settings instead of just high and low.</li>
      <li>some ways.&lt;br /&gt;The one inch is too large for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There is another Helen of Troy model that is made of a hard plastic which I think is more comfortable on the scalp.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this brush to be purchased as it is very unsafe and could cause someone to be injured if the element was touched.&lt;br /&gt;Lynette</li>
      <li>This brush iron works very well.  </li>
      <li>I really like conair because the bristles don&#x27;t break, and it turns off aftern1/2 hour.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>It is my ch better than other models (1512 &amp; 1514).</li>
      <li>Long bristles/teeth hold hair securely.</li>
      <li>It worked okay for curling my hair, so I kept it, and wouldn&#x27;t you know it really started acting up shortly after the expiration date for returning it.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would work better, but will stick with a typical curling iron.  </li>
      <li>This is adequate except occasionally one of the brush rods slides out of place</li>
      <li>Judging from some of the other reviews, I also suspect this is a cheap knock-off.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair that is very straight.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time the next day on the low setting and it got so hot that it melted the handle and</li>
      <li>I frequently wouldn&#x27;t realize it until I burned my head or hand</li>
      <li>This Helen Of Troy 1&amp;#34; brush iron is really the only one I can find.</li>
      <li>Now when I turn it on, only parts of the heating surface actually get hot.  </li>
      <li>With styling products and this curling iron, I can create a style that has soft loose curls/waves that look very feminine.  </li>
      <li>Major problem:  </li>
      <li>The heat function is twice as hot as previous models.  </li>
      <li>The Brush heated up fairly qickly, however the rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; were spaced so far apart, it is very difficult to use without burning your fingers, which I have had happen every single time I have used it.  </li>
      <li>My old one, that I believe had the same #1517, had long bristles and the end of it was stationery.</li>
      <li>For me, both had one major problem and a minor problem.  </li>

<li> The unit takes a long time to heat up.  </li>
<li> Minor problem:  </li>
<li> and I haven&#x27;t had it very long.</li>
<li> bristles are very short and do not hold hair well at all for curling like my previous one.....</li>
<li> This is my 3rd one because I use it everyday.</li>
<li> I have only had it for a few weeks</li>
<li> My only criticism would be that the iron is a little bit hard to hold.  </li>
<li> The thing works well but after less than a year the bristles got brittle and broke off.</li>
<li> This one the wire prongs seem to be sharper than my previous one although I still like this one.  </li>
<li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I was getting such poor results.</li>
<li> The short bristles on the model I received are bad and the end of it is not tight and goes around and around when I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair.</li>
<li> I had one of these for at least seven years previously until the plastic cracked.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve actually been wanting one of these for awhile, they stopped selling them in stores, I&#x27;m only slightly disappointed regarding the heat settings.  </li>
<li> Tried to correct spelling and was unable to go back.</li>
<li> are a bit hard on it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m keeping it because the 1&amp;#34; brush iron is hard to find but this unit needs improvement.  </li>
<li> This product is poorly made.</li>
<li> and when I would look at the ground to find the teeth, I had stepped on them and broken them.  </li>
<li> Seriously!</li>
<li> Unfortunately burned myself because of it.</li>
<li> Without their protection I find it impossible to use the tool.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. I&#x27;ve had it less than a month and the high setting quit working.</li>
    <li> bristles are very short and do not hold hair well at all for curling like my previous one.....am returning it for different one.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one because I use it everyday. I take it with me to Europe and the electrical systems are a bit hard on it. This Helen Of Troy 1&amp;#34; brush iron is really the only one I can find. It works really well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Model 1517 is a great buy. Long bristles/teeth hold hair securely. It is my ch better than other models (1512 &amp; 1514).</li>
    <li> Not so good. Didn&#x27;t heat up properly after day 5.</li>
    <li> The short bristles on the model I received are bad and the end of it is not tight and goes around and around when I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair. I&#x27;ve burned myself I don&#x27;t know how many times. My old one, that I believe had the same #1517, had long bristles and the end of it was stationery. I liked that one a lot. I don&#x27;t like this one at all! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Your hair won&#x27;t stay around the teeny tiny bristles one bit.  Wished I had returned it.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work better, but will stick with a typical curling iron.  I wish this would have worked better, gets hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Helen of Troy curling iron for years.  Imagine my surprise when my latest one was absolutely abysmal.  The heat function is twice as hot as previous models.  I suspect that this is a cheap knock off as the Helen of Troy logo on the iron&#x27;s handle faded away within a week or two. If you want to fry your hair ( and your fingers/ neck, etc) this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> It does the job but I would prefer more heat settings instead of just high and low.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased one of these brush irons and it arrived on 15th April 2014.  I used it for the first time the next day on the low setting and it got so hot that it melted the handle and the brush component of the appliance fell away as I was holding it exposing the heating element.  I would not recommend this brush to be purchased as it is very unsafe and could cause someone to be injured if the element was touched.&lt;br /&gt;Lynette</li>
    <li> This brush iron works very well.  It makes nice curls.  My only criticism would be that the iron is a little bit hard to hold.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I love all my helen of troy products.  For me, they heat well, stay heated and do I what I am looking for with my hair.  Have used them for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Like I said I don&#x27;t like using an iron but it is great product in some ways.&lt;br /&gt;The one inch is too large for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I MUST SAY THAT I LOVE HELEN OF TROY PRODUCTS LOTS!!!</li>
    <li> The Brush heated up fairly qickly, however the rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; were spaced so far apart, it is very difficult to use without burning your fingers, which I have had happen every single time I have used it.  I have been using curling brush products for many years, so I am not a novice on how to use one. The teeth on this particular model appear to be more brittle and break easily if dropped or gets bumped.</li>
    <li> Needed an inexpensive curling brush iron.  This is adequate except occasionally one of the brush rods slides out of place and I didn&#x27;t notice.  Unfortunately burned myself because of it.</li>
    <li> The Brush Iron takes FOREVER to heat enough for the hair to hold the curls.  The blue printing on the handle has faded to almost nothing.... I suppose because of holding it.  The end doesn&#x27;t stay and sometimes the &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; slip out.  I would NEVER buy &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34; again.  I don&#x27;t even use it anymore and I haven&#x27;t had it very long.</li>
    <li> I have short hair that is very straight.  With styling products and this curling iron, I can create a style that has soft loose curls/waves that look very feminine.  I would recommend this product to those with similar hair length.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Helen of Troy curling brushes. This one met  my expectations like the others. The 1&amp;#34; is perfect size for what I wanted. Doesn&#x27;t get to hot as others have said just the right temperature for the perfect cur.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these about 3-4 months ago.  One has already died - just quit heating.  For me, both had one major problem and a minor problem.  Major problem:  The end knob rotates freely and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; kept falling out while using the brush.  I frequently wouldn&#x27;t realize it until I burned my head or hand and when I would look at the ground to find the teeth, I had stepped on them and broken them.  Minor problem:  The unit takes a long time to heat up.  I also don&#x27;t like that the unit will not turn off automatically.  Helen of Troy bought out Belson several years ago and why they don&#x27;t make the Belson Pro 1&amp;#34; BP 2661 is beyond me.  It was  great curling iron and if it was still being made, I would buy it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m keeping it because the 1&amp;#34; brush iron is hard to find but this unit needs improvement.  Automatic shut off is a MUST! And the &amp;#34;stay cool&amp;#34; end....doesn&#x27;t - so watch out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been wanting one of these for awhile, they stopped selling them in stores, I&#x27;m only slightly disappointed regarding the heat settings.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Arrived prior to estimated delivery. Works great. Excellent purchase would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Helen if Troy is always my choice when choosing curling brushed and curling irons. I have used Helen of Troy for years and have found they last a very long time. I probably do not replace them for 10 years or more. Seriously!</li>
    <li> Works just fine on my longer hair. I just got ir cut shorter &amp; the size of the brush still works fine. I would buy this product again &amp; recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> It is exactly the size I was looking for and it looks to be a quality product.  I have only had it for a few weeks so I hope I will continue with this opinion.  It heats well.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly made. The brush part of the iron comes apart and does stay together. Sometimes it separates while in my hair. It is junk.</li>
    <li> The thing works well but after less than a year the bristles got brittle and broke off. Without their protection I find it impossible to use the tool. Pretty disappointing. I really like conair because the bristles don&#x27;t break, and it turns off aftern1/2 hour. Cannot find a conair 1&amp;#34; hot brush, though. Tried to correct spelling and was unable to go back.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of use of this product.  Wanted a hot air brush and ordered this by mistake, but it is an awesome product and I use it daily!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.  Judging from some of the other reviews, I also suspect this is a cheap knock-off.  The appliance felt cheaply made, right out of the box.  Also, it took forever to heat up.  It worked okay for curling my hair, so I kept it, and wouldn&#x27;t you know it really started acting up shortly after the expiration date for returning it.  Now when I turn it on, only parts of the heating surface actually get hot.  Some areas are totally cool to the touch.  No wonder I was getting such poor results. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for at least seven years previously until the plastic cracked.  This one the wire prongs seem to be sharper than my previous one although I still like this one.  There is another Helen of Troy model that is made of a hard plastic which I think is more comfortable on the scalp.</li>
