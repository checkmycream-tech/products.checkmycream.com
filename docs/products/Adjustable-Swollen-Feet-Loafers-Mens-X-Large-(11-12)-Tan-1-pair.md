<ol>
      <li>They&#x27;re Wonderful for my father in laws swollen feet!</li>
      <li>Great item...</li>
      <li>They were a gift and they work great for swollen feet</li>
      <li>Very nice slipper, I would recommend that you buy these</li>
      <li>&amp; all the Aide&#x27;s complement him on how nice they look!</li>
      <li>At $20 good for swollen feet in house slippers</li>
      <li>My father has parkinsons and his feet swell all the time these are great easy to get on and off and comfy</li>
      <li>He doesnot have swollen feet but liked the look of them.  </li>
      <li>as with most things you get what you pay for....</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>They were warm and comfortable.</li>
      <li>great if your feet are really swollen.</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable, warm and fit  swollen feet, but they are made of cheap material.</li>
      <li>I am returning these and finding something nicer looking and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>and they were huge.</li>
      <li>they didn&#x27;t fit well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>light and well made for the money.</li>
      <li>They look a bit &#x27;klunky&#x27; but love the fit and ability to mod the fit as needed (swollen feet...).  </li>
      <li>These loafers are perfect since they open  completely and can be adjusted to fit the foot.  </li>
      <li>(I figured even if they were too large, he is not going to be walking in them and they would be okay).  </li>
      <li>Too bulky and doesn&#x27;t  fit right.</li>
      <li>He really likes how comfortable they feel.</li>
      <li>Construction not as good as expected</li>
      <li>was going to return them, but at this price it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
      <li>there was just enough for the top overlaying flap to secure to the sides-</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>so I do not know how long they will last but for this price they are a great buy.</li>
      <li>First off, they are butt-ugly.</li>
      <li>Wish the backs were a bit higher or stiffer tho.</li>
      <li>These accomplished that.  </li>
      <li>just what I needed and came fast.</li>
      <li>These were the only things that would fit on them.</li>
      <li>and because only part of the top is actually stuck to the Velcro, the bottom part sticks out like wings.  </li>
      <li>As a diabetic with neuropathy, I often get cold feet and was looking for a slipper that would help keep my feet warm while staying secure on my feet.  </li>
      <li>Shipped reasonably fast- ordered on a Wednesday, arrived the following Monday by USPS.</li>
      <li>He is in a wheel chair and his feet are very swollen, especially around the instep.  </li>
      <li>our elderly relative had very sore feet</li>
      <li>The staff told me they really like them as it made the job of dressing my relative a lot easier.  </li>
      <li>Because of the swelling, he needs one size Larger than he normally wore.  </li>

    <li> The cheapest shoes ever!</li>
    <li> These were purchased for a friend who is very limited physically.  He loves&lt;br /&gt;These slippers, so of course I recommend them for any one who has&lt;br /&gt;Limitations especially tying shoes or having problems with swollen feet.</li>
    <li> Very nice slipper, I would recommend that you buy these</li>
    <li> NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PICTURE, VERY POOR QUILETY, THERE JUNK AND YOU SHOULD BE SUED FOR SELLING STUFF LIKE THIS</li>
    <li> Stretched out of shape and were hard to keep on.Construction not as good as expected</li>
    <li> My father has parkinsons and his feet swell all the time these are great easy to get on and off and comfy</li>
    <li> Only had for a week and the velcro is comming off</li>
    <li> They were warm and comfortable. At $20 good for swollen feet in house slippers</li>
    <li> As a diabetic with neuropathy, I often get cold feet and was looking for a slipper that would help keep my feet warm while staying secure on my feet.  These accomplished that.  Although I have a 10 wide shoe size, I ordered the 11-12 so I could wear socks if desired.  My only complaint (hence the four star rating) is the amount of Velcro on the slipper- there was just enough for the top overlaying flap to secure to the sides- and because only part of the top is actually stuck to the Velcro, the bottom part sticks out like wings.  Shipped reasonably fast- ordered on a Wednesday, arrived the following Monday by USPS.</li>
    <li> great if your feet are really swollen. our elderly relative had very sore feet and they were huge. These were the only things that would fit on them. they are durable and work well. light and well made for the money.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re Wonderful for my father in laws swollen feet! He really likes how comfortable they feel. &amp; all the Aide&#x27;s complement him on how nice they look!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These slippers are the first found during a long and tedious search which allowed me to put them on easily due to swollen feet, and a high instep.</li>
    <li> as with most things you get what you pay for....it fills my needs for now</li>
    <li> They look a bit &#x27;klunky&#x27; but love the fit and ability to mod the fit as needed (swollen feet...).  Wish the backs were a bit higher or stiffer tho.</li>
    <li> Great item...just what I needed and came fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased the slipper for my Dad. He doesnot have swollen feet but liked the look of them.  He felt the slippers were too big and could not get the slippers tighter with the velcro</li>
    <li> First off, they are butt-ugly. They don&#x27;t look that bad in the photo, but man, they be oogaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they didn&#x27;t fit well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return them, but at this price it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Too bulky and doesn&#x27;t  fit right. Hard to adjust the Velcro to keep your heels from sliding up and down. I am returning these and finding something nicer looking and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> They were a gift and they work great for swollen feet</li>
    <li> only had them for a couple of weeks and the bottoms are already coming off</li>
    <li> I bought these loafers for a relative in a long term nursing facilty.  He is in a wheel chair and his feet are very swollen, especially around the instep.  Because of the swelling, he needs one size Larger than he normally wore.  (I figured even if they were too large, he is not going to be walking in them and they would be okay).  These loafers are perfect since they open  completely and can be adjusted to fit the foot.  The staff told me they really like them as it made the job of dressing my relative a lot easier.  The only con is that delivery is via snail mail.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I received them so I do not know how long they will last but for this price they are a great buy.</li>
    <li> They are very comfortable, warm and fit  swollen feet, but they are made of cheap material.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEN&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;MR PAUL MARIA</li>
    <li> The velcro on one strap was torn.  We returned them</li>
