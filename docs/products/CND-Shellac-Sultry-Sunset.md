      <li>wish Shellac colors were labeled to best describe the actual color inside...</li>
      <li>I thought it might be more of a purple</li>
      <li>Very pretty under the sun :)</li>
      <li>It came on time and was an accurate color match.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful shimmery pink with a lean on the lavender tones.  </li>

      <li>While it is a pretty color I don&#x27;t care for metallics.  </li>
      <li>but I am so excited that it is more of a metallic magenta pink!</li>
      <li>Not quite as bright as I thought it would be, a shimmery soft pink color.</li>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>This is very close.</li>
      <li>More of a metallic pink</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a little more frost than I prefer, but it is a pretty color.</li>
      <li>A little different color that i thought, but its good</li>
      <li>Hope some new color might have a touch of frost too.</li>
      <li>I love the slight purple tones in the pink and the bit of metallic to it.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty pink that lasts two plus weeks without chipping and staying shinny.</li>
