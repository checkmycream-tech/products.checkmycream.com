      <li>Over all, good purchase.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for some colors.</li>
      <li>i believe it was a good investment.</li>
      <li>I bought these pencils with hopes of using them as eyeliners (because of all the good reviews on them).</li>
      <li>I loved all the shades and colors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are very pretty colors, and perfect for bases under shadows.</li>
      <li>and hello the milk one is famous!</li>
      <li>they will crease, but they are amazing to use under eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>I received them today, im in love with them, they are a great addition to my make-up collection if you use MILK as a primer they dont crease easily.</li>
      <li>I am so glad i purchased this set even though it was a nice chunk out my wallet</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, glides on and washes off completely.</li>
      <li>My husband said the look was &#x27;striking&#x27;...</li>
      <li>And another bonus is that mine came with 32 shades, not 27 :).</li>
      <li>Love the quality of the pencils.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully will be able to order them separately.</li>
      <li>and i Love the fact that i now can add these to my huge makeup collection.cant</li>
      <li>any time I see any makeup sets I go nuts, I Love NYX and I have to get any sets they put out there, these pencils are fabulous,</li>
      <li>but it gets humid easily and moves when I blink...</li>
      <li>The texture is great for blending, but they crease and the color runs off eventhough you apply primer and/or similar eye shadow.</li>
      <li>I love them all was worth</li>
      <li>I am in love with every single color, they are so vibrant and beautiful.</li>
      <li>these can be utilized in so many other creative ways, lip liners brow filler, concealer, blush, and the list goes on!</li>
      <li>They come packaged three at a time, and I&#x27;ve kept them organized in that way, makes it super easy when you want to create a certain look.</li>
      <li>The colors are so pretty and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product and first of all it got lost in the mail!</li>
      <li>Its worth it to buy all 27 because its cheaper to buy them all together rather than buying each one separately.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny, stay cool and it will work.</li>
      <li>Vibrant colors and glides on smooth.</li>
      <li>the white one (milk) is the one I use the most, any color you use over</li>
      <li>for shimmery/metallic colors i prefer using the actual nyx color then ur eye-shadow (preferably pigments).. makes ur eye shadow look like it has more quality.</li>
      <li>These pencils are sold individually and are pretty pricey in my country (Trinidad) so to get this many of them for this price was a steal of a deal.</li>
      <li>I noticed it happens when I don&#x27;t apply an eye primer first.</li>
      <li>Not long lasting at all.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and packaging was pretty good.</li>
      <li>This set pretty much has every color you can imagine.  </li>
      <li>It came pretty fast in the mail</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product to everyone!</li>
      <li>Preparing for the Look of London, I bought this set while I hired a cosmetic consultant, dress consultant and even a jewelry consultant to put together a well thought out, very flattering trio of colors that I could mix and match for my 2 1/2 week stay.  </li>
      <li>Very peacock-y.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product immensely.</li>
      <li>On normal to dry skin I don&#x27;t find these to crease as much as many say.</li>
      <li>it is vibrant and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how vibrant the colors of these pencils are.  </li>
      <li>I received my order a few days ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely this was packaged.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be ordering more items in the future.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are worth it if you calculate that individually they&#x27;re 4.50 or more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I cant even complete the rainbow with these 27 colors they made up!</li>
      <li>The colors are vivid and have stayed on without fading or bleeding until I washed them off.  </li>
      <li>But, for certain skin tone colors like the Sparkle nude, it&#x27;s totally possible.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I own a marketing firm which recived our biggest international account last summer.  </li>
      <li>NO REGRETS!</li>
      <li>; colors one reviewer complained about are no longer available.</li>
      <li>I have pretty severe dark circles, and the smudges don&#x27;t help me with that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I made the purchase for which are the yellow, orange, cherry and hot pink.  </li>
      <li>My favorite so far as been lime green, icy blue, and dark purple.</li>

<li> I made the purchase for which are the yellow, orange, cherry and hot pink.  </li>
<li> My favorite so far as been lime green, icy blue, and dark purple.</li>
<li> i think it is, but this set will definitely come with ur main ones black bean and milk.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the novel, but hopefully this helps someone!</li>
<li> One tip for you guys...when using as an eye shadow or eye shadow base, make sure to apply an eye primer first so the colors won&#x27;t crease or get runny.</li>
<li> I debated for a long time and finally decided to make the purchase.</li>
<li> you can look yourself, they dont sell the red pink orange or yellow anymore.</li>
<li> I did not recieve the colors; pink, cucumber, orange, cold, sparkle nude, sparkle lepord, knight, electric blue, peacock, purple velvet, true gold, colbolt, and red.</li>
<li> I was kind of disappointed</li>
<li> If you have oily lids you need to use a base as they tend to crease , they are creamy and blend out smoothly, very pigmented and shadows stick to them and show true to color.</li>
<li> /&gt;It was a total waste of a purchase, and I will never buy this again.</li>
<li> These pencils glide on with no pulling or dragging of the delicate eye tissue, so easy, the smoothest pencil liners I&#x27;ve ever used (even including the expensive department store ones.)  </li>
<li> However, you will get all the other colors.  </li>
<li> I can see how this would work well as eyeshadow base, it&#x27;s creamy, and it&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
<li> I like these a lot, I use it in many ways, sometimes as a liner other times as a base.</li>
<li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
<li> These little puppy will let you go from London Tower..to the ferris wheel on Coney Island.  </li>
<li> got a green that isnt what you wanted it to be?</li>
<li> Not sure if this was a fluke</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not going to list all the colors, because I&#x27;m not sure if it varies by vendor.</li>
<li> They can be used for numerous things such as a base for eye shadow, eyeliner, highlighter, cheeks etc.</li>
<li> But seriously, that&#x27;s the end of the benefits.</li>
<li> I received the NYX jumbo eye pencil shadow liner in the mail and had the expecation of seeing all the colors, unfortunately that was npt the case.</li>
<li> ill have 32</li>
<li> Also,  the pencil sharper that comes with the purchase is worthless.</li>

    <li> I am so glad i purchased this set even though it was a nice chunk out my wallet i believe it was a good investment.I have used them before and i Love the fact that i now can add these to my huge makeup collection.cant wait to recieve them i did also purchase the 5 that didnt come with this set AS well 5 instead of 27 ill have 32</li>
    <li> I love them all was worth the money spent!I would recommend them to anyone.Vibrant colors and glides on smooth.Excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I loved all the shades and colors. The texture is great for blending, but they crease and the color runs off eventhough you apply primer and/or similar eye shadow. Not long lasting at all.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and packaging was pretty good.</li>
    <li> This set pretty much has every color you can imagine.  Love the quality of the pencils.  Wonderful addition to my eye makeup collection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but I didn&#x27;t get the colors that&#x27;s I made the purchase for which are the yellow, orange, cherry and hot pink.  So if you are looking for those colors they are not included.  However, you will get all the other colors.  Over all, good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these after my daughter told me about them.  These pencils glide on with no pulling or dragging of the delicate eye tissue, so easy, the smoothest pencil liners I&#x27;ve ever used (even including the expensive department store ones.)  The colors are vivid and have stayed on without fading or bleeding until I washed them off.  One evening, I simply lined my upper eyelid with the Electric Blue pencil, put on some mascara and finished up with lipgloss.  My husband said the look was &#x27;striking&#x27;...that&#x27;s how vibrant the colors of these pencils are.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and was as described. Packaging was excellent and all the pencils were intact and sealed. Was a gift to my sister who is a makeup artist and she loves them. These pencils are sold individually and are pretty pricey in my country (Trinidad) so to get this many of them for this price was a steal of a deal. Will definitely be ordering more items in the future.</li>
    <li> It came pretty fast in the mail and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier with my purchase. I know that some of the colors are no longer there but, I&#x27;m still happy with it. I know others are going to say these aren&#x27;t the colors in the pictures but, you have to remember some on the colors has been discontinue. The colors are so pretty and goes on smoothly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I own a marketing firm which recived our biggest international account last summer.  Preparing for the Look of London, I bought this set while I hired a cosmetic consultant, dress consultant and even a jewelry consultant to put together a well thought out, very flattering trio of colors that I could mix and match for my 2 1/2 week stay.  These little puppy will let you go from London Tower..to the ferris wheel on Coney Island.  The only problem I have is I am about to run out of the browns and blacks.  Hopefully will be able to order them separately. Wonderful product, glides on and washes off completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to list all the colors, because I&#x27;m not sure if it varies by vendor. But i can tell you I had to buy the following by themselves because they didn&#x27;t come in the set: Iced Mocha, Cottage Cheese, Strawberry Milk, Yogurt, and Sparkle Nude.&lt;br /&gt;They are worth it if you calculate that individually they&#x27;re 4.50 or more.&lt;br /&gt;They are very pretty colors, and perfect for bases under shadows. As you may have seen from youtube tutorials though, you do need a primer or something for it to stick to so it doesn&#x27;t crease. I have yet to wear one of the pencils by itself without setting it without a shadow over it. But, for certain skin tone colors like the Sparkle nude, it&#x27;s totally possible.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to verify what colors the vendor has put together in their set, email them and ask them for all the color names.&lt;br /&gt;I have collected all 32 i think it is, but this set will definitely come with ur main ones black bean and milk.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the novel, but hopefully this helps someone!</li>
    <li> I received the NYX jumbo eye pencil shadow liner in the mail and had the expecation of seeing all the colors, unfortunately that was npt the case. I did not recieve the colors; pink, cucumber, orange, cold, sparkle nude, sparkle lepord, knight, electric blue, peacock, purple velvet, true gold, colbolt, and red. Also,  the pencil sharper that comes with the purchase is worthless. It&#x27;s just flimsy piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> they will crease, but they are amazing to use under eyeshadows. got a green that isnt what you wanted it to be? use a nyx jumbo pencil. and hello the milk one is famous! these are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;also, the &amp;#34;primary&amp;#34; colors one reviewer complained about are no longer available. you can look yourself, they dont sell the red pink orange or yellow anymore. could stand to update the photo.&lt;br /&gt;bottom line: an excellent staple and excellent price!</li>
    <li> I like the colors but it gets humid easily and moves when I blink...It&#x27;s funny, stay cool and it will work. probably during winter!</li>
    <li> these are very good eyeliners, and u dont have to stop there these can be utilized in so many other creative ways, lip liners brow filler, concealer, blush, and the list goes on! very good quality!</li>
    <li> Um, It says 27 jumbo eyeshadow pencils...AND I GOT 32. Not sure if this was a fluke but still, I&#x27;m very pleased! The packaging was AWESOME! They come packaged three at a time, and I&#x27;ve kept them organized in that way, makes it super easy when you want to create a certain look. My favorite so far as been lime green, icy blue, and dark purple. Very peacock-y. I enjoy this product immensely. I also ordered the lip pencils, I&#x27;ll be trying those out tonight!</li>
    <li> I bought these pencils with hopes of using them as eyeliners (because of all the good reviews on them). They smudge and crease. They make my eyes look like a panda. I can see how this would work well as eyeshadow base, it&#x27;s creamy, and it&#x27;s very smooth. But seriously, that&#x27;s the end of the benefits. I have pretty severe dark circles, and the smudges don&#x27;t help me with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a total waste of a purchase, and I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received them today, im in love with them, they are a great addition to my make-up collection if you use MILK as a primer they dont crease easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and first of all it got lost in the mail! It took like 3 weeks before I actually got my order! And my NYX jumbo eyeliner pencils dont look anything like the pic. WHERE ARE THE PRIMARYCOLORS? I didnt get none of them, I got numerous of pastel colors mixed with some neutrals! Im kinda upset paying all that money and I cant even complete the rainbow with these 27 colors they made up!</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;m a makeup  freak, any time I see any makeup sets I go nuts, I Love NYX and I have to get any sets they put out there, these pencils are fabulous,the white one (milk) is the one I use the most, any color you use over it is vibrant and lasts all day. If you have oily lids you need to use a base as they tend to crease , they are creamy and blend out smoothly, very pigmented and shadows stick to them and show true to color.</li>
    <li> MUA&#x27;s Best Buddies!&lt;br /&gt;Savings of 45% over drugstore cost. NO REGRETS! I will buy again! On normal to dry skin I don&#x27;t find these to crease as much as many say. I think they must have oily skin. Use a primer under!</li>
    <li> I received my order a few days ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely this was packaged. They came packaged in sets of 3. I am in love with every single color, they are so vibrant and beautiful. They can be used for numerous things such as a base for eye shadow, eyeliner, highlighter, cheeks etc. I am so happy I ended up getting these. I debated for a long time and finally decided to make the purchase. One tip for you guys...when using as an eye shadow or eye shadow base, make sure to apply an eye primer first so the colors won&#x27;t crease or get runny. I noticed it happens when I don&#x27;t apply an eye primer first. Other than that, no complaints! And another bonus is that mine came with 32 shades, not 27 :). The sharpener that comes with is also great. I highly suggest this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is literally the sh. I cant believe I JUST DISCOVERED IT. I use it over my primer and under my eye shadow. people like the white one, i do too, however.. it&#x27;s good for some colors. for shimmery/metallic colors i prefer using the actual nyx color then ur eye-shadow (preferably pigments).. makes ur eye shadow look like it has more quality.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot, I use it in many ways, sometimes as a liner other times as a base. I was kind of disappointed I didn&#x27;t get all the colors in the pictures</li>
    <li> Its worth it to buy all 27 because its cheaper to buy them all together rather than buying each one separately. They work well.</li>
