      <li>I was glad to see them again.</li>

      <li>I drilled a hole in the pivot, put a pin in there to hold it together, it&#x27;s ok, but expect to do that</li>

      <li>If I put this in my purse it will smell so strong others around me would be able to smell it.</li>
      <li>if you hold it by the handle itll break but its an easy fix.</li>

      <li>but if I did I could see how easily the flexible rubber would split over time.</li>
      <li>I love this--small, opens into a full size brush and a mirror to check makeup.</li>
      <li>Opening the brush and using it is fine.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>I could run my fingers through my hair, but this is fine.</li>
      <li>and I was able to use super glue to reattach it.  </li>
      <li>These are cheap cheap cheap and fall apart almost immediately, and the brush &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; also inverts way too easily.</li>
      <li>It is nice and very functional.</li>
      <li>They are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It is cheaply made</li>
      <li>Works well for a cheap brush.  </li>
      <li>I got this brush last year and it was great</li>
      <li>This folding hair brush can fit on my pocket, my backpack&#x27;s pocket and even in my jacket&#x27;s pocket.</li>
      <li>but well enough made as that goes with plastic and rubber, a good value, and will work well in our motorhome.</li>
      <li>Perfect size, seems to be well made, though there is some serious off-gassing from the plastic.</li>
      <li>It was shipped and arrived quickly after the order was submitted.</li>
      <li>This is fine for what it is, though it&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t charge a little more and make it a bit more robust and stout.  </li>
      <li>Just great for travel or everyday.</li>
      <li>The brush is clearly made out of potent chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine blonde hair</li>
      <li>Good little comb for travel.  </li>
      <li>You do not get a better one by paying name-brand prices; probably one company in China makes these in all different colors.</li>
      <li>I will not be using the mirror most likely.</li>
      <li>If the new one breaks so quickly, I will be warning everyone against this item.</li>
      <li>I soaked it in warm (not hot!)</li>
      <li>No color choice was available to me, but I like the red one</li>
      <li>/&gt;it really does stink&lt;</li>
      <li>A toxic rubber/plasticy smell that permeated the whole room.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say here...</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re great for travel, but the handle is very weak and will break if you consistently use it.  </li>
      <li>There are other brushes that work, in terms of closing them, 100% better.</li>
      <li>The brush is exactly what I thought it would be as far as quality.</li>
      <li>Fits in my purse nicely and that is what it&#x27; small about.  </li>
      <li>this little brush is so cute and folds up nice and small.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get a new travel brush; like other reviewers the circular one I had was cute but not very functional.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have if I&#x27;m running late and don&#x27;t have a chance to brush my hair before I leave</li>
      <li>I like it much better than the old circular compact brush that I had previously</li>
      <li>The hinge pops out sometimes, but it&#x27;ll slide right back in.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice it unless I put my nose right up on it (smells like a basketball, not that I&#x27;ve played in the last 10-15 years</li>
      <li>Great concept, very poor execution.</li>
      <li>so I simply snapped it back into place with no problem (even if I wasn&#x27;t able to snap it back</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a compact mirror and a small travel brush than try to save space in your purse with this product.</li>
      <li>It is the first thing I smell when I open my purse.  </li>
      <li>The black foldable portion of the brush is not well made, and the rest of the brush is cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Great brush for a small purse, however I got a blue one when I wanted the pink one pictured.</li>
      <li>but that is old technology.</li>
      <li>I know these are so old school</li>
      <li>I tried soaking it to reduce the odor, and now there&#x27;s a smudge of grade or glue near the end that won&#x27;t wash off.  </li>
      <li>It seems substantial and I recommend it if you do not fold it much or expect long life.</li>
      <li>When I unfolded the brush,,,one side was not firm, and collapses back into the folding position, so the brush was not usable.</li>
      <li>Be aware all of them that look alike, whether &#x27;Lewis and Clark&#x27; or other fancy name, are all the same except for the color and logo and the cheapest are culled to sell lower because of the plastic smell.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;teeth&#x27; on this brush are a little pointer than the round brush, and the rubber that holds the bristle part is better attached to the sold support.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for just 3 weeks - not even every day - and today one stroke through wet hair broke the thing in half right at the joint!</li>

<li> The joint piece constantly comes unhinged every single time.</li>
<li> Cheap and TOO expensive for the price.</li>
<li> but when it is closed the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; snaps loose and needs to be snapped back in place.</li>
<li> The hing is a little wobbly, though it does open and close properly.  </li>
<li> My last one broke at the handle hinge after less than a year, so lesson learned.  </li>
<li> Also, if you have thick hair, it&#x27;s easy to break the thin rods that hold the brush or to tear the rubber that holds the brush.  </li>
<li> Also, I find that the back of the brush which flexes to open the brush is very stiff and doesn&#x27;t work</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works well for a cheap brush.  Sometimes folds back into itself when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> This folds nicely and does not smell. I do not intend on folding it but if I did I could see how easily the flexible rubber would split over time. If you sat on it the plastic and mirror would break. It is cheaply made but well enough made as that goes with plastic and rubber, a good value, and will work well in our motorhome. I will not be using the mirror most likely. It seems substantial and I recommend it if you do not fold it much or expect long life. I had one before that I folded to travel with and it did not last long. I have a much better folding brush to travel with but it is made no-longer. This is good for what it is, I think. I could run my fingers through my hair, but this is fine. It is not much $ to spend. Be aware all of them that look alike, whether &#x27;Lewis and Clark&#x27; or other fancy name, are all the same except for the color and logo and the cheapest are culled to sell lower because of the plastic smell. You do not get a better one by paying name-brand prices; probably one company in China makes these in all different colors. I got a red one (wanted blue but so what).</li>
    <li> Received this item in a timely manner. Thought the only colors it came in was red and blue (because of the description) and one of those colors would be randomly chosen, but instead I recieved gold.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived in appropriate packaging, but the mirror had fallen out.  Thankfully the mirror was intact and I was able to use super glue to reattach it.  As other reviewers have stated, it does have an annoying petroleum type smell.  I soaked it in warm (not hot!) water with some shampoo, which helped reduce the intensity of the smell.  Hopefully it will fade with time and use.  The hing is a little wobbly, though it does open and close properly.  Despite these issues, the brush is quite functional and I will keep it handy in my briefcase to use at work.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s stocking, she loves it! It does how ever have a horrible rubber smell when you 1st take it out of the package, but it goes away. Also it said it would be blue or red and I got black.</li>
    <li> I put this brush in my purse and boy did I get a surprise when I went to pull it out.  The brush made my entire purse smell horrible . I&#x27;ve never complained about a plastic smell before, but this is insane.  I put the brush on my patio four days ago and maybe I&#x27;ll go get it, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;d rather just throw it away and go to the local beauty supply company and buy a brush for the same/less amount.</li>
    <li> While it does fold, the material is very stiff and stinks!  I tried soaking it to reduce the odor, and now there&#x27;s a smudge of grade or glue near the end that won&#x27;t wash off.  Since I don&#x27;t want to risk that gunk getting into my hair, I won&#x27;t use it, and it&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
    <li> This brush/mirror set looked just like another that I loved and was hoping to replace.  Unfortunately, this one was somewhat flimsy and smelled HORRIBLE.  A toxic rubber/plasticy smell that permeated the whole room.  Threw it out immediately and then had to get the stink off of my hands and out of the room.  Don&#x27;t buy it - total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Opening the brush and using it is fine. However when you close it, it comes apart and you have to snap it back together. There are other brushes that work, in terms of closing them, 100% better.</li>
    <li> The hinge pops out sometimes, but it&#x27;ll slide right back in.</li>
    <li> Can I Not rate LESS  than seem stars??? Their Grinch himself would not put this nasty smelling brush to his head.</li>
    <li> i wish i had read the reviews.  The brush had a terrible chemical smell.  I left it to air out for 2 weeks and finally threw it away.</li>
    <li> Just great for travel or everyday. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t carry a pursue.</li>
    <li> awful.  it broke after about a week of sporadic use.</li>
    <li> I usually read reviews and then decide but this time I ignored the advice and paid thd price. Sorry to all. These things smell worse than tires. Seriously. Tried washing them and gave up and threw them away.</li>
    <li> I know these are so old school but they are nice to have. I ordered it and within a few days it broke in my purse - yes I am a mom but it was my small purse… but for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I use these for travel and my gym bag.  These brushes work great and are very compact.  I think they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I bought it to carry in my backpack purse. Yes it did &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; at the hinge so I simply snapped it back into place with no problem (even if I wasn&#x27;t able to snap it back I don&#x27;t use the mirror anyway) and regarding the smell I don&#x27;t notice it unless I put my nose right up on it (smells like a basketball, not that I&#x27;ve played in the last 10-15 years but I like it :D)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I use it everyday? No but it&#x27;s nice to have if I&#x27;m running late and don&#x27;t have a chance to brush my hair before I leave (I wear it in a ponytail for work so I couldn&#x27;t care less)</li>
    <li> I got this brush last year and it was great but i just ordered this brush a week ago and it smells horrible don&#x27;t waste your money its the worst thing ever, its super disgusting.</li>
    <li> this little brush is so cute and folds up nice and small. it even has a little built in mirror. the one weird thing about it is that it is REALLY smelly. like, it smells like a tire shop. i tried soaking it in soap; yeah no. its still horribly smelly. i read one review that said someone put it out on their porch.... i&#x27;ll have to try that. its a shame cute its really cute and compact.</li>
    <li> This folding hair brush can fit on my pocket, my backpack&#x27;s pocket and even in my jacket&#x27;s pocket. I can easily fix my hair and look in the mirror when needed.</li>
    <li> The joint piece constantly comes unhinged every single time. Cheap and TOO expensive for the price. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I received two of these brushes today. The coating on both of them looks like it was scratched off on the sides of the brush. They are cheaply made. Not worth the price paid and not worth returning because shipping will cost almost as much as the brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these brushes and they both fell apart after two months. The black foldable portion of the brush is not well made, and the rest of the brush is cheap plastic. You&#x27;re better off buying a compact mirror and a small travel brush than try to save space in your purse with this product.</li>
    <li> There were a few problems with this product.  The mirror had come unglued and I had to glue it together myself.  Also, I find that the back of the brush which flexes to open the brush is very stiff and doesn&#x27;t work smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had a brush like this which I loved and was glad to find another even though it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
    <li> brush keeps popping apart&lt;br /&gt;bristles fine&lt;br /&gt;brush pops apart each time you open or close it&lt;br /&gt;it really does stink&lt;br /&gt;this one is definitely going back</li>
    <li> Brush works great, very compact. However, plastic has a gasoline smell that I hope goes away</li>
    <li> The brush is clearly made out of potent chemicals.  I&#x27;ve had it &amp;#34;airing&amp;#34; for a week now and it still has a very strong chemically plastic odor.  I also received the wrong color but that isn&#x27;t why I don&#x27;t plan on using it.  I don&#x27;t want it contaminating the contents of my bag or my hair.</li>
    <li> falls apart upon opening/closing. I drilled a hole in the pivot, put a pin in there to hold it together, it&#x27;s ok, but expect to do that</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a new travel brush; like other reviewers the circular one I had was cute but not very functional. I had hoped to find a &amp;#34;Rush Brush&amp;#34; - something my Dad found for me at an airport during the 1980&#x27;s...but that is old technology. No color choice was available to me, but I like the red one received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for just 3 weeks - not even every day - and today one stroke through wet hair broke the thing in half right at the joint! My hair is not snarly nor difficult to comb, and I was holding it at the joint to reinforce the strength of the brush stroke. Plainly, this brush is not strong enough to actually comb wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll replace it with the same product - ONCE - but only because it is so inexpensive. If the new one breaks so quickly, I will be warning everyone against this item.</li>
    <li> I love this--small, opens into a full size brush and a mirror to check makeup. I was looking for this after the one I was given as a gift broke.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, seems to be well made, though there is some serious off-gassing from the plastic. Just don&#x27;t take nose hit an you&#x27;ll be fine.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Handy for &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; my hair when I take my motorcycle helmet off. The mirror part is a joke though.</li>
    <li> nice brush, good quality. Fits nicely in a purse.</li>
    <li> I received this item about a week ago. It was shipped and arrived quickly after the order was submitted. I didn&#x27;t have a color choice, but I also didn&#x27;t care. I received the red brush. It is nice and very functional. I like it much better than the old circular compact brush that I had previously (it broke). The &#x27;teeth&#x27; on this brush are a little pointer than the round brush, and the rubber that holds the bristle part is better attached to the sold support. That being said, it smells really weird. I washed it in the sink, which helped a bit. I will keep it because I think it will fade over time.</li>
    <li> The brush is exactly what I thought it would be as far as quality. Not too great but not the greatest. I did&#x27;t get a choice of color but mine came in black. However it SMELLS terrible. In my opinion it smelled just like gasoline. My husband said it smells like a petroleum product. I soaked it in the sink with a stronger than hand soap detergent and it still smells. I put it on my porch to let the sun and air hopefully do some good for it. If I put this in my purse it will smell so strong others around me would be able to smell it. It&#x27;s that bad. If it doesn&#x27;t fade with the sun unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to toss it.</li>
    <li> Great brush for a small purse, however I got a blue one when I wanted the pink one pictured. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Good little comb for travel.  has a mirror which comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are a lil hard but i have no hair  :)</li>
    <li> Compact and handy, but it has a strange plastic chemical odor that is unpleasant.  It is the first thing I smell when I open my purse.  With time the odor is improving.</li>
    <li> This is fine for what it is, though it&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t charge a little more and make it a bit more robust and stout.  I&#x27;ve had one of these before and they&#x27;re great for travel, but the handle is very weak and will break if you consistently use it.  It&#x27;s best to just hold the brush itself and utilize the handle for the convenient folding mirror.  My last one broke at the handle hinge after less than a year, so lesson learned.  Still, hard to beat for this price - just don&#x27;t have high expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Poor craftmanship and quality</li>
    <li> Smelled like gasoline and broke in two days. We ignored the reviews as we thought, &amp;#34;how long could a brush smell?&amp;#34; But the smell never went away, like a bad house guest.</li>
    <li> I tried two different brushes from Amazon to replace a similar style that I had had for over ten years. These are cheap cheap cheap and fall apart almost immediately, and the brush &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; also inverts way too easily. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Unlike one of these I ordered before, this does smell like tires and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away. Also, if you have thick hair, it&#x27;s easy to break the thin rods that hold the brush or to tear the rubber that holds the brush.  Great concept, very poor execution. No point in buying this. Buy one at your local store if you must - at least that way you&#x27;ll know if it smells or not.</li>
    <li> Eh, you get what you pay for.  I have very fine blonde hair and it broke at the hinge as soon as I used it.</li>
    <li> this brush is ok, you have to hold it by the brush part for it to do the job. if you hold it by the handle itll break but its an easy fix. i reccomend getting a better brush</li>
    <li> As Described.  There isn&#x27;t much to say here...it is what it says, works well, seems like it will last.  It was a great price.  In quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> When I unfolded the brush,,,one side was not firm, and collapses back into the folding position, so the brush was not usable. very cheaply made.  not worth the purchase at all</li>
    <li> It broke when I tried to fold it. And it did smell really bad! I opened and returned it on the same day when I received it.</li>
    <li> Folded out and folded back in just fine, but I would not put it anyway near my hair because of the awful smell. It smelled like burning rubber, but worse.</li>
    <li> Fits in my purse nicely and that is what it&#x27; small about.  Have it if I need it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Fell apart after two uses.  I do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Concur with the reports of a horrible gasoline-like smell.  A whiff of it makes me cough up phlegm for an hour, gives me a headache, and causes my sinuses to throb.  I&#x27;m going to air it outside.</li>
    <li> great folding comb. I had one years ago and used it until it broke.  I was glad to see them again.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for keeping in your purse. Folds up small and I like the mirror on the handle</li>
    <li> good to keep in your purse or locker for windy days</li>
    <li> The item was as described, however there was a very strong petroleum odor. We soaked it in dish detergent to try to cut odor, it is getting better but still smells.</li>
    <li> Opens OK but when it is closed the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; snaps loose and needs to be snapped back in place.</li>
