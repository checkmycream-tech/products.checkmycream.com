      <li>Easy to use and keep clean too, for the price</li>
      <li>Some light pressure will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a good idea and has worked well for me for the most part.</li>
      <li>I have small hands and this tool is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to receive the product.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this hoping it would make cleaning my Sigma F80 easier.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t clean my makeup brushes every day</li>
      <li>, you can see all the makeup coming out of your brushes as you clean them.</li>
      <li>this makes brush washing so quick and pain free.</li>
      <li>This right here is a life saver for beauty geeks!</li>
      <li>The product is much smaller than my powder brush, but it surprisingly got the job done quickly.</li>
      <li>Package came in quickly.</li>
      <li>I also am cheap, so the cheaper price was much appreciated.</li>
      <li>I use it with castile soap on my brushes weekly, and it is a very effective little tool.</li>
      <li>It is quite small but works great</li>
      <li>It made it so easy to clean my brushes that I couldn&#x27;t believe it actually cleaned them!</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to some of the more expensive brush cleaner scrubs.  </li>
      <li>It cut the cleaning time of the flat top kabuki way down, and its satisfying to be able to watch the makeup come off all my brushes.</li>
      <li>(It was also my first time cleaning my makeup brushes.)</li>
      <li>Just use with regular handsoap and its a dream :)</li>
      <li>This is my first make up brush cleaning product.</li>
      <li>Used this for the first time today.</li>
      <li>The BrushEgg is gentle and has definitely extended to life of my brushes and I like that my brushes are always clean!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much bathroom space</li>
      <li>This brush cleaner is better than expected.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter, it works really well.</li>
      <li>I have Real Techniques brushes.</li>
      <li>Nice but small.</li>
      <li>Just a little bit of liquid castile soap and tepid water gets your brushes super clean.</li>
      <li>and how quickly it came in the mail I would definitely recommend and buy another one soon!</li>
      <li>I love this little thing.</li>
      <li>and it was fun (and gross)</li>
      <li>Nice and small, does the job!</li>
      <li>I only have 6 different makeup brushes, so this was fine.  </li>
      <li>Takes 15-20 seconds and brushes look like new.</li>
      <li>It makes foundation brushes softer than new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the EXACT same product, but it&#x27;s under $5!</li>
      <li>Washed my brushes this past weekend and this really helped get them clean.</li>
      <li>I really like that it actually cleans out the brushes</li>
      <li>to see all the old makeup come out.</li>
      <li>Does not fit 2 fingers, can barely fit one without squeezing it</li>
      <li>Other than that it is definitely worth the buy because it is so inexpensive and does the job.</li>
      <li>It usually takes me an hour or so (and lots of baby shampoo) to get all the brushes clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very tiny, barely fits on 2 of my fingers, but it does the job!</li>
      <li>Definitely a great alternative to that stupid brush cleaning glove by Sigma</li>

<li> I have a few in particular that aren&#x27;t holding up well after using this, but I have no way of knowing if that&#x27;s the brush&#x27;s fault or the egg&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My flat concealer brush, foundation brush and a buffing concealer brush.</li>
<li> /&gt;There is a similar name-brand product that is a glove that serves the same purpose, but I personally prefer this small alternative.</li>
<li> The only downside is that it may be a little too rough for some brushes.</li>
<li> not really meant for cleaning big fluffy faces brushes.</li>
<li> but your hand is flat and doesn&#x27;t have those little knubs that get into the dirt.</li>
<li> I will say that my fingers - two or three fit inside - get a little crampy when I use it, and if you get that hand wet, it will be difficult to keep it on, but that really is a small complaint for as well as this works.</li>
<li> I took a star down just because it&#x27;s not incredibly comfortable to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had seen this product on youtube for a while. I decided to test it out...it&#x27;s just $10. I used 3 brushes. My flat concealer brush, foundation brush and a buffing concealer brush. So I used a small drop of baby shampoo and all of the makeup and dirt and germs just dissolved. Now I know you&#x27;re thinking you can just do it with your hand...but your hand is flat and doesn&#x27;t have those little knubs that get into the dirt. Ladies, get this. Stock up.</li>
    <li> This a great product for the price. I almost purchased a much bigger type of this product, but it was 3 times the price. I only have 6 different makeup brushes, so this was fine.  It is small and even though I think you are supposed to put your fingers inside of it, I just held it in the palm of my hand.  I will clean my brushes more often with this product.</li>
    <li> Package came in quickly. Love the color!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this hoping it would make cleaning my Sigma F80 easier. I was more than satisfied with my purchase.  It cut the cleaning time of the flat top kabuki way down, and its satisfying to be able to watch the makeup come off all my brushes. Eye brushes are especially easy to clean on the top nubby parts</li>
    <li> Works great and good price. Would repurchase (my judge of how good something is).  I have Real Techniques brushes. Like that you can choose color here and not on the brush egg website :)</li>
    <li> This was a good choice to buy it</li>
    <li> Awesome ! You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This is my first make up brush cleaning product. I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup, but this cleaned my nasty old brushes with not much work needed. i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because you have to do a little maneuvering to keep the cleaner (bought separately) on the egg. Other than that it is definitely worth the buy because it is so inexpensive and does the job.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today. (It was also my first time cleaning my makeup brushes.) I was pleased by how easy it was to clean everything and it was fun (and gross) to see all the old makeup come out. Compact, easy to use, and cute! Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I shamefully admit that I normally take way too long between makeup brush cleanings because it&#x27;s a terrible, time-consuming chore. It usually takes me an hour or so (and lots of baby shampoo) to get all the brushes clean. With the BrushEgg I got everything done in under 20 minutes. The product is much smaller than my powder brush, but it surprisingly got the job done quickly. Tip: Don&#x27;t rub your brushes on this too vigorously. Some bristles on one of my brand-name brushes fell out, but that was my own fault for getting carried away. Some light pressure will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some other people here mentioned that the opening was too small for their fingers. For me, just holding the BrushEgg in my palm was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a similar name-brand product that is a glove that serves the same purpose, but I personally prefer this small alternative. I don&#x27;t have much bathroom space and I like that I&#x27;ll be able to travel with this instead of a huge, Yo Gabba Gabba-looking glove. I also am cheap, so the cheaper price was much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Great tool for helping clean your make up brushes effectively. The ridges help remove dirt &amp; oil and wash it away safely.</li>
    <li> This cuts down my brush washing time in half! I love this little thing. Definitely a great alternative to that stupid brush cleaning glove by Sigma</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It is quite small but works great</li>
    <li> Fantastic tool! It made it so easy to clean my brushes that I couldn&#x27;t believe it actually cleaned them! But it did, and I love it. Easy to use and way better than using your hands. I used baby soap but I heard olive oil and dish soap work too!</li>
    <li> Have 2 now. Works great for washing makeup brushes</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes. This has changed my brush cleaning experience! Just a little bit of liquid castile soap and tepid water gets your brushes super clean. The BrushEgg is gentle and has definitely extended to life of my brushes and I like that my brushes are always clean!</li>
    <li> This is such a good idea and has worked well for me for the most part. I feel like it gets more product out than just using cleanser on my palm like I used to. The only downside is that it may be a little too rough for some brushes. I have a few in particular that aren&#x27;t holding up well after using this, but I have no way of knowing if that&#x27;s the brush&#x27;s fault or the egg&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that the finger slot is too small for me for two fingers! I guess I have big forefingers... I just use one and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great brush cleaner! The best... You can also use it for your art brushes!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to some of the more expensive brush cleaner scrubs.  It&#x27;s very tiny, barely fits on 2 of my fingers, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> this makes brush washing so quick and pain free. Before I would dread cleaning my brushes because I knew the palm of my hands would be hurting by the time I finished. It&#x27;s easy to use this product and store it. This is my new best friend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so small and in the shape of an egg — that&#x27;s not comfortable, I don&#x27;t get it. But I guess I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t get genius&amp;#34; or something. Doesn&#x27;t matter, it works really well. I took a star down just because it&#x27;s not incredibly comfortable to use. It&#x27;s still really good. A really good cleaner, makes brush and sponge cleaning a real breeze.</li>
    <li> Some brushes are easier to clean than others but the Egg does a great job!  Will be purchasing some for friends and family!</li>
    <li> Nice and small, does the job!</li>
    <li> I love the brush egg. I never heard of it until I saw someone on YouTube talking about it. It&#x27;s great for eyeshadow brushes and medium sized brushes. I love it and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Does not fit 2 fingers, can barely fit one without squeezing it</li>
    <li> This right here is a life saver for beauty geeks! It cuts brush cleaning time in half! I really like that it actually cleans out the brushes, you can see all the makeup coming out of your brushes as you clean them. I definitely recommend this product for a cheaper alternative to the sigma spa glove!</li>
    <li> This thing gets crud out of makeup brushes like you would not believe. I use it with castile soap on my brushes weekly, and it is a very effective little tool. I will say that my fingers - two or three fit inside - get a little crampy when I use it, and if you get that hand wet, it will be difficult to keep it on, but that really is a small complaint for as well as this works.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner is better than expected.  It makes foundation brushes softer than new. Just use with regular handsoap and its a dream :)</li>
    <li> the most perfect things ever</li>
    <li> Though it be but little; it does the job!  I have small hands and this tool is perfect for me.  I applied the soap onto the Brushegg and used circular motions with my brushes, the build up from the lather cleaned them well.  Easy to use and keep clean too, for the price and how quickly it came in the mail I would definitely recommend and buy another one soon!</li>
    <li> nice stuff love it easy to use</li>
    <li> Love it. Washed my brushes this past weekend and this really helped get them clean. Plus, I can take the friction off of using my hand</li>
    <li> Nice but small. I need something bigger</li>
    <li> this is the cutest little brush cleaner ever!!!! its so easy to use and travel with! I use it only with my smaller eye brushes and concealer brushes. not really meant for cleaning big fluffy faces brushes.</li>
    <li> Very little.  I did not like.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the product. Used it immediately. Disappointed because it took a lot of scrubbing and difficult to wash it after using the brushes. I went back to the solution I use. Takes 15-20 seconds and brushes look like new. Others may like this and go for it. It is of a good, sturdy quality and I feel it won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> my brushes are squeaky clean now!</li>
    <li> Came fast works great</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I don&#x27;t clean my makeup brushes every day so this helps to give my brushes a thorough cleaning! It was also delivered quickly, which was Greg!</li>
    <li> I love it but Buy the one from &amp;#34;E2shop&amp;#34; instead!!! It&#x27;s the EXACT same product, but it&#x27;s under $5!</li>
    <li> Great way to clean your brushes!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price</li>
