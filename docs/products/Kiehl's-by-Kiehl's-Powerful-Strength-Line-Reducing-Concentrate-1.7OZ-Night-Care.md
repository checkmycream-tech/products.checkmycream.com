      <li>As for this product - fantastic.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so silky and smooth on my face.</li>
      <li>This is a great product but only use in the area&#x27;s that you need it.  </li>
      <li>but, now, two weeks later, she is still raving about how great a job</li>
      <li>This concentrate is very very lite, my face feels good very smooth and silky when I put it on and stays that way all day, you really see results right away,</li>
      <li>It feels warm when it is first applied and really seems to soften my fine lines!</li>
      <li>Liking it!&lt;br /&gt;Follow up to original review:  </li>
      <li>Now that I have been using this serum for a month I have noticed some significant changes in my skin.  </li>
      <li>White pleasant lotion came out.  </li>
      <li>And more over, after a week of use my whole face skin \\&quot;glowed\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I am thinking of returning to Amazon for full refund.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but my wife swears by it and wants to purchase more when this bottle is finished.  </li>
      <li>Normally, I put it on at night, and in the morning, my skin looks, for lack of a better word, brighter.  </li>
      <li>but it feels good and product has a long history.</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>Kiehl&#x27;s by Kiehl&#x27;s Powerful Strength Line Reducing</li>
      <li>Very suspicious whether it is in its original packing or has been opened before....</li>
      <li>I started to see the difference on my face right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SO smooth and SO soft!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the product does very much.  </li>
      <li>TRIED THE PRODUCT WITH SAMPLES AND HAVE JUST ORDERED THE FIRST OF MANY LARGER BOTTLES.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
      <li>This the first time I used this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different skin creams, including this one.</li>
      <li>So whatever this seller is putting in these bottles is not the true product or it&#x27;s old and expired.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, but when I went to apply it, clear liquid came out.</li>
      <li>At first I thought she was acting excited because I was the one who purchased it,</li>
      <li>It really does diminish wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I really noticed improvement in my skin after using.  </li>
      <li>If I put it on in the morning, someone will invariably comment that it looks like I got some sun that day -- not redfaced, but a bit pink in the cheeks for sure.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if this really &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for helping your skin</li>
      <li>I have been used this product for a while, it fits me very well&lt;</li>
      <li>I was ready for a change-up.  </li>
      <li>I used this product and it was really life changing.</li>
      <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;you can feel the heat as you apply it</li>
      <li>Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Takes a while but the results show sure worth the money, bottle last a long time and I will buy it again and again.</li>
      <li>I love the original product purchased from the Kiehl&#x27;s store at SFO airport, but this one I just received from Amazon seemed watered down and does not have the same look and feel.  </li>
      <li>It does sting a tiny bit when I put it on, but not badly.  </li>
      <li>I buy high end beauty products</li>
      <li>I have dry skin,  and I tried many kinds of facial serum</li>
      <li>She had a girls&#x27; weekend during which they shared all the new and brightest beauty stuff.  </li>
      <li>Much better than my usual cream.</li>
      <li>The clear liquid coming out was greasy.</li>
      <li>My fav vitamin C lotion so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been spending so much on products and procedures to stop the anti-aging process, but neglected my internal body system.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re ready for something different.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes, since I do use other Kiehl products, but this one didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really see results, but my skin likes it and looks fresher.</li>
      <li>When the product arrived, there was no outside packingC only a bare bottle with taped-up pump.</li>

    <li> 1. I have been used this product for a while, it fits me very well&lt;br /&gt;2. the price is Ok.&lt;br /&gt;3. this product makes my face soothe and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;4. i&#x27;ll continue to use it .</li>
    <li> I sampled this and loved its seemingly immediate results with my skin. A Kiehl&#x27;s fan for years.. , I usually purchased their lotions and shampoo. But this line-reducing concentrate is fabulous, and I use it every day, regardless of what I put on top in terms of moisturizer/sunscreen/bronzer.</li>
    <li> really works!&lt;br /&gt;you can feel the heat as you apply it and you can see your fine lines disappear as you wipe them away with your fingers!</li>
    <li> When the product arrived, there was no outside packingC only a bare bottle with taped-up pump. Therefore, it is not hard to imagine the mess it made in the mailing package. Very suspicious whether it is in its original packing or has been opened before....Indeed Disappointing.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love what it does. I previously purchased it at Neiman Marcus. Being on travel, I could not get to the store,so I looked it up on Amazon.  Arrived quickly, but when I went to apply it, clear liquid came out. So I shook it, opened the bottle and stirred the white lotion at the bottom, but still same result.  The clear liquid coming out was greasy. I went back to my samples from Neiman&#x27;s I had laying around and compared. White pleasant lotion came out.  So whatever this seller is putting in these bottles is not the true product or it&#x27;s old and expired. Came in Costco packaging, that was odd. Will not buy from this seller again.  BE AWARE!!!!!  Love the product and will order from Neiman&#x27;s now.  Not worth the hassle of return.</li>
    <li> For one year I&#x27;ve been looking for products to improve my fine lines between my cheeks and eyes area. I have dry skin,  and I tried many kinds of facial serum but they all \\&quot;kind of\\&quot; worked but never gave me \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; moments. Then I tried this product! Then it was the \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; moment the next morning after I woke up. I could hardly see the lines! And more over, after a week of use my whole face skin \\&quot;glowed\\&quot;. It&#x27;s SO smooth and SO soft! Now my face feels moist ALL DAY!! LOVE IT LOVE iT!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really see results, but my skin likes it and looks fresher. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered it online from Amazon (love Amazon) after having lunch with a friend of mine.  She had a girls&#x27; weekend during which they shared all the new and brightest beauty stuff.  I remarked to E, my friend, she looked great.  And she did.  That&#x27;s how I learned about kiehls.  it has made a difference for me in the smoothness of my skin and overall texture.  I was ready for a change-up.  I buy high end beauty products but after awhile I think your face gets used to them and you&#x27;re ready for something different.  The only drawback which may make some women stop and think is the fact that it is a bit on the oily side.  That fact doesn&#x27;t bother me.  A great find for me and hopefully for others.</li>
    <li> It does sting a tiny bit when I put it on, but not badly.  If I put it on in the morning, someone will invariably comment that it looks like I got some sun that day -- not redfaced, but a bit pink in the cheeks for sure.  Normally, I put it on at night, and in the morning, my skin looks, for lack of a better word, brighter.  Yes, that sounds like marketing schtick, but I&#x27;m not a marketer and I mean what I say.  My skin looks brighter the next day.  My fav vitamin C lotion so far.  (I keep the bottle in the box and under my sink where it will stay cool and dark to help preserve the vitamin C, bottle is dark, but not completely opaque.)</li>
    <li> This concentrate is very very lite, my face feels good very smooth and silky when I put it on and stays that way all day, you really see results right away,</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It feels warm when it is first applied and really seems to soften my fine lines!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different skin creams, including this one. Used it daily for about a week, then stopped because it was making my facial skin look WORSE. Gave me a slightly &amp;#34;haggard&amp;#34; look, like if I had been outside battling the wind on a cold blustery day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revagin skin cream for $25 including shipping is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far selling on amazon.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quickly.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in wrinkles but this product makes my skin feel and look great!  I would definetly purchase again.  (I have only been using for 4 days)</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in wrinkles but this product makes my skin feel and look great! I would definetly purchase again. (I have only been using for 4 days)</li>
    <li> I am not sure Kiehl&#x27;s will reduce any of these 70+ years of wrinkles but it sure feels good on my face and makes my foundation look great.  Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife found a review for this product in a magazine and wanted to try it to see if it would help her face look smoother.  She has been using this product for a couple of weeks now (daily) and continues to rave about it.  At first I thought she was acting excited because I was the one who purchased it, but, now, two weeks later, she is still raving about how great a job it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but my wife swears by it and wants to purchase more when this bottle is finished.  That&#x27;s proof enough for me!</li>
    <li> I love the original product purchased from the Kiehl&#x27;s store at SFO airport, but this one I just received from Amazon seemed watered down and does not have the same look and feel.  I am suspicious if the the bottle is very old or fake...I am thinking of returning to Amazon for full refund. It was $20 cheaper than buying at the Kiehls store.....</li>
    <li> Decided to try this product after reading reviews and comparing ingredients.  I was previously using C-Esta by Jan Marini.  I did not like the pasty feeling of this serum and it did not absorb well into my skin. Went back to C- Esta.  If it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> I really noticed improvement in my skin after using.  It&#x27;s smoother and fresher looking.  I use it in the morning after cleansing, prior to using sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Takes a while but the results show sure worth the money, bottle last a long time and I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but only use in the area&#x27;s that you need it.  I put this product on my entire face and after a month of using it I had a bad acne outbreak.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with acne for one year after using Kiehl&#x27;s ultra cleanser. Now I only use on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so silky and smooth on my face. Much better than my usual cream. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. I started to see the difference on my face right away. It really does diminish wrinkles. I can feel and see that it works. I finally found what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT. HAVE USED FOR A MONTH AND CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE LINES AROUND MY EYES!!! TRIED THE PRODUCT WITH SAMPLES AND HAVE JUST ORDERED THE FIRST OF MANY LARGER BOTTLES.</li>
    <li> I am 56, with age related lines.  I don&#x27;t think the product does very much.  I had high hopes, since I do use other Kiehl products, but this one didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me</li>
    <li> I used this product and it was really life changing. I&#x27;ve been spending so much on products and procedures to stop the anti-aging process, but neglected my internal body system. I realized a simple product isn&#x27;t going to fix the damaging I&#x27;ve done over the years, but a total change in lifestyle is necessary, as well. As for this product - fantastic. Used it after a Vitamin C facial and was amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  I am constantly changing products.  I tend to stay with one moisturizer and switch up serums a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this makes you skin feel warm when applied.  My skin looks dewy and feels great.  Liking it!&lt;br /&gt;Follow up to original review:  Now that I have been using this serum for a month I have noticed some significant changes in my skin.  My skin is smoother, pores are reduced, and wrinkles seemed to have be reduced as well.  I plan to stay with this product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this really &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for helping your skin but it feels good and product has a long history.</li>
    <li> Kiehl&#x27;s by Kiehl&#x27;s Powerful Strength Line Reducing Concentrate--/1.7OZ  is what I want. It delivered on time as stated in the website.</li>
    <li> This the first time I used this product. It is working as I expected. After using this for a week, I noticed the lines on my face are getting visibly lighter.</li>
