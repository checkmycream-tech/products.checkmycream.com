      <li>Great for travel.</li>
      <li>I took this on vacation with me and it worked just great.</li>
      <li>Awesome, I love it and plan on getting another</li>
      <li>cute and does its job!</li>
      <li>Heats up very quickly and works great.</li>
      <li>Tourmaline is a nice plus as well.</li>
      <li>I can also create nice waves and curls with it.</li>
      <li>Great for traveling and for quick touch ups at work.</li>
      <li>Perfect for those little fly away hairs</li>
      <li>Love the heat case that comes with it.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have gotten one with more heat settings instead of just on and off.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I want!!!</li>
      <li>I have Shoulder length hair and it works on my hair pretty good.</li>
      <li>Pleased with the size and quick heating.</li>
      <li>Great flat iron</li>
      <li>Good if your hair is thinner, and short.</li>
      <li>It is compact, it heats quickly and efficiently, and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It works, and it works quickly, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like large hair tools, and this is perfect for smoothing small areas.</li>
      <li>The price was right ($19.99) and it came with a heat resistent pouch which makes traveling that much simpler.</li>
      <li>This iron heats up fast, and its smaller size is easy to use around the ears.</li>
      <li>have had this since June and since its 450 degrees I can make my hair instantly straight in one swipe.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine and wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and arrived in a solid box</li>
      <li>The flat irons works great on getting into tight places with short hair.</li>
      <li>Live and learn</li>
      <li>After using this I realize how my larger flat iron is not that good - i.e., this leaves my hair finer with less frizz and no fly-aways</li>
      <li>Other than that it turned on right away and was ready to go in about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>I have also straightened my whole head and it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it intended for long hair so much.</li>
      <li>probably works, but I live in australia and this has an american power outlet.</li>
      <li>Use this everyday to smooth out the little hairs close to my scalp.</li>

<li> Only complaint is the cord is too short.</li>
<li> I have very short hair, but need a little smoothing and this does the job!</li>
<li> I purchased this flat iron to tame the hair around my neck.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
<li> The only complaint that I have is that there is no automatic cut-off.</li>
<li> Because some of iron is not free bolt, so I could not use when I visit another countries.</li>
<li> you want to tame or to get the hair close to your scalp without burning your head.</li>
<li> My hair is very thick and takes a long time to fully straighten with this item.  </li>
<li> But it is small and convenient for packing.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s clearly small and made for travel.  </li>
<li> My hair is way too thick for this.  </li>
<li> but I wish that the cord did not ravel all the way to the end every time I use it, which can be very annoying...</li>

    <li> It fulfill my expectations</li>
    <li> It works, and it works quickly, so I can&#x27;t complain. Tourmaline is a nice plus as well. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Please realize when it says mimi it means mimi also i haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I  don&#x27;t  like how you can&#x27;t adjust the heat....it is just on and off...I use a 3/4th&amp;#34; for my bangs so I  don&#x27;t want the 400°on them. But we will see I am going to try it today. Maybe it will be great.</li>
    <li> cute and does its job! perfect for travel too!</li>

    <li> Perfect for those little fly away hairs you want to tame or to get the hair close to your scalp without burning your head. Use this everyday to smooth out the little hairs close to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I took this on vacation with me and it worked just great. It is compact, it heats quickly and efficiently, and gets the job done. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Awesome, I love it and plan on getting another</li>
    <li> After using this I realize how my larger flat iron is not that good - i.e., this leaves my hair finer with less frizz and no fly-aways</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to tame the hair around my neck. I was using my curling iron, but was getting burns on my neck. Oh they hurt! The 3/4 inch size does the trick. This iron heats up fast, and its smaller size is easy to use around the ears. An extra bonus is the heat-proof case that comes with it.</li>
    <li> My hair is way too thick for this.  Good if your hair is thinner, and short.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron but I wish that the cord did not ravel all the way to the end every time I use it, which can be very annoying...That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> probably works, but I live in australia and this has an american power outlet. So who knows ? I will have to buy an adaptor so I can use it. Just assumed if they were posting it here, they would know i need an australian plug outlet. Live and learn</li>
    <li> This is a great travel straightener! I used to have the bigger version of the Infiniti pro and have been looking for a travel version. The price was right ($19.99) and it came with a heat resistent pouch which makes traveling that much simpler. My only regret is that it isn&#x27;t a bigger plate size. Other than that it turned on right away and was ready to go in about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> The flat irons works great on getting into tight places with short hair. I don&#x27;t think it intended for long hair so much. Only complaint is the cord is too short.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works as described</li>
    <li> Pleased with the size and quick heating. The only complaint that I have is that there is no automatic cut-off.</li>
