### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I like it for post swimming showers and I am so happy not to have recurring dermatitis!</li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>But on my skin it works as advertised to rinse pool chemicals away and leave my skin feeling great even after being in the pool for an hour.</li>
      <li>This soap is great for removing the chlorine odor from skin after swimming or spa.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so thankful Amazon carries this great product.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>smells good, gets rid of chlorine smell.</li>
      <li>This product has worked fairly well for me in containing swimmers itch in a pool</li>
      <li>Good soap for swimmers.</li>
      <li>ingredient list is fairly short:&lt;br /&gt;Saponified Olive, Coconut and Palm Oils; Distilled Water; Soymilk, Fragrance, Color,</li>
      <li>I bought another bar since, I&#x27;m convinced this is a good product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not $8-$9 dollars a bar good.</li>
      <li>Have been very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about effectively using a gel or lotion-type of product.</li>
      <li>This bar is great; no artificial preservatives or perfumes.</li>
      <li>The crystals can be added to pint size spray bottle and works better than the soap.  </li>
      <li>I like the soap bar much better</li>
      <li>Not 100% better, maybe 75%</li>
      <li>I participate in water aerobics and this soap has been a lifesaver, love it</li>
      <li>I read on the internet works even better.  </li>
      <li>The chlorine smell from the pool completely washes away, leaving you smelling fresh and your skin feeling great!  </li>
      <li>Nice fresh sent.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a good product.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll stick with it until I learn about a more reasonably priced equally effective remedy.</li>
      <li>I opened the box, the fragrance seemed extremely strong and perfume-y.</li>
      <li>The supplier answered my questions promptly and accurately.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten either sinus symptoms or dermatitis from it, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to use anything too</li>
      <li>It works and I love the fresh body smell after bathing with this soap.</li>
      <li>great for regular swimmers</li>
      <li>Paraben and sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results, and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I guess that would be a minus if you like fragrance with staying power, but I&#x27;m happy to use the least-scented things</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why or how it worked, but the result was good enough for me</li>
      <li>In fact, even when I used it in the shower for the first time the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as it had been upon opening the box.</li>
      <li>The product was quickly despatched.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this soap would be any better than regular moisturizing soaps.</li>
      <li>Seems cheap, but haven&#x27;t really used it yet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Soap is good but with absolutely no incentive to buy in bulk</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try if you have a reaction to pool water.</li>
      <li>A nice product, but can&#x27;t determine that it does anything different than bath soap I was using.</li>
      <li>Now the smell is gone right away.</li>
      <li>Its a LOT better than regular soap</li>
      <li>This soap bar really works!  </li>
      <li>Would probably buy it again, though, as it works better than regular soap.</li>
      <li>Though my legs still itch occasionally, I chalk that up to winter dryness more than improper chlorine removal.</li>
      <li>It an absolute must for swimmers!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got the same anti-chlorine ingredient, is cheaper and more convenient to obtain.</li>
      <li>This soap ruined a brand new swim suit!!</li>
      <li>In short, it&#x27;s working, smells fine.  </li>
      <li>but really works</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind so much being overcharged for the bar of soap itself.  </li>
      <li>Works very well to get rid of the chlorine smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I have to pack so much</li>
      <li>It lathers well (even in hard water) and rinses clean, and that&#x27;s most of what I look for in a soap.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>Plan to order some more and have given it to other people to help them with chlorine problems after swimming.</li>
      <li>But being charged $4 more for the shipping...and charging the same shipping rate PER BAR is a total ripoff.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this soap to take off chlorine smell from your body after swimming.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it those who suffer chlorine itch.</li>
      <li>and I usually get itchy skin after swimming for an hour or more.</li>
      <li>This soap effectively removed the smell of chlorine from my skin, but left my skin feeling really dry, devoid of any moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Cuts the chemical smell and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>but it has a fairly decent odor wherein the shampoo I buy locally has a somewhat chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>Buy Basis for sensitive skin at your local grocery/pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>soap itself does not dry out my skin, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good or bad.</li>

<li> The bar has a subtle scent, not too much lather, and is long lasting.</li>
<li> However, the smell has diminished considerably over just a few weeks.</li>
<li> If you have problems with dry skin, do still use a moisturizer post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to regular soap</li>
<li> I ordered the chlorine neutralizing bar soap, not available locally, to use in conjunction with anti-chlorine shampoo.  </li>

<li> They&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
<li> I used to have an unpleasant chlorine smell on me after swimming.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> My son gets a horrible pool rash and I hoped this soap would neutralize the chlorine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The supplier answered my questions promptly and accurately. The product was quickly despatched. The soap is not strong smelling although there is a slight fragrance. It produces a low amount of lather / foam which I prefer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I swim several hours a week and this works well to get rid of the chlorine smell.</li>
    <li> This soap is awsome.  I used to have an unpleasant chlorine smell on me after swimming.  It used to take a day and two showers to remove the chlorine smell.  Soap + removes the smell instantly! It an absolute must for swimmers!</li>
    <li> Seems cheap, but haven&#x27;t really used it yet.</li>
    <li> I gave this soap a try as a way to combat chlorine, and it did not disappoint. It lathers well (even in hard water) and rinses clean, and that&#x27;s most of what I look for in a soap.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, the fragrance seemed extremely strong and perfume-y. However, the smell has diminished considerably over just a few weeks. In fact, even when I used it in the shower for the first time the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as it had been upon opening the box. I guess that would be a minus if you like fragrance with staying power, but I&#x27;m happy to use the least-scented things I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is fairly short:&lt;br /&gt;Saponified Olive, Coconut and Palm Oils; Distilled Water; Soymilk, Fragrance, Color, Chlorine Neutralizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say what the chlorine neutralizer IS, however, and also doesn&#x27;t identify the fragrance or color used. Fortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten either sinus symptoms or dermatitis from it, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to use anything too noxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself does not dry out my skin, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing. If you have problems with dry skin, do still use a moisturizer post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I participate in water aerobics and this soap has been a lifesaver, love it</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to relieve the itching I get from the chlorine pool that I use at my gym and it works, thank goodness</li>
    <li> This bar really helps with getting that annoying chlorine smell off of your skin.  I tried a number of soaps and multiple showers before purchases this soap.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good or bad. A nice product, but can&#x27;t determine that it does anything different than bath soap I was using.</li>
    <li> My son gets a horrible pool rash and I hoped this soap would neutralize the chlorine. It did nothing. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> great for regular swimmers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve swam since I was five and I usually get itchy skin after swimming for an hour or more. This soap is advertised as neutralizing chlorine but I&#x27;m still itchy so I guess it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Removed some, not all of chlorine smell from my skin. Would probably buy it again, though, as it works better than regular soap.</li>
    <li> Its a LOT better than regular soap however I can still smell the chlorine 3 days and 3 showers later.</li>
    <li> This soap has been a God-send for me as pool chemicals were causing&lt;br /&gt;me a great deal of grief and very dry skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Solutions solved my problem.  I guard it for the specific use in the shower immediately&lt;br /&gt;after every time I get to the pool for exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other soaps don&#x27;t cut the problem nor sooth the itch.</li>
    <li> This soap works well at removing chlorine from your skin after swimming. I do water aerobics daily and use this regularly.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this soap would be any better than regular moisturizing soaps. But on my skin it works as advertised to rinse pool chemicals away and leave my skin feeling great even after being in the pool for an hour. I bought another bar since, I&#x27;m convinced this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with this product.  I suffer from a chlorine allergy and this has helped. Plan to order some more and have given it to other people to help them with chlorine problems after swimming.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of chlorine odor and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t smell the chlorine on myself anymore.  Thanks for a good product.  Also reminds me of the soaps I used as a child!</li>
    <li> This soap, when applied generously does indeed abate the awful itching caused by chlorine on sensitive areas. I highly recommend it those who suffer chlorine itch.</li>
    <li> Lap swimming three times a week in the local public pool suddenly began to give me dermatitis issues.  I ordered the chlorine neutralizing bar soap, not available locally, to use in conjunction with anti-chlorine shampoo.  Having resolved the dermatitis, this soap appears to be protecting me, so to speak, from further recurrence.  Not only that, but it has a fairly decent odor wherein the shampoo I buy locally has a somewhat chemical smell.  In short, it&#x27;s working, smells fine.  I like it for post swimming showers and I am so happy not to have recurring dermatitis!</li>
    <li> This product has worked fairly well for me in containing swimmers itch in a pool</li>
    <li> Buy Basis for sensitive skin at your local grocery/pharmacy.  It&#x27;s got the same anti-chlorine ingredient, is cheaper and more convenient to obtain.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I swim at lunchtime and you could still smell the chlorine on me, as well as the affect it has on my skin and I needed a product to get it off. Since it is at the Y and I have to pack so much, I wanted a bar soap so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about effectively using a gel or lotion-type of product. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results, and I have extremely sensitive skin. I definitely don&#x27;t smell like chlorine anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. Works very well to get rid of the chlorine smell. Only complain is the $4.00 shipping cost. What&#x27;s that all about?</li>
    <li> Swimming in a pool almost everyday leaves my skin feeling dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this and I have used it once.  After my shower my skin felt less dry and tight. Not 100% better, maybe 75% better.&lt;br /&gt;The soap left a slight residue. It has a nice smell.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I swim at my local \\&quot;Y\\&quot; three times a week, and have started using this soap in addition to my chlorine removal shampoo and conditioner. The bar has a subtle scent, not too much lather, and is long lasting. Though my legs still itch occasionally, I chalk that up to winter dryness more than improper chlorine removal. I&#x27;m going to continue using this (and since I can&#x27;t buy it locally, I have to order it via the Internet). Good product!</li>
    <li> A daily 45 minute swim in a salt water pool eventually left me with a body-wide rash that looked like hives. After using this soap bar for a few days following my daily swim the rash disappeared. I don&#x27;t know why or how it worked, but the result was good enough for me and now I see it after every swim. It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to regular soap but I&#x27;ll stick with it until I learn about a more reasonably priced equally effective remedy.</li>
    <li> . . . although I still have some problems caused by a skin allergy to chlorine. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try if you have a reaction to pool water.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Cuts the chemical smell and leaves your skin soft. Good soap for swimmers. I will keep buying this product</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this soap to take off chlorine smell from your body after swimming. It works and I love the fresh body smell after bathing with this soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for removing the chlorine odor from skin after swimming or spa. My granddaughter has an allergy to spa and pool chemicals leaving her skin red and itchy. This soap removes it and all the itching and redness!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of the soap</li>
    <li> This soap ruined a brand new swim suit!! I used it on my skin and rinse my swimsuit thoroughly and it RUINED IT!! Will never buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive yes but really works</li>
    <li> Soap was helpful, but price was a rip-off.  I didn&#x27;t mind so much being overcharged for the bar of soap itself.  But being charged $4 more for the shipping...and charging the same shipping rate PER BAR is a total ripoff.  Someone in this company has poor business judgement.  Seller obviously believes their product is so necessary buyers will pay any price for it.  They&#x27;re wrong.  Suggestion I read on the internet works even better.  Buy a $10 bottle of vitamin C crystals and a bar of peppermint soap from Trader Joes.  The crystals can be added to pint size spray bottle and works better than the soap.  A jar of vitamin C crystals will last forever and ends up being ridiculously cheaper than this overpriced soap.  Soap is good but with absolutely no incentive to buy in bulk it&#x27;s not $8-$9 dollars a bar good.</li>
    <li> I used to have a faint chlorine smell on my skin from swimming a few days each week.  I switched to this soap, and rub my skin with a wash cloth.  I haven&#x27;t smelled chlorine on my skin again!</li>
    <li> smells good, gets rid of chlorine smell.</li>
    <li> I am in a pool 5-6x/week. In order to keep my skin from chlorine sensitivity I always shower immediately after the pool. This bar is great; no artificial preservatives or perfumes. Nice fresh sent. Paraben and sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Before using this soap my skin smelled of chlorine several days (and several showers) after using the pool. Now the smell is gone right away. I like the soap bar much better that liquid version of similarly working product because of ease of use and no risk of spilling it in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> This soap effectively removed the smell of chlorine from my skin, but left my skin feeling really dry, devoid of any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This soap bar really works!  The chlorine smell from the pool completely washes away, leaving you smelling fresh and your skin feeling great!  I&#x27;m so thankful Amazon carries this great product.</li>
