<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ultimate detangler and shiner for good hippies everywhere</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year.  This product gives my hair excellent shine without any buildup.  There&#x27;s very little alcohol.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the very best hair shine product I have used.  The others either didn&#x27;t deliver or they worked minimally.  This works ladies; try it and you will like it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You just need small amount.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product at my hair salon in Brooklyn, NY. Whenever I get my hair done, I try to take a peek at the products that they use so that I can buy them and use them when I don&#x27;t have time to always run to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;I am an african american woman who has what they would call \\&quot;good hair\\&quot;. I do not use a relaxer, but I do use a flat iron to get the bone straight styles. When my stylist used this product, the first thing that grabbed my attenion was the fanastic smell!!!! OMG I LOVE THE SMELL... lol... The mist itself is a light oil, but the mist comes out so fine that if you spray it in your hands it will NOT leave a greasy feel. This product will give your hair a great sheen, and smell. It&#x27;s so light that you can use it everyday just to freshen your look.  I ended up purchasing two bottles on the spot.  Even though you don&#x27;t know me from a can of paint, just know that if you are seeking a misting spray that will leave your hair smelling like you just stepped out of the salon - BUY THIS PRODUCT. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. However, if you are looking for a \\&quot;con\\&quot; to this product - I would say that its the price. For $23 this small bottle may be considered steep if you compare it with a mist that you can get at your local duane reade/CVS HOWEVER, some times you get quality you will have to spend some money, and when it comes to hair, especially my nature long hair, this price tag isn&#x27;t that expensive when you compare results that a product like this will bring!</li>
    <li> The best product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Smells amazing too:-)</li>
    <li> It works very well. It is easy to use and has no smell. I highly recommend even for very long hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted the hairspray. Got something else I won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> If I was restricted to only two hair products from now until the end of time, this would be one of them.  I love all of the Eufora products, but this is the one I can&#x27;t live without.  As long as I use a high quality moisturizing shampoo, all I need is a few spritz of Eufora Illuminate Mist and my hair moves beautifully, has a stunning shine, and has a smoothed look to it, even if I decide to curl or flip.  The best part is that my hair feels amazingly soft and flowey.  I have super thick, coarse and generally big hair that needs to behave!  It&#x27;s not easy to tame it, but this product does it effortlessly and there is no heaviness at all; quite the opposite as a matter of fact.  I put it on when my hair has air dried for about 10 minutes and then lightly spray all over the surface of my hair.  After that it is a normal blow dry and my hair is good to go!</li>
    <li> So happy just like the one I would buy from the salon. Works great with the sculpture styling glaze!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Your hair looks and smells great.  Does not take much of this product  to do the job.</li>
    <li> This product is really great !  It sprays on in a very fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it produces a terrific shine.  My hair tends to be \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; (it is very fine in texture) and this product smoothes my hair down and makes it look professionally done, even though I get a good haircut only every three weeks.  No perms, no coloring, just terrific, shiny hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I pretty much use nothing but Eufora products.  I have used Illuminate Shine Mist for over a year now, and wouldn&#x27;t wash and dry my hair without it.  My hairdresser is a real expert on Eufora and travels the country doing demonstrations and teaching classes.  I have very, very, baby fine hair that is colored and highlighted.  So, I need products that will protect my processed hair without weighing it down.  In my case, I&#x27;m not really looking for shine, I have very shiny straight hair.  However, this product is an absolute must for anyone who needs to protect their hair from too much heat - hair driers and irons especially.  Once my hair is washed and carefully combed out, I put about a quarter size blob of Eufora Sculpting Glaze and about four spritzes of Shine Mist in my hand, rub together to mix and apply to my hair.  It works great.  My hair dries quickly with quite a bit of body.  You can use a couple more sprays of the Mist if you use any kind of iron on your hair to protect it from the heat.  My hair is in great shape.  I highly recommend Eufora.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for seven years and have no intention of switching. I mix this with the glaze to product my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I use this spray before the flat iron. I use in combination with Eufora Beautifying Serum. Both products together tame &#x27;blowsy&#x27; type hair to produce beautiful results.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER! I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW! SO HAPPY I FOUND IT ON AMAZON:) WAS $26 IN MY SALON! AND THE SMELL IS AMAZING! EVERYONE I GO AROUND...SAY\\&quot; OMG...WHAT HAIR PRODUCT DO YOU USE!? IT SMELLS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!</li>
    <li> Great product that I use along with my styling gel prior to blow-drying.  Does not weight your hair down. A tiny bit goes a long way. One bottle lasts me over a year!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shine without heaviness very easy light spray mist  has a very nice scent to it too  revives dry hair</li>
    <li> I use this product mostly for a sunscreen on my color treated hair, and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday, especially in the summer months.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR ,THESE IS MY 5 BOTTER AND I LOVE IT ,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,NOT GREESE,GOOD ,SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> Hello.  As an experienced and well educated Eufora user and salon professional, I think it is important for all buyers to know that when you purchase this product online, that you are *NOT* getting what you pay for.  Eufora is a professional product that should only be purchased in a salon.  The men and women who legally sell Eufora work closely with Eufora to insure that only the best ingredients are put into your product.  When a product like this is diverted to online retailer the only purpose is to make a quick profit.  It is common knowledge that these products can not be trusted as genuine Eufora Product and are often altered and watered down to make more available.  This product is an ALOE based product and should not contain a single drop of water in it.  Water compromises the integrity of this product and it *WILL NOT* work as intended.  If you would like to use *real* eufora please visit a salon near you and request it.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> My former beautician used this on my hair. It not only gave my hair shine but it made my hair smell nice &amp; fresh. I would&lt;br /&gt;recomend this product to anyone. The price was good &amp; delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair super soft and silky with shine that will last all day long...be careful though, a little goes a really long way! I use this after I blow dry with the Volume Infusion and I just love my hair!</li>
    <li> This shine mist smells delicious AND it works realllly well. I was introduced to it in a super fancy salon about 10 years ago and it&#x27;s very difficult to find. Great price as well. I always suggest this product to people when they compliment my hair. It&#x27;s effective on both damp or dry hair. I have blonde straight hair that the light just bounces off up with this.</li>
    <li> Loved it and deliverd timely as pormised!  The product makes my hair have that special shine--just a glowing healthy look!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have baby fine hair and use this for detangler and shine.  Use it with styling glaze.  Just wish there was a salon near by that stocks this product as I do not like paying shipping charges.  Consider placing it in Sephora or Ulta.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried these organic products.  I am so sensitive to chemicals it&#x27;s nice to find something of quality.</li>
    <li> the shine is great.  Just spray comb through and go about the rest of your hair care.  Great stuff for your hair.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly: a little goes a long way. If you overspray or use too much at one time/in one placei n your hair, the oil will saturate the hair there and will seem &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. Other than that one &amp;#34;be advised&amp;#34;, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light scent, great moisturizing ability that lasts and the price here was better than at the salon I usually go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband says he sees the shine when I have it in my very curly, thick hair--and it does also help lessen the frizz a bit on second-day hair, though I can&#x27;t use it as my only frizz prevention product on this thick, shaggy head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell dissipates so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfume or other hair products. But people definitely notice if I spritzed some on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: the price of this product went up $5 per 5.1 ounce spray bottle, or roughly $1 per ounce, both in salons and here at Amazon, after they redesigned the bottle--but did nothing to improve the product itself. The price increase occurred at the same time the new packaging came out, across the board. Sorry, Eufora, but this isn&#x27;t liquid gold and I&#x27;m not paying liquid gold prices for it--or for your product and packaging redesign costs. Switching over to other shine sprays which do the same, last as long, and cost less per ounce/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product, but I can save money by ordering something which provides the same thing, for less. So I will.</li>
    <li> I have typically really dry hair. This is perfect for me because it&#x27;s a light mist that gives my hair a little moister and control. Plus it smells good! I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product to use prior to flat ironing. My former hairdresser who was an award winning hairdresser in France turned me on to this product and I have been using it for years. Sometimes when I run out I try a different product that I can find at a local store but they never compare to this one!</li>
    <li> This product was just what I expected and I am using it. It is just like one I had previously except for the decorative design on the bottle.</li>
    <li> A must have for tangles or static, always love this product.  Use alone or with the sculpting gel.</li>
    <li> I like the way it gives a nice sheen after your are done styling your hair.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Eufora Illuminate Mist    It leaves your hair shiny and manageable.  I love the light mist it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair done.</li>
    <li> It really does make your hair shine without weighing it down</li>
    <li> Great product! Smell is great and it makes my hair really shiny! I have used this for a while I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair product, shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Next time I plan on buying the big bottle. You can use on wet or dry hair to control the unruly frizzy hair. I use it every time I wash my hair. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This product works great with a straightening iron!  I love how sleek and shiny my hair is after using it.</li>
    <li> This shine mist is the perfect product to use after drying your hair.  It makes your hair feel so silky and look so shiny/healthy.  You can use it everyday without drying your hair.  Try it &amp; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I started using this shine mist a few years ago and absolutely love it.  I have thick, wavy hair and it makes it look lustrous.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or flat.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Im not using it right now because Im pregnant. It is a bit too expensive though.</li>
    <li> Great. My hair is shiny, and it smells great. So weightless, too! I don&#x27;t go without my Illuminate Shine Mist.</li>
    <li> I spray this product 2 or 3 times while working a small bit of Euforastyle Sculpture in my hands.  Then I work it through my damp hair.  (I suspect that the two products help each other, if not, balance one another out.)  It adds gentle shine without being oily.  If I sense that my ends are not getting enough oil for health, then I add Moroccan oil (the light version).</li>
    <li> After being introduced to the Eufora products in my salon, I was immediately hooked. Immediately, you notice an amazing smell and salon quality results when using these products. That being said, my absolute favorite product by Eufora is the illuminating shine spray. It is absolutely amazing and worth the money! Though a bit pricey, you can easily make this product last for months. I had my first bottle for at least three months, and my hairstylist said she stretches hers to six months. Yes, my hairstylist uses this product too, and she really knows her stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, soft, stick straight hair that really does not need any product; however, I use this product every day. The best part about it is how versatile it is! You can use it when your hair is wet right out of the shower before you comb it, it will instantly detangle, soften and shine your hair. You can use it when your hair is dry for added shine and frizz control. It works as a detangler, frizz control, hydrator, and heat protectant! It&#x27;s really an all in one product. If you are going to add one product into your hair routine and want one that does it all, this is the one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eufora is all natural and safe for color treated hair. I cannot tell you how many compliments I have received after using this product. Not only do people think my hair ALWAYS smells great, and I do mean always (even after a workout), but they always comment on the beautiful shine and softness of my hair. I will continue to use Eufora products, and the shine mist has become a staple I could not do without now! Like I said, you can make one bottle last a long time, so the price is absolutely worth it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was not the girl with the shiny, glossing hair...&lt;br /&gt;This product does give you a little subtle sparkle....helps out!</li>
    <li> Comes in different bottle. Not sure if original.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loves it.  Highly recommend.  Seemed expensive for what you get, However, it made her very happy, and that is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product works great as a hair detangler, pre-treatment for hot tools, or after styling hair smoother. The bottle is small but lasts me several months and I use it everyday at least once a day. I do not apply to my roots so that I do not get an oily look, just healthy shine. I spray a few pumps into my brush and brush the ends of my hair, which is long, but not excessively long. I seldom use hairspray, just this product.</li>
    <li> i have used this for several years on and off.  i use it before i straighten my hair and it&#x27;s been good for me.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for a finished product to be used on any style. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Like the smell of it &amp; I think it does exactly what it says it does. Adds shine &amp; enhances color.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It can even be used as makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair very shiny, as advertised. The smell bothers me a little but its easily overlooked. My only wish is that the spray bottle applied it in a finer mist, it comes out fast.</li>
    <li> Eufora Illuminate Shine Mist smells sooooo GOOD!  I really like this product, it makes your hair look healthy, it is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, I have thin hair so this product makes my hair look shiny and healthy.  Did I mention it smells Great?</li>
    <li> I have tried many shine mists from other haircare lines and this one is by far the best!  It not only adds a beautiful shine to my hair but it smells amazing also!!!  A little spray goes a long way so the bottle will last awhile!  I am very happy with this product and would definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I wanted it after my hair stylist did my hair, but the price was too high. I was able to purchase it at a better price. And my daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love Ephora Procucts, I have been using it after I shower on my hair, I combine 4 different ones before I dry my hair and they leave my hair smooth and silky, they are pricey though</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, cheaper than the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Really keeps hair shiny.  Smell is light and texture non greasy,  Use it after blow drying daily.  Would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works great. Don&#x27;t leave home without it!! Gives hair a great shine!  To bad it is so hard to find in stores..</li>
    <li> My hair is so curly and frizzy this works better than anything I have used.  It takes my hair from a frizz ball to a soft curl.  I love Amazon</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product - the smell, the gloss on my hair...it is never too greasy in my opinion. I have long, fine, straight chemically treated hair. I like how it smooths fly-aways.</li>
    <li> This is very strong - it works very well but can also leave your hair looking a bit greasy with one too many sprays. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just having a hard time figuring out how to use it (as I&#x27;m used to the aerosol type sprays).</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair when used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have never used a product that had such an instantaneously positive effect on my hair such as the Illuminate Shine Mist in congruence with the Pure Polish! I&#x27;m officially obsessed! I couldn&#x27;t understand how my hair was suddenly feeling so completely amazing so I decided to check out the site; oh my word, I was so happy with what I found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera as a base, no sulfate, no synthetic fragrances... ? It&#x27;s like literally spritzing magical pixie dust in your hair! The perfect, weightless shine with healing properties?!? Le Gasp! If you&#x27;re on the fence, just hop over the mystical land of shampoo commercial worthy hair &amp; buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful with how much of this I use, any more than a TEENY TINY bit will turn me into a greasy mess. But a quick spritz on the palm of my hand and then rubbed quickly on my ends, gives mt hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> The scent is horrible!!!!!!!!!! And that alone makes me not like it :(</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome.  I have not found anything that works as well...I need to buy this stuff in bulk!</li>
    <li> Usually combine with the gel. Hairdresser recommends a nickel sized amt in my palm, the 4 sprays (for fairly short hair). Use the shine mist if your hair is feeling dry or dull on a non wash day also.</li>
