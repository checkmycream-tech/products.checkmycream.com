      <li>Colors are the same as pictures and hair looks real.  </li>
      <li>the hair piece looks good and real but it is a little too heavy for the head to wear for too long.</li>
      <li>piece has a strange, greenish-gold, brassy hue in person and is very shiny, in a way that is unnatural looking.</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair</li>

<li> Colors are spot on, hair is thick, soft, and looks real.</li>
<li> The only complaint that I have is the claw clip needs to be tighter, sometimes feels like it wants to fall out</li>
<li> Very thick and pretty.</li>
<li> Not much blonde added into the brown mix...a little darker than I wanted.  </li>
<li> This hair piece is not what I expected.</li>
<li> I chopped my hair off a few months ago and I miss my long ponytail</li>
<li> The clip is totally hidden.  </li>
<li> Way too heavy to even wear.</li>
<li> The color is frosted and looks fake.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed on how heavy it was.</li>

    <li> I have gotten so many compliments!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This piece is BEAUTIFUL!!! Colors are spot on, hair is thick, soft, and looks real. The only complaint that I have is the claw clip needs to be tighter, sometimes feels like it wants to fall out and I wish the ponytail was longer. Other than that for something easy and fun LOVE it and if your thinking about buying it......DO IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Not even close to looking like the phyo</li>
    <li> I loved this ~ but the color was not good for me.  It is a great item ~ but had to return.  Will try another color!!!</li>
    <li> Way too heavy to even wear. I tried to put this in and my head felt like it weighed 50 pounds. I wore it around the house to try it out and it made my neck hurt and gave me a headache. Colors matched perfectly but looks completely fake. No way this would pass to look real in public. Will be returning once I figure out how. I was very disappointed on how heavy it was.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe the color match &amp; the piece blends so naturally! Thumbs-up and five stars.. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for this product, I thought it would be super cheap and noticeably fake, but surprisingly it is decent quality and looks pretty real! The clip holds really well and doesn&#x27;t slide off my ponytail or anything. It makes me feel pretty!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair extensions and falls for 25 years, so I speak from some experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This piece has a strange, greenish-gold, brassy hue in person and is very shiny, in a way that is unnatural looking. Almost like plastic. (Remember, when we were kids, what Barbie&#x27;s hair looked and felt like?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband said the color and texture looked &amp;#34;weird.&amp;#34; And like most men, he doesn&#x27;t normally notice details when it comes to girlie stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve left the tag on it so that I can attempt to resell it and get my money back. Better luck next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great and my order arrived quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors in the ponytail clip but it seemed much shorter than on the website a bit thin in my opinion, I sent it back,.</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PIECE!!!  I was nervous about the color but it matches perfectly and it is so easy to wear.  I love the length of the pony tail and the fullness.  The highlights are amazing.  This really is a great product.</li>
    <li> the hair piece looks good and real but it is a little too heavy for the head to wear for too long. I couldn&#x27;t wear it for even an hour.</li>
    <li> not the  color that was on line,  looks completly diffrent after i get the product in my hand</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! I chopped my hair off a few months ago and I miss my long ponytail so I thought I&#x27;d try this. I LOVE IT. It is easy to use, matches perfect (I got brown), and it fits comfortable and does not look fake. I have super thick hair and it works great! And I got it earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This hair piece is not what I expected. The color is frosted and looks fake.</li>
    <li> Fantastic pony! Beautiful color look and feels like real hair. The price is awesome!! I&#x27;m going to order another one.</li>
    <li> An all-time favorite!  It is heavy, but cute!!  The clip is totally hidden.  Thankfully, no red tones.</li>
    <li> Love it. Although I did order one and never revived it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice piece.  Not much blonde added into the brown mix...a little darker than I wanted.  Very thick and pretty.</li>
    <li> Colors are the same as pictures and hair looks real.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear it.  This will be a great addition to my accessories</li>
    <li> A-DOR-able!  Goes on quickly, and looks great!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and it looks exactly as shown.  It is very pretty and the colors are very natural looking.  The clip thata holds it to your hair is invisible when it&#x27;s on.  This is a very good buy.</li>
