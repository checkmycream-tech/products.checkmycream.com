    <li> great deal! Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and I can&#x27;t believe  how soft my skin feels! I could actually  feel it working in the shower! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Cleans my deodorant and smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells great, pack of 3 has lasted for almost four months. As long as the price stays &amp;#34;low,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll continue purchasing this product from Amazon.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Nivea body wash. I have no intention of buying any other brand. My skin feels wonderful and the lather is perfection. I can use this wash on my entire body without irritation anywhere.</li>
    <li> It smells lightly sophisticated. And by lightly, I mean very light lol NOT heavily fragranced at all which is cool. I also like how it&#x27;s not a thick, creamy body wash but it&#x27;s almost clear, more liquid like and lathers well and does leave skin a bit soft. Plus 3 in a pack is a good deal ! And it arrived pretty fast. Might order again in the future !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Nivea. Nivea can be expensive. I paid a very fair price for the Q&amp;Q of this product. My pockets and body loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of the Nivea body wash and I decided to try this scent. Its really nice, like the other one I had and leaves my skin so very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Hope I can eventually find this in a larger bottle. :)</li>
    <li> I received Moisturizing Body Wash instead of Cream Oil Body Wash. It is not the same. I was dissappointed but still kept it as it is good product but not exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have loved the Nivea brand since I lived in Germany for many years. So glad it is now sold in the USA. I had not tried the cashmere body wash before and I really, really love the fragrance as well as what Nivea does to your skin. Soft and gentle body wash that with continued use helps even sensitive skin not to become so dry. It nourishes while it cleans and lets you feel so feminine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Great price!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, best smelling soap on this planet.  Tea rose smell.  Other than that, it does it&#x27;s job as soap.</li>
