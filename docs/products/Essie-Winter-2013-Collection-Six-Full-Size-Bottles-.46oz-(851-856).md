<li> (my fav) is the deep, dark, ruby wine or burgundy that is very in this season.</li>
<li> Very thin, and looks so smooth, and clear with two layers on.</li>
<li> I was expecting a flat color.</li>
<li> your mittens- a dark navy blue.</li>
<li> Very dark, but not just blue or navy.</li>
<li> They came very carefully packed.</li>
<li> I had to spend about an hour cleaning off the bottles &amp; now I was left with a little less than half a bottle.</li>
<li> Not your typical Essie winter collection, but</li>
<li> My only small complaint is that I wish I had received them on Dec. 6th, so I could offer them to my 4 girlfriends as a stocking stuffer at the Christmas party we all were attending.</li>
<li> Big disappointment!!</li>
<li> One of them was broken!</li>
<li> Bad customer service.</li>

    <li> Fast delivery. Loved how they came with 6 polishes, do not have to buy nail polish for a while ! Definitely will be back for more</li>
    <li> I gave each of my friends a bottle for Christmas last year. They loved them. Essie is a great brand with great colors, You can&#x27;t go wrong with this nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors in this winter collection! The light lilac color came out kind of sheer and runny but I think overall, these colors are a must for this season</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous but the Mind your Mittens was not properly sealed &amp; it leaked all over the other bottles. I had to spend about an hour cleaning off the bottles &amp; now I was left with a little less than half a bottle. I contacted the seller as soon as I received my package weeks ago &amp; yet still nothing was done to resolve the issue that I am now left with only 1/3 bottle of polish. Bad customer service.</li>
    <li> Not your typical Essie winter collection, but I loved them! They are so pretty and unique for winter, and are all really good formulas that are opaque in 2 coats.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty collection set.  I am really enjoying all of the beautiful shades of color this set contains.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine. I am happy with the purchase. I think that more and buy more than once. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Brother&#x27;s GF and she loved it, of course! I also got her a nail polish which is amazing!!! I love buying for her, I just think of what I want and *poof*. LOL I LOVE Essie!!!</li>
    <li> The bottles of nail polish were as described. Nice colors. However they arrived in two separate boxes with a different nail polish brand&#x27;s name on the boxes.</li>
    <li> I just got the nail polish set today, but my gosh every color looks so beautiful!!!!! Very thin, and looks so smooth, and clear with two layers on. I definitely recommend this set to anyone :)</li>
    <li> love all the colors. Love Essie</li>
    <li> I could not tell if product was truly new with no seals being on the items. The packaging was fair.</li>
    <li> I love the colors for winter, and they stay on better than most polishes! They are great in my book!!</li>
    <li> 6 Full Size- \\&quot;Winter\\&quot; Polishes perfect for the colder weather. These polishes will make you feel warm and cozy in the winter cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind your mittens- a dark navy blue. Looks like a frozen lake/river blue. Very dark, but not just blue or navy. Very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm and toasty turtleneck- is a frosty purple. A little darker than a summer pastel, perfect for the winter purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sable collar- darker than warm and toasty with glitter/shimmer. Shimmer and shine it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toggle to the top- is a dark ruby red with spectacular glitter/shimmer shine. It is the perfect Christmastime/Holiday polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shearling darling- (my fav) is the deep, dark, ruby wine or burgundy that is very in this season. Super sexy winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parka perfect- is a light blue frosty color that just makes you think of light feathery snowflakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of my best purchases on amazon so far. Love them!</li>
    <li> I love love love this collection. So many different combinations you can do with it. I over Essie. I highly recommend getting to add to your collection. I do nail art and have had a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> Love the Winter collection. The colors are simply gorgeous. They came very carefully packed. My only small complaint is that I wish I had received them on Dec. 6th, so I could offer them to my 4 girlfriends as a stocking stuffer at the Christmas party we all were attending. Besides that, I can&#x27;t wait to try them all with my sister!</li>
    <li> Christmas morning...my son opens up the package-missing the USB Cable Battery and Charger, Mini screwdriver, Spare blades!!! Unable to fly..Big disappointment!!</li>
    <li> This was an absolute treat!  All the colors of the Winter 2013 collection were gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Such a welcome treat to get the whole collection at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> One of them was broken!</li>
    <li> I like most colors and that they are full size.  There is the deep red that I find too sparkly.  I was expecting a flat color.</li>
    <li> I love Essie and I can always get the new collections here @Amazon.  I bring my own nail polish to the salon and I like having certain colors because they don&#x27;t always have the latest and greatest!!</li>
    <li> The formula is nice - goes on smoothly and is opaque with one thick or 2 thin coats. Love Essie&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Love the variation in color. Essie is one of the better polishes out there and loved having these colors for the holidays. Lots of compliments.</li>
