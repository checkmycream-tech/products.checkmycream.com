      <li>I liked this because it doesn&#x27;t have quite the smokey smell that Texas Cedarwood has.  </li>
      <li>lot of companies now are sending follow-up emails, asking you to give an unbiased, honest review of their product on Amazon after a purchase.</li>

      <li>This has a wonderful natural fragrance and provides nice relaxation.</li>

      <li>Very light scent.</li>
      <li>Love the oils in the diffuser.</li>
      <li>I purchased the cedarwood oil and received it and already love it.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and works great.</li>
      <li>I purchased it with the intent of making my home smell better and it has done that.</li>
      <li>Lovely high quality stuff with a great scent.</li>
      <li>great quality, I&#x27;m really liking this and finding it to be a good concentrated oil, meaning that I don&#x27;t have to use as much</li>
      <li>It is supposed to decrease dry scalp and skin and is working wonderfully!  </li>
      <li>They even contacted me after I purchased the oils to ask if I was satisfied and to send me free ebooks and more savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it works brilliantly - and the green beans smell good, too.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, too!</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s smart and always try to leave an honest review of products I enjoy.</li>
      <li>Been using this way for @ a month and am very pleased to be seeing new growth.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order again  Very nicely packaged also</li>
      <li>Very sweet and powerful.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know why since it&#x27;s pure, but it&#x27;s lovely and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The prices are lower than most, but the oil seems to be of a high quality.</li>
      <li>I have used other DeSensua oils with great success.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve searchex and these he&#x27;d and tried various other &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; oils and this companies Cedarwood oil and others that I&#x27;ve tried are just as effective and much more affordable.</li>
      <li>The specific cedar trees of which I speak are referred to as the so called &amp;#34;Ringing Cedars Of Siberia&amp;#34; and the fabulous cedar oil extract that they produce for the blessings of all humankind.</li>
      <li>not as much hair is coming out during each washing</li>
      <li>would ABSOLUTELY recommend this oil and will be a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>works as described and shipped fast thanks</li>
      <li>let better with other fragrances.</li>
      <li>this is special, i will be back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not yet actually begun to use this Atlas Cedarwood Essential Oil,  but after having read several marvelous books by one Mr. Vladimir Megre that describes his initial encounters with a mysterious Siberian recluse named Anastasia has given me the incentive to do so very soon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important for other buyers and I rely on customer reviews to help me determine a purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a bunch of oils online, but DeSensua is the only one who picked up the phone to find out if I had any questions about their product and to also send an in-depth Essential Oil e-book to explain the background and purpose of a huge number of oils.  </li>
      <li>and so it&#x27;s lasting much longer.</li>
      <li>The books go into a lot of detail about how truly fragrant the cedar oil is it can be such an enormous blessing to anyone who is fortunate enough to begin using it.  </li>
      <li>the past, I have tried a variety of cedarwood oils with scents ranging from wet dirt to christmas tree, and finally came across deSensua&#x27;s take on it, which actually has a concentrated smell of strong, rich cedarwood.</li>

<li> We used this product mixed with water to spray on green beans and roses as a deterrent for Japanese beetles.  </li>
<li> This oil doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like cedarwood to us.  </li>
<li> I know that&#x27;s not exactly what the expected use is</li>
<li> It was clearly a call center with agents who have a questionable grasp of the English language.</li>
<li> My daughters and I had lost alot of hair due to toxin exposure.</li>
<li> And I would NEVER give permission for them to contact me other than by email.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the post purchase marketing push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used other oils from more expensive companies that require you to sign up as a seller and purchase expensive starter kits in order to get big savings on their oils (which even with those &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; savings their products are still hard to justify the expense).</li>
<li> Since it is so concentrated, I need to use less of it on my diffuser to get the desired effect.</li>
<li> Used for thinning hair - by putting a few drops in my shampoo bottle&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be doing well....</li>
<li> She has trouble sleeping and a friend told her that rubbing some of this on her feet before going to bed would help her sleep.</li>
<li> But I also have arthritis and this oil, helps my joints not be so stiff.  </li>
<li> Then I got tired of the phone calls, so picked up to find out who it was and shut it down once and for all.</li>
<li> Perhaps I just received a bad bottle, as I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would find it acceptable.</li>
<li> Use on my beard with Coconut Oil as a base and my beard does not itch or flake anymore.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> We found it very unpleasant and wouldn&#x27;t use it under any circumstances.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Asked for this for a massage (you must dilute it for massage), as it is meant to be relaxing and help sleep and I&#x27;m a bit on an insomniac. I don&#x27;t even remember the massage; my wife says I was asleep within 5 minutes. That&#x27;s impressive but it has happened twice!</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly. This company makes great essential oils and has great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have tried a variety of cedarwood oils with scents ranging from wet dirt to christmas tree, and finally came across deSensua&#x27;s take on it, which actually has a concentrated smell of strong, rich cedarwood. Since it is so concentrated, I need to use less of it on my diffuser to get the desired effect. Will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I just started getting into essential oils to use for my dog and to make DIY cleaning products.  I&#x27;ve ordered a bunch of oils online, but DeSensua is the only one who picked up the phone to find out if I had any questions about their product and to also send an in-depth Essential Oil e-book to explain the background and purpose of a huge number of oils.  I&#x27;m impressed with their customer service.  Their oils are well packaged.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Love it! Happy with product.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful natural fragrance and provides nice relaxation. using in oil warmer and on my bath sponge during showers. I am very happy with my purchase. I was also offered 50% on my next purchase from DeSensua.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever love it</li>
    <li> Very nice rich outdoorsy fragrance.  Will purchase again when I use all of this bottle.  Am also very pleased with customer service of DeSensua .</li>
    <li> Cedar wood at its best.  Great seller and great product.  Will return as a customer</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great Cedarwood Oil. Very light scent. Use on my beard with Coconut Oil as a base and my beard does not itch or flake anymore.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Used for thinning hair - by putting a few drops in my shampoo bottle&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be doing well....not as much hair is coming out during each washing</li>
    <li> Bought this Cedarwood Essential Oil for my wife. She has trouble sleeping and a friend told her that rubbing some of this on her feet before going to bed would help her sleep. The oil is a great product and smells wonderful. No complaints about the product at all. Nice packaging too. My only complaint is the post purchase marketing push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of companies now are sending follow-up emails, asking you to give an unbiased, honest review of their product on Amazon after a purchase. I think that&#x27;s smart and always try to leave an honest review of products I enjoy. It&#x27;s important for other buyers and I rely on customer reviews to help me determine a purchase. But when they start calling me every day at work like a telemarketer scorned, that&#x27;s when I have an issue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys (or an independent call center) were calling me every day while I was at work. I didn&#x27;t recognize the number so I didn&#x27;t pick up. Then I got tired of the phone calls, so picked up to find out who it was and shut it down once and for all. Ends up it was this company or someone hired by them to follow up and ask for a review then they offered to send me a discount coupon if I decided to sign up for some club membership and an opportunity to win a $25 Amazon gift card for signing up. It was clearly a call center with agents who have a questionable grasp of the English language. And I told her I was at work and did not appreciate being called every day until I answered the phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When did I ever give Amazon permission to share my personal information, especially my phone number with these companies? And I would NEVER give permission for them to contact me other than by email. When these companies start calling me incessantly, I take issue. That alone would give me great pause from ever purchasing this product again, even though it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> We used this product mixed with water to spray on green beans and roses as a deterrent for Japanese beetles.  I know that&#x27;s not exactly what the expected use is but it works brilliantly - and the green beans smell good, too.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, he loves it</li>
    <li> heaven on earth this is special, i will be back. Thank You</li>

    <li> Received from a friend to try.  Used as an aromatic in my diffuser - soothing smell to add relaxation to any setting.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Great product, mild scent.  I have used other DeSensua oils with great success.  Great company to buy from.</li>
    <li> I liked this because it doesn&#x27;t have quite the smokey smell that Texas Cedarwood has.  It seems to blend a lit t let better with other fragrances.</li>
    <li> Will order fragrance again.  Prompt delivery...good product.</li>
    <li> Very sweet and powerful.</li>
    <li> I have used other oils from more expensive companies that require you to sign up as a seller and purchase expensive starter kits in order to get big savings on their oils (which even with those &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; savings their products are still hard to justify the expense).

    <li> My husband is a head shaver and uses this after he shaves to moisturizer his scalp!  It is supposed to decrease dry scalp and skin and is working wonderfully!  Looking forward to trying it on my sons eczema the next time he has a spot as it is supposed to work wonders on that, too!</li>
    <li> I am using this cedarwood oil for hair re-growth. My daughters and I had lost alot of hair due to toxin exposure. I add 1-2 drops per ounce of shampoo to our shampoo bottle. Been using this way for @ a month and am very pleased to be seeing new growth.</li>
    <li> Lovely high quality stuff with a great scent. Arrived quickly, too!</li>
    <li> great quality, I&#x27;m really liking this and finding it to be a good concentrated oil, meaning that I don&#x27;t have to use as much and so it&#x27;s lasting much longer.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice.  It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the cedar I was looking for and I don&#x27;t know why since it&#x27;s pure, but it&#x27;s lovely and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and works great. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like cedarwood to us.  We found it very unpleasant and wouldn&#x27;t use it under any circumstances.  Perhaps I just received a bad bottle, as I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would find it acceptable.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this oil and the service I have received. The prices are lower than most, but the oil seems to be of a high quality. Some lower price oils seem to be deleted but not the Cedarwood I received from this website. I will definitely order again  Very nicely packaged also ❤️</li>
    <li> Love the oils in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cedarwood oil and received it and already love it. It smells amazing and had a calming effect!    I purchased it with the intent of making my home smell better and it has done that. Thanks for a great product!   </li>
    <li> This is good oil for arthritis, I am also told it is good for tremors from Parkinson. I have tremors but the medicine is taking care of that.  But I also have arthritis and this oil, helps my joints not be so stiff.  It also smell nice like cedar.  The price was good as well, I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> works as described and shipped fast thanks</li>
