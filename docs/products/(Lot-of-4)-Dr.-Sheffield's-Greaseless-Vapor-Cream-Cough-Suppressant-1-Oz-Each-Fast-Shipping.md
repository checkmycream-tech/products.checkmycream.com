<ol>
    <li> VERY SIMILAR TO VICKS VAPO-RUB WHICH USED TO MAKE THE GREASELESS CREAM AND DISCONTINUED IT...SO THANKS</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price and was exactly as described - what&#x27;s not to love.  This is the perfect replacement for the Vicks greaseless cream that has disappeared from the shelves.Buy from this vendor with confidence.</li>
    <li> Works well but not quite as potent as the discontinued Vick&#x27;s greasless. I like the amount for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally after many years of searching I have found the HOLY GRAIL to the next best thing to &amp;#34;Vick&#x27;s Vaporub Greaseless Cream.&amp;#34; Can I say, I LOVE YOU AMAZON! There is no difference. I still had my old bottle of Vick&#x27;s and compared the two. They are exactly the same. Nothing works quite like this. Sorry Proctor &amp; Gamble, you just lost out. A shame really. Oh well, My suffering in silence days while sick are officially over. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> great product I hope you keep it coming.</li>
    <li> love them when the kids get sick</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Please keep on selling it.</li>
    <li> This product is very close to the Vicks VapoCream which has been discontinued. But is still lacking a little something. It&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
    <li> this is the only and closest to the old Vicks cream, don&#x27;t need it much but when you do it is a blessing. It is not as strong as the vicks was thus the 4 instead of 5 and it wears off quicker but still would never be without it</li>
    <li> I have purchased this vapor cream before. It totally takes the place of VICKS GREASELESS VAPOR CREAM that some many consumers have been looking for. This will be my second review, it is truly greaseless, it  rubs in very easily,  and since my last purchased , the $$ has dropped. I will continue to buy this product no matter what the $$. THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄&lt;br /&gt;*OCT.16th, 2015*  i ordered another 4 more, it&#x27;s the season for colds, flu, and the simple sniffles. With 7 grandkids coming &amp; going I&#x27;ll be ready for coating their chests &amp; backs, mine as well. I rub this on my chest &amp; throat every night, snuggle under my blanket and let the vapors fo the work. Even when I am not feeling under the weather I still use this every night when I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;For the $ it pays to keep a tube or two around just in case. 😩the expiration date on the boxes and tubes are  05/16. I tried to wite out the boxes &amp; darken the tubes so potential buyers can see they would not be getting expired merchandise.  Sorry if my photos aren&#x27;t that good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, stay well.</li>
    <li> Best vapo cream I have found since Vicks. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the non greasiness and light smell&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with odor allergies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I had the choice. I found this when I was looking for Vicks cream. I found out Vicks no longer makes theirs. I love this much better! Only on thing, the tubes are small. So happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> Love it and need more</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Vicks cream that is no longer available.  Does not leave a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> I was so unhappy to hear that Vicks did away with the cream, that has been all I used, probably like most when I get a cold I rub the stuff all over and snuggle down into my blanket. The cream would absorb into your skin and you would never get that greasy feeling.  I remember the old days rubbing down and turning into a grease ball with clothes sticking and getting greasy hair. Ick.  So my search was on for a replacement that I thought was not there, till  I found Dr. Sheffields greaseless vapor, Just like vicks, exactly, I can&#x27;t  tell the difference, smaller tube where vicks was bigger, but looked and found 4 tubes for a little over $10 for 4 oz. I think I paid $6 for my last vicks tube. Yes a bit pricy but if you bath in it like I do, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Not Vicks Greaseless Vapo Creme, but it will have to do. It&#x27;s just not as good, Vick&#x27;s bring this back, please!!!</li>
    <li> These are very similar to the &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; brand and that company quit making the lotion.  I searched and searched for them and when I found these I gave them a try and they are the exact same product.  Thank you for offering these.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So very happy to find this. I have been searching for the Vicks brand everywhere just to find they no longer make it. I used it for several years and was just sick till I found this. Love it, love it, love it!!! Non-greasy and works so much better than the ointment.Thanks, Dr. Sheffield!!!</li>
    <li> Could be a little stronger, but a whole lot better than that chunk of grease you put on your chest. Seller was great did their job.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Vicks I had.  But usable.  Shipping was great.</li>
    <li> Just a good as VICKS VAPORUB  ......what a find</li>
    <li> better than old vapor cream.</li>
    <li> It is a good replacement for the Vick&#x27;s Greaseless rub that is no longer produced.</li>
