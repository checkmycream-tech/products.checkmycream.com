      <li>This is a great color for me.  </li>

      <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>AT A REALLY GOOD PRICE.</li>
      <li>She is very pleased.</li>
      <li>Good color and a nice gloss that doesn&#x60;t make my lips feel sticky.  </li>
      <li>This is a great neutral lip color that goes on smooth and adds some gloss to your lips.  </li>
      <li>This lipstick Is amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT HAS A NICE GLOW</li>
      <li>Nice for now</li>
      <li>Good , nice and cheap ...</li>
      <li>it probably will end up more as a gloss than anything else.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I would have paid much more now</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My wife was running out of lipstick that she had bought many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Gives you a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;A+\\&quot; loved the lipstick, just the right color.</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and in perfect, new condition.</li>
      <li>So worth the money!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited when i saw the words &amp;#34;nude glow&amp;#34; with nude lip color being popular right now, but it is more glow than nude.</li>
      <li>I got it for a fantastic price</li>
      <li>vIt looks really good on me inside cant wait to see if it shines more outside.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my gf, and she loved the color, but definitely should use a lip liner</li>
      <li>it is a true nude...</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t since it&#x27;s super pigmented and the color is still there.</li>
      <li>It was sent quickly.</li>
      <li>But it turned out very pretty in my lips and against my beige skin tone.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a nude with a shiny kick to it so if you are looking for a soft or matte nude, this isn&#x27;t your color.</li>
      <li>and it kind of brings you back to the 90s.</li>
      <li>My new go to lip color!!!</li>
      <li>It feels great on my lips without having a thick or heaviness to it.</li>
      <li>It wears off quickly but is to be expected with a lipstick that is more like a lip balm than anything else.</li>
      <li>Even with that minor detail I still love the neutral color, shine and reflective traits that it gives.  </li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly and is moisturizing at first, but it&#x27;s best if you use chap stick or a lip base before you put it on since it dries out quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a little more bronze nude with golden flecks than it</li>
      <li>I really like this lipstick.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any complaints besides it lacking moisture.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It is best with a base and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>It looks natural and is exactly as described, nude.  </li>
      <li>Lighter in person than looks online which I am glad for because I thought it may be too dark for me.</li>
      <li>It is hard to describe, kind of a rosy color with a hint of bronze.  </li>
      <li>It is much more pink than i expected but still pretty.</li>
      <li>THIS SHADE OF LIPSTICK IS REALLY SOFT AND NOT HARSH</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a soft nude, this isn&#x27;t the shade for you.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect much color at all and don&#x27;t expect for it to last long.  </li>

    <li> This is a great color for me.  I like the texture as well.  The product arrived quickly and in perfect, new condition.</li>
    <li> I like the color but its too brassy. Its not the perfect nude and it kind of brings you back to the 90s. If you&#x27;re looking for a soft nude, this isn&#x27;t the shade for you.</li>
    <li> My new go to lip color!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!! So worth the money!! It was sent quickly. I was concerned with lipstick in the mail because of melting in the heat, BUT that didnt happen. It came packaged as if I bought it from the store!!</li>
    <li> THIS SHADE OF LIPSTICK IS REALLY SOFT AND NOT HARSH AT ALL.  IT HAS A NICE GLOW AT A REALLY GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> My wife was running out of lipstick that she had bought many years ago.  It had to be the same color.  We found this and it was the same as she had.  She is very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great neutral lip color that goes on smooth and adds some gloss to your lips.  It is not glittery and it has the slightest tinge of pink.  I am very very happy with this product.

    <li> It&#x27;s smells great, It reminds me of a lip gloss. The color is like a bronze nude. It doesn&#x27;t lasts long though.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color for summer.  It is hard to describe, kind of a rosy color with a hint of bronze.  I use it on my lips as well as my cheeks.  Gives you a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i saw the words &amp;#34;nude glow&amp;#34; with nude lip color being popular right now, but it is more glow than nude. It is much more pink than i expected but still pretty.</li>

    <li> I love it. vIt looks really good on me inside cant wait to see if it shines more outside.It is truly a nude on me. It goes on shimmery with a lot of moisture. Lighter in person than looks online which I am glad for because I thought it may be too dark for me.</li>
    <li> Received it broken, so I did receive a refund.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;A+\\&quot; loved the lipstick, just the right color. probably the first and last lipstick ill use.ive never been a lipstick kinda person til now</li>
    <li> This lipstick Is amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits me well and I have red hair with a tint of a medium brown color in it and I have VERY pale skin and medium colored freckles. If you have darker skin it probably will end up more as a gloss than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has a overly-shiny hue to it but after a few minutes it dulls so it&#x27;s still shiny but not blindingly so! It is best with a base and dries quickly. (Which is why I docked a star) It glides on smoothly and is moisturizing at first, but it&#x27;s best if you use chap stick or a lip base before you put it on since it dries out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts a longer than the moisture and it feels dry and like you have to re-apply it, but you don&#x27;t since it&#x27;s super pigmented and the color is still there. The color is more of a nude with a shiny kick to it so if you are looking for a soft or matte nude, this isn&#x27;t your color. Nice for now and I don&#x27;t really have any complaints besides it lacking moisture. Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Its a little more bronze nude with golden flecks than it it is a true nude... But it turned out very pretty in my lips and against my beige skin tone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my gf, and she loved the color, but definitely should use a lip liner</li>
    <li> It looks natural and is exactly as described, nude.  Don&#x27;t expect much color at all and don&#x27;t expect for it to last long.  It wears off quickly but is to be expected with a lipstick that is more like a lip balm than anything else. No complaints.</li>
