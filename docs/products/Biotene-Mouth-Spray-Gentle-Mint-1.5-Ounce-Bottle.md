### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Very glad that it is not stinging.</li>
      <li>It has a nice taste also.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if over time the results will be better, but for now I am still working on the results.</li>
      <li>if there are any more bottles of this I would like to know.  </li>
      <li>Oasis tastes way better and is cheaper.</li>
      <li>Nothing more to say except Biotene is recommended by my dentist.</li>
      <li>I love Biotene Moisturizing Spray with &amp;#34;Protene-enzyme system&amp;#34; as it stated on the box.  </li>
      <li>Oasis has a much better taste</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything more helpful.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product for dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>It was useful, and   effective.</li>
      <li>A great product except for the short time of effectivness.</li>
      <li>Biotene products are great for dry mouth problems and I use them all the time.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean taste that doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste like some do.</li>
      <li>I really like it and the vendor shopped it very promptly and in good packing materials.  </li>
      <li>It really works and I plan to order more.</li>
      <li>Just 2 quick spritz and it feels as though you drank a full glass of water.</li>
      <li>Almost as good as Oasis Mouth Spray For Dry Mouth</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to friends who also had success with it.  </li>
      <li>Was so glad to find it to order because the drug stores that use to carry it dropped it, and there is no other product out there like it.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product if you suffer from \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; because of medications or other reasons.  </li>
      <li>The biotene spray is the first attempt at alleviating the situation but it has not worked for me at all.</li>
      <li>But this moisturizing mouth spray actually gives me relief, not long-term, but good enough to keep buying it.</li>
      <li>B0015HPTQW Biotene Mouth Spray, Gentle Mint,</li>
      <li>highly recommend this !</li>
      <li>The Biotene mouth spray really works for her.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that I can have this product delivered to her home.</li>
      <li>The new formula does not contain this wording, and it burns the mouth!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it works very well</li>
      <li>I hope Biotene will go back to their former formula, quickly!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it has helped tremendously with my dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>So far 3 of them do not spray -- they squirt a stream of the liquid (which is far too intense)</li>
      <li>First one lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>The mouth spray tastes very fresh,however it only lasts about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Biotene, as Oasis, gives momentary relief, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>It became dry mouth from hell, a whole new dimension.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really helps after a long day of smoking cigars.</li>
      <li>Spray works very well and keeps my mouth moist in this dry Arizona heat.</li>
      <li>This product exceeds our expectations and really helps her manage her dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>I had major surgery and had one of my salivary glands removed.  </li>
      <li>and  the bottle lasts much longer then expected.</li>
      <li>immediately helps the problem with a couple of squirts far back into the throat.</li>
      <li>-but Biotene is half the price of OASIS and 1.5 times as much product; it&#x27;s a clear winner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried switching the sprayer from one of my empty old bottles that actually sprayed into the new bottle, but got the same squirting and dripping result.  </li>
      <li>Some of the meds I use to help with the COPD that I live with make for extreme dryness in my mouth.  </li>

<li> Some of the meds I use to help with the COPD that I live with make for extreme dryness in my mouth.  </li>
<li> I keep it at the head of my bed because medications I take often give me a very dry mouth in the night, and if I wake feeling like a cotton-mouth, I pick it up and spray a few times in mouth and throat and can go right back to sleep.    </li>
<li> Biotene spray is convenient to use,  and helps with dry mouth for a moderate   period of time.  </li>
<li> For the last seven years, I wake up every two hours with my mouth so dry my tongue is literally stuck to the roof of my mouth.</li>
<li> and I have a constant dry mouth and dry throat condition.</li>
<li> I have had dry mouth for all of my life and this is the only product that I have found that helps with dry mouth.</li>
<li> Both my wife and I have problems with dry throat and Biotene</li>
<li> I use this when my throat gets dry during the night.</li>
<li> My wife has dry mouth from some of the meds she takes.</li>
<li> It also sooths a dry throat.</li>
<li> I have been treated for throat cancer and have a lot of dry mouth.</li>
<li> I woudn&#x27;t recommend it if you want it for dry mouth.</li>
<li> After 40 years of living with allergic rhinitis and antihistamines, I thought I knew all about dry mouth.</li>
<li> He said they have been a life saver in that he doesn&#x27;t have dry mouth all day and night any longer.</li>
<li> We buy enough to last her for a few months at a time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy about the price, particularly shipping costs, but the cheapest price I can find locally is $10.99 a bottle, so I&#x27;ll take the money and run.</li>
<li> We bought this for a relative who has extreme dry mouth due to celiac sprue.  </li>
<li> I have a dry mouth due to medications.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s had absolutely no effect.</li>
<li> We are using almost all of the Biotene products now due to my husbands terminal mouth, throat and neck cancer.</li>
<li> and then it drips down the bottle.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty bad.  </li>
<li> No more feeling like everything in my mouth is glue together.</li>
<li> I have been unable to get the manual spray pump to work.  </li>
<li> After two brutal rounds of chemo-radiation, my salivary glands were destroyed.</li>
<li> This stuff tastes terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.  I had major surgery and had one of my salivary glands removed.  I use this product on a daily basis to keep my mouth moist.  I tried the mint at one time, but did not like the taste.  This is the one I prefer.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. Both my wife and I have problems with dry throat and Biotene immediately helps the problem with a couple of squirts far back into the throat. Excellent product!</li>

    <li> Biotene, as Oasis, gives momentary relief, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  Haven&#x27;t found anything more helpful.</li>
    <li> After 40 years of living with allergic rhinitis and antihistamines, I thought I knew all about dry mouth. And then May 2, 2006 I was diagnosed with stage 4 throat (tonsillar) cancer. After two brutal rounds of chemo-radiation, my salivary glands were destroyed. It became dry mouth from hell, a whole new dimension. For the last seven years, I wake up every two hours with my mouth so dry my tongue is literally stuck to the roof of my mouth. My bottle of ice water is literally with me 24/7. But this moisturizing mouth spray actually gives me relief, not long-term, but good enough to keep buying it. Like my ice water, it now goes everywhere with me. I&#x27;m not happy about the price, particularly shipping costs, but the cheapest price I can find locally is $10.99 a bottle, so I&#x27;ll take the money and run.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a relative who has extreme dry mouth due to celiac sprue.  This product exceeds our expectations and really helps her manage her dry mouth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes terrible. You may as well spray canola oil in your mouth. That&#x27;s about what it tastes like. Oasis tastes way better and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Biotene products are great for dry mouth problems and I use them all the time.  Nothing more to say except Biotene is recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> Biotene spray is convenient to use,  and helps with dry mouth for a moderate   period of time.  It was useful, and   effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and I have a constant dry mouth and dry throat condition. The biotene spray is the first attempt at alleviating the situation but it has not worked for me at all. I&#x27;ve tried it about 5 times now and it&#x27;s had absolutely no effect. It also has a bit of a weird taste, but that may be the case for most of these mouth sprays.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product if you suffer from \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; because of medications or other reasons.  I really like it and the vendor shopped it very promptly and in good packing materials.  I could not get it at the drug store in my area.  It was always out.</li>
    <li> I have been treated for throat cancer and have a lot of dry mouth. Biotene spray provides instant relief!</li>
    <li> Do not like the taste of this product. Oasis has a much better taste but I can&#x27;t find it. I will not substitute!</li>
    <li> I have a family member that is suffering from Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.  She swears by it.  We buy enough to last her for a few months at a time.  I really like the fact that I can have this product delivered to her home.</li>
    <li> I used it with a glass of water when I get dry-mouth and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. I am a smoker by the way, so that might effect it.</li>
    <li> I love Biotene Moisturizing Spray with &amp;#34;Protene-enzyme system&amp;#34; as it stated on the box.  This is what I received...if there are any more bottles of this I would like to know.  The new formula does not contain this wording, and it burns the mouth!</li>
    <li> Spray works very well and keeps my mouth moist in this dry Arizona heat. It has a nice taste also.</li>
    <li> My wife has dry mouth from some of the meds she takes. The Biotene mouth spray really works for her. We keep a bottle in each room of the house, so there&#x27;s always one nearby.</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth due to medications.  Biotene works well for me.  I have recommended it to friends who also had success with it.  No more feeling like everything in my mouth is glue together.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015HPTQW Biotene Mouth Spray, Gentle Mint, 1.5 Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really helps after a long day of smoking cigars. Almost as good as Oasis Mouth Spray For Dry Mouth -but Biotene is half the price of OASIS and 1.5 times as much product; it&#x27;s a clear winner.</li>
    <li> Some of the meds I use to help with the COPD that I live with make for extreme dryness in my mouth.  I always have to have something with me to drink and when that&#x27;s not possible, I can use this spray.  It really works and I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Something has changed!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it has helped tremendously with my dry mouth.  This time I ordered 6 bottles.  So far 3 of them do not spray -- they squirt a stream of the liquid (which is far too intense) and then it drips down the bottle.  I&#x27;ve tried switching the sprayer from one of my empty old bottles that actually sprayed into the new bottle, but got the same squirting and dripping result.  The formula must have changed.  It&#x27;s pretty bad.  I hope Biotene will go back to their former formula, quickly!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I hesitated to buy this spray because of expense and quality. I was surprised that it works very well and  the bottle lasts much longer then expected. I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped it would but it does make my mouth feel fresher so I give it 3 stars. I woudn&#x27;t recommend it if you want it for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> We are using almost all of the Biotene products now due to my husbands terminal mouth, throat and neck cancer. He said they have been a life saver in that he doesn&#x27;t have dry mouth all day and night any longer.He carries this spray with him in his pocket. He said there is no problem with the taste and it works for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend this !</li>
    <li> I have had dry mouth for all of my life and this is the only product that I have found that helps with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to get the manual spray pump to work.  Consequently I  have to try to unscrew the pump assembly in the middle of the night to take sips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that the spray feature is not functional, I cannot get enough sips ot of 1.5 ml. to justify the cost. I wish there were a prescription alternative.</li>
    <li> The mouth spray tastes very fresh,however it only lasts about 20 minutes. Just 2 quick spritz and it feels as though you drank a full glass of water. It also sooths a dry throat. A great product except for the short time of effectivness.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if over time the results will be better, but for now I am still working on the results. Very glad that it is not stinging.</li>
    <li> I use this when my throat gets dry during the night. It has a clean taste that doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste like some do. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. First one lasted a long time.</li>
