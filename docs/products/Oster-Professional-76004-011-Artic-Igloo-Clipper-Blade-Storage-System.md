      <li>Since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be another product out there any better, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>OK</li>

      <li>It holds all my blades just fine.</li>
      <li>There should be a hinge for the cover, otherwise the storage is fine.</li>
      <li>This storage system is designed to be fit on a wall.  </li>
      <li>I I truly appreciate and enjoy using this product</li>
      <li>My stylist liked them so much I used them as an incentive gift for them.</li>
      <li>Fit all my oster blades, and made it look clean and professional.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This case is nice and will protect your blades but would be nice if the lid latched closed.</li>
      <li>This is only good for sitting on a counter and struggling to get your blades out.</li>
      <li>This is only good if you do not plan to transport the blades.  </li>
      <li>There is no cushion in the compartments and the lid falls right off.</li>
      <li>The two are sort of a pain to put together, they have to be aligned just right.</li>
      <li>Its made of great hard plastic however if you want to travel with it the blades bounce around with no foam protection.</li>
      <li>Well, pretty well.</li>
      <li>many of my coworkers have this very same storage system; i was always envious of how neat their stations looked, so it was time i got my own.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did design my own hinge system for it and it works okay, but was difficult to do being the way it was made.</li>
      <li>, i highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>so when I leave work I have to make sure to carry it very carefully in my bag (</li>
      <li>THE TOP IS A LITTLE DIFUCULT TO PUT IT ON</li>
      <li>ok, but not easy to carry it.</li>
      <li>Designed to hang on the wall or just use on a flat surface, either way it have been designed with the cover hinged because as it is, it is not very user friendly!</li>
      <li>It would be so much nicer if the lid would actually clasp shut.</li>
      <li>Oster Professional 76004-011 Artic Igloo Clipper Blade Storage System-</li>
      <li>First the bottom isn&#x27;t padded like I&#x27;ve seen on other blade case, the way it&#x27;s designed</li>
      <li>I liked the blade storage system, but the blades are difficult to get out if its not hung up, Still would get it again.</li>
      <li>you cannot grab the blades out without a struggle, and finally the lid, imagine you have some thin shards of fragile exspensive glass laying on a plate (this would be your blades) now place another plate on top of that plate</li>

<li> It&#x27;s pretty much exactly as described, but the one thing I will say is that the blades can be a little difficult to get out from time to time, but that might just be user error (butterfingers).</li>

<li> The cover is what attracted me and it is jut what i expected.</li>

<li> plastic tray not much to review.</li>
<li> So if you wish to use this as a portable storage unit as I wanted to, I would certainly not recommend it.&lt;br</li>
<li> The lid doesn&#x27;t hinge and is a bit tricky to take on and off at first but worst of all, it all feels cheap and flimsy.</li>

<li> You can&#x27;t hold the lid it will slip off, it doesn&#x27;t latch down, and when place in a bag to carry, your blades would be all over the place</li>

<li> but they some times be getting out of their little slots rather then that i like it .</li>
<li> The lid doesn&#x27;t swivel up or down, tough to keep lid in place.</li>
<li> Really sucks doesn&#x27;t hold your blades in place.</li>
<li> I LITTLE BIT TO EXPENSIVE</li>
<li> I put my blade end down as it is easier to grab a blade that way and no worry of cutting my fingers.</li>
<li> I actually kinda hate this thing.</li>
<li> i got sick of my blades being all over the place and leaving my work station a mess.</li>
<li> The lid fits on awkwardly and isn&#x27;t secured to the base in anyway.</li>
<li> Horrible for transporting.</li>

    <li> This storage system is designed to be fit on a wall.  It&#x27;s very  difficult to get the top off unless it&#x27;s anchored to a wall or other surface.  So if you wish to use this as a portable storage unit as I wanted to, I would certainly not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are OK with mounting it on a wall or on a cabinet, then sure... go for it.  You&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> This item is verry helpfull. It organizes all your blades instead of haveing all your blades thrown around this is the best way to organize especaly if you are a barber on the go you will injoy it as i do mine.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Thankyou good mans</li>
    <li> This case is nice and will protect your blades but would be nice if the lid latched closed. Otherwise the construction is nice and sturdy for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
    <li> This is only good if you do not plan to transport the blades.  Otherwise, they will shift around in this container and remain all mixed up.</li>
    <li> Where do I start, your better off finding some tupperware. First the bottom isn&#x27;t padded like I&#x27;ve seen on other blade case, the way it&#x27;s designed you cannot grab the blades out without a struggle, and finally the lid, imagine you have some thin shards of fragile exspensive glass laying on a plate (this would be your blades) now place another plate on top of that plate (this is your lid) You can&#x27;t hold the lid it will slip off, it doesn&#x27;t latch down, and when place in a bag to carry, your blades would be all over the place and so would the lid, just like with the plates. This is only good for sitting on a counter and struggling to get your blades out. Andies makes a case that fits Oster blades and its much better, made for carrying.</li>
    <li> Oster Professional 76004-011 Artic Igloo Clipper Blade Storage System- love it.  As a barber I keep sanatization 100% as a priority. After a long day cutting hair I have a system to clean all of my blades and put back into this case.  Great product.</li>
    <li> A bit hard to open if not attached to something.</li>
    <li> I really love it.  It holds all my blades just fine. I put my blade end down as it is easier to grab a blade that way and no worry of cutting my fingers. I can see the number on the blade better this way, too.  I hope to hang it on the wall soon.</li>
    <li> I actually kinda hate this thing. The lid doesn&#x27;t hinge and is a bit tricky to take on and off at first but worst of all, it all feels cheap and flimsy. I&#x27;m going to throw this out and get some of the long, slender boxes that my buddy got from the pet grooming supply.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for your clipper guards. My stylist liked them so much I used them as an incentive gift for them. Now we are all happy with the organizer.</li>
    <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t swivel up or down, tough to keep lid in place. Not recommended, save your money by ordering something else.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Ships fast, holds the blades, is not (despite what&#x27;s been said) difficult to remove blades. Plus the price is like half of what you&#x27;d have to pay elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback- you&#x27;ll want to buy a bunch of blades to fill your slots.</li>
    <li> plastic tray not much to review.</li>
    <li> Awesome thanks. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I I would and plan to order this product again.I I truly appreciate and enjoy using this product</li>
    <li> Really sucks doesn&#x27;t hold your blades in place.</li>
    <li> Its made of great hard plastic however if you want to travel with it the blades bounce around with no foam protection.</li>
    <li> it&#x27; s ok, but not easy to carry it.</li>
    <li> There should be a hinge for the cover, otherwise the storage is fine.</li>
    <li> The clipper heads don&#x27;t stay in the compartments it&#x27;s suppose to keep them organized and they fall out.. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again ;/</li>
    <li> it was good. It protected my gaurds well but they some times be getting out of their little slots rather then that i like it .</li>
    <li> Designed to hang on the wall or just use on a flat surface, either way it have been designed with the cover hinged because as it is, it is not very user friendly! I did design my own hinge system for it and it works okay, but was difficult to do being the way it was made. Great idea, just not such a great design.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Just a bottom and a top. The two are sort of a pain to put together, they have to be aligned just right. It needs a hinge to keep the two pieces together. Since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be another product out there any better, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> i wish the lid was on a hinge is the only thing that gives it 4 star instead of five</li>
    <li> Outstanding. love the cover, great product mounting system. The cover is what attracted me and it is jut what i expected.</li>
    <li> Purchased this box to store my clipper blades for my grooming kit.  It&#x27;s pretty much exactly as described, but the one thing I will say is that the blades can be a little difficult to get out from time to time, but that might just be user error (butterfingers).</li>
    <li> It would be so much nicer if the lid would actually clasp shut. Horrible for transporting.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t clasp close or anything so when I leave work I have to make sure to carry it very carefully in my bag (but i knew that already when ordering it) but it does make my station look a lot cleaner and more organized</li>
    <li> Goes perfect with my oster professional speed clipper holds all my blades in a stylish see thru case that I have mounted on my wall</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to keep blades organized, but it has one major flaw. The lid fits on awkwardly and isn&#x27;t secured to the base in anyway. If you want to use this to transport blades, you basically have to tape it closed. I find it good for storing my blades, but the lid is less than great.</li>
    <li> It would work great as a &amp;#34;hang on the wall&amp;#34; box... But is awful for &amp;#34;in the drawer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;in the bag&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I think they could have made this a lot better.  There is no cushion in the compartments and the lid falls right off. Nothing keeping the container and lid together.</li>
    <li> But it holds my clipper blades well. Well, pretty well. It&#x27;s not padded inside or anything and they slide about a bit. But it does the job well enough! There is an option to hang it on the wall which is just strange.</li>
    <li> i got sick of my blades being all over the place and leaving my work station a mess. many of my coworkers have this very same storage system; i was always envious of how neat their stations looked, so it was time i got my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has made cleaning and organizing my tools a breeze, i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fit all my oster blades, and made it look clean and professional.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for all barbers!</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes storing my blades so easy and keeps them nice and safe when not being used. Lid is awesome, you can flip it under neath when using your blades.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> Great tray to keep your clipper blades in order.</li>
    <li> I liked the blade storage system, but the blades are difficult to get out if its not hung up, Still would get it again.</li>
    <li> I LITTLE BIT TO EXPENSIVE DO THE JOB OK THE TOP IS A LITTLE DIFUCULT TO PUT IT ON TAKE A LOT OF SPACE  LOOK NICE</li>
