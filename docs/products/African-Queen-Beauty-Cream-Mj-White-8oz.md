      <li>three of their gels and their serum in order for the cream to work and make u light fast</li>
      <li>so far okay no break out.</li>
      <li>U must be consistent with it.</li>
      <li>but in all fairness, no pun intended, I havent been that consistent.</li>
      <li>I love African Queen products.</li>
      <li>but my skin is so smooth and clear that I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
      <li>Am I using too much?</li>

      <li>AS FAST OR AS</li>
      <li>it just smell really gud doesnt work or bleach</li>
      <li>It really works</li>

      <li>I am lightening my whole body.</li>
      <li>I stopped using the Piona bleaching cream and made this the main cream i use.</li>
      <li>This product is too high to not work.</li>

      <li>more ocassionally as in every other day rather than religiously, once a day.</li>
      <li>it make my spots more dark and black in the first week....  </li>
      <li>The female on facebook really had me convinced to try this.</li>
      <li>Thanks African Queen</li>
      <li>Yes, I definitely recommend this product but keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and each person responds differently so what is great for me may not necessarily be great for another.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t see a difference compare to the Pink Cream.</li>
      <li>This product really works, and does remove dark spots from your skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was watery as if it was a bad batch it was not usable I threw it away very disappointed</li>
    <li> Have not been using it long...so far okay no break out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product probably a month ago in february 2011 and I&#x27;ve been using it since and there has been no results. This product is too high to not work.I&#x27;m light skinned so I dont need it to bleach but I though it would lighten my dark spots on my back and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love African Queen products. I have been using these products for many years and I still get compliments on my skin everyday. Before I was introduced to this product from a friend my skin was very dark and blothcy from pimples. After about two months of using the product I was amazed at how beautiful my skin was looking. I was more confident and attracted more men. I actually met my husband soon after I started using the product. The best thing for me is that I really don&#x27;t have to wear makeup anymore (I do to feel fab) but my skin is so smooth and clear that I don&#x27;t need it. Thanks African Queen</li>
    <li> This cream works and i don&#x27;t understand when i see reviews by others who say that it doesn&#x27;t work for them. It works for me and everyone is asking what I use on my skin. I feel and look gorgeous. It makes my skin smooth. For those of you who are not seeing results please do a power exfoliation on your affected area before putting this cream on. It works with a week but with exfoliation, results are even faster. Of course some areas are harder to brighten than others but please exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate like no body&#x27;s business and that cream will sink right in and get to work! You will get results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works like magic</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than two months now...more ocassionally as in every other day rather than religiously, once a day. I really bought it to lighten my arms and forearms which were darkened 4 shades after working in the sun for years. While rubbing it on my arms, i decided to use it on my face too. After 3 weeks, my sister kept telling my how great my skin looks and it actually glows. And she still iterates how fairer I look six weeks later. The thing is, I feel my arms look the same...but in all fairness, no pun intended, I havent been that consistent. Yes, I definitely recommend this product but keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and each person responds differently so what is great for me may not necessarily be great for another. There is also another thing to keep in mind when about using skin lighteners, they do not necessarily lighten your skin uniformly......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been more than a year now and my arms have gotten lighter to the original colour. Most importantly, it has evened out my skin tone so nicely - both my face and arms. I no longer have 2 to 3 different shades on my face. Yesterday my friend told me that my skin looks beautiful and this is the only product I have been using since. Best product.</li>
    <li> The product does lighten the skin</li>
    <li> super cream is faster</li>
    <li> I hate the product the 3of them the gel and whitening cream,, I order it after I read the reviews I thought it&#x27;s good , but it getting me darker it make my spots more dark and black in the first week....  I feel regret for buying them and am not using it anymore .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using African queen beauty cream off and on for years.the reason i have to stop using it is because it gets my skin really light.I have severe hyper-pigmentation and this cream lightens my dark spots about four shades lighter. It really works</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cream in the past but I do believe that this company sells or knock-off or that the formula has changed.  After a few days of use my entire face erupted in unsightly bumps.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> im in love with this product it works perfect.... i have tryed every one of there products and my face looks amazing!! thank you african queen!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now. Even though it gives my face a glow. I have significantly lighter spots around my mouth. I&#x27;m dark skinned so its easy to notice. I put it on twice a day everyday. Am I using too much? Is it permanent?</li>
    <li> If I use a product and don&#x27;t see results within two weeks I tend to kick it..</li>
    <li> need something stronger and not with perfumes</li>
    <li> This product really works, and does remove dark spots from your skin</li>
    <li> This cream.really give my skin a nice tone I love it .very much it has it own sunblock.</li>
    <li> I hate African Queen Beauty Cream.This product should be banned immediately.False advertisement!The company that produces this crap better watch out because I plan on suing.The so-called beauty cream ruined my face and neck. I will never,never ever purchase african queen beauty cream.And, don&#x27;t get me started talking about the so-called beauty cream smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the MJ White cream for  3 weeks and I really don&#x27;t see a difference compare to the Pink Cream. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase the MJ White Cream again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 7 WEEKS NOW, AND ALL MY SPOTS ARE GONE...I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING...INCLUDED PERSCRIPTIONS FROM KAISER AND NOTHING HAS WORKED AS FAST OR AS WELL AS THIS..I&#x27;VE TOLD EVERYONE ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just  received my mj cream three of their gels and their serum in order for the cream to work and make u light fast u have to mix three of their African gel plus one bottle of their African serum mix them and place it in the refrigerater  also get their complexion lotion with antibacterial ok  then u must take a shower bathe thoroughly with their African queen soap after u dry off apply the complexion lotion all over your body and face let it dry soak in skin then take the  cream out of the refrigerater it should be cold  then apply cream all over body  this will work you will be light in a week I&#x27;m seeing results my first day happy customer</li>
    <li> THE CREAM MEET EXPERTATIONS . VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with it.  Meet my expectations</li>
    <li> it just smell really gud doesnt work or bleach i used it for a month consistently no results just like lotion dont waste yer money!</li>
    <li> Someone I know on Facebook used his cream to lighten their skin. They were Oprah complexion and now she is Alicia Keys complexion, i just ordered me some MJ white offline today. So will keep you all updated on how it works!! The female on facebook really had me convinced to try this. I am darkskin and want to be more lighter. So I am happy that i found this product, im waiting for it to arrive. The girl on facebook is the same complexion as me, so i definitely know that it will work.  ..................*Update*.................  Okay so i have been using the cream for about a week now. And yes my skin has lightened tremendously.I stopped using the Piona bleaching cream and made this the main cream i use. Within a few days i started seeing results but u must exfoliate. I am lightening my whole body. The face is easiest to lighten now im working on other parts to lighten it up. Skin lightening takes time to accomplish esp if u are really dark like me. I have gotten in the habit of taking the cream with me when i go out. I use the cream constantly throughout the day and then exfoliate my skin. Its a process. U just cant slap on bleaching cream and think its going to work overnight. U must be consistent with it. Email me nalishaw89@gmail.com to share yur story.</li>
