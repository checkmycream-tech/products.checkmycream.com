      <li>the best solution for those who do not have reversible shoulder joints to scratch your shoulder blades and back;  the telescoping handle makes storage very easy.</li>

      <li>Very cheap.</li>
      <li>It gives a perfect back scratch.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;It is better than advertized.</li>
      <li>After searching for &amp; using many Back Scratchers this one is great!</li>
      <li>is this muse of love, I inquired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Amazon</li>
      <li>I love that I can close it and carry in my travel bag or purse.</li>
      <li>Love them</li>
      <li>These are more durable then bamboo and</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Just love this scratcher.  </li>
      <li>and I love this item for that.</li>
      <li>I will order more to use as stocking stuffers.  </li>
      <li>My dad will love it</li>
      <li>Thanks goes to Amazon&#x27;s great return policy.</li>
      <li>better off getting a bamboo one or a plastic</li>
      <li>I put it back together the best that I could</li>
      <li>would have liked a more secure (perhaps soldered) fit for the head of the device.</li>
      <li>Not expensive and truly loved when needed.</li>
      <li>Very good back scratcher.  </li>
      <li>Works great when directly on the skin.</li>
      <li>but i guess this but is better then others because it can fold up very easy to bring around good portible back scratcher</li>
      <li>Cute little tool, works great!  </li>
      <li>Easy to carry, there when you need it.</li>
      <li>The expandable feature makes it easy to store &amp; carry anywhere.</li>

      <li>It bends as easily as a soda can.  </li>
      <li>3) Easy to extend and contract.  </li>
      <li>Extended easily.</li>
      <li>Whereas with the bamboo one I can easily go over the shoulder, with this one, because of the flexing, I have to go underhand and up to the shoulder</li>
      <li>Not only are they good for scratching , but they come in handy for picking things up or reaching things that are out of reach.</li>
      <li>I snagged this puppy up for a pretty nice price.  </li>
      <li>The telescopic part makes it awesome to fit in a purse or drawer or other bag.  </li>
      <li>it should be fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine for infrequent use or someone who isn&#x27;t needing to use it aggressively.</li>
      <li>Received just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;1/29/2013 UPDATE - Still works just fine.</li>
      <li>And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it for a quick, easy gift that is sure to bring a smile!</li>
      <li>The telescoping portion is fine, but I had to put a bit of electrical tape to secure the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, this little guy fits the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>My husband liked them so much that I then purchased a couple for him...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great to keep on hand for those who cannot reach the middle of the back.  the cost is minimum for the comfort to alleviate iching in the mid back.</li>
    <li> We keep one of these little guys in several rooms.  Once you get the hang of how to angle them, there is no better back scratcher.  We tried the wooden back scratchers but they seem dull.  Just scratch and say ahhhhh!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect find to brighten up my deployed husband&#x27;s day! The next time I got to talk to him after he received the care package with this it it, he was raving about it! He said it was awesome, and every one wants one now! And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it for a quick, easy gift that is sure to bring a smile!</li>
    <li> had to bend it to get it working to its full potential. it came with the scratcher bent at a 90 degree angle. heated the metal up, straightened it, then let it cool. Works great now. only drawback is that doesnt have a twist to tighten when extended.      **update** had to glue it together with super glue at least 3 times over the next couple months. Snapped in two for the last time about 2 weeks ago. Tossed it. Did the job for a couple months but imo not worth buying again.</li>
    <li> The product was worthless. It fell apart almost as soon as I bought it. The telescoped end of the scratcher fell off and made the whole thing useless.</li>
    <li> It works well, but its flimsy. Broke after a week. I picked this back scratcher because it was most popular...will know better next time.</li>
    <li> Handy, useful, portable, efficient, marvelous and perfect. Don&#x27;t question yourself. If you&#x27;re looking at this, you need it and want it and will be happy you bought it. Mine was a gift. Be THAT guy!</li>
    <li> The item is very poor quality and arrived bent in two places. It was not all chrome like the photo and was made of very soft metal, even the pocket clip was bent, it appeared so soft that it would bend with light use. Go for one with a higher price. It stated \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; on the label and it really was poorly made. If bent back it would surely break. I returned it and since I had Prime there was no shipping cost either way. I would not recommend this to a friend or anyone. Thanks goes to Amazon&#x27;s great return policy.</li>
    <li> You can not beat the price for this item.  I got this item delivered in a reasonable time, even before the actual date I needed it.  I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves this item and I like it just as much cause I&#x27;m not his designated back scratcher anymore.</li>
    <li> This back scratcher works very well, but when I got it I noticed the tines were a little flat to do much good.  After I bent them down a little so they were a little more direct, the thing worked wonderfully.  I like the telescoping action especially.  Nice and compact when closed.</li>
    <li> The back scratcher I receieved is completely different than the one pictured in the advert photo.  The one I got does not have the side bolstering as pictured here. It bends as easily as a soda can.  Very flimsy.  I love Amazon and I know I can just reurn it, but I figured for $3.90 I should just write this review and alert others not to buy it.</li>
    <li> After searching for &amp; using many Back Scratchers this one is great! It is better than the bamboo ones which usually have some rough edges. The expandable feature makes it easy to store &amp; carry anywhere. The metal scratcher can be cleaned very easily.</li>
    <li> Ordinary termination.  I know scratching you back isn&#x27;t a royalty action but I&#x27;ve seen premium finished back scratchers that looks much more beautyful than this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased a couple of these for my father-in-law....He loves them.  My husband liked them so much that I then purchased a couple for him...one for his sunroom and one for the bedroom.  These are more durable then bamboo and the price is right (even though shipping is too high)  I was afraid that they wouldn&#x27;t telescope out long enough but no, not a problem.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these items. The item is very cheaply made. You have to be very carfeul for it not to break. I enjoy using it though. The blades on the scratcher does a very good job. I don&#x27;t think it is worth $7 but it is worth $4 in my book.     It reaches places on my back that I have a hard time scratching and I love this item for that.</li>
    <li> this product worked all of 5 times or so, then broke off close to the claw.  looks like some sort of piece fell out of it.  unable to put back together.  i went with a regular wooden one after this one crashed.</li>
    <li> I bought 3, one for the house and two for the cars. First one fell apart- telescoping section came out. Second one literally bent while I was using it. I have never had one do that before. I will stick with the old fashioned wood one from now on.</li>
    <li> pretty good back scratcher like any other back scratcher it scratchs  but i guess this but is better then others because it can fold up very easy to bring around good portible back scratcher nothing really more to say i would recommend it is all i guess</li>
    <li> For 5 bucks I guess it&#x27;s OK.  The actual scratching part is only about an inch wide and I think the telescoping part will bend/break if I apply too much pressure. My kingdom for a decent back scratcher!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these backscratchers, so much I have purchased 6 of them. Keep one at differant places around the house and one in my truck. Not only are they good for scratching , but they come in handy for picking things up or reaching things that are out of reach. Love them</li>
    <li> The back scratcher was well received, though I wonder if it will be strong enough to last when telescoped out?  The utility of collapsing it though is really nice.</li>
    <li> My husband has been asking me for a back scratcher for a couple of months and I finally got him one. He absolutely loves it.  Of course, it isn&#x27;t quite as good as a person, but he can get all the spots he couldn&#x27;t on his own.  He also likes the telescope feature because it&#x27;s nice an compact.</li>
    <li> This item does a great job as a scratcher.  The only complaint is that the scratcher part is a little too bendable.  When you have to put the telescoper together again its a little difficult not to bend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big guy.. with broad shoulders and a wide back.  I also dislocated my shoulder from the back so it&#x27;s really tough for me to reach the tough spots sometimes.  So when I get the occasional skeeter bite or random bumpy itch on the bottom of my shoulder blade that just won&#x27;t go away you can understand that I really need the right tool to get the job done.  I snagged this puppy up for a pretty nice price.  At first I was like cool, I can shrink it down and stick it in my desk drawer at work.  I can also show off a bit and make my co-workers jealous.  I was very very wrong.  Not a month after I recieved it, I the thing twists around in the opposite direction (telescopic you see) and also the scratcher isn&#x27;t glued on or sealed.  The scratcher head just pops right off.  Not only that but it&#x27;s small.  It barely makes a proper nut-scratcher.    If you are a 12 yr old or a skinny short girl then I can see people taking advantage of this thing.  But for a big guy like me it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
    <li> too flimsy it broke after about a months use</li>
    <li> Very good back scratcher.  Just what I thought it would be.  Ordered 3 of them,, wish I had 5 since they seem to get lost around the house.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST must have item ever!!! Does the trick every time. Highly recommended! Got a nice reach too.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these, so far they seam to be sturdy and high quality. I am happy with them :-)</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these already because I love the concept of having a compact back scratcher that extends for a low price. Sadly, BOTH of them fell apart after a few months of use. Each section starts breaking off one by one. Don&#x27;t waste your time with these.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this thing. mine has broken after only a few months of use. the constantly pulling it in and out to stretch will literally break it, and this is what happened to mine, over time. better off getting a bamboo one or a plastic one like I used to have, it&#x27;ll last much, much longer. one where you don&#x27;t have to keep pulling in and out.</li>
    <li> This item fits right into my lunchbox, extends, does the job, then folds right back up. I don&#x27;t go to work without it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it could fit in my purse, or attach to my pockets. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> The back scratcher is fine, but if you grasp it by the scratching part, it pops off. The telescoping portion is fine, but I had to put a bit of electrical tape to secure the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked a more secure (perhaps soldered) fit for the head of the device.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves his back scratched really hard so I wanted to get him something sturdy that wouldn&#x27;t give him splinters.  I thought this one would do the trick, but it broke within a week!  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> A nice travel back scratcher, but came loose. I had to glue it to stay.</li>
    <li> Just got this for the wife and I. It works great and is pretty \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; and does not bend. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The back scratcher is great in theory- great design, great concept, etc. The fact that it telescopes make you wonder why *all* of them aren&#x27;t made like that. So why two stars? Well, it broke almost immediately. I think I used it two or three times before it completely fell apart. I put it back together the best that I could and it worked poorly for a few days and then it broke completely. I am not super happy about the whole thing, and I&#x27;m not sure if mine was just faulty or if these are just made extremely poorly.</li>
    <li> A good device when bed ridden and unable to reach hard to get places.Also use as a tool to reach for things when they are out of reach . The pocket clip helps me keep it close to me at all times, never have to search for it .</li>
    <li> I sent this item to a friend who travels a lot, thinking that the telescopic handle would fold up nicely for travel. However, the recipient reports that he didn&#x27;t like this backscratcher because the handle was \\&quot;loose and rotated a lot...you can&#x27;t use it to &#x60;dig in&#x27; a lot.\\&quot; Knowing that I have never seen or handled this item myself, it is possible that one could somehow \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the handle in place if the effort was made, but I didn&#x27;t get the impression that the recipient spent any real time trying to get the handle to stay in place.  I followed up with a gift of two regular bamboo backscratchers (JMK 06590 Long Reach Bamboo Back Scratcher-2 Pack) which the recipient really likes and seems to be getting a lot of use from.</li>
    <li> This back scratcher is small and ideal to take when traveling.  It is not of great quality but small enough to pack and have with you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s perpetually itchy back ... and it&#x27;s just not strong or large enough. It&#x27;s fairly puny, so it doesn&#x27;t satisfy the really annoying itches like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this would probably be good for a kid??? But not so good for a grown man who constantly needs his back scratched ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this it fits in my purse real well and reaches ever where. I will get some more for Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Product felt flimsy when I initially extended it, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.  On the fifth use, it came apart, sending two brackets flying across the room.  Great concept, but very poorly constructed.</li>
    <li> It fell apart after about 2 uses.  There are tiny pieces of metal inside that hold the tel-scoping bit together.  One of those falls out and the whole thing goes to pieces.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great little product.  I especially like the telescoping handle.  Very handy for someone with limited reach.  Bought two for me and several for gifts</li>
    <li> The title says it all!  The best investment I&#x27;ve ever made.  It reaches all those hard to get at spots easily, soothes the itch nicely. Feels so good my arm gets tired. Telescoping handle works well and isn&#x27;t as flimsy as some reviewers have said, you just have to remember it isn&#x27;t a solid piece of metal.</li>
    <li> Cute little tool, works great!  Love the telescoping element!  I keep one in my purse at all times, so I&#x27;m never forced to weirdly contort myself in an effort to satisfy that &amp;#34;just out of reach&amp;#34; itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;scratcher head&amp;#34; does come off at times from being jostled around in my purse, but it screws back on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This little tool works great for someone with arthritis. I love that I can close it and carry in my travel bag or purse. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this item while in the military and have sent them to friends who are deployed, it is a great item to have  in the field.</li>
    <li> I worked well for a little while, but if you accidentally tug too hard on it, it comes apart and is hard to put back together.</li>
    <li> This is a $4 back scratcher. Nothing more, nothing less. It does exactly what you think it does - extends, folds back up nicely and scratches backs. It&#x27;s a month old and hasn&#x27;t broken and shows no sign that&#x27;s on the horizon. Does seem to be much cheaper than say &amp;#34;The Claw&amp;#34; models but it&#x27;s fine for infrequent use or someone who isn&#x27;t needing to use it aggressively.</li>
    <li> I bought a number of these little gadgets for &amp;#34;stocking stuffers&amp;#34; at Christmas.  All the recipients were elated to get them, and I&#x27;ve actually seen them using the gadgets...so I&#x27;m saying it was a good gift!</li>
    <li> These back-scratcher are inexpensive, but they work very well.  The point where the scratcher joins to the handle is the weak spot and if bent back and forth enough, will break.  However, at this cost, you can afford to buy several more to replace it and they last a long time before they break.  The telescoping handle makes it handy to reach any part of your back and also make it useful for other tasks around the house.  I sometimes use it to scoot something on a high shelf closer to me or off the shelf entirely.</li>
    <li> this is a great item for me.  I am 70 and cannot reach my back as well as I once did.  I ordered two and keep one in my car and one at home.</li>
    <li> This is great! It extends and reaches places impossible to reach with the bare hand or corner of the cabinet. Well made, too.</li>
    <li> works well, but the head can bent, if  you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband while he spent a tour in Iraq. And he said it has replaced me.</li>
    <li> This thing is great because:  1) It scratches very nicely; Not too sharp/Not too dull.  2) Nice compact size without being flimsy when extended.  3) Easy to extend and contract.  I will order more to use as stocking stuffers.  I only wish they would have sent the free one that they said they would send with every order. Maybe that was a special they were running and forgot to take off.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 ... they are great..</li>
    <li> The back scratcher is great.  It is compact and gets the job done. Not made of wood-so it won&#x27;t break.  Only complaint was the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> This tool is very effective and so compact it fits anywhere.  Sturdy construction and easy to use.  My husband says its the best one he has ever used.</li>
    <li> Broke super fast.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these years ago, and I keep one at all times in my car, but the other one went missing. I missed it very much, so I bought this. I initially tried to pick one up on ebay, but got out bid. The bidder paid an outragous amount! Very pleased with this, perfectly sturdy, and just scratchy enough. Silly little item, but I love the convenience and not having to twist my arm to get at the difficult places!</li>
    <li> It may be a simple back scratcher but it my husband&#x27;s favorite back scratcher besides my nails.  We&#x27;ve tried a few and this was the best as it extends and does not become flimsy.</li>
    <li> Works great, though I wish the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; were more pointy and less rounded.  Holds its length well when extended.  I bought two: one for home and one for office.</li>
    <li> It is Great. It will really get to those hard to reach places! I bought two [2]. didn&#x27;t need the clip, but should come in handy.</li>
    <li> The first one I ordered got lost in the mail. The company shipped another one out right away free of charge. Product is nice.</li>
    <li> Being 100% physically disabled and needed to reach to scratch an itch can be a problem. This is ideal for the price and it can sit on my desk top for daily use, or be folded into compact size for travelling. It arrived on time, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me to take to the office. Works great when directly on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t have enough strength to apply great pressure through clothes. The end of the scratcher can bend pretty easy. I tend to use a corner wall instead of this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband because I was tired of being asked to scratch his back every night. Now he keeps this in his bedside table and it does the job for me. Feels a little flimsy due to the telescoping wand, but has held up for over a year no problem. Unless you&#x27;re scratching very... vigerously it should be fine.</li>
    <li> Its very flimsy.  I couldn&#x27;t scratch as hard as I wanted to. I was afraid it would break.  And when I finally put some pressure into it it bent. it no longer goes back into the original shape it was.</li>
    <li> We all know that habitual back scratcher addict out there!  Tired of seeing your poor friend or relative do the door frame wiggle dance trying to get at that itch?!  Well, this little guy fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Read the measurement because it&#x27;s really small!  Good quality, just tiny!</li>
    <li> the best solution for those who do not have reversible shoulder joints to scratch your shoulder blades and back;  the telescoping handle makes storage very easy.</li>
    <li> This will allow you to reach your itching back, and is durable and cokpact. But the head is subject to twisting tge wrong way on contact.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my coworkers. Not expensive and truly loved when needed. Ahhhs abound.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t know how the product will hold up long term - it is a little on the cheaply made side, and what can you really expect for the price - it sure is a handy little thing while it lasts! It&#x27;s small enough to fit in a purse. Discrete enough to use even in public. Handy to store. And if you need it to be longer, it adjusts.</li>
    <li> These are great because they telscope and are sturdy because they are metal but the clip falls off easily as it unscrews too easily.  otherwise a good buy and good item.</li>
    <li> This was a handy little tool that I was in desperate need of as I do not have nails. However, it did break after only a month :(</li>
    <li> Stayed together for about a week, then then it fell apart on me. Based on that, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I met, on a recent return to my premises from Cheyne Walk, a certain gentleman who you know and I know, one B------- S-------.  He looked aghast, not his usual, contained self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve come across this maiden fair.  Beguiling is she!  I&#x27;d name her a right witch, but her whiles are sumptuous and intoxicating!  I&#x27;ll not lose her for a guinea a day.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this muse of love, I inquired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Telescopic Back Scratcher with Pocket Clip,&amp;#34; he intoned, and left me, beset by the fickle universe of love, in the London rain.</li>
    <li> I only had this item 2 weeks when it broke off at the last section.  These &amp;#34;antenna types&amp;#34; are just not as sturdy as the noncollapsable types.</li>
    <li> This back scratcher is funny and looks like a neat little gift to get someone. Too bad it sucks. I bought this for my boyfriend as a dorky little gift and it broke right after he opened it. It always falls apart when using it and is not very well made.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose but does not look like as what is pictured. Looks a bit of low quality, but looks can be deceiving.</li>
    <li> Product arrived ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than advertized.</li>
    <li> wife loves it now I dont have to scratch her back</li>
    <li> I put this in my boyfriend&#x27;s stocking last Christmas so he would stop grabbing random stuff around the house to scratch his back with (gross!). He claims this is one of his favorite gifts ever. It extends a little bit which is cool, and it&#x27;s metal so it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> Cute idea but broke after a few days.</li>
    <li> Bent the first day, broke the second. Flimsy and useless. If you have an itch, this won&#x27;t scratch it, bends rather than scratches. Cheap, yes, so I tried it, but it was no bargain.</li>
    <li> Great! (: This back scratcher is awesome and it gets the job done. My dad will love it (: (:</li>
    <li> Purchased this item Aug, 2014. After 5-15 uses (don&#x27;t remember, but not a great number), the piece connecting the scratcher head to the extendable stem snapped off. Yes it did not cost much, but I don&#x27;t like to throw away money regardless of amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it into a desk drawer and forgot about it until today when I found it in the bottom of the drawer. I got to experienced that feeling of being taken once again.</li>
    <li> Love it , itnreaches the spots I cant reach and feels great and sturdy. I,would reccomend to any body !!!!!</li>
    <li> forget this one. It broke in a week. The bamboo back scrathber os easily lost because it blends into surroundings, but it works so much better</li>
    <li> I gave these a gifts and kept one for myself. It&#x27;s handy, doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.</li>
    <li> in my purse all the time....I am quite surprised how much it gets used.</li>
    <li> Need to scratch your back. This permits it. Easy to carry, there when you need it. A great gift for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this back scratcher because I can put it away in a drawer and by the bed so it&#x27;s always handy and when I need it, it is heaven.  I have had these for well over a year now and have had no problems with them.  The telescopic part makes it awesome to fit in a purse or drawer or other bag.  You have to be careful if you are getting too vigorous between your clothes and on your back I could see if you were really getting after it that it might bend.  But, I take care of my stuff so I haven&#x27;t had that problem as long as you scratch up and down there is no problem as long as you are not using your clothes as a fulcrum to get more pressure, I could see where that would cause a problem.  It&#x27;s one of the best scratchers I have ever had and does the job and takes up very little space.</li>
    <li> Nothing else will do when you have an itch you can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> I just love this back scratcher I recently lost my husband so need back scratcher does great job for me at cheap price seen some reviews complain on how long last I don&#x27;t see a problem seems well built to me just like a stereo antena :-)</li>
    <li> Very cheap. I bought this and it lasted about three weeks before it bent. Little bit of tape back to new (well not quite) then another bend and then, finally,  it went in the trash where it belongs; the quality is as low as the cost. In this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This thing fell apart within 5 min of opening the package it came in.&lt;br /&gt;  It was not missused in any way it was mearly used to scratch my back once then fell apart.</li>
    <li> after only a few uses the scratching head broke off.  only the telescoping mechanism seemed to be durable.  good gag gift but no serious applications should be attempted. better off with dollar store wooden hand.</li>
    <li> This makes a terrific, inexpensive sumpin sumpin gift.  Very fragile and lightweight so must handle with care when extending -- I wouldn&#x27;t extend it too much. It&#x27;s the size of a writing pen when collapsed. I will be giving several of these away and ordering an extra for myself. It gives a perfect back scratch.  I&#x27;m impressed but wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if it broke cuz I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price.  BTW, it comes in a clear zip-type bag so can easily get lost if shipped with other items. I almost threw mine away with box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Mine is not the same as the one pictured so hopefully it&#x27;s an improved version(?). It looks more like the Kikkerland Telescoping Back Scratcher  [[ASIN:B000UVT8GQ Kikkerland Telescoping Back Scratcher, Silver]] .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/21/2012 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this a lot just because I like how it feels. It&#x27;s neither sharp nor flat.  Like the little bear said, it&#x27;s just right. Feels a lot like fingernails.  Although it is not as fragile as I thought and seems sturdy enough, I still wouldn&#x27;t yank it out or handle roughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/29/2013 UPDATE - Still works just fine.</li>
    <li> My husband just started using this the other day.  His last one was wooden and broke.  Thought the metal would be better and nice the it collapsed smaller to store in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I love this back scratcher. It&#x27;s used daily and has held up very well. I have has  this for a year now and it&#x27;s still in new shape. I gave 4 stars only because I wish the hand part was a little wider, but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
    <li> Nifty little thing, keep it in your pocket as if it were a pen, also its fun to play with.</li>
    <li> Received just fine. Extended easily. I am unable to find mine, but that is my mistake. I may have accidently thrown out with the box! So I haven&#x27;t had the privilege of using this regularly, which I was so much looking forward to.</li>
    <li> Just love this scratcher.  It is very small, but strong.  It comes in so handy when you get that scratch that you just can&#x27;t reach.  The telescopic adjustment is well made and makes it great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product regular old back scratcher nothing special. I purchased one and it broke within a month.</li>
    <li> Item has broken within the fist week of use. Bad quality item.</li>
    <li> Works as a back scratcher.  Seems like an odd thing to keep in ones pocket but I bought it as a gift.  She says it works so overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good things:  Small, discreet, can travel easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad things, Small, bends too easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made from what appears to be an antenna, and as so, bends when enough tension is applied to actually scratch the back.  The tines (or fingers) of the scratching end are not rough or edged enough to impart a scratching feel.  I think using a spoon might have the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good replacement for a traditional bamboo scratcher in any way.  Whereas with the bamboo one I can easily go over the shoulder, with this one, because of the flexing, I have to go underhand and up to the shoulder blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you can&#x27;t tell the scale, but when folded it is the size of a table fork, extended it is about the size of a standard scratcher, but with half the scratching area and none of the bite of a regular bamboo unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it is cheap and I probably could have researched it more before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I met some ladies who each had one in their purse.  They were very pleased so I decided to purchase some for stocking stuffers. Since I have not had a chance to try mine, as it goes into the stocking, I can&#x27;t say how they hold up. I keep looking at the back scratchers and and thinking that I may order a few more to put with some of the packages that I will be sending.</li>
    <li> The length is adjustable and the weight is solid enough to provide a good scratch for all those hard to reach places. It&#x27;s also small and light weight to fit in your purse or glove compartment! A Great Buy!!</li>
    <li> Finally the back scratcher that gets those hard to reach places, but fits in your pocket--what the hell took so long  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even has a pocket clip.</li>
    <li> worked great until it broke in half. a real piece of chinese junk. Sorry cant reccoment this. get a real thick wooden one.</li>
