      <li>I thought it was going to come as shown just like a bright blue Tiffanys Box.</li>

      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It is really pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good solid, forgiving, true color that gives a professional glaze to it.</li>

      <li>Also shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Shipping was normal.</li>
      <li>, I thought it had a little mint color to it, but it looks almost like the bohemain color, the bohemain is more close to a sky blue.</li>
      <li>If you put it on correctly with a good base and top coat, then it will last the entire week without chipping.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had expected.</li>

    <li> So happy to have this Tiffany blue. It&#x27;s a little lighter in the bottle. Hoping when I apply it dries a little darker. Shipping was normal. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to come as shown just like a bright blue Tiffanys Box. But it definately did not come that way. Its like a dingy sky blue color. Should have bought something else.</li>
    <li> Love it A All Time fav</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Purchased for my bridesmaids and will match their dresses and my wedding color very well.</li>

    <li> Beautiful color! Doesn&#x27;t get watery. But it does chip &#x3D;( Still worth it though!</li>

    <li> I LOVE CHINA GLAZE!! But this color doesn&#x27;t look like the color in the picture, I thought it had a little mint color to it, but it looks almost like the bohemain color, the bohemain is more close to a sky blue. Other then this purchase I&#x27;ve been very happy with china glaze, I was always a OPI girl, no more!!! 😸I&#x27;m a china glaze girl all the way now!!!  I&#x27;m going to take a picture of the 2 bottles side by side. The Audrey and bohemain, so people can see the difference or maybe not see a difference.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Beautiful color! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but more of a mint.  Not aqua, maybe I got an off color bottle?.  :(  Still, I adore China Glaze!</li>
    <li> China Glaze is the best polish I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has great lasting power, and the polish is the perfect consistency. If you put it on correctly with a good base and top coat, then it will last the entire week without chipping. It also lends itself to nail art very well. For Audrey is a perfect Tiffany &amp; CO blue... it looks fantastic with whites, blacks, silvers, or just on its own. Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect toenail color for Summer! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Beauty color, appears to be a pinch on the green side than Tiffany Blue. Can&#x27;t wait to wear!</li>
    <li> This is the color of the box you&#x27;ll get from Tiffany&#x27;s with your big diamond ring inside. Or maybe paint your toenails this color and put a tiny white bow on the big piggies. Audrey Hepburn, we love you!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Came in perfect condition. The color is amazing! I definitely recommend this polish for evryone!!! Thanks again! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it ! Thanks for the great service. I look forward to doing business again. the selection is great ! have a great day !</li>
