      <li>work \\&quot;kind of\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>But honestly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>but it smells nice and feels cool and nice</li>
      <li>I started using this product about 9 days ago, and I love it.</li>
      <li>but I believe, I have to be more patient.</li>
      <li>I will post an update within a month to see if it has gotten any better.</li>
      <li>love the fact that this gel is odourless and invisible too.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have two more.  </li>
      <li>This double pack was an excellent buy</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
      <li>I bought this first at a health food store and loved the feel.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is easy to use for most customers.</li>
      <li>- you will run through the cans very quickly.    </li>
      <li>I like that it is odorless and that it absorbs very quickly on your skin.</li>
      <li>I gave this product 2 stars just because it feels good and absorbs good and the ingredients list has no harmful, toxic ingredients, and I like this company and lots of their other products which I feel</li>
      <li>I also posted a pic of my scar to show how light it is...</li>
      <li>Which is important for me.</li>
      <li>But already it just looks like a light callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells nice, feels nice, but several jars in,  </li>
      <li>(Poetic, no?</li>
      <li>The first time I used this gel it made the incision feel better and</li>
      <li>The scar is no longer raised and it has lightened significantly.</li>
      <li>I purchased Derma E Scar Gel for mild post surgical scars around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work on my acne scars, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I used this every day for about a month on dark, unraised scars from bug bites on my leg, and a skiing scrape on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;Although it smells nice and absorbs quickly with no stickiness, it didn&#x27;t reduce pigmentation at all in either</li>
      <li>Have tried many things to &#x27;reduce&#x27; the appearance of acne scars on my shoulders and back.</li>
      <li>Fast shipper !</li>
      <li>do Jiu Jitsu, and most people are bigger and stronger than me, so I have gotten into lifting weights.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hispanic with an olive complexion so the results are pretty amazon.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I&#x27;m with this cream,let me say I have a third degree burn when i was a little girl</li>
      <li>/&gt;A lot of people have made it sound like a miracle product, and although it has only been a month, I am calling it-</li>
      <li>My surgeon said he has never seen a scar heal so fast.  </li>
      <li>This really works.  </li>
      <li>i have a chihuahua who does not like to get her nails cut very often.</li>
      <li>Product shipped fast.</li>
      <li>it used to be much darker.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worked very well for that.</li>
      <li>haha..    </li>
      <li>I used silicone gel and patches for a while and my scars are flat and light.  </li>
      <li>But I can see a size difference in my arm for sure, due to the weight lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream softens the scar tissue, making it more pliable and less intrusive.</li>
      <li>While a representative claims the only thing that changed was the addition of more \\&quot;Panthenol\\&quot;, the only thing I noticed was less product and more air pockets (voids).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone trying to heal their scars.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday 2-3 times a day (occasionally more if I remember).</li>
      <li>While I am not sure if this product will do much for the scars yet (which aren&#x27;t major to begin with), it has made a SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT in the crepey skin under my eyes - a fantastic and unexpected surprise.  </li>
      <li>My right arm is burned around the entire circumference of my bicep.</li>
      <li>This product goes on light and fluffy and really works, it fulfilled my realistic expectations.</li>
      <li>I do notice that it leaves the skin feeling very soft, however.</li>
      <li>Most other products I have experimented with leave a white film, or in the case of coconut oil, and greasy layer that gets all over</li>
      <li>Within the first week my skin was instantly smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the clear gel texture</li>
      <li>i clearly wanted it to fade so that people wouldn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m a wrist-cutter.</li>
      <li>After four months the scar is faded and soft.  </li>
      <li>and it has considerably lightened.</li>
      <li>a day after staples were removed from complete hip replacement.  </li>
      <li>far, 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My granddaughter had surgery on her chest when she was just 4 months old.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be working so far.</li>
      <li>They have been stetching with time too, only not as fast as I need them too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say if you need to get rid of old scars, stick to the scar sheets instead.</li>
      <li>prone, sensitive, oily skin</li>
      <li>Will get back with  more comments after few months.</li>
      <li>Already my scars are noticeably softer and more pliable, the thick parts are already feeling thinner, it&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gets SUPER tight when I lift weights and get a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably not patient enough to use it as it requires multiple applications daily and months of straight usage to see results on older scars.</li>
      <li>My recent shipment came with a New &amp; Improved label on the boxes.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this derma e Scar gel hoping that it would help me with a scar from an old scratch on my hand.</li>
      <li>She used it on half of her 12-inch scar at first</li>
      <li>I have tried many other far more expensive, \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; products for under-eye crepey skin improvement, and this beats them ALL, at least for that issue.  </li>
      <li>She is 19 years old now and has had a problem with the scar tissue for a long time.  </li>
      <li>recommendation: I can&#x27;t speak for old scars, but if you have new cuts, burns, etc, that you think will turn into scars, or if you have newish scars, use this for a few weeks and you will see a major improvement.</li>
      <li>Tried it out on some old and new little scars and marks....</li>
      <li>The surgery left me with a very noticable scar about 6 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
      <li>I have some old scars, not that much visible but getting hard.</li>

<li> recommendation: I can&#x27;t speak for old scars, but if you have new cuts, burns, etc, that you think will turn into scars, or if you have newish scars, use this for a few weeks and you will see a major improvement.</li>
<li> Tried it out on some old and new little scars and marks....</li>
<li> The surgery left me with a very noticable scar about 6 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
<li> I have some old scars, not that much visible but getting hard.</li>
<li> Who has the patience for that?), and in the past 9 days the area has gone from dark brown, puffy and dehydrated, to smooth, the lightest pink and barely there.</li>
<li> so she could compare it to the other half to see if it really worked or if it was wishful thinking.</li>
<li> thing I will note is that I personally found this stuff to be a little tiny bit sticky, but because my burns are so extensive I am slathering it on and totally covering my hand with it, so that might be why.</li>
<li> It is tight because the burns happened when I was 14 years old, and I am 40 now.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made the texture of my skin a little smoother but hasn&#x27;t done much to correct dark scars.  </li>
<li> It has a faint lavender scent to it and goes on smoothly and not too sticky.</li>
<li> I use this a few times a day, it is nearly invisible, and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
<li> Each time it took too long to massage it in</li>
<li> Scars take a long time to fade, but this seems to have helped mine and has improve my skin tone in problem areas.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using it everyday since 3 weeks on surgery scars which are 2 months old.</li>
<li> I knew my scar would not completely blend,  </li>
<li> The company claims it weighs the product, but I have to say it visually appeared to be significantly less than the last 20</li>
<li> MADE MY SKIN DRY</li>
<li> Add to this, that I am actively lifting weights with the intention of getting stronger and putting on some size, and you have some pretty tight &amp; stiff scar tissue issues.</li>
<li> It was dark red and always itching.</li>
<li> The area next to my thumb is a little more difficult as it blistered, so it has been healing a little slower.</li>
<li> I was curious how it will work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> have use 3 times and I have noticed fading..</li>
    <li> i have a chihuahua who does not like to get her nails cut very often. She scratched me on my wrist and it looks like i cut myself, so i clearly wanted it to fade so that people wouldn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m a wrist-cutter. I applied this about once a day for a little over a week and it has considerably lightened. I&#x27;m hispanic with an olive complexion so the results are pretty amazon. I&#x27;m starting to use it on my face and back to help with acne scars and on my thighs and hips to help lighten my stretch marks from puberty. I will post an update within a month to see if it has gotten any better. I also posted a pic of my scar to show how light it is... it used to be much darker.</li>
    <li> Very effective for my skin after razer tuning.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this derma e Scar gel hoping that it would help me with a scar from an old scratch on my hand. I have applied it on the scar on a basis since I received it in July 2011. I like that it is odorless and that it absorbs very quickly on your skin. Since I have not used it for too long, I hesitate to speak of its effectiveness, as I have not noticed any dramatic changes as of yet. I do notice that it leaves the skin feeling very soft, however.</li>
    <li> I used this every day for about a month on dark, unraised scars from bug bites on my leg, and a skiing scrape on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;Although it smells nice and absorbs quickly with no stickiness, it didn&#x27;t reduce pigmentation at all in either case.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have made it sound like a miracle product, and although it has only been a month, I am calling it- it didn&#x27;t work for my scarring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and really liked it.  My recent shipment came with a New &amp; Improved label on the boxes.  While a representative claims the only thing that changed was the addition of more \\&quot;Panthenol\\&quot;, the only thing I noticed was less product and more air pockets (voids).  The company claims it weighs the product, but I have to say it visually appeared to be significantly less than the last 20+ jars I&#x27;ve gotten (that weren&#x27;t \\&quot;improved\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> Is not sticky or oily.  Scars seem to be getting less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two months and can tell a difference. Within the first week my skin was instantly smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work on my acne scars, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;A jar lasted me about 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had surgery on her chest when she was just 4 months old.  She is 19 years old now and has had a problem with the scar tissue for a long time.  Over time, the scar has become tough and doesn&#x27;t bend with her. This cream softens the scar tissue, making it more pliable and less intrusive. She used it on half of her 12-inch scar at first so she could compare it to the other half to see if it really worked or if it was wishful thinking. The good news is that it does work. It won&#x27;t remove the scar, but it does make it feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a commercial on television for Mederma, so I thought I would investigate. This stuff is basically the same but is a whole lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT WORKED AS PROMISSED i THREW IT AWAY, MADE MY SKIN DRY i HAVE NOTHING RLSE TO SAY</li>
    <li> Have tried many things to &#x27;reduce&#x27; the appearance of acne scars on my shoulders and back. Tried this and decided to include it into my everyday routine. Scars take a long time to fade, but this seems to have helped mine and has improve my skin tone in problem areas. No smell, not sticky, but it is a bit expensive. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months almost finished my 1st bottle and not much difference. my acne scars still the same. lets see if continuing to use 2nd bottle help. if not I am planning to buy a different one ...Murad or ..</li>
    <li> I had foot surgery about 15 months ago. The surgery left me with a very noticable scar about 6 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide. After a year, the scar was still raised and red. I&#x27;ve been using the derma e scar gel for 2 months and I can see the difference. The scar is no longer raised and it has lightened significantly. I plan to use the product for the recommended 6 months to see if it continues to diminish the scar.</li>
    <li> I tried for 6 weeks but didn&#x27;t notice any change. Each time it took too long to massage it in and I don&#x27;t think it is easy to use for most customers.</li>
    <li> I had two lumpectomies. This worked great! my dr said it would take at least a year for the scar to heal...7 months and you would never know unless you look with a magnifying glass. Softened the skin and faded the redness!&lt;br /&gt;I bought some for my friend who had a c-section.&lt;br /&gt;smells good too. Which is important for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hysterectomy scar that goes from above my navel to my pubic line. It was dark red and always itching. A friend recommended Derma E Scar Gel. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 3 months and have noticed a remarkable difference. The scar is now pink and has not itched in weeks. I highly recommend this product to anyone trying to heal their scars.</li>
    <li> I purchased Derma E Scar Gel for mild post surgical scars around my eyes.  I have been using it for 3 weeks, 2 x a day (not 3-5 as recommended).  I like the clear gel texture, it&#x27;s odorless, absorbs well, and is not sticky.  While I am not sure if this product will do much for the scars yet (which aren&#x27;t major to begin with), it has made a SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT in the crepey skin under my eyes - a fantastic and unexpected surprise.  So, I will definitely continue using it for that problem, and hopefully with longer use (they recommend an 8 week trial) it will improve the scars.  I have tried many other far more expensive, \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; products for under-eye crepey skin improvement, and this beats them ALL, at least for that issue.  **Use caution if YOU make the choice to use it around your eyes.  From what I can see, the product description and instructions do not state specifically where on your body you should and/or should not use this gel.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, feels nice, but several jars in,  I have not seen the slightest indication this works at all... Tried it out on some old and new little scars and marks....faithfully, several times days...Not the slightest discernible difference. Nothing... but it smells nice and feels cool and nice haha..    If you follow the recommended protocol on the instructions - 3 to 5 times a day (who can do that anyways, realistically everyday) - you will run through the cans very quickly.    I gave this product 2 stars just because it feels good and absorbs good and the ingredients list has no harmful, toxic ingredients, and I like this company and lots of their other products which I feel are very good and effective. But honestly. I don&#x27; t think this does what it&#x27;s advertised for.</li>
    <li> Recently I got second-degree burns from working with sugar on the stove. The burns were on the back of my hand and next to the nail on my thumb. They got pretty bad and I wanted something that would help them heal. I ended up picking up this product from Dominick&#x27;s, and trying it out. I use it everyday 2-3 times a day (occasionally more if I remember). I started using this product about 9 days ago, and I love it. It has a faint lavender scent to it and goes on smoothly and not too sticky. I rub it into my burn area for about 1-2 minutes (rather than the 3-5 they suggest. Who has the patience for that?), and in the past 9 days the area has gone from dark brown, puffy and dehydrated, to smooth, the lightest pink and barely there. The area next to my thumb is a little more difficult as it blistered, so it has been healing a little slower. But already it just looks like a light callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: I can&#x27;t speak for old scars, but if you have new cuts, burns, etc, that you think will turn into scars, or if you have newish scars, use this for a few weeks and you will see a major improvement. And try to follow the directions. Things tend to not work as well when you don&#x27;t follow directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got some really bad, old scars and this stuff just didn&#x27;t do the trick. I&#x27;m probably not patient enough to use it as it requires multiple applications daily and months of straight usage to see results on older scars. I&#x27;ve been using it as a night moisturizer for my acne prone, sensitive, oily skin and it&#x27;s worked very well for that. I&#x27;d say if you need to get rid of old scars, stick to the scar sheets instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this first at a health food store and loved the feel.  This double pack was an excellent buy and I&#x27;m glad to have two more.  I used silicone gel and patches for a while and my scars are flat and light.  This is helping them continue to improve.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I&#x27;m with this cream,let me say I have a third degree burn when i was a little girl and you may not believe but it&#x27;s working.thank you,And if you have a scar you need to try this.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper ! Great items</li>
    <li> This really works.  I started using it once a day after staples were removed from complete hip replacement.  After four months the scar is faded and soft.  My surgeon said he has never seen a scar heal so fast.  If you have a bad scar, this is just what you need.</li>
    <li> Recent surgery left me with a 3&amp;#34; incision on my neck. The first time I used this gel it made the incision feel better and it didn&#x27;t seem to feel as tight. An added benefit is that the scar appears to be shrinking. I use this a few times a day, it is nearly invisible, and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast. It seems to be working so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my skin while using this product but I found you have to stay persistent and use it twice a day on problem areas to see the difference.  It&#x27;s made the texture of my skin a little smoother but hasn&#x27;t done much to correct dark scars.  It may lighten scars from small blemishes, but don&#x27;t expect it to work wonders for a surgical scar.</li>
    <li> No real results a little disappointed</li>
    <li> This product goes on light and fluffy and really works, it fulfilled my realistic expectations. I knew my scar would not completely blend,  but it lightened it drastically.</li>
    <li> I was curious how it will work. I have some old scars, not that much visible but getting hard. After 1 week I felt them softer. Works also well to lighten the color of just healed burns. I&#x27;m using it everyday since 3 weeks on surgery scars which are 2 months old. They are still red but I believe, I have to be more patient. Will get back with  more comments after few months.</li>
    <li> I am covered in 3rd degree burn scars, and I am talking Freddy Krueger style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do Jiu Jitsu, and most people are bigger and stronger than me, so I have gotten into lifting weights. My right arm is burned around the entire circumference of my bicep. It is tight because the burns happened when I was 14 years old, and I am 40 now. Just over time my arm has obviously grown and it is bigger now than it was back then. Add to this, that I am actively lifting weights with the intention of getting stronger and putting on some size, and you have some pretty tight &amp; stiff scar tissue issues. (Poetic, no? Tissue issues?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the doctors told me that burn scars will not stretch \\&quot;once they are totally healed and settled in\\&quot;, I figure that if mushrooms can grow through asphalt, my scars will stretch with time. They have been stetching with time too, only not as fast as I need them too. But I can see a size difference in my arm for sure, due to the weight lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty set in their ways; some parts are stiff and thick while other parts are thin and soft. However, the fact that the scars go around the entire bicep means that I feel tightness around my arm at all times, like I am wearing an MP3 player arm-band around my arm.&lt;br /&gt;It gets SUPER tight when I lift weights and get a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying different creams, coconut oil (messy), silicone based products, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Some work \\&quot;kind of\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So then, I bought this stuff last night and put it on. I could not believe the INSTANT difference I felt. I still can&#x27;t believe it actually. I put it on twice last night and once this morning. Already my scars are noticeably softer and more pliable, the thick parts are already feeling thinner, it&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note is that I personally found this stuff to be a little tiny bit sticky, but because my burns are so extensive I am slathering it on and totally covering my hand with it, so that might be why. Other people find it is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this gel is odourless and invisible too. Most other products I have experimented with leave a white film, or in the case of coconut oil, and greasy layer that gets all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s June 26th 2013 as I write this. I haven&#x27;t even been using this product for 24 hours yet.&lt;br /&gt;So far, 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to continue to use this over the summer and report back here with an update for people who are covered in serious burn scars. Stay tuned.</li>
