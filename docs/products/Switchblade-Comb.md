<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s a switchblade comb!  had one when I was a kid.  You either want it or not.  don&#x27;t be dumb and buy it because you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; mustache beard comb...  It works fine and scares the kids equally well...</li>
    <li> Pretty cool comb to have</li>
    <li> The spring snagged a little but not badly. Gave it as a gift to my then boyfriend as an inside joke, and he loved it. I believe it held up well.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my dad, he keeps it in his glove department as an emergency comb!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, who wouldn&#x27;t love it?</li>
    <li> The teeth on the comb are only about 1/3&amp;#34; deep</li>
    <li> Exactly what you expected.&lt;br /&gt;There were easy to understand instructions in the box, although anyone could&#x27;ve figured it out in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that once I got it through the mail and opened the box, the comb was really sticky for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easy, which is a good thing to get all the ladies with this.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what people expect for the price, but i think it&#x27;s super cool! The teeth and pretty close together. if you are using gel, vs a pomade, it&#x27;s going to thin it out and pull out some of the product.</li>
    <li> Will not stay open on mine. Looks nice but feels cheap</li>
    <li> what can i say I apparently have to write 19 words. This is a cheap comb but it did what was required. made my buddy laugh</li>
    <li> Yeah I mean it is what it is but, it is flimsy not flimsy enough to break right away, or anything but flimsy. What I like about this switch comb is it actually works and if it gets stopped while its coming out it doesnt hurt you at all. The only reason that I gave this 4 stars is because the lock barely works, when you flip the switch comb upside down it locks into place without any control and is pretty annoying but overall great product.</li>
    <li> My son loves this!  His buddy even asked me to order him one. :)  Boys.  He went to a water park last week and almost got it taken away though.</li>
    <li> I love this awesome novelty comb, because it was very cheap with free shipping.  I loved that it came in two days which is not what I expected. It&#x27;s worth the price. I gave this 4 stars because after many uses it doesn&#x27;t lock as good, but still it was because of my bad maintenance. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have flicked it for passing time.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s what&#x27;s to be expected for the price, it does have aa cheap feel to it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for a costume, but there are sharp edges on the metal &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; and the teeth are tiny.</li>
    <li> This was a gag gift to someone and he loved it</li>
    <li> its cheap metal but for the price it is very good and more of a mustache comb but its still good</li>
    <li> yup. love it. easy to use. bought two.</li>
    <li> Great quality for what you pay.. There is people on here saying it&#x27;s cheaply made.. I feeling like it&#x27;s the opposite it&#x27;s very nicely made for what you pay for it.. It&#x27;s like the ones you had as a kid but has a functional lock on it and some metal parts.. And the comb is great for my beard is tight bristled..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had much use for this really...</li>
    <li> I had one of these as a kid, and I bought a new one for nostalgia more than anything. Not going to lie, it&#x27;s definitely a cheap novelty comb whose main function is to get a laugh or two from your friends, but altogether, it&#x27;s cheap, although the comb function works just fine. The spring starts out super springy, but over time it will become less springy and just kind of flop open partway, so you&#x27;ll have to end up giving it a solid flick as you hit the release to get it to open all the way. Also, the slide lock is loose, and doesn&#x27;t stay in one position or another. Simply turning the whole thing upside-down will let the slide fall the other way. Regardless, pretty good for a laugh.</li>
    <li> It was only a few dollars..this shouldn&#x27;t be listed over $1. This is worse quality than something you would find at the dollar store. I was about to go through a return but it&#x27;s honestly not even worth the effort. This thing is simply a flimsy black comb attached to really low quality plastic. It&#x27;s not even toy-worthy as many are mentioning (I have no clue why either!); the yellow box is more eye popping than the actual product inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a little over $3 I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything close to high quality metal; but this garbage plastic-ey comb should not see the light of day.</li>
    <li> I like it but you can&#x27;t really comb your hair with it.</li>
    <li> Lock broke immediately, and it is okay, but what can one really expect for this price!</li>
    <li> This is a unique item to show off to yuor friends i love going to my friends and showing it off lol</li>
    <li> My son wanted this, he was thinking it was &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; (spent his allowance money), it never worked (clipped or stayed closed) right out of the box.</li>
    <li> cheap quality...broke after opening it 3 times</li>
    <li> so i leave a bar because this guy was trying to start a fight. i go outside and he follows.he starts running towards me yelling profanity&#x27;s so i pull this out and say &#x27;&#x27;ILL CUT YOU&#x27;&#x27; pointing it right at him.then he pulls out a giant machete like knife and so i open my switchblade comb,slick my hair back with it and say...&#x27;&#x27;ehhhhhhhhhh&#x27;&#x27; with a thumbs up,then i was stabbed.</li>
    <li> I am more than satisfied with this item. The reviews I&#x27;ve read said that it would work fine and those weren&#x27;t lies. I&#x27;ve used this comb for my beard and it works wonders. For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal. The only con is the cheap plastic feel of the thing. The comb itself has more quality than the rest. Still, I can&#x27;t complain. Depending on how long it lasts, I might even buy another one. Don&#x27;t look down on it for it&#x27;s price. It should encourage you to buy it even more.</li>
    <li> son loved it but it tore up the first day, I am thinking of re ordering though... maybe as a gag gift.</li>
    <li> really cheap and shityy</li>
    <li> If you think you&#x27;re cool and you don&#x27;t have a switchblade comb - you aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb has a satisfying flick open that says, &amp;#34;Look at me! I&#x27;m almost dangerous! Is it a knife? Nope! I&#x27;m SO awesome, I can intimidate with well-coiffed hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this comb is much more substantial than I was expecting and extremely inexpensive. Makes a really fun gift for men and women.</li>
    <li> Lock button doesn&#x27;t stay other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I liked it but made very cheaply I guess it&#x27;s worth what I paid.</li>
    <li> It is only ok. It was worth the 3.50 with free shipping. It was gifted with beard balm, and wasn&#x27;t a main present so it was fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVEd this item! Great as a joke or for fixing your hair! With this in your pocket, I feel safe! (its a comb!)</li>
    <li> An overall fun thing but lock broke after dropping like 2-3 times</li>
    <li> I got this super fast! Ordered late on Thursday, it shipped on Friday, I got it Saturday. I think it&#x27;s a good balance between inexpensive and quality. It looks sturdy enough to keep around for a while, but we won&#x27;t be sad when it inevitably breaks or gets lost. I bought it as a cute, fun addition to a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; gift basket for my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Gag gift and my son loves it.</li>
    <li> The product is not bad, cheap Chinese plastic so it is not very durable however, my gripe is more with the delivery portion, the package was &#x27;delivered&#x27; according to the USPS 3 days before it showed up at my door.</li>
    <li> Low qulity breaks fast</li>
    <li> its bigger than youd think! i expected 4 in long but its 5.5in long.&lt;br /&gt;thin metal which i dont expect to last long but the mech should,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think this would be good for a school play or a costume, but not for a day to day comb, especially since it may be confused for a real switchblade which is illegal!</li>
    <li> It is a great comb for it&#x27;s price. Not the most sturdy of materials, but I got it about 2 months ago and it still works perfectly. It is also neater comb than most, with it resembling a flick-knife and all. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a new comb but is tired of the mundane, regular comb. I would also check out the butterfly comb. They may be priced more, and harder to use, but they are a fun way to comb you&#x27;re hair. Also, don&#x27;t buy the other flick-combs, they are awful. my sister bought another brand and it didn&#x27;t close, and she dropped it later on hardwood, and it split in half. I&#x27;m not saying all other flick-combs are terrible, but this one seems the best for the money.</li>
    <li> ah had one when ah was in school... and this is just like it it takes me back... ah use it fur mah mustache and it warks stoat!!!</li>
    <li> Its made of cheap materials but i guess you get what you pay for. The locked doesn&#x27;t really work to well.</li>
    <li> I know that this is inexpensive but it&#x27;s really only good for a gag... my hair isn&#x27;t even thick and it felt like the comb was gonna break off.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a beard comb and he loves it! Works perfectly and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I may buy another just in case he loses this one!</li>
    <li> Quality is more of a novelty than something that can be used regularly. For the price though totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This feels more like a toy to me than an actual safety tool. I like it.</li>
    <li> Just like when I was a kid!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  The safety that supposed to prevent it from opening on one&#x27;s pocket isn&#x27;t very functional. A toy at best.</li>
    <li> Great idea, fun for my son, but the comb is a little crooked and doesn&#x27;t go in as easy as it should.  Fun gift for a few dollars.</li>
    <li> Inexpensively made and comb splines aren&#x27;t very deep. Other than that, it&#x27;s hard to beat the price, perfect gag/gift/stache-comb, and with a little oil it opens perfect every time!</li>
    <li> Came in with a giant package, which first concerned me. When my friend opened it, it was perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it broke on the third week, since the blade is sticking out a little.</li>
    <li> pretty cool, works good. gave it to my husband he likes it and uses it all the time. no complains</li>
    <li> poor quality gadget.  flimsy.</li>
    <li> I was Very pleased with item. Not to mention my son was happy to get it. Not cheaply made.  And it was shipped on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> cheaply made crap Do Not Buy! Mine broke after one day of use and now i have to use scotch tape to keep it closed when i got it i was extremely dissapointed due to the fact it looks and feels like a toy and its made out of &amp;#34;Tin metal&amp;#34; weak stuff that is used to make tin cans, I will not buy any more products until the quality improves</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this gift. I made him some beard oil and got him this comb as a joke to go with it but it works amazingly well for his super long beard. The switch action is really fast and smooth for a 3 dollar comb.</li>
    <li> it bends backwards through thick hair- i wish it wasnt so flimsy...it combs decently though...the &amp;#34;safty lock&amp;#34; thing isnt stable either..too cheaply made</li>
    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s made out of metal, if you call &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34; a metal. Very cheap, but so is the price, so I guess you get what you pay for it. The locking button on mine falls down easily. I guess it would be cool for an elementary class &amp;#34;1950s&amp;#34; day or something, ya know, if you dispised your kids or something...I&#x27;ll probably just throw it away in the end...whateva.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 8 year old son and he was delighted with it. Yes it is cheaply made, but what would one expect for 2 bucks?! Being a young boy he&#x27;s tough on things but it is still in one piece and functional. He is happy with it and so am I.</li>
    <li> Cheap and just awesome</li>
    <li> im in love with this switchblade comb, it looks so damn real, very happy</li>
    <li> hilarious and useful! My hubby loves this and carries it with him!</li>
    <li> Haha its a cheep comb but still I have fun freaking people out</li>
    <li> I expected for the price this to be not a very high quality item, but I was surprised just how cheap it was.  Push the button and it opens about half the way and binds up.  Got it as a gag gift and I&#x27;m glad that&#x27;s all it was for.  Was almost so disappointed I debated not giving it even as a joke and just throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Meh. Kind of chintzy. I don&#x27;t know what I expected for that price though.</li>
    <li> My son has been asking for a knife and I got this for him.  Now he has the look of a knife while looking good for his mother!&lt;br /&gt;Great for young kids that want to play it cool....</li>
    <li> Item was delivered MUCH sooner than promised -- incredibly fast service! Great! Have nothing but high praise for this vendor and highly recommend them to anyone. Product is extremely high quality in addition to being delivered rapidly; if I could give them 10 stars and animated fireworks, I would! Reviewers who claim the product is \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; or \\&quot;cheaply made\\&quot; obviously are incapable of being satisfied. The comb is quite well constructed and if used as intended (not as a switchblade knife or some other tool) should give years of service. At any rate, for under $3, this gives you a product for the cost of many ordinary combs with a dash of panache added, so I am not complaining! I went back and bought a couple more as early-purchase Christmas presents for co-workers who are Rockabilly/Psychobilly fans and/or bikers, and I know they will get a hoot out of them! The only caveat I have about the comb is that it does have a shallow working area -- about a half-inch. This is not an issue for me, and in fact it works well for me because it gives me extra service as a moustache and sideburn comb, but if you have long hair, thick hair, or ethnic hair, the shallow tines could prove problematic. If your hair is average length to short, fine, etc., then it is not a problem. I find I get better control from the shallower depth than I do from standard-issue combs.</li>
    <li> It is okay...no not at all! it rusted the third time I used it! I have no idea why and if is Crappy!</li>
    <li> Little flimsy but it&#x27;s cheap. Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this comb for a few days only but I&#x27;ve already fallen in love with it! It feels great when you comb your hair and it looks awesome! I use this comb everyday and it has a GREAT price and it&#x27;s portable which is so awesome! If you ever buy any comb get this one! And you can easily lock and unlock it! This comb is so cool for scaring your friends too! Overall best comb that has ever been invented and it will always be that way!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 10-year old&#x27;s Halloween costume as a &#x27;Greaser&#x27;. He Loved it! Still using it. Decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I was excited for this comb. I opened up the package to see the comb out of the box. I took out the comb and realized it&#x27;s entirely made out of very cheap plastic. It made a rattling sound and the lock mechanism barely works. Please do not buy this. It looks so great in the pictures but I assure you it is not.</li>
    <li> This product is not that great,  it is made of plastic and tinfoil. It does not have very good quality.</li>
    <li> just want to say that this is an awesome comb its heavier then i expected it to be. I kind of thought that it would be cheap but it actually ended up being really nice will buy from this seller again also it was very quick shipping!!!!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Higher quality than expected for $2.  It is still holding together and has not broken yet. It is an interesting product</li>
    <li> purchased as a gag gift for my adult friend who has a epic south western style mustache &amp; he loves this &amp; no longer has to comb &amp; shape with fingers! Great gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby to comb his man-fuzzy-face out. He loves the goofy aspect of it, and I like that he keeps it looking clean! And you really can&#x27;t beat a 2$ comb with free shipping. Sadly, it is pretty flimsy, so if you like it as a joke go for it, but as for anything serious it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
    <li> Love the switchblade comb and glad I did get this comb and highly recommend this comb to anyone who is thinking about buying this comb. 100% please</li>
    <li> Not a very good comb either</li>
    <li> cheap product - but my son thinks its awesome</li>
    <li> Such a funny gift! It is what I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade doesn&#x27;t come out super smoothly, you kind of have to throw it.&lt;br /&gt;Still achieves the hilarious effect.</li>
    <li> This comb is great for a joke as it looks like a switchblade knife. It also works well on hair. Still holding together after use and my kid gives the switchblade feature a workout.</li>
    <li> I suppose I should&#x27;ve expected less. It is very very low quality. Pretty much a children&#x27;s toy</li>
    <li> Great for personal protection</li>
    <li> Nice product made from cheaper materials but okay all around.&lt;br /&gt;It was nice and worked but it broke fast and didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> After about a week of random use, the hinge broke and I could no longer use it. Unfortunate because it was fun while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Got this for fun and i actually get a lot of use out of it.  Works fine and fun to use</li>
    <li> Fun to use, happy with my purchase. Came on time and have been using it non-stop. Overall nifty thing to have.</li>
    <li> this was one of the best things i have ever bought for my 14 year old son...he loves it so much!</li>
    <li> Saw it and had to get it for the nostalgic humor.  It&#x27;s great and works perfectly.  Not a great comb but what do you expect?</li>
    <li> Nice novelty, will work as a comb, just feels lighter then expected very thin metal used</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this product and its funny and functions. It comes exactly how you see in the picture although the safety is easily moved up or down just by leaning it one way or the other. The comb does stay in place as you comb.</li>
    <li> pretty nice. I brung it to my highschool and screwed around alot with it i would go up and be like &amp;#34;Youre not going annywhere *pulls out switchblade*&amp;#34; and they would be like :o and then i&#x27;d be like &amp;#34; *presses button* nowhere...without.....me. *dramatic combing of hair*&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It was already broken the moment I got it.  It wouldn&#x27;t open, and it kept getting stuck.  Which sucks because I already know that it&#x27;s a great product, since I bought the exact same one from the Spy Museum in Washington D.C.</li>
    <li> It worked for the first few times but then it started sticking.  And I also found out that it wasn&#x27;t metal it is plastic</li>
    <li> My son used these for party favors and all of his friends thought that they were really cool.  The quality is not bad for the price, and they were cheap enough to use as party favors.</li>
    <li> Its very cool as a little novelty item to keep on your shelf, but it quickly broke and I was kinda sad about that. But It was okay for a few bucks.</li>
    <li> he loved it looks cool all his friends want one got yyou new customers a whole school kids loved it like the 50&amp;#34;s they like it</li>
    <li> Reminds me of Grease.  SO cool and bada**.  Not as well made as i thought it would be but it does what it was made for</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it!!</li>
    <li> Sweet comb! I gots a sweet beard and when I bust out this bad boy to groom with chicks just stop and stare! Good comb, better price, if u don&#x27;t like it your probably lame anyways!</li>
    <li> So fun! My son loves this knife comb. Very cool. Flips out like a slingblade. Only complaint could be that the bristles are very small, so you need fine hair, which works for us. If you have coarse or curly hair I&#x27;d suggest going with a different one.</li>
    <li> fantastic just lost it and am buying another.</li>
    <li> Great gift from the past!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but then decided not to take it with my carry on for the trip to save me some trouble. It is very convenient and doesn&#x27;t feel so cheap or fragile. The lock thingy is cheaply made though it doesn&#x27;t stay at one place just slides up and down, thats the only negative. Good tool if you&#x27;re all about that life- thug life-</li>
    <li> its very cheap aluminum made in china. I would strongly urge to avoid this product and find something built better.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing a cheap product, but it was on  a Christmas wish list....  Very surprised how long it has lasted and how entertaining this is.  I am sure not all are made exact, but for us... it is good to go.</li>
    <li> My son thinks this is the greatest thing since slice bread. He takes it everywhere with him and carries it in his back pocket. still works great.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool sold to to my friend for twice the price dope stuff kinda cheap quality but it works alright</li>
    <li> I got it for my babershop, just to see if my clients like and the love it, people really like this comb!</li>
    <li> Christmas present and he loved it.</li>
    <li> It broke in two days.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. It has a very cheap spring.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who&#x27;s a barber and he loves it. Kinda flimsy material but good for the price</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he loved it!</li>
    <li> Great! The comb itself is great and the person who I gave it too loved it, pretty durable</li>
    <li> I got one for my little brother recently, and not only did it ship early, but it&#x27;s also in one piece! Yup, my little brother breaks nearly everything, and I&#x27;m quite surprised that this item is still intact. It has a hollow body made of steel, and plastic for the black grip. Once you press the button, it has a nice quick release. It even has a safety button but it&#x27;s quite flimsy and doesn&#x27;t always work. The comb part is plastic and it&#x27;s somewhat loose but that&#x27;s alright. We had some great times messing around with people with this product, it&#x27;s a great gag item.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a stocking stuffer for the bearded man in my life. It was a hit. It was small, inexpensive and fun. It is a little on the cheap side; plastic and the comb&#x27;s teeth are short, but for the $ you can&#x27;t beat it. Also, arrived super quick! Already recommended it to a friend.</li>
    <li> My nephew loved it and combed his hair all day.  I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to any child as there are no dangerous parts.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t all that great the bristles are close to each other . Work great as far as the internal mech .</li>
    <li> I just got it today it worked just fine but I tried to put down the lock but it was stuck :( , but luckily it worked! lol</li>
    <li> My son bought this product while we were visiting Washington DC over the summer.  It was a fun item he found at the International Spy Museum and it encouraged him to comb his hair.  Unfortunately TSA does not allow weapon replicas and it had to be forfeited at the gate.  So a replacement was necessary, the composition was not as good as the item from the museum, even though it appeared to be the same manufacturer, and this one was not as linear as his original.  All in all, a very affordable souvenir that continues to bring a smile to a child&#x27;s face, and get him to comb his hair.</li>
    <li> After the first day I had it, I thought this thing was so cool. The second day, it stopped closing and was becoming annoying. I can only use it for a comb now, which isn&#x27;t even that good because it is very small so it doesn&#x27;t even comb my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Very low quality, wouldn&#x27;t work as an actual comb (at least for my thick hair).</li>
    <li> Good but locking mechanism is crap</li>
    <li> Made out of very cheap materials. The spring stopped working within 4 days of use. The comb fell off.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift! He like it, thought it was pretty cool for his mustache! Not extremely sturdy but is a fun gift to give.</li>
    <li> Gave to husband as a stocking stuffier, he whips it out at work for fun. Not high end but does what its intended for, don&#x27;t see it lasting long though.</li>
    <li> Cheap to buy but works well. Spring is tight and responsive. Exactly as expected. Just don&#x27;t bring through airport security. (The fate of its predecessor...)</li>
    <li> I liked this comb, it&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Bad quality, in two weeks it did not even close</li>
    <li> These were a hit at Xmas!! Included them in a care package of custom made apothecary items, they just about stole the show!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun gift idea, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll break sooner than later. Also the locking mechanism sticks pretty bad, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not for every model.</li>
    <li> The comb is a cool novelty not a very good beard comb, still its a cool item. Plastic and was broke within 2 days of using.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a higher quality comb, but remembered the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, and that couldn&#x27;t be more true here. It&#x27;s cute, but very delicate.</li>
    <li> I gave this comb two stars for various reasons. 1) The teeth are too close together. Perhaps its just my particular type of hair, but I couldn&#x27;t get the look I wanted. I know for a fact its not the product I use because I Suavecito pomade and this stuff is great! 2) It looks very cheap. Mostly made of plastic and you can hear parts wiggle around. 3) I found the same type of combs for a dollar at a local 99 cents store. Overall its a good comb if your going to use it as part of a 50&#x27;s costume, however for daily use? Well didn&#x27;t work for me. Overpriced in my opinion but hey, money comes and goes right?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was going to work all that great but boy was i wrong. This is a very cool switchblade comb, it springs up with force and combs nicely.</li>
    <li> Not the best- often, my hair will get snagged in it, causing pain. Otherwise it seems somewhat sturdily built, and nice looking. Lock is not functioning as well.</li>
    <li> This thing is completely stupid and pointless and yet I can&#x27;t help but love it. I giggle like a six year old every time I flick it open. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This comb/knife looks pretty cool in the picture, and it would probably last a while, but my friend&#x27;s broke very quickly due to the body of the knife being, as far as I could see, cheap plastic. It&#x27;s a nice souvenir but not built to withstand any wear or tear. The mechanism that makes it spring out is also pretty flimsy.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was just a kid. I modified mine to be something a kid shouldn&#x27;t have so my dad took it away. LOL! (good job, Dad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t seen these combs again anywhere in the last 30 years! Finally found them here on Amazon. Ah, the nostalgia! What fun. No adult has any business pulling one of these out in public to comb his hair (you&#x27;ll look ridiculous!) but at home, it&#x27;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, ok...so this wasn&#x27;t really a product review per se, but there are already plenty of those on here. I just wanted to mention that these combs are a fun novelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to get one of these past TSA without some drama.</li>
    <li> great for Halloween but this is a product that was not made to last.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> reminds me of my youth...at a good price!</li>
    <li> This is cute and a great add on gift for any occasion</li>
    <li> First off, it is made of plastic. The whole handle is plastic. The only metal is the piece that holds the actual comb. There is a little lock switch that often locks itself. I can see the purpose for this, but I found it annoying. Mine finally managed to break, so now it&#x27;s stuck in the unlocked position. It worked out well for me, but I&#x27;m still counting that as a flaw. The price is decent for the product, but some expect it to last as long as Suavecito&#x27;s unbreakable comb.</li>
    <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my ten year old son.  He loved it and I loved the price and quality of it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my 12 year old nephew.&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the gifts he got (and that was a LOT)&lt;br /&gt;He said this was his fave.</li>
    <li> I bought it to make a joke on one of my friend and it worked perfectly for the price.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s cheaply made from cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> it is a cool thing to own. some of my friends actually believed that it was a real switchblade and the comb works pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend and he loved it!  Very cute and well made!  The price could not be beat!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but I remember buying these once a year at Playland in Rye NY. For anyone that gave this a 1 to 2 star complaining about quality clearly is expecting too much. It&#x27;s a $4 item that is built to have fun with, not for long term use. Perfect example when I was young (and this was a long time ago) I used to go to Playland at least once a year and every time I went I bought a new one for the one previous to it eventually broke but considering how cheap it is $$$, who cares? if you want a better quality one, build it!</li>
    <li> Product was defective. The switchblade action did not work. Very cheap construction. Not worth using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the brand of switchblade comb that I got with my Grave Before Shave beard oil (which I love BTW).  This comb sucks.  It is cheaply constructed but far worse is the fact that my beard hairs get caught by the edges of the comb frequently, and that HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually on line to buy a new beard comb and it reminded me I really should write a review of this one as a warning to my fellow beard wearers.</li>
    <li> Nephew loved this.  It brought back memories of our childhood as well.</li>
    <li> Cool comb! I don&#x27;t have a hair on my head but I got plenty in my lip and this comb makes the perfect mustache comb. And so fun to use I can&#x27;t stop playing with it. It&#x27;s a lot better made then I thought it would be.  I have a real switch blade and I swear if you lay them side by side on a table you can&#x27;t  tell them apart.  Even the action when opening and closing the blade works and sounds the same.  Although not the same quality as the real switch blade. Has the same style safety as the real one but it is very loose and does not work well but who cares, it&#x27;s a comb.  The metal parts are stainless but a little tinny and the black part of the handle is a light weight plastic.  But still a great novelty comb that works and looks like the real thing.  And for under $5 you can&#x27;t go wrong. If it does eventually break after all my constant opening and closing, I will definitely get another one.</li>
    <li> very happy with my order and how it was shipped</li>
    <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t the sturdiest item I&#x27;ve ever gotten from China, but what do you expect? It works fine, springs out nicely, but it does feel like it could break at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it to comb my beard, and it did an adequate job, but the comb is thin to accommodate the form factor.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend after he misplaced his mustache comb. The locking mechanism is a little loose, but other than that is works perfectly. It&#x27;s very fun to use and gets compliments every time someone sees it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a cool switchblade comb. reminds me of when i was a kid, but i bought it for my beard, but it hurts my beard hairs, haha.&lt;br /&gt;but that&#x27;s my fault, it&#x27;s a cool comb, gave it to my little brother.</li>
    <li> Good comb qnd works pretty good</li>
    <li> This seller is truly the best on Amazon!  Fast shipping!  Great products &amp; prices !  I&#x27;m happy,  my clients are happy; I&#x27;ll do busness with them for many years to come,  highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good quality, arrived on time</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with both this product and the packaging that it came in. The little yellow box that it came in completely fell apart during shipment and thats how i received it. Also, it says in big letters &amp;#34;Ages 5 and up&amp;#34; right on the front. They should really make that font much smaller it sticks out more than the title and i was intending on giving this to my boyfriend as a birthday gift. Not only that but the small button on the blade was loose i dont know if its broken or if its just really cheaply made. This product is useless i&#x27;m going to need to find a better quality comb somewhere else. I definitely do NOT recommend this product. Never buying this again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a switchblade and it&#x27;s a comb!  Just like the one I got at a carnival 25 years ago.</li>
    <li> Cheap, I gave them too my grandkids as toys</li>
    <li> For about two dollars this product is a great purchase. I will admit when I first ordered this I expected it to be pretty cheap, but honestly it&#x27;s pretty well made for the price. The metal part going up the comb is kind of coming off, but nothing a little push back into place won&#x27;t solve. Good buy.</li>
    <li> When I saw these I had to order several of them. I had one when I was a kid and thought it was the coolest thing. I ordered one for each of my kids and a couple others for family. I even ordered one for myself just because why not. They are exactly like I remember them. Fun stuff.</li>
    <li> great and even more great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pretty cool comb.. fooled a couple people. very light comb.  using it for a month and still working perfect</li>
    <li> The packaging is great but the product is trash don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great buying some more later on</li>
    <li> More of a novelty item than a real use practical comb. However, i suppose it does get the job done. Kinda feels like a plastic toy. A little buyer&#x27;s remorse here.</li>
    <li> It is plastic, but I didn&#x27;t expect any more from the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great gag gift for my fiance for his beard. He loves it.</li>
    <li> its everything it says</li>
    <li> This is a fun novelty item, looks like a stereotypical switchblade knife, but it&#x27;s a comb! It looks and feels really shoddy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. It opens very quick and the comb works. However I do have some issues with the lock. The lock should just be taken out or made better. It gets in your way. Also, the materials used to make this thing aren&#x27;t all that great, but for 3-4 dollars? Great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this just for fun came really quick and it looks like a switch blade it&#x27;s awesome comb itself seems heavy duty.</li>
    <li> WORKS BUT REALLY JUST A SEMI-FANCY MUSTASH COMB</li>
    <li> Broke within the first day I got it. Definitely not something you can comb your hair with either...</li>
    <li> we really enjoy these idem,,the children just love them  ,,i would get more for mmy other grandkids but you only had 2 left,,thanks again</li>
    <li> Kids comb, he liked it</li>
    <li> Its really good for the price. It moves when im combing my hair and also one of the edges gets caught on my ear while combing.</li>
    <li> Just like a remember feels little more durable then when I was a young tike</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t been used yet (it&#x27;s a Christmas gift), but it looks great! A great gift for dad or spouse!</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Very Flimsy. Will break within a week or two.</li>
    <li> Its cheap  but it makes a fun little gift for people</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made and most likely wont last long spec if it gets played with a lot but it&#x27;s still decent and $3 is a good price for it.</li>
    <li> Does not feel cheaply made and feels like it will last a long time. Though, on the box it says for Ages 12 and up, and on the bottom Ages 5 and up. Strange.</li>
    <li> What more could I say? It works, it make kids happy, and I&#x27;m glad to have bought it... and at a fair price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this and it was awesome when I opened it. After two days it BROKE. It is made out of cheap plastic and you can barely comb your hair.</li>
    <li> it came on time and wasnt damaged from shipping. i recommend this to anyone looking for a cool gift for a low price :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, I&#x27;d give it a higher score but considering i found some that are sturdier and don&#x27;t have a lock that slips constantly, I&#x27;d say this was pretty bad. The locking mechanism on it slips way too easy into lock mode. There are better products out there, we used them to make prop switchblades for a movie we were making. Thankful we found the sturdier ones as they held up way better than these would have.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband for valentines to go with his bay rum pack.. he doesn&#x27;t use it to often. but its a pretty neat little happy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t take it to school!</li>
    <li> Cheap and not even worth my time. It doesn&#x27;t stay closed without having to finagle it and the same for opening. Will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> for the price its a good deal its just a little cheaply made but like i said for the price you cant ask for more :)</li>
    <li> I wish the teeth on the comb were longer but its still a good idea! My guy will still like it. Ships extremely fast!!! I think the withdrawal from my bank account is still pending haha</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. They are fun little gifts but they are cheaply made. The comb is very shallow.</li>
    <li> Great item. I wanted a mustache comb that was not easy to lose and this one fit the bill. Not only does it work perfectly, it looks good too. I put it on my keychain and now it&#x27;s hard to lose either one. People get a kick out of it and if walking across a parking lot with this in your hands, No one will try to mess with you. LOL. I am going to give them as gifts this holiday season.</li>
    <li> Cool little toy comb... That being said don&#x27;t be too hard on it. It has a fragile feel to it. I use it for my beard not my head.</li>
    <li> Pretty poorly made, only made to use as a gag gift, not for actual grooming.</li>
    <li> Got this for my younger brother (he&#x27;s 10) when I ordered it I was expecting something sturdy and well built. This was a piece of crap that you could by at a dollar store. Broke within 10 uses, my brother has lost faith in me now. He just acts like I betrayed him, whenever I&#x27;m around he just moaps around quietly. I want my money back!&amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> Amazing little toy comb&lt;br /&gt;Still a good comb&lt;br /&gt;One of my new toys and additions to my weapon comb family</li>
    <li> a fun little accessory. I bought 3 for this price figuring if they sucked i am not out much and gag gifts. after seeing it a lot of my friends now want one. works well as a comb, cheap but functional stamped stainless steel but for a few bucks what can you expect</li>
    <li> It was great for the first two months but inevitably it broke its nothing but a novelty toy not for regular use</li>
    <li> Construction is somewhat iffy, but is what I expected for the price. This thing looks like the exact same switch-comb I had in the late 1970s!! Based on the out-of-control political correctness in schools, I don&#x27;t recommend any kids carrying them to school.</li>
    <li> I got 5 of these for a friend/neighbor who&#x27;s the music director for DePaul&#x27;s Opera Theater.  They&#x27;ll be used as the basis for prop switchblades in their student production of \\&quot;Threepenny Opera\\&quot; the weekend of May 17-19, 2013 in Chicago.  The show features the song \\&quot;Mack The Knife\\&quot; as it was years before it was popularized by Bobby Darin.    Come on out and see the show, and know that Amazon helped make it possible.    [...]</li>
    <li> super hysterical, my mustachioed husband loved this</li>
    <li> It was good in the beginning but the spring got loose in about a month of playing with it and now it&#x27;s permanently open and doesn&#x27;t close at all. It still functions great as a comb but I can&#x27;t whip it open anymore.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. It&#x27;s a toy.</li>
    <li> this is a great item but was so noticeable that its a cheap item.plastic and tin. but i gaot it for a gag and item was a hoot. So ite was well worth getting plus its a reminder of what a good night.</li>
    <li> This item was not at all what we expected.  Just a novelty item.  If you are into that kind of thing then fine.</li>
    <li> Its a cool little stylish comb! I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift. awesome present and great price. fast shipping too. THANKS (:</li>
    <li> Really cool! Flips out really fast, and just the shell is intimidating, becare full were you take this because the outside is really realistic and it can easily be mistaken for a real knife if it&#x27;s folded</li>
    <li> When I received the product the cardboard package was ripped and smashed against the comb. After opening the comb it seemed to deploy fast and normal. But, after about 10 uses, the comb stopped flipping completely open. The comb stops about halfway when the spring does not extend anymore and no longer works. The quality of the comb will probably vary. Purchase with caution.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! I am keeping it for sure. Completely satisfied with the product. Would order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Cute but not functional. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. It&#x27;s cheaply made and if you have any hair at all there&#x27;s no way you could comb it with this tiny comb</li>
    <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected and was exactly as described. It&#x27;s plastic, but for the price, it&#x27;s a fun gadget comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool switchblade comb! What more can you ask for? It did come a bit late though but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> I bought this just for the novelty and was expecting something chinsy and poorly put together. I must say I was rather suprised at how heavy duty this was for the price. The spring action is excellent and there&#x27;s actually real metal on much of the gadget. If you&#x27;re looking for something like this, for the price you&#x27;re not going to beat it. No cheap plastic at all, this feels and looks like it should be priced much higher than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product was shipped to me very quickly, very good job by the seller.</li>
    <li> it broke after 2 days</li>
    <li> The chain broke easily the shipping was slow and the mocking jay looked really cheap the paint fell of after a week the only thing that was good was the bird didn&#x27;t break</li>
    <li> May have to oil for it to slide with ease. Pretty good overall.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like it. If you&#x27;re getting it mostly for the novelty value, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is... confusing. The important parts are made of metal, and the overall build quality is quite solid.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a plate of metal on either side of where the comb folds in, and another folded around the plastic part of the comb to hold it in place. That part is quite solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, the parts of the handle that you hold and the mechanism that launches the comb out both seem to be made mostly of cheap-feeling plastic. That includes the button to flip the comb out, and the lock that keeps it from flipping out in your pocket. The mechanism worries me the most - it always feels like it&#x27;s about to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it feels like you could comb with it for hours without anything bending or breaking... but I&#x27;m always kind of nervous each time I close it, because it feels like it might not open next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual comb... the teeth are really sharp!&lt;br /&gt;It feels like you&#x27;re gently scratching whatever you&#x27;re combing with it. Good if you have an itchy scalp or itchy beard, but not too welcome otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are also very close together, meaning you need fewer strokes to get your hair to behave. Pretty convenient if your hair is practically made of copper wire like mine is. Not very convenient if your hair is easily tangled like mine is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a fun novelty and a mediocre comb, and it&#x27;s built to actually be used. For the price, not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Its made out of plastic. Which i shouldve guessed. however it does what it is supposed to do. I do not think the material is built to last and it does not stay open when it is being used.. its sometimes closes on you as your comb through your hair. it is an attn grabber at first though.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy, but it&#x27;s meant as a gag gift for my boyfriend and I think he&#x27;ll get a kick out of it.</li>
    <li> This is one of those novelty items I had as a kid and always thought I was cool because of it (I wasn&#x27;t, but ignorance was bliss.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled into this by complete accident. I collect handmade cutlery including traditional stilettos and Amazon suggested this as an item. Well, it was like 3 bucks so I figured why not and bought two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I am happy with the product. This is not a super high-quality item, but it&#x27;s a novelty more than a functional tool. It opens. It closes. (It does not lock open.) And it looks the same way the picture described (black and stainless.) Even rabbits love them!</li>
    <li> husband loves it, then it broke. also hard to clean. feels cheap, buy as a gag gift only</li>
    <li> Overall i thought this would be a cheap product, because of the price, and i was right, it is only good for really thin, short hair, and the comb brakes fairly easily</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Its okay but the lock on one of the combs I bought was broken other than that it was what I expected.</li>
    <li> I used for about a week before the plastic teeth wore down and became uneven. It&#x27;s nice to play with, but would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected and i LOVE it. Not cheaply made and very worth the price.definetly a satisfied customer!! My advice? BUY ITTTT</li>
    <li> He is Ex Cuban military so I needed something that he was used to seeing that had a little joking twist. And this was PERFECT. He was expecting a knife to come out but when it turned out to be a comb he burst out laughing and said this was going to be his &amp;#34;Mustache Comb&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is cheap and made out of plastic. It broke the same day that I got it. It is junk!</li>
    <li> When I first got it, not only was my hair combed but I my self had a good time playing with it .</li>
    <li> for being so cheep this is a great gift and great for pranks and what not. and it works as a good comb if you need one that is also fun...</li>
    <li> I liked the whole concept of the product so I bought it. Unfortunately, the lock and general construction of the device is starting to become a little loose, and I have had it snap open on me , even when it was supposed to be locked. Overall, Great product.</li>
    <li> good novelty product.</li>
    <li> This comes in handy every time. Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Cheap piece of plastic. But still looks pretty cool to have. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly great.  I bought three, one for me and two for my boys (8 and 6).  Owned for 6 months now, has not broken or lost their springyness that makes it pop open.  They hold up pretty good and actually work as good as the unbreakable black comb that I also use.</li>
    <li> Quality is what you would expect for such a cheap price, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Item broke on first use. Made with cheap materials.</li>
    <li> bought these as gag gifts for stocking stuffers at christmas. good quality for a gag gift and made everyone laugh.</li>
    <li> Watch out I&#x27;ll cut you! Naw I&#x27;m just combing my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good overall the comb is sturdy and it functions properly the only thing is that the lock sometimes won&#x27;t work but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 7 yr old son, and he loves it. He is getting into knives, so this is a much safer alternative. Fast delivery and great item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap feeling but it is worth what you pay for it and ejects fine</li>
    <li> It was really cool, till it snapped in my hair. I got two, and only one didn&#x27;t snap. I got these for me and my friend. Way too plasticy.</li>
    <li> I remember these as a kid and when I saw this on Amazon I just had to get one for sentimental reasons. it really is functional! Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Service.</li>
    <li> Buy it if you like novelty. spring loading switch wears down after awhile.</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; good product</li>
    <li> Really fun at first but it stopped closing after a couple days of use. This was expected seeing as it is such a cheap product but still disappointing.</li>
    <li> It sucks. It broke within the first 2 days I had it and the don&#x27;t bother to use it as a comb because it&#x27;s tiny.</li>
    <li> Gift for Dad for Valentine&#x27;s Day - a real conversation piece - and fun - looks pretty cool - the lock that locks the switch from opening is pretty loose and there really is no adjusting it - but at this price you can live with that - otherwise would have given a 5 star..  My Dad has real fine hair and these blades are perfect for that - the teeth are small and real close - he keeps his hair military style - real short - not sure if it would be great for someone with super thick hair...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my husband, and it lived up to all the fun reminiscence I&#x27;d hoped.  He says it&#x27;s the best switchblade comb he ever had, haha.</li>
    <li> I would give it more but it took a little to long for me.</li>
    <li> It is an ok product and it worked fine untill it broke,it looks cool but it suck as a brush</li>
    <li> We gave these switchblade combs to cub scouts and they all seem to enjoy them. (Anything that looks like a knife boys enjoy.) The nice thing is They are just a comb - no one gets hurt :)</li>
    <li> This was a christmas present for a friend and i was able to play with it before giving it away and i really liked it. its a fun gimmick but you do have to be a little careful so it doesnt break. but its a fun toy for sure, just becareful where you take it out.</li>
    <li> this is a great toy for kids who want to look cool in front of their friends. They in turn will want one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a freshman in college and bought this as a gift for one of my friends with crazy puffy hair and he loves it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I bought this comb as a Christmas stocking stuffer and my boyfriend loved it along with all his friends.</li>
    <li> cool but cheaply made</li>
    <li> Just received my SwitchBlade comb and I&#x27;m happy to say this was worth the money and wait. Very well built, shipping was fast.Worth everything(:</li>
    <li> Fun novelty item. My boyfriend loves his hair done with an undercut and uses old fashioned pomade to style his hair. As a joke I got him this comb to really finalize the whole &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; he is going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb works well when his hair is dry or wet, but since his hair is thick once he puts the pomade in it he can&#x27;t really get the comb through his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still made him chuckle which made the purchase 100% worth it! Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> very poorly made, broke the first day we had it</li>
    <li> Piece of junk, to &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It came just as advertised, in the little box. To operate, there&#x27;s a little sliding button that acts as a safety. When it&#x27;s down, the button to release the comb can be pressed. When it&#x27;s up, the comb can not be released. The safety lever is a bit loose, but overall a fantastic product that has brought me laughs now and for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I Was Going To Have Fun with This Little Item. But I Found Out It Came Broke With No Way To Fix It.&lt;br /&gt;I Tried To Return It. But They Woulnd Accept It...</li>
    <li> Great accessory for a greaser costume. Its a little cheap but for the price you cant beat it. It didnt break so Ill give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use as a beard comb along with beard oil. The joint where the plastic comb meets the metal arm constantly catches the hairs of my beard and yanks them out. It&#x27;s incredibly painful and makes the comb basically not possible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lock switch doesn&#x27;t actually work. It engages the lock, but it doesn&#x27;t remain in place - just holding the comb straight up causes the lock to disengage just from gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap novelty, and not much else. Basically exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> cheapo..... should have remembered that you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> very flimsy plastic an I think it was a  waste of money and its worth spending more for better quality.</li>
    <li> Flimsy can&#x27;t even comb my hair</li>
    <li> Works well for something so cheap. Impresses my friends too.</li>
    <li> quick and easy to use just don&#x27;t bring it to a gun fight :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend. He loves it. The switch button sticks a little but once you get the hang of it, you should be fine:)</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for someone and they loved it</li>
    <li> Broke the second day I had it. Not even worth  a dollar</li>
    <li> nice novelty item for touch ups in the car</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD. AMAZING. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The lock button is a little shakey but well built would recommend it</li>
    <li> It broke after two days. It won&#x27;t stay closed now.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap but worth the price</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and broke easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good just I lost it 😂</li>
    <li> Bought this as a joke but its actually come in handy once or twice.</li>
    <li> spring broke after 1 week.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a neat little prop and it looks exactly as pictured!  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty sturdy as well, I can&#x27;t imagine it breaking unless someone were specifically trying to break it. From far away(and occasionally close up!), I have had a few people believe I was pulling an actual knife before I released the comb so I guess that&#x27;s both points for awesomeness AND something to be wary of, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While holding it, it is obviously plastic though, which is too bad, but it&#x27;s a tiny nitpick. Also wouldn&#x27;t use it as a functional comb, but I think it&#x27;s WELL established this is more for looks/costumes. If you really wanna use it, glory to you, but my hair is way too thick and curly.</li>
    <li> Always a good sticking stuffer for the boys</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he wanted one really bad. I wasnt expecting much for such a cheap price but it works. Hes been using it for a few months now and it still works, he uses it to brush his hair all the time. Im happy with my purchase.</li>
