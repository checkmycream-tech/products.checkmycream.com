      <li>Rose scented perfumes, soaps, and lotions are my thing</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my daughter, who loves rose scent.  </li>
      <li>Rose smell is not that rosey.</li>
      <li>, however, it&#x27;s really nice to use as a face and body wash.  </li>
      <li>The rose flavoring need to be stronger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a repeat customer for the rose fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I now use the rose &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; to  make my cleaning products.</li>
      <li>However this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve tried the Rose</li>
      <li>This rose does not smell like rose, smells like a</li>
      <li>That being said, it is still a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>So, I purchased the Rose scent.</li>
      <li>I use the Rose</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I lovvvvvvveee this!!! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This hemp rose soap from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is amazing! It has none of the harmful ingredients found in many commercial soaps, like sodium laryl sulfate, etc. It&#x27;s pure and smells absolutely fabulous--not overly rose-y, more like an earthy-type rose. The scent is very natural and authentic too, not perfume-y. One thing you should be aware of is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot because it has no chemical foaming agents; this, however, is fine by me. I just use a little bit more, or clean up without the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has natural oils in it as well so that it&#x27;s not drying. I use it solely as a bath soap, but apparently all of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps can be used for everything from body care to household cleaning. I love this soap and find it gentle enough to even use on my face, yet it does clean thoroughly. I love how it makes shaving my legs easy as well, because of the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves little to no residue. I have read that it can be used to brush your teeth, do the dishes, and bathe your pets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked, and plan to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s exclusively from now on as a mainstay in my home. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural and versatile product like this for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> The product gets a 5.....the smell gets a 1!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for years.  I decided to try the Rose/Hemp soap when I couldnt find a good deal on my usual scent (Lavender).  The scent isn&#x27;t too overwhelming like a lot of rose scented products out there, and as with all Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, it has many uses, and rinses away clean.  You cant go wrong with this soap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap and love them all. However this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve tried the Rose and it has such a wonderful scent.  I&#x27;ve used this product for well over 10 years and have share how nice it is to others.  Once you try it you will not go back to regular soap.</li>
    <li> I adore this liquid Castile soap by Dr. Bonner&#x27;s. I use it to wash my hair, it has never been this pretty. Mix with equal parts coconut milk and add vitamin e.</li>
    <li> If I use this product in a bath soak more than once in a row I get itchy skin.  So does my daughter. In fact, she gets a reaction after using just once. We&#x27;re both fair skinned red heads.  It&#x27;s too expensive to use for general cleaning. (It does keep the bathtub clean) It may be a great product for some people.  Just not me.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was going to be exceptional with it having fair trade ingredients, usda certified, and organic but I was displeased because I would use just a dab on your hands and it always felt sticky. I just thought he product was good for using on laundry. Just a dab with do ya.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it to clean everything, even my car.  It makes great suds for washing dishes and you won&#x27;t have to worry about leaving any chemical residue on your dishes.  The rose scent is my favorite scent although the other scents are good too.  It also works great in laundry.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven&#x27;t used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes, we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes, including to use to wash our hair, faces, and bodies.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo, as it&#x27;s difficult to find a good conditioner to match it&#x27;s rosy scent, however, it&#x27;s really nice to use as a face and body wash.  As a shampoo, it tends to dry out my hair a little too much, also.  As a face and body wash, I haven&#x27;t noticed any effects of drying out my skin, and the scent is not strong enough to overpower, but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.  The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Castile Liquid is always useful because it doesn&#x27;t include any toxic ingredients ,so no bad to your health and no dry skin! Worth buying! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> love love love Dr. Bronners</li>
    <li> The soap cleanses body and hair well. It is fairly drying to my hair so I just make sure I put extra conditioner in after washing. A little does indeed go a long way. Only complaint is that it is fairly irritating to the genital areas on a female. Scent is slightly off from what a rose truly smells like but still more authentic than other body washes claiming to be rose scented.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells great and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap to use by the sink as a hand cleanser, in the shower, as a shampoo, etc. Other soaps make me dry and itchy, but not this one. I use the baby unscented variety though as I do seem to have problems with light rashes and itchiness with the scented varieties. If you are a sensitve person you can be allergic to naturally derived scents as well as chemical ones. I am particularly sensitive to the lavender, that may be the problem some people are having with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my pump dispensers by watering it down with half water. I find we have less or even no dry hand problems and skin cracking in the winter when I use this soap as compared to others. And it&#x27;s a great veggie wash also!</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this product.  I figured rose fragrance how bad could it be?!?  It was bad, It was not what I expected.  I love Dr. Bronners Almond and Peppermint castile soap, but buyers be where this smells horrible!</li>
    <li> So compared to Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap bars, this is kinda horrible. It&#x27;s extremely watery, the scent is strong &amp; a bit nauseating, especially in the mornings. I reallly wanted to like this one but I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the scent! It&#x27;s awful! At least for bathing..It reminds me of some old flower water mixed with burnt plastic. Ugh! Headache! Plus, it doesn&#x27;t lather as well, &amp; my skin was much dryer. I don&#x27;t even think I wanna use it to clean with. The fragrance was just the bad..</li>
    <li> subtle rose scent.  a little goes a long way.  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have loved this stuff since someone introduced me to it 40 or 50 years ago in the Haight in San Francisco (though that was the Peppermint version). One caution, it IS real soap and you will notice it (as will your kids) if it gets in your eyes, a cut, etc.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received this last week.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it as I want to get away from chemicals and I especially wanted to try it as a shampoo. I have very long curly hair and want it help keep my hair from drying out and not strip it. Well yesterday I used it for the first time. Even while still in the shower it felt weird like my hair was coated in thick wax. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed to no avail. I used the Dr bronner&#x27;s conditioner and that stunk even worse. I could not detangle my hair. It felt very dry and bushed up so awful. I put a band on it yesterday and tried to brush it out this morning before my shower and could not get a brush through it. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on anything else for fear it would take paint off. I hate it and would never buy it again. Oh, and it does have a bunch of weird new agey crap on the front, wouldn&#x27;t care about that but they also used the name of Jesus in it and since I&#x27;m Christian, it kinda offended me as the portrayal of Him was inaccurate. I just wish someone would have told me before I spent almost $20 on this crap.</li>
    <li> It cleans, it rinses, it smells great, it lasts forever. I prefer rose, lavender, and tea tree, over peppermint but rose is pleasant enough to wash with every day.</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily, so I used different brands for my issue. Only  Organic Castile Liquid Soap Rose Dr. Bronner&#x27;s helps my skin to clean up from the oil which is produced.</li>
    <li> dr bonners is great soap. you can use it for so many different things, and it&#x27;s castile soap and organic so you know it&#x27;s quality. it soaps up real good but if you wash your hair with it you&#x27;ll catch random wiffs of a weird &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; and hair mix that&#x27;s just kind of not sexy in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stick with the peppermint or citrus, those scents are premium.</li>
    <li> The soap is nice, leaves my skin feeling soft without causing breakouts, but not so fond of the scent (rose). Doesn&#x27;t smell floral to me, just...odd</li>
    <li> Love this product but would not buy the Rose scented again.. Do love all the other scents..Great value as shower soap, lasts forever....</li>
    <li> Just a word to the wise for those reading the description. I didn&#x27;t read enough and this is a hemp rose product (smells earthy) instead of sweet. I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products but just don&#x27;t love this smell.</li>
    <li> love this soap! it is mild and the fragrance leaves me, my bathroom and bedroom smelling heavenly.  i highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this a couple of years back and since then we have not used any other soap! It is amazingly refreshing. I love the Eucalyptus one the best (Peppermint a close second). Didn&#x27;t like the cloying smell of the Rose much. But I guess that is personal preference. Also love their socially conscious commentary on the bottle :)</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to use only on my beard. After buying the original Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Original/Peppermint Pure Castile Soap (32 oz) at Trader Joe&#x27;s for only $9.99 (now sells there for $11.99), I liked it enough to want to try one of the additional scents if the price was right. So, I purchased the Rose scent. The Peppermint has a sort of kick you in the face and get you ready for the day scent while the Rose scent is a bit more subtle and relaxing. I like both but if I could only choose only one, I would choose the Rose Scent with the lower cost of the Original at Trader Joe&#x27;s ;). I usually buy the Original (at TJ&#x27;s) just because I can never find any Dr. Bronner&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon.One note I would make is that before buying the Original/Peppermint, I was concerned that it would have a menthol type feel to it like a men&#x27;s aftershave, but this wasn&#x27;t the case at all. Both scents smell great to me and the brand deserves all the praise that it receives.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great organic product that smells like roses.  Your skin is the biggest organ you have and it absorbs whatever you put on it.  Its better to bath with a natural soap instead of a glob of chemicals</li>
    <li> My all time favorite Dr bronners soap!!!</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps are great, but this has quite an offputting scent. It in no way resembles the single note rose scent I expected. Instead it is a strong, unpleasant bile-like scent. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this scent again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, is light soapy feel, very  versitle. Highly recommend this product to anyone. You can use it for anything!</li>
    <li> It smells divine(i took Rose) ... and knowing that it is not loaded with chemicals makes me feel so better when i use it. Will use it for some more time and come back and update my review if the product fails to impress me further in any way...</li>
    <li> Great as a brush cleaner and body wash, little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I feel like I have to share my experience with this product.  I love this soap, completely adore it and have bought it for years.  When I received it from Amazon today it didn&#x27;t have a safety seal on it and was very watered down, it had very clearly been tampered with.  So disappointing.  If you love this soap as much as I do, I would recommend buying from somewhere more reliable.  Sorry for the downer of a review!  I hope this review helps someone else avoid this situation...</li>
    <li> I feel clean.  i smell good.  No soapy or over-moisturized feeling left on my skin.  Definitely recommend over your standard body washes.  Love that it can double for home cleaning, too!</li>
    <li> Dr Bronners is the best.  Been using for 10+ years now and can&#x27;t be beat.  Not my favorite scent but I keep it in the rotation.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this and washes very well. Cleans up good even my floor if I wanted a different smell in my home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter, who loves rose scent.  She has used it as a body wash, and has also used it to shampoo our pets.  It is non-irritating and gentle.  The product has many potential uses which are listed on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bonners - the go to soap.  The smell is lovely.  A change from my usual lavender.  I love sharing this with my niece.  Nothing beats Dr. Bonner!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and received on time.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this simply b/c I wanted to see what the rose soap was like.  First it&#x27;s not only Rose, but also hemp- thus the scent is not purely \\&quot;ROSE\\&quot;.  That being said, it is still a nice scent.  The liquid is VERY thin in consistency, unlike another brand that I have tried.  It is a Very good soap.</li>
    <li> Soap ok but not greater. Smell does not remain on your skin, unlike the other Dr Bronner soaps (lavender,etc). The rose flavoring need to be stronger.</li>
    <li> Great for diluting and using in your empty foam soap dispensers. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s cheat sheet on their website says you can dilute with water at a 1:10 ratio for hand washing or doing dishes. So it&#x27;ll go far!</li>
    <li> I like these liquid soaps a lot. Large quantity and a variety of uses - love that it is organic</li>
    <li> I am a big supporter of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand soaps. I have tried several of the scents, but I have to say that Rose is sadly my least favorite. I&#x27;m not sure why, and it is still tolerable. But, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d choose it again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap...  a little goes a long way!  And the smell is just beautiful!  It makes a great shampoo as well as a body wash!  I am left refreshed and feeling great!  I am more than pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap for about two years. I quit using the soaps with all the chemicals. I really love the many ways you can use it. I use it to wash my body and clean the tub afterwards. I also use it to clean the floors. This Rose Castile soap smells good and I wanted to try it out because I normally buy the unscented soaps.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet as it just came in the mail but I&#x27;m already disappointed. I selected the natural unscented and was sent Rose. It may not be a huge deal but I want what I ordered and not a surprise.</li>
    <li> I really like using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s or other castile soaps for everyday handwashing, etc. It seems a bit drying for body wash, and castile soap made my hair very limp and stringy when I tried it as shampoo. However, I do use it in all of my bathrooms and kitchen for handwashing. In that application I actually dilute it quite a bit...I have some foaming handwash dispensers (not the automatic kind, just old, reused Softsoap foaming dispensers) and am able to fill about 1/3 of each with water while still getting really good lather. This helps the product last a really long time and we haven&#x27;t had any problems with the soap going bad (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s even possible...) so I feel it works well. I don&#x27;t notice much of a rose smell from this, but that could be because we typically use it diluted...</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer, smells like roses but not overpowering, not dried out like most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Love the soap and I have a hard time finding soap that works for me with my extremely&lt;br /&gt;sensative skin.</li>
    <li> Love Dr Bonnets soaps! I use 3 different scents depending on the time of the year. Leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint: I use this in the shower during the hot and humid summer months. Cooling tip: Don&#x27;t towel off after you rinse. Just stand in front or below a fan and air dry. Brrrrrrr! With or without air conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose: The first time I used this was my first shower after my daughter was born. I will forever associate the pure woods rose scent with this special time in my life. So glad I chose to pack the little 4oz bottle in my hospital bag. Highly recommended and had no concerns about nursing baby(exposure to chemicals) after bathing. I use the Rose regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond: I find the almond scent comforting in the cooler months.</li>
    <li> I love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  I have sensitive skin and get very dry skin during winter and have been on a search for a good soap.  This soap lathers up and rinses clean with no residue.  Dry itchy skin went away and we are using much less water too!  The rose scent is very light and fades away as well as the lavendar which has a stronger smell to it but it also fades away.  I have been using the tea tree oil bar soap on my face which is also helping with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other side benefit is... it seems that the bathtub is not getting as much soap scum and is easier to keep clean.  It&#x27;s a win win...  Less water, better results and a cleaner tub.  I have been recommending these products to family and friends!</li>
    <li> great product for anyone who enjoys feeling clean. it works excellent on clothing and hair also. i really love it.</li>
    <li> The soap is great, but the smell is awful, in my opinion. I thought rose would be a light, flowery scent- and this is very strong, artificial, chemically sweet smell. It is not good! I wish I would have gone to the co-op and taken a whiff before buying this. My advice is smell it before buying it! I will probably use the bottle (not to waste!)  but with reluctance. I am talking about the ROSE scent. I love others like the peppermint and lavender.</li>
    <li> Product is great, just like all Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  Very natural.  Not perfumey, as expected.  But it smell like chalky candy - very subtle, but not great.  I recommend the citrus.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this soap.</li>
    <li> Rose scented perfumes, soaps, and lotions are my thing so I was very excited to find out that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap came in Rose scent. I was not expecting this scent at all. In fact, I don&#x27;t even think it resembles any kind of rose scent! I mainly just use it in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> A classic, you can&#x27;t go wrong with dr bronners! I mix one part rose castile with one part sweet almond oil for the best face wash ever!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean up hair very well and I doubt it&#x27;s using natural ingredients. I used a French brand all natural ingredient shampoo before and it clean up hair so well, but definitely not this one.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I use it in foaming hand soap dispensers at each sink, in dispensers in the showers, and the whole family from the toddler on up uses this soap. It has a lovely, subtle scent.  I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps because they don&#x27;t add any artificial, cancer-causing, endocrine-disrupting bad ingredients like most brands.</li>
    <li> As a body wash yes I smell yummy. ..but as a shampoo it just makes my hair tacky  and greasy looking. I did read the though that if you use too much and don&#x27;t rinse out completely.  That is what happened to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for so many uses around the house. A truly versatile product!</li>
    <li> I love all Dr. Bronners products, even the tea tree oil which actually smells like Pine Sol to me.  This rose does not smell like rose, smells like a**.  I NEVER write reviews but I just had to for this because it is THAT BAD.  Honestly I feel like puking even thinking about the smell.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with it, don&#x27;t even want to open the flip top again.  Absolutely disgusting UGHHH.</li>
    <li> i love this but it irritates certain areas</li>
    <li> I have Prime, so with the free shipping, I saved a few dollars over buying the large bottle of the rose castile soap at Target.  I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years, and I love the rose scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells as good as it works!</li>
    <li> I used this to replace my shower gel/body wash. I tried using it as shampoo but it makes my hair feel like straw. It really is a great body wash though!</li>
    <li> I love this smell and product. Its soothing and the smell fragrant. I have keratosis on my skin and castle soap is helping smooth my skin. Delivered promptly and would recommend to you to purchase. Peppermint smells good too!</li>
    <li> This is a smooth soap which leaves your skin feeling soft, elastic and youthful.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I use this for homeade cleaners, shampoo, and dishwashing soap!! Works great an last for a long time!</li>
    <li> Always loved this soap. Fair Trade, made with biodegradable materials, and simply covered with bible phrases. You can&#x27;t beat this soap.</li>
    <li> Something in the product&#x27;s fragrance profile resembled vomit to me, to the extent that I became nauseated while using the soap for laundry. I generally love rose-scented products. As this was a very unpleasant experience, hopefully I am the only person who will have this experience. Also when I used it in cold water, the soap solidified on clothes. I am looking forward to trying the unscented version, for hot &amp; warm washes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing, I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen, and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn&#x27;t take a large amount, much less than I have to dispense with Dawn.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use for natural cleaning around your home.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great! Gentle on my driest skin and also helps my super dry hands stay moist :)</li>
    <li> I will never go back to bar soap.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid soaps. I thought I&#x27;d try a new scent. The rose is my least favorite.  I only use this soap as a last resort because frankly, it smells terrible.</li>
    <li> I like dr bronner products....but after a long while i noticed when i use it as a body soap that it starts leaving a ring of scum in the shower- probably due to the oil base.  I tried it in homemade coconut shampoo and only used on my scalp-but found it to be very drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer for the rose fragrance. I&#x27;ve used Bronner soaps for a long time and really like the rose fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and wash my cats with it once a month. The jumbo bottle is awesome and will honestly last me like 4 years beause this is all I use it for. Booyah.</li>
    <li> We use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s all the time!  We use the mint, the baby, etc.  We had never used Rose and our local store does not carry it so I though, why not!  Well, I will tell you why not.  There is something wrong with this soap.  It leaves a really weird feeling to your skin.  We have never had this with any other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap in any other scent or unscented.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, but you feel like you need to wash your hands again.  Since we use this as a shower soap too, it is a big problem.  It feels like an odd film or something is on you.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bonners, so I thought I would  try this new rose sent. Its only okay I think  will stick with the peppermint next time.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry from washing in the winter, and I&#x27;ve found castile soap is much less drying for my skin than standard soaps based on SLS and similar chemicals. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in quality between this and cheaper brands of castile soap, but I like how many different scents this brand offers, and I use it diluted in foaming soap dispensers, so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> As always, does the job of cleaning my skin. I also use it to wash my dog&#x27;s dishes. Very gentle. This is my favorite scent of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I use it as face wash, body wash, and to clean the counters and even the tub</li>
    <li> I love the lack of toxic chemicals in this soap, and it has great slip and good suds. The scent isn&#x27;t as rosy as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m not sure if the hemp overwhelms the rose or what. It&#x27;d probably be a good idea to include the word hemp in the product title, since it does have a pretty strong smell.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and love rose, but this smelled awful.  It smelled like rotten roses.  I think this company is selling expired soap.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again from this company.</li>
    <li> Rose smell is not that rosey. I guess I was expecting something stronger considering it was Dr. Bronner.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I use it with the foam soap dispenser, which offsets the high cost but does an incredible job. Found better price at a local store.</li>
    <li> rose is not my favorite scent for the shower, but I absolutely love this stuff. I use the lavender and peppermint in the shower and I now use the rose &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; to  make my cleaning products. love love love this product!</li>
