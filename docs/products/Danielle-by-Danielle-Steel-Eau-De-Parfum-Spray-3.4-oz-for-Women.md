    <li> light clean smell...get asked daily what cologne I&#x27;m wearing. Am disappointed it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product came on time and in great condition - great price, saved 30.00 I will buy through amazon again soon.</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear her perfume, I receive so many comments.  Men and woman have asked me the name of the perfume.  I feel so special when I wear it.  I actually freak when I run out of it.  Thank you Danielle Steel!</li>
    <li> love this. will order again</li>
    <li> I have paid as much as $26.98 for it,so I am extremely happy that Amazon.com carries Danielle Parfum for women as well as for men at such reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was perfect for a birthday gift for my granddaughter.......  who&#x27;s name happens to be &amp;#34; Danielle &amp;#34; !!  Much appreciated Amazon!  Hats off to easy shopping !</li>
    <li> Love this  so much.  Since no longer available in stores I was thrilled to purchase this here.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This perfume does not smell that good the moment you put it on.  3 minutes later, however, it smells great and it sure lasts a while.  I receive compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
    <li> I wear this perfume every time I leave the house. I get compliments on the way I smell everyday. I work as a registered nurse so I really can&#x27;t wear over powering fragrances, yet I have never had anyone complain about my perfume. It is strong for about the 1st 5 minutes you put it on, but by the time I get to work 25 minutes later it has softened. I have had COPD patient&#x27;s tell me they can&#x27;t be around perfumes because it litterally takes their breat away. However, I have always been told even by the most sensitive client&#x27;s, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re wearing but it is the nicest perfume and it doesn&#x27;t make me sick.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Danielle has a lovely scent that is beyond description.  I am continually receiving compliments on my perfume wherever I go.  However, the perfume  is becoming increasingly difficult to find.  It seems that it can only be found online.  I wonder if the manufacturer has ceased production. If you like it, better get it while you can!</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfume, i love her as an author and i also love her perfume would reccomend&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift! Great scent!</li>
    <li> I tried this once at Macy&#x27;s, and fell in love with it.  It smells great on me, and I get a lot of compliments on it.  A co-worker bought it because she loved it on me, but didn&#x27;t like it on herself...free bottle for me!  I found it at TJ Maxx for a while, but now I can only find it online.  Great scent for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is my Wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. I paid a great price for it and it was delivered promptly. I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I wear it daily and get complements constantly. Although I can&#x27;t smell it  Will continue to purchase it. Soft scent</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my mother, and she loved it!!! She bought it once at a Marshalls store about 3 years ago and she had been trying to get it again ever since. Now I got it for her, and she was a truly happy mom!!!</li>
    <li> Getting too expensive and  came unboxed. A real bummer. Hope the fragrance hasn&#x27;t changed. It&#x27;s about priced off my gift list.</li>
    <li> I love these perfumes Danielle Steel and Cool Water they are my favorite fragrances since years back. The movie Dance With Me is super good. I say you people did an excellent job with my order, everything went well, the delivery and time frame, excellent!!!!! Thank you so much.</li>
