      <li>We have tried so many different hand cream products none of which really worked.</li>
      <li>thank you very much!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It felt like a deep moisturizer, with a clean scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much thrown out all of my other lotions including the special news formulated for eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
