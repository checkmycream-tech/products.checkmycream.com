<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> good shaver， The battery is robust.</li>
    <li> Solid shaver. Not a great dry shaver, but works flawlessly in the shower. Cleaner is nice addition, but not sure it really does anything. It&#x27;s a little noisy and slow at cleaning so don&#x27;t do it at night. I got this for $69.99 which was an absolute steal.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband when he shaved his head completely.  He absolutely loves it and uses it daily.  Cleaning and recharging are easy.</li>
    <li> I bought it primarily for wet shaving, in the shower.  was considering a Braun, and Norelco wet/ dry model, but was turned off by the high replacement cost for the foil, blades and cleaning system.  Panasonics replacement cost are more reasonable.  It charged quickly.  Got a very good close shave first time using it, (like a newborn&#x27;s bottom,) although it took a little longer.  Got razor burn second time I used it.  Had to apply after shave balm.  Have not used it as a dry shaver yet.  Also, this shaver is very easy to clean. So far, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an older Wet/Dry 3-blade panasonic razor.  What I like better with this version is that I haven&#x27;t gotten any &#x27;razor-burn&#x27;.  I still have to shave the same area 3 or 4 times to get a close shave.  Both my old and new razor work(ed) great in the shower.  I would have given this a 5 star rating if I only had to make 2 or less passes to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and bonus.  It has a travel lock switch, so when I travel the TSA won&#x27;t think my suitcase has a &#x27;vibrator&#x27; in it :)</li>
    <li> Never been an electric razor guy, but must admit that I like it and could get used to it.  Solid manufacture and a relatively smooth shave.  For me, using it twice a day seems to provide the best results.  The self-cleaning feature is cool too.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I love it. It will hold a charge for several weeks and has a lock for traveling to prevent any accidental battery drain. The washing station is a very nice feature</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a high end Braun that gave me great service for 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to save money and now I&#x27;m paying for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use so much force for this to shave my face that I end up with a red neck at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Aren&#x27;t shavers supposed to shave anymore :o(</li>
    <li> Great shave, easy to use. I traditionally have been an old disposable razor shaver, and wanted to try going all electric. This shaver shaves almost as close, and works equally well in or out of the shower! Thanks Panasonic and Amazon!</li>
    <li> too noisy during the washing procedure</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.  My husband has very thick facial hair, but this razor leaves him super smooth and soft.  He loves the self-cleaning holder, too.</li>
    <li> It shaves good and it works perfect. No better product as a gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> Easy to use shaver, have not need any cream or shaving gel. Nice charging system, I rinse/wash the head and screen after each use and use the dryer function built into the charger.</li>
    <li> Husband love this!  You should buy it!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this!</li>
    <li> My husband says awesome.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present, to replace a Braun 2-foil shaver I had been using for a number of years.  After a week of regular use, I am quite pleased.  Using it dry, it provides a very close, comfortable shave.  Like any other electric razor, you do have to work at it a bit and move the head in different directions to deal with different hair growth patterns, but the results are worth the effort.  This was my first wet/dry shaver so I was quite interested to try it in the shower.  I&#x27;ve tried it with a light shave butter and a low-foam shave gel and got a decent close shave in each instance.  I will say, however, that with the water and lubricant it felt like the foils skidded across my skin a bit and as a result I don&#x27;t think the results were as good as a dry shave.  The pop-up trimmer on the back of the razor works well and there is a convenient lock on the on/off switch to prevent accidental shutoff during your shave.  The cleaning mode in the base is handy but as other reviewers have noted, you can accomplish the same level of cleaning by running the head and foils under warm water.  I do like the fact that the base has an internal fan and a drying mode that can be used without having to go through the entire cleaning cycle.  Overall a very good razor.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as closely as expected.</li>
    <li> i bought this shaver for my bf valentines day gift and he loves it! He says it works great and that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin, like other shavers. He loves the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Son in the Navy so he has to shave every day.  Tough beard but sensitive skin that was badly irritated from daily shave.  Ordered this shaver for him when he was home on leave, and it immediately began to heal his face.  He reports that it is perfect for his needs and gentle to his skin esp. since he has to look \\&quot;ship shape\\&quot; all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one for myself - last electric I bought was a Norelco from 1963.  Electric razors appear to have changed.  This thing is great - love to use it in the shower.  It delivers a good shave - not as good a feel as a razor blade but I have a pretty tough mug so I never have any irritation.  Blade just shaves closer, but this is a nice thing to have for quick shave or touch up later in the day.  Another great Panasonic product.</li>
    <li> nice close shave, I have a rotary and now this, both work in unison for great shave</li>
    <li> Is very good, very good, the price is right, is to open the package and found that the outer packing of the razor was broken.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great body shaver, no iritation whatsoever. But when I tried my face I got razor bumps eveywhere so it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin. The charge lasts awhile, and the charge meter is a really nice feature. But when it does need to be charged or cleaned it does so in little time. Oh and the pop up shaver is worthless, awkward to use and digs into the skin too easy.</li>
    <li> Good Product, i like it</li>
    <li> Nice shaver, i got in black Friday deal and I am enjoying it. It took me 2 weeks to adjust, as others recommended use it atleast 2-4 weeks to notice difference, I don&#x27;t need to use razor any more, after 20 years of shaving with razor and now with shaver there is lot difference, this the first time I have clean shave without cuts and nicks. I bet you don&#x27;t loose money with this device. By the way use pre electric shave lotion for better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68 so I have used a LOT of shavers over a LOT of years!  This is definitely the best I have ever used.  I have always really preferred a wet shave with a safety razor because that is the closest shave.  However, with very sensitive skin, I can only shave with a blade about once a week so I have used electric shavers extensively over the years.  This Panasonic shaver is definitely THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED!  It truly gives a shave as close as a safety razor.  And it is very easy on my skin - I don&#x27;t even need to use alcohol / shave lotion after shaving with this one - and can use it every day (though I seldom do anymore).  It works well with a 3 day beard, too - but I find I need to start with a very light touch and then go back over - and still the same clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I especially like the cleaning unit - it leaves the razor as clean as brand new.  Now, I always shave dry - and after shaving pop the head against the sink to remove the loose whisker and skin and a quick brushing of the top of the shaver itself.  So, when I put it in the cleaner, all that loose debris is already removed - I think that probably makes the cleaning cartridge last a little longer and stay cleaner.  The real effect of the cleaner, after all, is to remove all the skin oil that can build up in the shaving head so it is truly sparkling clean.  I find the cleaning cartridge lasts me 2 months.  At about a month along, a little more water needs to be added to the tank as a good bit apparently evaporates while the cleaning is being done; if the water level runs too low the cleaner will indicate a replacement cartridge is needed.  NEVER replace all the water - the water in the tank has the cleaning &#x27;soap&#x27; in it. The cartridge has a filter to take out larger particles (e.g. whiskers) and much of the dead skin, oils, etc. which is washed out of the shaver head and the water cycles through this on the way back to the tank.  When replacing the cartridge, empty the water tank and then refill it and give it a good shake to pick up any sediment in the bottom of the tank and empty that out so you&#x27;ll start the new cartridge with a very clean tank of water.  Be sure to put your fingers over the two holes in the tank or you&#x27;ll have water everywhere!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and worried this might have a bad reaction. It turned out pretty good and leaves a great shave. So for those with sensitive skin i recommend this, although remember everyone&#x27;s skin is different so as always you&#x27;ll just have to see if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband - he LOVES IT! He can get a perfect shave or trim, whichever he chooses to do. And the self cleaning is simple to use.</li>
    <li> good price, high quality. plz i love amazon prime.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son.  He loves it so far</li>
    <li> Quite a big difference from my old Braun shaver. This shaver is quieter, gives a nice close shave. Meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with his Panasonic Electric Shaver.</li>
    <li> Great reliable shaver.  Very quiet.</li>
    <li> This shaver got me a close shave. The charging dock is very nice, and the on/off lock is a great feature that other shavers lack. However, my face just couldn&#x27;t adjust to a foil-type shaver (was attempting to switch from rotary) and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Better That I was expected... Perfect gift for my husband</li>
    <li> This razor is good. Not great. But good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for probably about a month now. When I started, I only got minimal irritation from switching over from a rotary razor. So, that was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to always shave whenever I wanted, but now I find that I MUST wash my face with warm water first or I will get a million stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is 6/10&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;The comfort while shaving is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;The charger/cleaner is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind shaving, then realizing that you need to shave again because you missed a couple of hairs, this razor is for you.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic and I&#x27;m as happy with it as I was with the others.</li>
    <li> So, I have always wanted a good electric razor. However, I have long been afraid to get one because I get the worlds worse razor burn. I have always used a mach 3 and waited 3 days in between shaves. Otherwise, I would have a red bleeding bumpy neck. I also have think facial hair that grows very fast.  So, I figured I never had a chance with electrics. However, this electric caught my eye on cyber Monday when it was on sale for an awesome price. I decided to give it a shot. The first time I shaved I used water and shaving cream. I was amazed at what a great job it did on my face. Wet shaving this thing gets just about as close as a mach 3. The only problem is on my neck it took several passes and manipulating the shaver in different ways to shave some of the neck hair.  So I did end up with some razor burn but not too bad. Next i decided to try it dry. Again I was quite impressed.  It takes some getting use to but after a week or two i had my own kind It shaving system that works best for me.  I shave everywhere lightly on the first pass. Then I press down hard with the razor to my skin and slowly shave everywhere again. This seems to do the best job for me with the least amount of razor burn. Its not perfect, but I do like it. It probably takes about the same amount of time as normal shaving. I just don&#x27;t have to spend like 10 bucks every 2 weeks on blades.  Oh and the self cleaner works..it cleans ..it charges..it drys. Not sure what more you could expect from that. Don&#x27;t know yet if it will be worth it to buy the replacement cleaning carts. I have found it extremely easy to clean manually. In summary, I went into this not expecting much and I am pleasantly surprised. If you can afford to give it a shot, especially if you get it on sale, I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and brother have the same shaver and they love it. Both of them have a thick beard.</li>
    <li> it takes a month of daily use to know if it is doing the job, we have not had it long enough to know</li>
    <li> The base is pretty bad, I got 2 and both act really weird.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it will get stuck in the dry cycle for over an hour</li>
    <li> Works great. Shaves close to skin without pulling or scratching skin. Cleaner does a good job. Battery last more than a week using it daily. Great when on the road.</li>
    <li> Perfect Christmas gift for my dad</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s had this for a year now.  It shaves well and gentle enough to not affect teenage acne issues.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product, I expected it to shave better. I feel as if I have to shave over and over the same area to feel smooth. I have used numerous electric razors over numerous years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, quick delivery. I&#x27;ve had several of these - they seem to be the best product I&#x27;ve been able to find compared to the others out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new battery seems to last much longer than their older ones.</li>
    <li> I always used razor till now for shaving needs,  I started using this one just a few days, This shaver definitely will give close to shave look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Over all i would say this will definitely will give close shave and if you have acne/boils on you face this shaver will help you out with smooth&lt;br /&gt;shaving. As other reviews mentioned cleaning/drying cycle is taking long time approximately 45 mins for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor now for over a year and I wished I switched sooner. Like a lot of guys I have thick corse hair which only let me shave once a week. Almost zero pulls compared to my rotary which made me dread shaving. I was attracted to the functionality of the various methods of being able to use it (wet,dry with foam/gel) i&#x27;ve only used it dry as to not to waste unnecessary water (preference) although I won&#x27;t rule out trying it wet. The closest shave of any electric I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;A major appeal of this was the ability of self/manual cleaning with simple liquid soap on the cleaning setting takes less then a minute. No cleaning solution/cartridges to buy of you don&#x27;t want to. Of course this comes with a cleaning station which works well enough but I feel a manual cleaning can be more thorough. I do see the benefit of the drying setting on the cleaning station to extend the life of blades and foil. If you use the cleaning station or not I like it has a nice home on the station rather than under the sink or on the counter. My only complaint which I knew from other reviews before purchasing was it&#x27;s LOUD. Really loud.&lt;br /&gt;All that said and for the price which amazon offered a $20 coupon you can&#x27;t beat the price and quality. Happy Shaving, your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good razor for my husband for a long time, and this was it. He has very thick face fur, and this cuts through it like a good mini- mower. He uses it every day and loves it, and I love how smooth his face is. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this  razor its work good for me Excellent job.I recommend this 100% Not cheap and no to expensive</li>
    <li> This is sharpness and very effective shave to me&lt;br /&gt;I was less spend time at morning, more satisfie my condition</li>
    <li> in a word.The Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc 3 Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning Systempackage is heavy, others  are good！wu fen hao ping!</li>
    <li> I have used this item for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;This item is really working well and the price is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased another one.</li>
    <li> It looks good, but I haven&#x27;t tried its functions yet.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  Easy to use.  Need info on replacement blades</li>
    <li> MUCH LIKE ME IS WHAT WE WANTED</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic (ES-LT71-S Arc3) razor a couple of years ago to replace my old Braun Syncro razor after learning that Braun had decided to economize their blade designs and manufacture them in China with the result that it wasn&#x27;t possible to buy quality replacement blades for the Braun anymore.  The Panasonic has been a nice razor and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It shaves just as well as the Braun did or any electric razor I have had. The cleaning station for the razor is not as effective and integral as the cleaning station was for the Braun. In fact, if I recall correctly, the manual for the Panasonic indicates it&#x27;s not that essential to use the cleaning station and you can just wash the razor off when you are in the shower or whatever. The cleaning station does keep the foil and blades clean and fresh for the next time you shave, but lower on the razor&#x27;s head gunk will gradually build up. The cleaning station itself also gradually gunks itself up and has to be cleaned every 6-12 months or so. The razor&#x27;s waterproof feature is really nice and it is super easy to clean it off in the sink or shower, and a wet shave does feel nice and gets closer than a dry shave. But I usually shave dry.  The Panasonic&#x27;s battery life and ability to keep a charge is much better than the Braun&#x27;s ever was.  I haven&#x27;t had any more problems with it pulling my beard if I go a few days without shaving than I have with any other electric razor. It&#x27;s just a problem inherent to electric razors, in my experience.  All in all this is a good quality product and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> easy to order online as expected&lt;br /&gt;last for years, and years, and years, and years worth the big price tag</li>
    <li> It is authentically better than Philips razor used for an ago&lt;br /&gt;The short beard is well cut&lt;br /&gt;I would like to recommend</li>
    <li> I am normally lazy to write a review and do it only in obligation to others who&#x27;s reviews were really helpful to me. Not this time - this review would be my pleasure to write. I gave this shaver a 5 stars only because there is no more stars to give. I have a very thick facial hair that grows in different directions and tough as hell. At the same time I have a sensitive skin. Shaving for me was a dreaded choir until now. This shaver is amazing. I never was able to achieve such a close and smooth shave with electric shaver before, and with no irritation at all. I own a fairly new Brown and Norelco shavers - they both go to the thrash. Do yourself a favor - buy Panasonic shaver and start enjoying shaving at last.</li>
    <li> Good little shaver. Not excellent but will give a pretty good shave if you twist and turn over the same areas a bunch.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get this kit on sale, but have not yet found a technique for getting a decent shave in less than about 15 min.  On the plus side, you do not have to use the cleaning reservoir to clean shaver or to recharge. I am not confident in the safety in using this electric razor in the shower, so have not tried that. Perhaps that would provide a faster shave. I have to go over each area many more times than with my old Remington electric to get a uniformly close shave. Perhaps I will discover a technique with practice that makes me use this instead of my old Gilette Good News disposable safety razors. Not there yet.</li>
    <li> Very Nice Shaver. Love the cleaning function on this.</li>
    <li> My two year old Norelco that I was replacing gives me a closer shave. Don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver at Best Buy.  I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]] and lost it during business trip.  I went to Best Buy and found this unit -- looks like ES8109S, 3-blade, arc foil, Linear motor, cleaning charger, exactly same, but this one has on-off switch lock that is a great feature for frequent travelor like myself.  I like this shaver using in shower.  This is just another great shaver from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Update after 5 years:&lt;br /&gt;My Panasonic razor still works. The battery got noticeably weaker starting in the 2nd year and now is at about 20% of the original. But it still gives me a week of shaving per charge. I&#x27;m on only the 3rd foil and blade in 5 years, that is amazing to me, compared to other razors I have used. And without any special cleaning or lubing, just water and soap. Still love the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review from May 2012:&lt;br /&gt;After the battery of my Brown 8595 started to fail after 10 years I was in the market for a new electric shaver. I wanted a washable razor, which now almost all seem to be. I tried some of the razors friends had, the [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]], the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]], the [[ASIN:B005DKKBUG Panasonic ES-LT71-S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade(Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]] and the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]].&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco had by far the roughest and least close shave for me. Maybe it works well for some beards and longer hair, but it didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like the new Braun shaver. I had been very happy with my old Braun, the only downside for me being its tedious cleaning: one couldn&#x27;t use water, had to use a brush or the Braun cleaning system, but their alcohol based solution evaporates rather quickly. I only used it about once every 2 weeks and closed the container again, it then would last 6 months. The new Braun can be washed with water and soap like all the other new shavers. I was disappointed though that the Braun 790 didn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as close as my old Braun. Their blade and foil is one piece now, which I thought might improve the closeness of the shave, but it didn&#x27;t. I liked the feel and built quality of the Braun a lot, but after I tried the Panasonic shavers, I couldn&#x27;t justify anymore spending twice as much for the Braun for a less close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed by both Panasonic shavers I tried. The LA63 is a newer model but uses the same blades as the LT71. The blades are wider spaced in the LA63 and the foil head is deeper as it has two floating foils (to straighten hair?) in between the two foils that cover the blades. The LT71 has only one such intermediate foil. I could however not detect any difference in closeness of shave, both are excellent and better than my old and the new Braun I tried. The LT71 was cheaper, so the LT71 it was.&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect I might consider buying the [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]] and save $20. It is identical to the LT71 except it has no cleaning device. This device seems unnecessary, though. Cleaning under running water, and if necessary adding some soap, cleans the shaver to a like new condition.&lt;br /&gt;The LT41 and LT71 seem to replace the [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] and [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]].

    <li> I have had shavers all over the years that were \\&quot;soso\\&quot;. Then I got this one and it is fantastic and works way better than all the other ones I had. I love it.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use it, I&#x27;m really annoyed by its working sound. Maybe its engine is too powerful. Anyway, I can only get used to it.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver I got for Xmas this year. However, after a couple of months, the motor stops part way thru a shave, the recharging indicator lights up (although the display also indicates a full charge, or nearly so) and the unit will not turn on again no matter what I try. Happened to discover that if I put it in the charging stand, it eventually resets itself after a few hours. But, it fails again after a few minutes shaving - even after fully charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see who or where to contact to see about a warranty replacement, so thought I&#x27;d post here and hope for a reply.</li>
    <li> Great feature to price ratio.  It shaves extremely close.  The cleaning feature is really nice, and it costs less than a comparable Braun shaving system.</li>
    <li> reviews I read helped. It is a great razor.  Also a good value. I am very pleased with it. Thanks</li>
    <li> This was the first electronic shaver I have ever owned. I bought it because it was on sale for $70&#x27;s and it was at the top with great ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I put the cartiage in and water in the tank. It began leaking between the socket and the cartiage, then through every hole and slit there was. Contacted customer service and they sent me another one with 2 day shipping. Sadly I won&#x27;t be back until the weekend to review it. If it also leaks, i&#x27;m returning both of them and just getting the electric shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver itself is great. It works effeciently and is easy to clean. I never had one before and never knew how easy it was to clean. Just add some soap on the shaver with warm water, and turn it on, and it basically clean itself. It works great for my sensitive skin and works well for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change my review if the second one works, but for now 2 stars for the electric shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* The replacement works much better than the first one I had gotten. The electric shaver as I stated deserves 2 stars for its shaving capabilities and other features, and the cleaning system also deserves 2 stars for its ability to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for not only the low price compared to others, but also the product itself works better than average.</li>
    <li> This works sufficiently, but wish it shaved a little closer.  It about as long to shave with this than with the razor.  To be fair, this is my first electric shaver, so I do not have a comparison to others.</li>
    <li> This product is so beautiful and portability. I love it! I cut the mustache easily with it. I support it.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco shavers for over 50 years, I thought I’d give this Panasonic a fair try. After about two months of shaving with the Panasonic, I can report that (1) the Panasonic is much noisier, and of course a shaver can be used close to the ears; (2) the Panasonic is much easier to clean, as one does not have to contend with three small wheel blade sockets as with the Norelco; and (3) the Panasonic’s straight blades and linear configuration do not do the good shaving job around the nostrils that the Norelco’s round blades do, causing me to supplement the shave I get from the Panasonic with a little touch-up near the nostrils with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic shaver came with its own cleaning system, which offers a charging cradle for the shaver but takes a certain amount of space. It features a small tank, to be filled with water and a cleansing agent which can last a few months. It is simple to operate but the process takes about an hour and produces alternate different sounds like a washing machine might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what to expect from this Panasonic shaver after, say, 12 months of use. My Norelco experience has taught me that buying replacement parts like new blades can cost more than buying a brand new shaver which will, of course, include new blades. My experiment with the Panasonic may not last 12 months, but I am happy to share my findings to date with you about this shaver.</li>
    <li> Awesome affordable great quality shaver. Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far. You can not go wrong with a Panasonic. It&#x27;s recommended.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. No razor bumps, no burning sensation, and a close/smooth shave. The manual that comes with the shaver is a great asset and I am glad I took the time to review it, I encourage you to do the same. The only (minor) negative thing that I&#x27;ve experienced is when I shave under my neck, I leave a few hairs untouched. But, this is due to my hairs not cooperating (laying flat) and not a fault of the shaver. Again, this a great shaver. It&#x27;s well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I ever used i 40 years ,shaves so close.  Your face feels so smoth Easy cleaning, nice side burn trimmer. Feel great in your hand.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the buy. I have very sensitive skin, which as a guy who works at a job that requires shaving before EVERY shift, sucks. This razor though glides smoothly, and works efficiently. My face is clean almost every time.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great choice in electric shavers. I have only had it for about a week or so now so i havent had a chance to use the self cleaning system although ive heard it works great. they say it takes about a month for your face to get used to the new razor but mine is already getting accustomed to it. previously ive owned 3 electric shavers and this is by far the closest shave, the most comfortable shave, and the only one that hasnt caused my face to break out. i love it. my opinion to those who are looking to purchase an electric shaver, i would definitely go with this one, if not, id go with nothing less and just get the better version.</li>
    <li> Best sharver very easy to use</li>
    <li> this electric shaver works amazingly for my boyfriend. he now shaves everyday :)</li>
    <li> For the past 44 years I have only used a blade razor, works well so why change.  Recently, because of health issues my doctor has me on  Plavix and other blood thinners so now if I nick my face while shaving it bleeds all day. Not good.  To solve this problem the idea had crossed my mind to try an electric razor and when this popped up for the &amp;#34;Deal of the Day&amp;#34; I gave it a try.  Glad I did.  Very close shave on the face and with a little extra effort does a relatively good job on the neck.  I really cannot compare this to other electric razors because this is the only one I have ever tried but compared to a blade razor it can hold it&#x27;s own. Even at full price I would highly recommend this shaver.  At the high price of blade razors today with their three, four or five blades this electric razor will pay for itself in short order.</li>
    <li> Really amazing shaver and last me two weeks for full charge. It does a good job</li>
    <li> I had another of these, one model up, and the battery conked out after not using it for a while.  So I thought this one with the special charger and cleaner was a good idea.  I like having the cleaner and don&#x27;t miss the special swivel head.  So far it is going strong.</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric razor for ease and comfort, and have trouble with them because I have psoriasis and fine facial skin.  Unfortunately this more expensive version of an electric razor did no different than a cheaper one.  I probably just have super sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t treat my face well, I just get razor burn.  Honestly, dollar shave club razors do by me the best.</li>
    <li> Two points to note before buying this product :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As pointed by many others, you can&#x27;t have a stubble and use this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not flexible at the lower end of your jaw. Under my neck, i have to use Razor after using this equipment to shave properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially my skin became very sensitive towards this product, but after couple of time it became normal. This shaver also has a trimmer but it is pretty un-useful.</li>
    <li> This shaver does such a good job that this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the same model (the first was destroyed through no fault of its own).  It gives a close, smooth shave without taking a chunk out of your face or your wallet.  The cleaning cycle is a bit loud, so I would avoid running it anywhere near a sleeping human, and the cleaning fluid cartridges can be hard to find in stores.  That&#x27;s another job for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas Gift for my younger brother.  He went to use it this morning and the base was full of water?!? It has a self cleaning feature and apparently it died during it.</li>
    <li> So far this shaver has been pretty awesome for me. It doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as with a blade (of course) but it comes pretty close. You must make sure that you replace the blades frequently and keep it clean though or it will too a pretty poor job.</li>
    <li> This is great, I use it daily.</li>
    <li> The razor quit after 8 months of use. It will not charge or work with charger hooked up. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Do not order, useless shaving machine, and box is too complicated and too big to pack back and return, also you have keep spending money for blades too often.</li>
    <li> Its the best advantage is it implement high speed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I love it. It will hold a charge for several weeks and has a lock for traveling to prevent any accidental battery drain. The washing station is a very nice feature. The razor works great when dry shaving in a hurry and cuts perfectly when used in the shower. I am very impressed. Purchasing on Amazon saved me $60 over the cost for this item at Best Buy. I am very pleased with this razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Braun shaver that was still working but they cheapened down the replacement blades so much that they wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 3 or 4 months instead of the 18 months that they claimed. I got tired of spending $30 on new blades and foil every 3 months and so I finally switched to the Panasonic and after using it for a couple of months I&#x27;m happy with how it performs. Of course it remains to be seen if the blades last for the year that they claim they will. The cleaning system on this one works better than the Braun system and last longer as it&#x27;s not alcohol but water based and the detergent cartridges are a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I actually returned because my husband didn&#x27;t think it worked very well. Took more time than just shaving with a razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun and Norelco electrics in the past, and been relatively unimpressed by their quality.  When my Braun finally stopped working a year ago, I immediately started looking at new shavers.  Initially, I was fairly unimpressed by the options, but I found Panasonic Arc 3 razors in a big box store, and decided to check out what reviewers were saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering my options, I finally opted to pick up ES-LT71-S here on Amazon.  I was off work for a week, so I choose to grow out my beard to give it a real test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the box, I noted that the cleaning system was larger than I expected, but sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to gauge just how big something will be.  I continued opening the package and read the instructions that came with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the razor, I gave it a real test on a 9 day beard.  I was pleasantly surprised, the shaver cut cleanly, no tugging, and no significant burn, even though I was shaving Dry, yes, DRY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that first shave, I filled the water tank, and inserted the vortex cartridge.  I placed the shaver back in the cleaning system and selected the clean and dry cycle.  It took a few moments to start, but once it began, it was easy to tell what the cycles were.  It would buzz for a while to clean the clippings out.  Then the fan would kick in for a little while, and the cycle repeated multiple times.  Once the cycles stopped, I checked the shaver to see just how clean the system could get the shaver.  To my surprise, there were no signs of clippings anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find any fault with the shaver, the cleaner, or the foil.  However, I have only been using the shaver for a few weeks, so I&#x27;ll hold off on giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of foil shavers ever since my first Braun in the 80&#x27;s. After three great Brauns, I moved up to a Grundig in the 90&#x27;s. That became my favorite for the next 10+ years. Toward the end, the Grundig battery got a little tired, so I tried the Panasonic ES8109S in 2009. This thing gave the same great shave as my old European shavers with the added benefit of being waterproof. The cleaning system by Panasonic is very economical compared to the competition. Unfortunately, my ES8109S started taking on water a couple months ago. The first indication was the condensation on the inside of the LCD display. Eventually, something inside shorted out and the shaver died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new shaver but the ES8109S was replaced with the ES-LT71-S. Fortunately, it&#x27;s almost exactly the same shaver. I hope the seals last longer on this one. It&#x27;s a really nice shaver. Comfortable and fast.</li>
    <li> This was much better at cutting my beard hair (which is like copper wire) compared to my $200 rotary razor.&lt;br /&gt;wet or dry, it works well. I got a much closer shave with this model.</li>
    <li> Sounds great, not clean shaven. Large, poor portability Bought regret it, some impulse, this razor is not for me，just so</li>
    <li> This is my first electrc razor.  This isn&#x27;t as close as a razor but does well.  It&#x27;s nice not have to go thru that morning ritual of shaving cream etc etc. the quality seems good, cleaning easy, durable, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> As advertised this product is good, I need to put some pressure for clean shave. I have been using traditional razor, I thought this would save some time but its not, in fact it took double the time. I got severe razor burn (may be my skin is allergic to it) after each use. I got cuts in the problem area (chin), I have returned it after trying couple of times, thought its may not for me!</li>
    <li> The quality of this item is very high with regard to build and aesthetic however I find the performance of the shave somewhat limited and have to touch up with manual razor. Good gift for someone new to electric shaving or with sensitive skin but in hindsight would opt for a philishave model due to having a much better experience.</li>
    <li> Shave softly and smoothly.super clean also it can refresh by itself.thats amazing.but it takes a little bit long time to take a shower by itself.anyway still worthy.</li>
    <li> We bought this electric shaver for my 95-year old father who had become frustrated with his old one.  We&#x27;ve purchased several other models over the past couple of years and he was unhappy with each one.  When this one went on sale, I decided to try one more model, and the good news is that so far he loves it.  We&#x27;re not using the cleaning system though -- for him it seems to be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  He just cleans the shaver manually and uses the charger plugged directly into the outlet without the cleaning system.  I don&#x27;t really care how he uses it -- at least he gets a very good shave and he&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> my husband for years has run late because of shaving and then when we are headed out the door he has to lit paper stuck on his face. This device has sped up his mornings, gives a nice clean smooth shaved and cleans itself with the push of a button he is very happy and so am I</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get a clean shave with this shaver, I have to go back and forth several times just to get most of it out, it&#x27;s becoming a chore to just use this. It also does not give a close enough shave, I can feel all the hair still no matter how many time I run the shaver over my face.</li>
    <li> My previous electric razor was Panasonic&#x27;s first 13,000 rpm, liner motor model, purchased about 10 years ago.  The battery finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been very pleased with that model, I decided to buy a new Panasonic, so the question was \\&quot;which one.\\&quot;  10 years later...not all that much has changed.  They&#x27;ve introduced self-cleaning chargers, and some models have 4 or 5 blades instead of the 3 on my old model.  I decided to stay in the $100 range, so purchased this model (ES-LT71-S) which is actually very similar to my old one.  Main differences compared to my previous model as far as I can tell are: the new blades have an \\&quot;arc\\&quot;, the head flexes, and this has the self-cleaning mode (press and hold the start button), the pop-up trimmer on the new one is small and intended only for sideburns (where on my old one it was larger and also intended to be used in conjunction with the foils for certain parts of the face) and this has a self-cleaning charger option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaves every bit as close and closer than my previous model...in a word: great.  I shave dry and it took my skin no time to adjust to this razor since it is similar enough to my previous one. I am a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; type of guy...I need to shave every morning for a clean look.  And on my old model, I needed to use the slide-up trimmer to get some of the hairs on my neck each morning.  On this one, no problem for the regular foils / blades by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the self-cleaning feature...I prefer to just clean it manually...very easy following the included instructions and literally takes about a minute.  I do use the charger to then dry the razor after cleaning.  The noise is similar to a lap top&#x27;s fan that is blowing full force.  Not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided against Panny&#x27;s 4 (and even 5) blade models because of the cost, and the fact that I have read that the 4 blade model has a very annoying, bright blinking LCD that stays blinking when fully charged.This has a much simpler display (what else do you need to see except the charge level?) and once charged, the display turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine that the 4 blade model shaves closer (maybe faster?), but I am 100% satisfied with the ES-LT71-S.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;m an extremely hairy man and my hair grows back super quick.  After shaving with this I have noticed my facial hairs take longer to grow back which means the shave is very close.  I have 1 question to other users:  How often should I use the self cleaning kit if I shave every day?</li>
    <li> Great shave, I wear a beard and mostly shave my neck and became tired if wetting down just to shave my neck with a blade razor. This works very well for me.</li>
    <li> A great buy for my dad. Panasonic has offered good, if not one of the best, electric shavers. ES-LT71 certainly is worth buying</li>
    <li> The shaver is quiet compared to other brands of shaver I have used and it does a nice job of shaving close. About the only negative thing I can say is it doesn&#x27;t do a great job with long whiskers, they just don&#x27;t seem to pass through the foil to be cut. The Braun shavers do a better job with long whiskers but in all other respects the Panasonic is better.</li>
    <li> THIS NEW SHAVER REPLACED A 10 YEAR OLD SIMILAR PANASONIC SHAVER. I PREFER THE OLD ONE. IT GIVES A BETTER SHAVE (CLOSER).</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my beard or facial hair. I am an African American and I get frustrated because all these products do not cater to me or my type of hair.</li>
    <li> My husband, who it a man of few words, stated that this is the best razor he has ever had.  This razors cleaning/charging system is much faster, less noisy and less expensive than his last one.  He said the shave is one of the smoothest and closest he has gotten from an electric razor.  He must really like it if he&#x27;s said this much about it!</li>
    <li> Have always been a Braun user... this has it beat tenfold! Close shave, quiet, lightweight, and can clean with any deteregent!</li>
    <li> I took the advise of others and purchased on size smaller in the waist fits great. Color as ordered. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Returned it do to the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work. My $25 shaver  shaves almost the same. No need to spend this much money a little difference.</li>
    <li> Works better than my old Braun Series S***. :P</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for several months now, generally shave 3-4 times a week.  I used it dry a few times and it did work good, but I typically use it in the shower for convenience.  When I first started using it I was a little disappointed since I came from shaving with a DE razor and was used to absolutely no stubble, but quite frankly I was tired of bleeding out sometimes from rushing a shave. While this of course does not get as smooth as a straight razor, it does get very close.  I don&#x27;t generally get any discomfort or razor burn unless I&#x27;m trying to shave way too fast or really digging in to my neck way too hard.  As long as I slow down a little and focus on merely reducing and not eliminating my facial hair then it works perfectly.  As a note, I have never actually used the base thing it comes with.  I just take the head off and rinse it out really well after using, and plug into the wall as needed, which isn&#x27;t very often.  I can usually get in 6-7 good shaves before I&#x27;m down at 40% and get it plugged in.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything to shave after serveral times&#x27; using. however, the cleaning process is too long and take too much energy. and it will charging after every cleaning.</li>
    <li> The best shaved I ever had</li>
    <li> Good, very like，Come to buy, the price is too cheap  Amazon, hope I can make such a lot。Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have tried many electric shavers and have had many different results. The power cord for my last shaver got accidentally thrown out so I decided to go back to the Gillette and  forget about electric versions. However, Amazon had this Panasonic on a heck of a deal and I could not resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged the power cord directly into the shaver and let it charge. I took a shower and then gave this shaver a try. I was really surprised at the results because most instructions say you have to use a shaver for a month or so for the shaver to become acquainted with your beard. Not in this case because this shaver quickly introduced itself to my beard and then proceeded to remove it quickly and smoothly. But as surprised as I was with this performance the best was yet to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the dozen or more electric shavers I have owned I never had one that would cut the hair just under my nostrils .I  always had to use one of those little nose hair things to finish the job. To my utter amazement this Panasonic gave me a complete shave including the area up close to the nostril area. I would give this more stars if it were possible. Best electric shaver  have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I stopped using an electric razor about ten years ago because it finally died.  I recently grew tired of buying razors and lathering up with shaving cream so I decided to transition back to the electric razor.  The Panasonic ES-LT71 is a great razor to use. I feel like I get a closer shave using this than I did with the old shaving cream and triple bladed razor I use to use.  Cleaning up the razor is easy too. Just rinse it off under hot water. You can also put a little soft hand soap on the foil while the razor is turned on to clean it up even more.  The included cradle also provides a cleaning, drying, and recharging function. The only complaint I have is that it seems to take longer to finish shaving than with a traditional razor but the shave is much smoother. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I still cannot get over the fact that I cannot use this while it&#x27;s charging!  I mean, what if I&#x27;m completely out of battery and I need to shave?  Why can&#x27;t I just plug it into an outlet and shave!  Seems common sense to me.  Also, cartridge failed very fast.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave, I won&#x27;t buy Panasonic again! a waste of money. The charge and wash station  not needed.</li>
    <li> I have not used the cleaning function yet but the shaver is very ergonomic and the shave it gives is superb.  No pulling or burning  just a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Love the razor. Works well in and out of the shower. Holds it charge for several days with light to moderate daily use and is easy to clean. It is also compact so it stores easily.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a special-of-the -day for my husband. He has been pleased with the shaver so far. Nice features and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> I Like the fact I can use it wet or dry. Gives a nice clean shave of head and face.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE FOR ITS QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;but I dont think the cleaning system is necessary. the shaver can clean itself and be charged without the dove.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most skin friendly shavers i have ever used. It removes the hair even better than any blade with no significant allergy. Just mild redness on the neck part. My skin is very sensitive btw</li>
    <li> I used to philips sense touch series. As we all know ,it have quite different shape like this.But eventually due to the promotion at black friday, the price is so attractive that I made the purchase. It turns out a good product ,making shaving a cozy thing</li>
    <li> I gave this to my father and he loved it, it is confortable, and easy to clean. Just keep in mind that the cleaning system need the solution to keep the shaver clean and lubricated.</li>
    <li> I had been going higher end when this one went on sale at a very attractive price, so I bought it on spec.  Guess what, it runs circles (for me) around the ones with bigger shave heads.  It&#x27;s more comfortable in my hand, and oh yeah, it gives me a much better shave.  My experience with Panasonic has not been great, the cleaner/charger units keep breaking, but they do make the best shavers in my opinion.  If you can get past the breaking part of this tale (this one being new hasn&#x27;t broken yet but give it some time) then this is the shaver for you!</li>
    <li> Love this shaver, light, effective, use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> It works great on the face, but it does not do well on the neck.  It does not clean up well on the neck and leaves behind a lot of stray hair.  You have to go over it many times to get it all to the point that you get razorburn or break out the manual blade.  What&#x27;s the point of a fairly expensive shaver when you still have to use your manual razor?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this Panasonic shaver.  It works pretty well.  Only con is that the filter get clogged pretty quickly.  I rinse the shaver head before cleaning it to get the majority of the hair out first.  Definitely not a deal breaker though. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I have had it for 30 days now and it seems to be working just like I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I am a dedicated blade shaver, but I like to shave with an electric razor a couple of times a week in order to minimize skin irritation. The ES-LT71-S delivers the closest shave I have ever experienced, from an electric razor, without applying any undo pressure to my skin or going over the same are multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely waited a couple of months to write this review, to make sure I continued to feel the same way about it as I did the very first time I used it, and I do. Over a period of 5 decades, I&#x27;ve owned every well-known name brand of electric razor, and most did a perfectly adequate job, but this Panasonic comes closer to a razor-quality shave than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are more expensive electrics out there, but I can&#x27;t imagine any shaving better than this one. A very good value for the price. Well-constructed, feels comfortable in the hand, and is relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> The reason why, I&#x27;m giving this product 3 star is because, It does not do a great job a shaving thicker hair, I used to have an old norelco that did a better job. I had this system for quite sometime now, since I have thicker hair, and grows pretty fast I found that it easier to just used it twice a day one a night and one in the morning that way it cuts down on time.  If you have thick hair prepare to spend a few minutes with it, as the system eventually heats up from rubbing against the skin,  With out using it at night, I have to spend longer amount of time shaving in the morning, It does a great job for your cheeks and flat areas on your face but the neck line is not that great, I recommend shaving with a razor for below the neck or under the chin,  If used twice a day it does a great job, by using twice a day it can cut down on time.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works pretty well also, although a far easier way to clean is by doing it yourself in the bathroom sink after using it.</li>
    <li> my husband loves his new electric shaver.  he had another Panasonic for about 10 yrs that needed an upgrade.  he loves his new one too!</li>
    <li> It may be just that the hair on my face isn&#x27;t ready for the electric razor, but it does a decent job. I do sometimes need to follow up for some stubborn hairs that I assume lay to flat for the razor to pick up. I had not used an electric razor due to razor burn and fear of bumps. It took about two weeks for my skin to adjust and I also used B&amp;C Skin Tight which works very well overall. The razor is about average noisy and louder when using the trimmer so you may wake the GF, wife or kids up but overall it seems to be a good quality product. My facial hair is slightly curly and straight mixed and I will continue to use this razor and hopefully figure out how to get those missed hairs.</li>
    <li> This an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with Panasonic wet/dry shavers for many years, and enjoy being able to shave in the shower.  This one is an advancement on the previous models I&#x27;ve used.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Over a year ago I bought a Philips Norelco 7310 from Amazon and after reading reviews I was happy to see that people were not having irritation with their skin after shaving so I went ahead with the purchase. After the first use, I was happy... two days after the initial shave I was experiencing heavy irritation and thought \\&quot;ahh maybe my skin needs to get used to it\\&quot;... I went in for the second shave and to my avail, booom... instant irritation. I was frustrated and dropped it in the sink and it broke the head off with the blades so not only did it irritate my skin but it also was cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I see this on sale via Lightning Deal on Black Friday and read reviews once again and figured if it ripped my face up like the last, I&#x27;d return it... Three shaves later, OH MAN NO IRRITATION! I would gladly pay the full asking price that it&#x27;s now on Amazon for.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver because my other unit croaked. I read a ton of reviews and wanted to go a bit cheaper so I grabbed this one and have been very pleased. It provides a fantastic shave, is very close and the cleaning device works well.</li>
    <li> It is good for me, and the sound when it runs is not so loud like noisy as discribed by other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
    <li> Great, close shave, dynamic pivoting head, and stylish look. The cleaning dock is also a great perk!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about this product is the process of cleaning wheb usin the dock. Although the dock manually cleans the razor, it takes about 45 minutes, which seems like a long time for a 8-10 minute shave. And during this cleaning time there is quite a stirring of noise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty solid product all in all. My Fiancé loves it!</li>
    <li> would not recomend !!!! ihave no tips i keeped it clean etc usrd before shave lotion plus dry skin . what else can i write</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and it was a complete waste of money.  This shaver left behind lots of beard hair.  It was far from a clean shave.  My husband has coarse hair that grows in multiple directions and this thing couldn&#x27;t handle it.  He used it daily for a week, hoping that after a few days he might be able to get a closer shave.  No luck.  We purchased a cheaper rotating shaver from another manufacture and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This shaber is a good machine because its functions are the required, the cleaning systems is a great option that save time to me.</li>
    <li> I love Panasonic&#x27;s wet and dry shavers. The wet shaves are closer and smoother than you can get with any blade. I also love the charging/cleaning stand. This is a great razor. I use it in the shower and run it through its cleaning cycle every 4 days. It always keeps my beard smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have owned.  Most razors that have a cleaning system require you to use only their cleaning solution.  This razor allows you to clean it using just liquid soap and water if you want.  This saves on the cleaning solution.  Plus, the cleaning system has a feature that allows you to dry the razor instead of having to go through the entire cleaning cycle.  The razor cuts really smooth and does a great job on my skin.  I have never gotten a rash from having to get used to it.  This razor was on sale when I bought it, so the overall value was tremendous to me.  I really love this razor and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used several electric razors over many years. This is the best one I have ever owned. My facial hair grows quickly. I need to shave 2X a day. I have tried all styles of rotary/straight etc. My last was a Braun series 5. This is a much better and closer shave for me. This cuts through the thick hairs easily. I never considered Panasonic until I saw this in a promotion and read several positive reviews. The included automatic charger/cleaner works well. I have only used this as a dry shaver so far. But it can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - close shave, charges quick..husband loves it !&lt;br /&gt;Nice and quiet so he does not  wake me up!!</li>
    <li> I shave my face and scalp every day. My old Braun wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore even with a new head. Did some research on good scalp shavers and this Panasonic got mentioned frequently. What a revelation! Closest shave I have ever had. No contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I never used lather before with an electric, but tried it with this. I will never shave dry again. Bought this model with the self-cleaning base. I&#x27;m happy I did, but it&#x27;s a convenience, not a necessity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  After using this razor, his face felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  He has tried, many, many, razors, but this is the best by far.  It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I t dose not give a good shave!!!  I am going back to my razor ..  I GUESS I CAN SAY THAT  I ALSO HATE IT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> So far I really like this shaver.  The cleaning system is pretty neat and so far seems to actually do what its touted to do.  The shaver is definitely water proof as I have used in the shower several times now.  It does a pretty good job of giving a close shave though to get that &#x27;razor close&#x27; feeling I have to do a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you should know when using, to get the best shave with this you need to hold it so it points straight in as you shave, if you hold at an angle it doesn&#x27;t shave near as well.  (but straight in very good for an electric in my opinion)</li>
    <li> Works very, very well, but as with all electric shavers a quick shave with an ordinary razor helps the Panasonic provide an irritation free, close shave especially when used in the shower. My only complaint is that the base when in cleaning mode will switch to charging automatically once the hour and forty minutes of drying time is up and I do believe in letting the battery discharge a bit.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great &amp; will give you an smooth shave every time. I recommend this for African-American men especially.</li>
    <li> It is good shaver and I previously gave it 5-stars. However, now I change it to 2-stars.  The trimmers is small and does a marginal job. Also the cleaner is inefficient and often fails to dry the shaver completely.  My shaver in less than two years is unable to charge itself and no longer functional.  My previous Braun Shaver is still working after 9 years.  I also have two Phillips Norelco Shavers that still are alive at 12 years.  Panasonic did good shave as long as it worked.</li>
    <li> I had an old Panasonic wet/dry shaver that finally quit running after about ten years. This replacement works very well, shaves close, and is a pleasure to use. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> At the end of the Amazon do activities to buy, good shape, very cost-effective, that is, the noise is relatively large, shaving cleanliness also need to strengthen the overall still good a razor.</li>
    <li> This item replaces my 10 year old Braun 8595 electric razor which the battery was dying . Wanted a rechargeable that was wet or dry and Braun charges a fortune for theirs. Considered Norelco but had the three head razor and didnt care for it. Anyhow this razor is very good all around. Shaves close dry or wet. Does a better job wet though, easy to use and clean with or without the cleaning system. The unit is quieter than the Braun in operation and the cleaning system use. I&#x27;m a big fan of Panasonic products as they rarely disappoint, work as advertised and remain affordable.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver compared to the rotary shavers I have had. I have used it about 5 times, but have not tried the cleaning machine. The cleaning machine/process seems more complicated then I expected and it says to not use it in the bathroom, which is a small problem to me. I have not found a suitable place to set it up outside the bathroom yet. I wanted to try it and see if I liked it first.</li>
    <li> This thing pulses so fast, you don&#x27;t feel a thing! I didn&#x27;t know an electric shaver could give such a close shave. The build quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> So I got this to speed up my morning routine. I ended up wanting to use the trimmer more often than the actual shaving head. Now I realize that this isn&#x27;t a dedicated trimmer, but when you just open it up and use it all of your hairs get pulled out. After fiddling with it for a little bit, if you push up on the lever while shaving it actually works really well which is why I haven&#x27;t returned it. I see other reviewers have had trouble with the trimmer as well, so try pushing up on the black bit if it&#x27;s not working for you.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my son.  He said it is a good shaver, likes the self cleaning, keeps a decent charge.  My son has average to light beard growth, so he is not an every day shaver.</li>
    <li> Close shave for sure and the clean function is great. The cleaner is a bit noisy, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to run it at night, but otherwise works great</li>
    <li> This is dad&#x27;s gift, he is very like it, he is very happy! thanks!&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++++&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc 3 Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning System</li>
    <li> I bought this 6 months ago and it&#x27;s been reliable so far. The manufacturer claims that if you use it for 6 months the shave will improve. Sorry, but it&#x27;s no better now that it was the first day I used it. That shave is adequate, but not as good as a razor (no surprises here). I do like the cleaner function in the charging stand. I&#x27;d call this an average electric shaver---but then it&#x27;s not that expensive either.</li>
    <li> Made a lot of noise, but didn&#x27;t shave as well as I had hoped. Always have been a big fan of Panasonic shavers - as they always outperform Norelco and Braun - but I think this one falls short in many respects. The shave was not as close as some of the shavers from the past. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard - but this required 3 passes to get most of the hair. Had high hopes - but let down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars for now because my husband has not yet complained about it. He does not use it everyday because during hockey season he grew a beard and decided to keep it, so he has just been using it for trimming. He did say that it works great for the trimming. Hope it lasts.    Updated 8/30/14: Husband still likes this razor, but he did say that he originally had problems with getting all the correct tabs off the cleaning cartridge and it overflowed and he believes it shorted out the lighted indicator screen. He also said the instruction manual that came with it really did not have complete instructions in it. He had to go online to figure out how to select whether is was doing a dry or wet clean.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I shave wet, wet with cream, and dry.  This shaver shaves well in each case.  Even when I let it go for a couple of days, the blades still trim down the longer hair and finish smooth.  Cleans up easy, and blades stay sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 2 years now.  Quickly charges.  I am still on the original blades, which probably do need to be replaced.  The trimmer works very well for sideburns, or long hard to get neck beard hair.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shaver. Said it is the best one he has ever owned! Ease of use, and cleaning abilities are great.</li>
    <li> Bought it thinking it would be much better then my Remington f -3800. Very disappointed because the inexpensive Remington  shaves better. Panasonic is much quieter, and appears to be well made, but doesn&#x27;t shave as well as Remington.</li>
    <li> I WAS A NORELCO SENSA TOUCH USER IN THE PAST BUT COULD NOT PURCHAS BLADES DUE TO BEING DISCONTINUED. I READ REVIEWS ON aMAZON FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT BRANDS AND DECIDED TO GO WITH THIS ONE. i WAS LOOKING FOR A RAZOR LIKE MY PREVIOUS ONE THAT ALLOWS ME TO SHAVE WET OR DRY AND THE PANASONIC FFIT THE BILL. I AM VERY PLEASED AFTER TWO SHAVES AND RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THE WET/DRY OPTION. THE CLEANING SYSTEM IS AWSOME AS WELL.</li>
    <li> good one for dialy shave with good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sutable for senstive skin note that i use dry shaving without foam</li>
    <li> The jury is still out. I&#x27;m converting from a triple header to this style. The instructions state it will take about 30 days to re-train my skin so I have to wait to see if it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I love it very much.I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> just ok. It&#x27;s hot on touching area while shaving. And the cleaning system is noisy.</li>
    <li> Great shave! This works better than any Norelco or Braun that I have owned. The cleaning base is a very nice addition but the cleaning cartridges are not available everywhere so be prepared to mail order them. It holds a charge for a very long time and it travels well. It still will not do a good job on a few days worth of growth though so it is not the end-all, be-all of shaves.</li>
    <li> Works great. After 50 years of using Norelco&#x27;s, it is nice to find a shaver that shaves close.</li>
    <li> Overall nice, easy-to-use shaver. Good deal if you catch it on sale. I&#x27;ve had this one for about a year now and it could really use a head replacement (costs about half the price of whole unit). Recommend buying but do compare with other shavers first. Seller (Amazon), shipping and price were very good.</li>
    <li> ugh its ok not more to say</li>
    <li> nice Shaver! It&#x27;s good for me.Shaver clear and comfortable.One full charging can hold on about two weeks. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> The unit has pleanty of power but the blades don&#x27;t cut the hair short. I use it for most of my beard then my Norelco finishes the job. It&#x27; oky.</li>
    <li> This razor is the closest shave of any electric razor I’ve used.  I wouldn’t recommend any I’ve owned but this one after 6 months is still sharp and doing the job.  This shaves your face to military standard as I’m using this in Afghanistan and love it.</li>
    <li> excellent! good stuff! But the 4 head one may be better. For normal use, this one is enough. I like it.</li>
    <li> Gave it an &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; as I gave as a gift and have not heard otherwise.</li>
    <li> It makes too much noise, not only during normal usage, but also during auto clean stage (and the auto clean and dry procedure took too much time than expected). To avoid the noise I have to place it in garage, and still, it wakes up my wife and baby one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the shaving, it&#x27;s just OK, no better than a $55 Philips shaver I used before.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Fast cutting speed and a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I get about 10 to 12 shaves per charge.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the self cleaning/charging holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Cannot shave with the cord plugged in, but it charges in about an hour.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun&#x27;s, Remington&#x27;s, and Norelco&#x27;s. This Lithium Ion battery holds a charge, blades cut close, and handles easily....Spectacular!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over a month.  Does a better job of shaving than my old Phillips.  The wet dry feature allows you to wet your face and shave or add shaving cream (it only takes a small amount to do the job).  I have only had to charge it on weekends; it still has lots of charge when I do this.  Most of the time I simply take off the head and rinse it clean.  Once a week I use the cleaning system.  I rinse it before I put it in the cleaner  (which also charges the shaver).</li>
    <li> This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had one 20+ years ago and didn&#x27;t like the results it provided at all. My conclusion after using the Panasonic for about a week now is that technology hasn&#x27;t advanced any in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this razor a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; for dry shaving and a &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; for wet shaving. I gave it a &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; overall because it appears to be exceptionally well made. It&#x27;s a high quality item that doesn&#x27;t shave very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a mediocre shave if I wet my face before shaving but I get a completely unsatisfactory result if I don&#x27;t wet my face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, lesson learned (again). I&#x27;m a blade guy.  :)</li>
    <li> It is the first electrical razor I bought. It works smoothly and the cleaning suit works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very useful and efficient in whiskers.</li>
    <li> Used a Braun for the last 8-10 years and really liked it until it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. For 69.99 deal of the day price, this turned out to be an outstanding replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband a month ago because he said he was having razor burns from using a regular razor.  So I did some research and decided on the Panasonic ES-LT71-S, it was on sale at the time as well so that was an added bonus.  So far he seems to like it a lot.  I asked him to write a review on it and here is what he said.  \\&quot;This electric shaver has met and exceeded my expectations.  My previous electric razor was not able to be used wet and it always left my face hot and raw.  Being able to use lather when using this razor has been great.  The shave is closer than with a dry electric razor and the comfort is great.  I was pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend this razor.\\&quot;  It comes with a charger/cleaning system.  You place the shaver into the cleaning system after each use and the fan inside the cleaning system turns on and dries the shaver.  The dryer stays on for about 30+ mins, it makes a fan noise which I find annoying but since I am not in the bathroom the whole time, it&#x27;s tolerable.  From reading the instructions, it appears the shaver needs to be cleaned once a month and the blades need to be replaced approximately once a year.  The blades are not very expensive so that is another positive consideration.  All in all, I am happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a wet shaver.</li>
    <li> To say that I was disappointed with this product would be an understatement. The razor simply failed to conform to some of the contours of my face, which meant I would need to shave over the same area repeatedly to have a close shave, leading to red, irritated and bloody skin. After every shave, my face would have dozens of cuts and be red from repeatedly shaving over the same area. I ultimately switched back to a manual razor for a faster, more comfortable shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a light amount of facial hair, this razor would probably work well for you. If you are like me, however, with a thick crop of fur, I would recommend something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m chinese!Do not like the products made in China.&lt;br /&gt;Product description clearly says: &amp;#34;Origin Japan&amp;#34;,Actually origin  is China!I feel cheated...</li>
    <li> Back in the day, circa 1968, my most prized possession, was my Panasonic 8-Track Car Stereo, now 45 years later, it&#x27;s my Panasonic Shaver with its Cleaning System. Panasonic has been a trusted name through out life. Bravo Dudes!</li>
    <li> I got a good  shave with this product. After the first two months,however, it would no longer hold a charge and it was too late to return or replace it. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Eexciting , it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my son for Christmas he loved it.</li>
    <li> i would return if i could. pullsl hair if your facial is even slightly longer. takes several passes to clean get rid of even stubble.</li>
    <li> You have to go over multiple times, in all short of directions. I was so excited to get the razor, Then I tried it out :(. You have to go over your face with it so much, trying to get all the hair off, that after words your face is sore, like a sunburn feeling. Maybe I got a lemon, but it don&#x27;t work good for me, and the amount of $ I wasted, sad.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with the Panasonic Electric Shaver.  It shaves close and quickly.  It maintains the charge for an unexpectedly long time.  I think I made a very good purchase.  I had considered getting some older shavers repaired but found I could purchase a newer and much improved one for less than the cost of repair of old ones.  I also added the replacement kit to assure that I would be able to keep the razor for an extended length of time should the design change and parts become difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronald B. Rea, Ph.D.</li>
    <li> Sofar sogood! fast trasition! good shaver</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver as I had an earlier model which I loved and used for several years. After about a month of use I have no complaints whatever with this product. My last shaver didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning unit so I&#x27;ve been used to manually cleaning the shaver myself and usually do so rather than use the base unit. However, about once a week I do allow the base to clean the shaver and as far as I can tell, it does a decent job. I will probably continue to do most of the cleaning myself as I don&#x27;t wish to purchase the replacement cleaning cartridges for the base very often. I believe that each of the cartridges is good for 15 cleanings so if I&#x27;m only using the cleaning base once a week, each cartridge should last about 3 months. That&#x27;s acceptable for this old miser. Anyway, I do use the base everyday to dry the shaver as you can opt to just dry rather than a full cleaning and drying cycle.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this shaver to anyone who is looking for a quality electric razor.</li>
    <li> A little plastic ish.&lt;br /&gt;Good results though.</li>
    <li> Clean~ but the nosie is too loud~</li>
    <li> But i dont know how it cleans itself, becuase when I put it in cleaning mode; it practically does nothing. What is the reservoir of water there for? Or the filter? Have no idea....</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaver.  Lots of power.  Smooth, yet tough on the ol&#x27; whiskeries.  It&#x27;s a breeze to keep clean.  You can use the detergent  cartridge (which mixes with the reservoir you fill with water) for easy, convenient clean/dry cycle automatically.  You might instead choose to run the tap and soap it--in case you don&#x27;t want to pay extra to replenish cartridges, at the cost of a little convenience.  My prior Braun shaver (which also had a similar automatic cleaning system) came with a brush to help &amp;#34;prepare&amp;#34; the shaver for cleaning.  At first, I missed having the brush.  I quickly got used to not using one with this Panasonic.  I just take the cover off, run a quick water over it while turning it on, like a quick-rinse.  Pop the top back on and into the base it goes, and press the Cycle button.  Viola.  It runs a clean and a DRY cycle.  Definitely worth the purchase.  I only which I had bought it much sooner!</li>
    <li> The Arc3 was worth the money, and I paid less than $80 for it, with the cleaning station. It doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my old 5822XL does, but has a better feel and a better trimmer that can handle my sideburns. It lasts forever on a full charge and cleans up easily. It&#x27;s not horribly loud but neither is it quiet. I&#x27;ve never used one, but to triple your expense on the Arc5 doesn&#x27;t seem like getting your money&#x27;s worth. Go with the Arc3 and enjoy the money you saved vs the Arc5.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and cleaning combination set. I clean my shaver every time the battery runs out and the cleaning solution keeps the blades and foil lubricated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good the only thing it lacks to the Braun 7 it&#x27;s not as sensitive on skin</li>
    <li> not to impressed.  It takes many passes to cut the days growth.  I thought it would do a better job.  Overall I would give it a passable grade but not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> very good razor, cuts cleanly and quickly, definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I shave my head and this is the best I&#x27;ve found for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Feeling good and try to re-purchase the quality products and excellent Hanun Dress</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years as the last one felt so rough on my skin I never went back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one worked well out of the box. Very gentle on the skin and gave a close shave like my razor. But the trick to not leaving hairs behind is to shave up and down in all directions a few times and maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the cleaner and probably won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s easier to simply wash it under water. But it makes a great charging station which I leave in the study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly to Australia.</li>
    <li> works  very  well.  nice  design,  fits well  in  the  hand,  smooth  running  not  too  loud,  good  features,  excellent  protective  plastic cover  for the  shaver top and screen,  handy  carrying  pouch.</li>
    <li> My husband say&#x27;s it is the best razor he has had so far!</li>
    <li> My Husband is More than Happy&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is pretty good as an everyday shaver. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for a month now. I don&#x27;t really understand why, but it does leave some spots, like on my neck, with lots of hairs that it just misses no matter how many times I go over it. For the majority of my face it is pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just shaved with a high-quality, manual razor for the first time since I got this in the mail. The manual razor leaves my face so much smoother than this Panasonic. I know the difference is just millimeters but the difference in feeling is large. I&#x27;ll keep using this electric razor on an everyday basis because it leaves my face a lot less irritated and it is a bit faster to shave as well. However I wish it was a little closer and was more thorough. Maybe that&#x27;s too much to ask for an electric, I just don&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have much experience with different electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the cleaning and charging station, although I wonder how necessary it is over just taking the cover off and rinsing it, which takes about five seconds. The cleaning cycle can also be very loud; I can hear it through the entire downstairs of my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good quality electric shaver that I am sure I will use for years almost daily, but I do wish it was a bit better.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband&#x27;s birthday. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed by its performance. It takes too long and it doesn&#x27;t do a close shave on most spots. If a regular shaver does a better job, that tells you something is wrong with this product. Also, I thought that the digital display does more than just showing 20, 40, and 60 minutes for charging and drying time. This electric shaver feels and looks cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaner actually performs quite well. It cleans and dries the shaver, but it also takes too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband. He is thrilled with it. He has had it for a year and it is still running strong. He can even use it in the shower and best of all, it cleans itself! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Might not be the best person to go by, but I&#x27;ve never purchased a electric razor that was more than $25. Decided to take the plunge on a &amp;#34;premier&amp;#34; model, and wow. Big difference. The shave is so close, comparable to a razor, but then again, I&#x27;m used to using my $25 model so...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is.  I can&#x27;t get a close shave.  When I press harder it just rips my face off.  It looks nice, feels nice, etc.  Just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I used a Braun for years and really liked it.  The trimmer on it broke so I bought this shaver to replace it. I like this even better than my old Braun.  It is light, easy to use and gives a very close shave. I don&#x27;t use this in the shower to avoid some of the problems I read about. I am very happy I bought this shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric razor that could replace the expensive blades I have been using. No electric razor has ever given me a satisfactory shave before, but this one does. It is not quite as close a shave, but is close enough. I have not had it long enough to say anything about durability and maintenance, but it is easy to clean and recharges quickly. If it lasts at least three years, I will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> Closer shave than the Braun I was using before i bought the Panasonic and half the price! Great shavers for the price</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shave.  It is the most complex/high tech shaver ever bought.  Love the self cleaning feature.  Does take a good amount of time.  Suggest turning cleaning on while at school to work.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s well and I really like the automatic cleaning function. Would recommend it as a good travel option as well</li>
    <li> Relatively affordable price, wore felt good, although the sea Amoy trouble, but pleasant shopping</li>
    <li> Totally，it works well，but it’s difficult to bear the noise</li>
    <li> Currently, I have tried this razor several times, and each time, I have allowed it to be at 100% charge and freshly cleaned/lubricated. I tend to shave every other day to every second day and this shaver does not cut it, literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver pulls quite a lot in the thicker areas and does not even trim my neck region. If I were to try to shave until all hair was gone, it would take 30+ minutes due to all the passes and cleaning I would have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried preshave lotion, hot water &amp; soap, shaving cream, wet, and dry shaves, however this shaver is not able to shave my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am sticking to the straight razor.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Used it for almost a month now and don&#x27;t have any complaints. No irritation or whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have always been a rotary blade shaver fan. I just did not see a reason to change. However after doing a considerable amount of research, I decided to give this shaver a try. I was amazed at the closeness of the shave! I will never go to a rotary shaver again.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of electrics, always with the hope that this one would work as promised and always disappointed. Well finally I got what I bargained for, this really delivers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He says it shaves smooth and clean. Its easy to use and easy to clean. He says it tops the 3 head rotarys.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product was as expected.  This is a great product I like the fact I can shave in the bath.  Also I like he self cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it said it was crafted to catch longer hairs as well as short ones. Also because was such a good deal in a daily deal. I have never really liked very many women&#x27;s razors. This razor does a great job, is quiet, easy to clean and the charge lasts for a long time. Very close shave and works great on my legs. Even in areas where I cant really see what I am doing. I would not have paid retail (close to 200) but at 75 it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Every couple of years over the decades I&#x27;ve decided to take advantage of Christmas bargains and switch to an electric shaver.  Just as regularly, I give them up after the 30 days it is recommended to use one before returning to blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now taking a blood thinner that makes a razor nick look like I&#x27;ve been in a fight.  Time to try an electric again, and triple heads don&#x27;t work on my increasingly-sagging neck.&lt;br /&gt;This works.  Acceptably close, very quick (multiple passes over the same area are not necessary), and the same results whether I shave &#x27;dry&#x27;, washed, or with pre-conditioners.  Just recharged it after nearly one month of usage, and it took less than two hours!  There is a funny cleaner device whose use is optional, and takes up a lot of room, so I don&#x27;t.  A squirt of liquid soap, a few seconds of &#x27;on&#x27; under running water, and it&#x27;s clean.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> i really like this product. only thing is you can&#x27;t get a clean line if you&#x27;re trying to style your mustache or beard. other than that its perfect</li>
    <li> Really expected a little more. Did not shave very close on neck. Rest of face was fine! Very cool cleaning setup.</li>
    <li> Great!!!! Easy to use and clean. Perfect for travel too.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Shaver is the Bentley of electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;It gets the smoothest possible shaves, in the shortest shave times.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Just press the clean/dry button for a perfect clean.&lt;br /&gt;Use the detergent tablet as recommended by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Toy will love the clean shaves and legendary quality of Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other shaver is even close to this product</li>
    <li> I had an old Remington razor and decided it was time to replace it. I thought my face just didn&#x27;t do well with electric razors, turns out it doesn&#x27;t do well with crappy electric razors. I don&#x27;t even have to use aftershave or Nivia like I used to with my old razor.</li>
    <li> Nice unit but had a difficult time with thin hair, hair that is matted down, or hair that is too thick to fit into the holes in the screen. That may just be a function of foil shavers, as opposed to rotary shavers. The unit is well designed. The charging display shows you five charging levels. The ability to shave dry or wet is great, as is the automatic cleaning system. It is really easy to clean, charges quickly, and has a travel lock. The Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor rotary shaver I am now trying takes 8 hours to charge, is more difficult to clean and seems to have a much weaker (but quieter) motor. This Panasonic shaver takes 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t had too much experience with electric shavers, and a rotary shaver would probably work better for me, I consider this Panasonic unit a design masterpiece.</li>
    <li> I have always used Philips shavers and thought this time I would try something different after reading all the reviews, however I am disappointed as it takes so much longer to shave and I ha e to work hard at it</li>
    <li> For a shaver this one is OK.  Shaving is quick and comfortable but not as close as a blade.  Can be used twice a day without discomfort to the face.</li>
    <li> I really love this shaver. It gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver. It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable, and easy to use. I like the fact that I can lock the head so that it doesn&#x27;t move around when I don&#x27;t need it to, and I love the cleaning device. The pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but I don&#x27;t use it too much anyway.</li>
    <li> It was a very good priced and I use it as gift to my son and as always Panasonic products are top rated</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for years due to them being too hard on my skin, this one is NOT like all the others, this is smooth, very smooth and reasonably close too but not as close as with a blade razor. It is easy to clean and then dry it in the accompaning dryer/charger.</li>
    <li> At this point, I can&#x27;t praise it enough...time will tell.  It replaced a top of the line Braun I&#x27;d been using for many years, and IMO the ES-LT71-S is a better razor all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BG&lt;br /&gt;Coloma, CA</li>
    <li> the heading says it all. it arrived quickly. works like it should. easy to clean. use it wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as advertized. This is my second eletric shaver and so far it is providing excellent shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans up easily. Recommend it to anyone needing a great shave.</li>
    <li> It is what I feel after trying it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recomend it to a family member.&lt;br /&gt;In general reasonable.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver power is very strong, but is also louder than a large, clean barrel works well to clean the Shaver</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a satisfactory experience with the Panasonic 8109 model.  I have a very very tough beard and I used to wear shavers out in 3 months.  The Panasonics for around $100 will last me up to a year if I replace the blades and screen at least once.  My girlfriend says they provide a nice smooth skin and she is the best one to judge that.  So I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my hubby because old one needed a part replacement that costed almost as much as a new one so I got Panasonic ES-LT71-S. He loved it: so easy to use and so forgiving on skin, no more red spots of irritated skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really liked it and for the price is a great product. Not effective for the hair on the neck but all in all a great shaver :)</li>
    <li> Works Great, Never had any problems. My skin is sensitive and I never had one break out . The best way to use it is in the shower with gel if you want the closest shave. It&#x27;s as close to using a straight razor you can get. I love mine and I&#x27;m pretty sure you will too. The cleaning system is great, i don&#x27;t always use the cleaning cycle but i do always use the dry cycle to get the water off the blades after every use. If you do that it will also help the life of your blades. I would run your cleaning cycle once a week. Hope it helps Good Luck</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005DKKBUG Panasonic ES-LT71-S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade(Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;This shaver shaves your beard and not your skin. Charges from dead to 100% within one hour. Has indicator to show the amount of charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sending my THIRD WAHL [[ASIN:B0058SY1XG Wahl 9880-100 Lithium Ion Triple Play Shaver and Trimmer]]shaver back because the rotary cutters fell off the shaver and disassembled themselves on the floor - I gave up and bought the panasonic. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAVER</li>
    <li> Was looking to either get this or the es8234a. I preferred to only have 3 blades as the es234a has reviews that suggested the large 4 blade head made shaving the neck and top lip difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am so glad I got this razor.  Ive only had 2 electric razors in the past as i always had to finish the job with a manual razor to remove remaining hairs.  I cannot believe how close this blade shaves.  There is no need to touch up any missed spots at all.</li>
    <li> Works great!! As close as my Gillette razors. . Lasts long too. I would recommend this to everyone I Know.</li>
    <li> Shaves very close to the skin, much closer than my old Norelco rotary one. I don&#x27;t care much for the cleaner unit that comes with it though - I&#x27;m guessing most people just use it to charge the shaver. Cleaning is very easy to do right after the shave, and the unit requires some proprietary cleaning cartridges anyway (that end up going moldy if not taken out for a while).</li>
    <li> My Panasonic is the best</li>
    <li> The perfomance is not good, the sensation of the court is bad. I dont recomende this product, why expectative about it, terrible</li>
    <li> My main complaint about this shaver is that it can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s recharging.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I&#x27;m writing this review with my face half shaved while i wait for it to charge enough to finish (fortunately it only takes about 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I like it. Notice that I bought during a black friday deal and for $100 I got replacement head and 2 extra cleaning cartridges. (The current full price for that would be about $250. For that price I don&#x27;t know if I would give the same score...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts very well. The first couple of weeks it was quite painful but not because of the skin adjustment, but rather for hand adjustment. I was using the same movements as my previous shaver, and the result wasn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;I still have some difficulty on my chin, my previous cheaper shaver didn&#x27;t cut as deep as this one, but was better on round edges like the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is also nice, I was diffident but it&#x27;s kinda ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read the reviews about people saying this shaver does not cut well, and you are worried as I was, don&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect they are from people that never used an electric shaver before.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my dad for Christmas, and he LOVES it.  And he&#x27;s a hairy guy.  :o)</li>
    <li> This is an updated version of Panasonic ES8109 which is retailing in Amazon for $300 plus dollars and I got this with a $20.00 coupon so I paid less for the sale price of $89.99.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I think I will like it the same thing as my old Panasonic 8109 and the cleaning system is the same except for the wording charge change into course.</li>
    <li> Although my husband does use this razor often he still sometimes uses a blade. I had hoped it would be sufficient so that wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
    <li> I loved using razors and a friend told me to try this.  I love it and will not go back.</li>
    <li> First Pnasonic shaver and finally get my old Phillips retired.&lt;br /&gt;Battery charging is very fast but the running sound is a little bit loud.</li>
    <li> Gives a really good shave. Very smooth and very comfortable. I still haven&#x27;t figured out what the cleaning system actually does.</li>
    <li> Not the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used, but get&#x27;s the job done. The beard trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
    <li> Never owned a $200 shaver. I always bought a $99 razor for $60. Well now I bought a $200 razor for $60 LOL. Much better.&lt;br /&gt;Quick charge and close shave wet or dry. It&#x27;s smooth close and painless. This is truly the way to go. Hum, makes me wonder what a $300 razor for $60 will do for you.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 4 years later&lt;br /&gt;It died&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10 months later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still great, heads wore out. $22 for new heads. Thats typicle. I use a Gillett non electric razor from time to time so these heads seem to be good for 6-8 months. However this makes electric razor shaving as expensive as using the non electric razor.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by someone who thought it was the best shaver he had tried. I haven&#x27;t tried that many but it works much better than my old one. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He is very pleased with it. It is quiet and shaves great.</li>
    <li> very good product,I think have one is a good choice!</li>
    <li> I really like it. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why the cleaning mechanism doesn&#x27;t work which is why I bought this product since it comes with the cleaner and charging stand.</li>
    <li> good,my husband like it.</li>
    <li> not as close shave as I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two previous Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers over the past many years, and always been completely satisfied.  When I saw this one on sale for $75 on Amazon I grabbed it.  It&#x27;s lighter and gives a better shave than my last one.  My one complaint is that they no longer use the induction charger.  The charger now is a plug-in.  It&#x27;s a little smaller and lighter than the induction charger I had before, but you have to be very careful about using it in the bathroom, because it&#x27;s not protected against water.  The instructions actually say not to charge the shaver in the bathroom, but I suspect very few people are going to pay attention to that, I certainly don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a large device intended to clean it (and charge it at the same time).  I haven&#x27;t used that yet, may try it out in a few months.  It&#x27;s too large to take on trips, though.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this shaver considering all the good reviews. I know not all beards are the same. This shaver may work for some but not others. Case in point I have an old Braun shaver that still gives me a better shave than this Panasonic. The only reason I&#x27;m replacing the Braun is because it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m have always used razor blades to shave.  My preference were the disposable razors from Gillette.  When I ran out of the large package of these razors I bought at Sams some 10 years I was looking at another $40 purchase of  razors when I came upon this electric razor at a very reasonable price.  So I added a few more dollars to the $40 I was going to spend on razors to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic warns that you have to use an electric razor for awhile to let your beard become accustomed to it.  I have found that to be true.  The shave I now get after more than a month of use is comparable with the razor shave before.  I particularly like the side burn trimmer and the battery charge meter.  Since this is the only electric razor I have used  I have no basis for comparison with other electric razors.  But I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this one. It is very comfortable shaving. Good looking too. But I return it just because the big noise. I bought another Braun one. It is very bad product compare with this one.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t heard yet how he likes this razor, but he was very excited to receive it. his first electric razor</li>
    <li> So far so good , no complaints . Smooth shave .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It is the first wet/dry razor he&#x27;s used that actually gives a nice, close shave! It recharges quickly, holds a charge for a long time, and cleans up well in the cleaner.  Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard.  When shaving dry, it leaves tuffs, much better when shaving wet. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my spouse for Christmas. He never liked electric shavers before, but he uses this one every day. He especially likes the pop out trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a smooth, close shave!  Brushed sillver in tone this Shaver has a very solid feel to it. I am VERY HAPPY with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Gives an excellent shave.  Maintains a charge well.  I&#x27;ve always likes Panasonic razors.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the cleaner yet though.</li>
    <li> The best razor thank you</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I gave it to my husband and it has been only a few weeks but he says he really likes it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have much faith in electric shavers before buying the ES-LT71-S. I&#x27;ve used the shaver daily since February 2014, today is March 17, 2015. I make sure to clean after each use and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I received the shaver in two days. It replaces another Panasonic razor that lasted almost three years. This razor cuts at a much faster rate than my old one. Very close shave, close to that of a disposable razor.  The cleaning base has a new function. You can wash the razor in water and place it in the cleaning base for drying and charging only. I aslo like the locking shave head. It was a fine improvement from my old Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and get red bumps if I shave with a metal razor so I tried this. It works great. I use it every morning. Keeps me looking fresh and skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated. Does take a week or so to get used to. Love the cleaning system because it uses water instead of alcohol. Charge lasts 2 weeks of needed.</li>
    <li> Works just fine and is very nice that you can use it in the shower.  Gives a decent shave and I expect the usual Panasonic reliability.</li>
    <li> Full of clean shaving is still pretty loud voice, a bit noisy, producing exquisite, feel good.thi is Worthy of the price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  The self cleaning makes it very easy to use.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My fiance had an older version of this razor and it broke, so he hasn&#x27;t been able to use it very much. He loves this one so much better than the old version! He says that it gets but closer and doesn&#x27;t take as long. He also loves being able to see the charge left in it, that way he doesn&#x27;t get caught halfway through his shave with dead battery. Also, you don&#x27;t need the whole cleaning unit in order to charge the razor, which saves a lot of space. Thankfully his old cleaning cartridges fit into this model, so no wasted money. Very nice!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it and ueses it both wed and dry.He couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Have yet to find an electric shaver that does as good a job as a regular razor. This one does a very decent job.</li>
    <li> Love the razor. I had a Braun that went out on me and after reading the reviews on this one I decided to save some money and try it out. It actually shaves closer than my old Braun. They cleaning staion works good also. They only complaint I have about it is the side burn trimmer does not work very well.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Provides a close, comfortable shave. Great value for the price because it also includes a sophisticated automatic cleaning/charging system.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he cannot stop telling me how awesome of a shaver it is. He would highly recommend this to all the guys out there.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He had never found a shaver that worked for him, but is very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> it is a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> Love my new Up grade shaver.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing shaver, especially at the sale price I picked it up for..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> For the past 25 years or so i have alternated between using a blade and a Norelco Rotary Shaver.  The problem I have had with the Norelco is that it irritates the skin at the base of my neck.  I have used the Panasonic shaver for about six days now and so far I have not noticed any irritation anywhere.  It shaves reasonably well, with no irritation, and the time it takes me to complete the process has been halved.</li>
    <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;This is a gift to someone else, he is very like&lt;br /&gt;The future will continue to buy related products</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for at least a year now, it&#x27;s my favorite shaver and it definitely beats any 3-circle style shaver head electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever tried. The cleaning station I don&#x27;t really use all that much for cleaning, but it is super convenient for charging. I just do the cleaning myself under the faucet.</li>
    <li> This amazing razor has only cut my neck ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;After getting used to it, it has not irritated or cut my skin ever again.&lt;br /&gt;After switching from a rotary Phillips razor, this is a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that might make people irritated however is how loud the cleaning system again.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody thinks I&#x27;m using a vibrator when it&#x27;s cleaning my razor. (lol)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas, after studying your reviews.  They were so helpful, and he is very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> This has been the best electric shaver I have ever owned. Dry shaving is great. Wet shaving is even better! I wet shave when doing it after a shower and the shave is almost as close as a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was becoming more sensitive to razor blades (I guess due to age), and I can&#x27;t hardly feel anything when shaving with this product. Dry shave is great as well when doing a quick shave in the mornings. Definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase. Outperforms the Norelco I had.  Works best with shave gel in shower as opposed to dry shave. As close as a razor except for the lower jaw line.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i had a foil razor that died after many years of use... i tried a rotary shaver and just wasnt happy with it...  I saw this deal around christmas and decided to pull the trigger and get it...  after two months of use i love it... it gives a very close shave with half the effort of the rotary shaver i was using... the model i got came with a cleaning base but i usually just manually clean the razor and use the drying feature of the base although i do once a week use the cleaning function on the base just to get what i missed... the cartridges are tiny compared to the old cleaning base i have so Im not sure how long it will last but i can always just keep manually cleaning it if replacing them gets to be too costly...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has great difficulty shaving.  He has tried several electric razors and many different blade razors.  All of them give him so much difficulty that he only shaves every 2-3 days.  This shaver is so good that he now shaves every day with little difficulty.  For people with tough and difficult beards, this shaver is fantastic.  He thanks me for the gift nearly every day.</li>
    <li> About me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin, especially in the neck area.  Was hesitant to try an electric shaver, however I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  Shaved for years with a traditional Gillette Fusion razor and gel shaving cream.  Got tired of having razor bumps and wet shaving everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) High quality Japanese product&lt;br /&gt;2) Very long battery life&lt;br /&gt;3) Cleaning and charging stand looks great and cleans the shaver very well; also charges the unit very quickly&lt;br /&gt;4) Provides a close shave that lasts&lt;br /&gt;5) 13,000 CPM motor ranks very close to the higher end Panasonic models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Expensive product; I bought this on sale for $124.00 CDN after I found a better price on NewEgg.ca and had Future Shop price match the product for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this shaver, I applied shaving cream to my face with water; this was a bad idea as I have very sensitive skin.  I later found out that this shaver works best for me when I use it to shave my face and neck dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful when you first use an electric shaver because it still cuts very close to your skin, which will increase your chances of getting cut.  Take your time and try it on your face dry before using it with shaving cream and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this shaver not only for it&#x27;s quality and performance, but also because using an electric shaver has been a blessing for me when compared to my experience with a razor and cream; razor burn does not occur so long as I am careful and take my time using this product in a dry state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver DOES miss some hairs, so you will have to go over certain parts of your face and neck at different angles to get the hairs that you&#x27;ve missed, however, it&#x27;s not too bad of an experience.  If this is a huge issue for you and you have lots of hair on your face, maybe you should try the models with 4 or more foils, I think that mightwork better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Panasonic Arc4 and the Arc3.  I think the Arc3 gives a better shave (both more comfortable and smooth).  I&#x27;m still fighting a few razor bumps but the results are promising.</li>
    <li> Up until I purchased this, I had been shaving with Phillips Norelco rotary shavers. I got this on sale for cyber Monday, and I&#x27;m glad I did. My whole face feels completely smooth after using this in the morning. When I used my rotary shaver, my face was still rough.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have used, in fact I love it so much I bought my son one.</li>
    <li> Loved this shaver while it still worked until about 4-5 months of use... I really like this style of shaver as opposed to the 3 circle electric shavers. Was extremely excited to get is because i have thinner facial hair and my skin gets irritated when i shave for too long using a traditional razor. With an electric I can shave every day without irritation and my skin gets pretty smooth. It&#x27;s waterproof so  I can still use shaving cream and run it in the shower if needed. The cleaning unit is only really good for a couple uses before it starts getting filled with nasty hairs/dead skin, and it is much easier to just remove the top cover and rinse it out. Were i to purchase again I would probably just get the razor itself without the cleaning unit and save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like i said, this worked amazingly until about 4-5 months of ownership when one of the little black clips that hold the screen cover on top of the shaver broke, leaving it loose. The gap between the vibrating blades and the screen made it basically unusable. I&#x27;d end up with pulled hairs and really patchy facial hair for the parts that it did shave. I loved this razor for the 4-5 months that I was able to use it, and would probably give it 4-5 stars if only it hadn&#x27;t broken so soon. I don&#x27;t think i will purchase another one because the price doesn&#x27;t justify only 4-5 months of use. I&#x27;ve gone back to traditional razors (dollar shave club) which is more affordable though i can only shave maybe 2x per week and even then i get irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rotary shavers for years, and saw this one on sale, so I decided to try it even though I&#x27;ve been partial to the rotary design. Partial to it no more! This shaver works better than I hoped, it shaves accurately and quickly...and better...than my rotary did, especially cutting around the outline of my beard, etc. The popup trimmer works great as well, making it easier to maintain an evenly defined trim.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and service</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. Gave decent shave on my cheeks, but not very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Along my neckline, it was very bad and left many patches. No matter what angle I tried, some patches wouldn&#x27;t get shaved.&lt;br /&gt;It was very tedious to try and get a good shave using this, so I didn&#x27;t end up using this very often. Will just throw it away.</li>
    <li> I like this product, no matter from the reputation and quality are in line with my request,I love it....thank you!</li>
    <li> And provided a lot of money to go to the barber they lead all the things you want to do yourself to the degree of smoothing, cleaning, charging is not a big problem should be easy to use and very practical %100</li>
    <li> Shaver was actually used and cleaning solution was missing. I believe someone bought it and exchanged the blades. I have had many electric shaver s before including Panasonics so I went out and bought new blades and cleaning solution and all was well. The seller credited me the costs of replacement blades and cleaning solution. In the end I was content.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for one star rating reflects the way I received the product. I had to remedy the issue myself with support from the seller.</li>
    <li> great razor works well</li>
    <li> Husband seems to like this razor, but he does use it with in the shower with shave gel.  It charges quickly and holds it charge for several days of use.</li>
    <li> clean better than i used</li>
    <li> Just as bad as any other electric shaver except expensive piece of junk does not even come close to a razor doesn&#x27;t cut tough beards</li>
    <li> After being tired of paying for razors I decided to buy a good electric razor. I have a beard so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but I like how close it shaves and that you can use it wet or dry. The trimmer is a bit awkward because I use it to trimmed my moustache and the razors head blocks some of my view when trimming but its manageable. The pivoting head is great to work around my neck and jaw as I shave up to my beard line. Nice unit.</li>
    <li> Great shaver; everything I was looking for in razor. Its right up there with the top brands. I would recommend to anyone that is interested in getting one.</li>
    <li> After buying a Panasonic Electric razor with a cleaning system over 5 years ago, I decided I should test out a new one and see how it works.  The cleaning system is very efficient (Although can be a bit loud at times) and the razor and its mobility are much improved from the previous model that I owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gets very close and the trimming option attached to the back side is very efficient and precise.  This is a great electric trimmer to buy and if it is anything like my last, it will last forever and keeps sharp for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to purchase extra shaving cartridges (for the cleaning system) as well as an extra blade for the trimmer just in case (they are very cheap here on amazon)</li>
    <li> Since there are so many reviews, I will focus on what I have not seen in other reviews and what I believe is the biggest design flaw in this product.  The shaver is fine, and I have no problems with it.  But if you&#x27;re buying this unit, it&#x27;s probably because you want the cleaning system, too, so be aware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase replaced an older Panasonic model where the razor was held in place by snapping into a piece that came over the top of the razor and cleaner.  I never had any problems with this setup, but Panasonic decided to make it simpler, by having a system where you just drop the razor in the cleaner, the razor leans *slightly* back, and cleaning starts at the press the button.  The problem with this is that without something holding the razor in place, it easily slips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the razor cleans itself, the cleaner activates the razors blades to shake off debris.  Unfortunately, while doing this, the razor very subtly moves itself out of place from the 3 metal contacts that it uses to charge and connect to the cleaner.  As it cleans, it goes through cycles of turning the blades on and off as it pumps water through, but since it loses contact, it will stop vibrating before it is supposed to and the razor doesn&#x27;t get fully cleaned -- or charged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; this by putting small items under the front of the cleaning system to make the razor lean back far enough so it can&#x27;t shake itself out of place, but this is a ridiculous fix.  I&#x27;ve used it for six months and there is no &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; period after which this works better.</li>
    <li> The charger and cleaning system are quite effective. The shaver itself seems to not want to cut even with a nice lather and I find I have to finish my shave with a disposable if I want a real close cut. I may be doing something wrong, but I doubt that.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe the savings I got on this shaver. I saved 50% from the price in the store I visited. It works exactly as described and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> As per the bfriend: Only used it a couple weeks so far; shaving is quick and smooth; pleasant surprise using this shaver...no nicks so far!</li>
    <li> He only shaves about 2 times a week and has never owned an electric razor. I bought this for Christmas because I was sick of buying disposals. He LOVES it and shaves more now! The cleaning unit is very easy to use and the blade gets close like he likes. The cleaning cartridges are not too expensive and I appreciate that. Highly recommend gift for your man.</li>
    <li> It is just great! thanks a lot! I would like to recommend my friends.I believe that they would like it.</li>
    <li> This shaver has several pro&#x27;s and no cons as far as I am concerned. The battery life on this razor is great. It easily lasts me 3 weeks in between needing to be charged. It works great, wet or dry and does not irritate my skin at all. The travel lock and pouch are little extra bonuses that help out a lot when you&#x27;re traveling frequently as well.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive electric razor I&#x27;ve owned, but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.  Mainly, it shaves quite well. (I previously used Norelco.) Battery life is very good - lasts up to a month btw charges for me. The feel is good, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oddest thing is the cleaning system, which must take up 80% of the instruction book.  It could only come from Japan. However, once you figure it out, it works well.  It makes a funny chirp/buzz sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take 1 star off for high price.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - TWO YEARS later.  I have now just replaced my first set of blades and the screen.  I am happy to report they work as well as the factory set, which is the main reason I switched from Braun, on the Braun the replacement cut my face because it was not the same blade as the one sold with the unit.  So after two years this unit is running well and the replacement blade/foil are working great.  Buy this razor!  UPDATE - Two months later:  Still loving this razor.  It works great gives me the shave I want and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or pull my hair like the Braun was.  The cleaning cartridge has finally wore out and needs changing.  My Braun cleaning cartridges would last about a month with 5 days of cleaning.  This cartridge lasted about two months - bonus.  Next bonus, the Panasonic cartridges are cheaper than the Braun and because you add the water to a reservoir the dry cartridge is much smaller to store.  Cheaper and smaller, who can ask for more!  Unless Panasonic screws up their replacement blades like Braun did I never plan on switching back.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original Post:  I have been using Braun shavers for about 15 years. I started with the 7526 and then when the batteries died I switched to an 8985. When I went to replace the blade on the 8985 I got the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; style blade that would hurt every time I shaved because it would pull my hair and not shave it well. I then found an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; style blade and as soon as I installed it my 8985 was back to normal. My screen recently got a larger hole in it and the razor started to pull my hair. So I went to order another of these blade and screen combo&#x27;s only to hear from other users they stopped selling the older style blade and have switched to the newer one that does not work for me. So I did some research and ended up buying this shaver instead.  About me:  I have sensitive skin I don&#x27;t have a thick beard I shave daily (dry) and I don&#x27;t get a heavy 5:00 shadow  This shaver is an AWESOME replacement for the Braun shavers for me.  I went ahead and got the cleaning system since I was used to how the Braun worked.  This system works great.  If you are like me you take one look at the cartridge and think &amp;#34;wow that is a lot smaller than the Braun how long will it last&amp;#34;.  The Panasonic is a concentrated cartridge and you add water to a reservoir in the back of the stand.  So you end up with about the same amount of liquid as the Braun but you provide the water.  Another person posted they didn&#x27;t know whether to charge all the time or run the battery down.  The manual says to charge all the time and you can&#x27;t overcharge it.  A big plus for US consumers is that you can replace the batteries so once they do wear out it is a user serviceable part unlike the Braun.  In the final analysis it does as good of a job as a Braun and does not hurt my sensitive skin or pull any hairs.  I bought this model because of price and the fact that some people complained the head on the higher end model was too big.  This model is definitely comparable to my Braun 8985 and works great.  If you need to switch because the newer style Braun blades hurt more than they help I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for less than 6 months.  Shaver works great, but the outer foil is so thin that a small hole caused cuts on my neck.  I&#x27;m now having to purchase a new outer foil as I cannot use if I do not want to bleed.  I expected higher quality from a shaver at this price.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a cheap one i bought from target. This product works great! Ive had it for 6 months and its still working like new. Its very easy to clean. The battery lasts for about 10-15 shaves. So if you only shave once a day then you only have to charge it about every 10 days. This means i dont have to worry about taking the charger if i go on vacation. Just charge it before you leave and youre set. The blades stay sharp for a very long time. After 6 months, they are still super sharp. The precision trimmer on the back also works very well. This product is definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> Better than my old Norelco in so many ways, but going &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; on portions of my face, causes it to catch a little. Lectric Shave helps.</li>
    <li> my husband just loves this shaver.  He said it well worth the money and an excellent buy.  He loves certain kind of shavers, this one was top of the line.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Good! package arrived today,so happy!</li>
    <li> My son loves his new electric shaver</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty great.  Bottom line, close shave like Mach 3 Turbo manual shaver, make sure to use Lectric Shave product (works great), not much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: Foam/gel shave, Lectric shave, and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the background, I&#x27;m coming from a Mach 3 Turbo manual shaver that I&#x27;ve used for the past half decade I think. The reason I made the move to electric? Sam&#x27;s Club stopped carrying my wholesale refills and any other option was costing me too much per refill. I&#x27;m one of those that has to shave every 3 days because I start getting too scruffy for work, mostly due to anytime before that causing irritation of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has a pretty basic feature set in comparison to other similar Panasonic shavers around the same price point. The feature that gravitated me towards this one was the lock power button, excellent for whenever I travel. I was also looking at the Braun products but their self cleaning system is known to leak, so Panasonic it was. This device was also good because the newer 3,4,5 blade shavers were a bit too much $$ for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was with only water in order to see how it worked. Result was a close shave, took a bit of time because I was getting used to the device, major problem was irritation in the neck area as it was a problem area for a close shave (I learned pulling the skin with your free hand greatly improves after much trial and error). I notice it is as close as my old Mach 3 Turbo as long as you do a few passes over the same areas. Also notice microscopic hair buildup on your face as you pass through (like a mix of micro hairs and water), easy fix is run a bit of water on your face and the machine, it&#x27;s back to shaving clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next shave will be with the use of gel to see if that will make a difference. I am also considering the Lectric(sp?) shave products as something to raise the follicles will help in a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze, and I now see why others note that the self cleaning system is not needed. A bit of soap, water, and it&#x27;s clean, especially easy with a cleaning mode and all. But of course, I&#x27;m lazy and OCD at the same time so I plan to use the self cleaner sparingly in order to conserve the refill liquid but I will dry and charge all the time after my personal cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review as I shave and I hope this product ultimately is perfect for me, as it is my new tech toy and it provides a great use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used my Gillette Shaving Gel, HORRIBLE! First it was a huge mess as I like to glide back and forth while shaving for a second pass through. Second I couldn&#x27;t see what hairs I missed in comparison to dry shave (Lectric Shave was best). Third there were clumps of hair which I didn&#x27;t notice until I was at work already. The gel/foam just doesn&#x27;t help and made it more cumbersome to shave, I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lectric Shave is the BEST![[ASIN:B0013NB7DW Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave with Soothing Green Tea Complex -- 7 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than a dry shave because you have a little bit of something on your face. Resulted in a closer shave, cut down shaving time due to not needing multiple pass through. I did end up cutting my neck for the first time but that&#x27;s due to pressing too firmly on my main problem area (hate my neck). Only gripe is hairs stuck onto my shaver while I was trying to clean it. I had to use the cleaner for the first time because of this, but of course that&#x27;s a Lectric Shave issue not Panasonic Shaver issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is currently in use, it is not loud, sounds like a mix of cleaning mode and the sound of gargling. It works decently. I think it does a better job than I could manually cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time being I will be keeping the shaver unless some unforeseen event occurs and I return it but it would only be for a higher class Panasonic Shaver with those fancy vibrating foils, I&#x27;m looking at you ES-LA93-K, but I think I&#x27;ll be just fine with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used  razor blades for 50 years I finally decided to try an electric razor. I&#x27;m thrilled with the shave I get and the speed in which it takes to achieve a great and smooth shave. I recommend Panasonic to anyone sick of lathering up on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Love the cleaning feature. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used blade razor for years. Panasonic is fast, easy, good close shave. Well priced at 69.99 on sale.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using braun shavers for years but this last one we bought was only about a year old and he has not been happy with it.  Based upon other reviews on Amazon, I bought him this shaver for Christmas and he LOVES it!!!  Very very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> .I have tried the shaver and I,am very disappointed in it,s shaving the face. I,ve had to go back to the plan old razer.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Shaves close and I like it.</li>
    <li> It does not shave  at all!</li>
    <li> even better than expected, amazing price</li>
    <li> Clean but very noise!</li>
    <li> This product is far superior than all others I have used.  In the past I have used Remington Flex 360 R-5130NB, Norelco Speed 8240XL, and the Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1255x.  I battled with ingrown hairs for years with all three of these shavers .  I thought the rotary was better than foil. But, I was so wrong.  I have been using the Panasonic Arc3 (ES-LT71-S) for three days now and all the ingrowns are gone and the skin at the neck area is smooth.  All those having the same problem I had, the ES-LT71-S is the product for you. Amazing results! Awesome! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND I REALLY LIKE THE CLEANING AND CHARGING SYSTEM,  EASY TO USE AND GREAT FOR STORING THE RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS THE OFF LOCK SWITCH IS GREAT FOR TRAVEL ON AIRLINES ( CAN&#x27;T TURN ON BY ACCIDENT )</li>
    <li> Most of my life I used a hand razor and shaving cream. The first time I tried this shaver, I wasn&#x27;t a fan. I&#x27;ve since learned that, for me, there&#x27;s an adjustment period. After a solid week of daily shaving, this became my preferred method. Had I reviewed this immediately after using it this would be a negative review. Keep that in mind if you are thinking of switching from an electric rotary shaver or non-electric hand held razor and don&#x27;t expect to be immediately wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From start to finish, this shaver gets the job done much faster than my old non-electric. One big reason is not having to first spread on shaving cream and heat up my blade under hot water. I&#x27;ve heard (read) others talk about the shave not being as close with an electric shaver, but that hasn&#x27;t been so in my case. The shave I get with this razor is every bit as close. I really like being able to grab this razor to shave while soaking in the tub or showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t buy this razer because of the price. There are many cheaper electric razors. While I&#x27;m still not thrilled about the price, I&#x27;m happy with my choice for more reasons than just performance. Besides being able to take it in the shower, the shaver&#x27;s cleaning cycle is awesome. I remember my dad&#x27;s electric razor and its funky high school gym shower smell. This Pansonic Arc 3 stays fresh smelling and new feeling. The soap cartridge lasts a couple of months and is easily replaced; the old one slides out and the new one pops right back in. 3 seconds, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I was able to justify this purchase is the availability of replacement parts, like the soap cartridges. It is recommended that the outer foil and inner blade be replaced at least every year to maintain the cutting edge. Panasonic has been making shavers of this design for years and, as far as I can tell, the foil and blades remain the same even when model numbers change. That&#x27;s great news because I feel secure that the inner workings of the shaver or cleaning system won&#x27;t become obsolete. I&#x27;m keeping this baby for a good decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides price, the only other issue I&#x27;ve had with this shaver is that I&#x27;ve had to twice replace the foil. Both times were my fault. The foil was damaged when I dropped the shaver once in the shower and once in the sink. I can&#x27;t blame the shaver because the handle is made well enough to be able to hold on to it even when wet. I&#x27;m a klutz, so be warned if you are one too.e shaver or cleaning system won&#x27;t become obsolete.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now. occasionally get razor burn from it. i get an extremely close shave by using this and a traditional razor in combination. on its own it tends to leave stubble on my neck area and i am not a heavy set guy so i would think it would be tight enough area to get closer then it does there. it also didnt seem to come with instruction pertaining to how often to change the cleaning solution for the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a closer and quieter shave than the rotary head shaver that I previously owned.  Found that it pays to spend a few more dollars for a better quality shaver.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave wet or dry. Easy to clean and to tear down and excellent battery life so far. I would definitely buy this model again.</li>
    <li> This shaver is much quieter than the older versions.  It gives a very close shave.  The weight is very good and it cleans well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various Panasonic wet/dry shavers for the past 15 years.  I switched to Norelco last time I needed a new shaver, but decided that for my sensitive skin, the Panasonics provide a smoother less irritating shave.  The only drawback of this razor is that it vibrates at such a fast speed, it splatters water all over the bathroom mirror when you rinse it in the sink and pull it back out to continue shaving.  I don&#x27;t remember this happening with older models.  They probably didn&#x27;t run at such a fast speed.  I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning piece yet.  It seems to take up a lot of counter space and it is very easy to just plug the charger cord into the bottom of the razor.  It charges very quickly.  Cleaning by rinsing in water after shaving works for me.  A great price on Amazon, plus I found a $15 rebate form on Panasonic&#x27;s website!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investment I put into a shaver. So clean. It comes with the clean jet which is really useful! This is especially good with little hair because it cuts little hair crisp and clean. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I have not tried an electric shaver in many years but I had hoped that they had improved over that time. Although I appreciate the fact that you can use it in the shower the bottom line is that it does not shave effectively, particularly on my neck. Even when my whiskers are very short i.e one or two days growth this shaver does not remove the whiskers on my neck. I am very disappointed in the product particularly given the many positive reviews I read...</li>
    <li> But it is very close to what we wanted and does seem to be as nice or nicer than what we originally purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Brand New works great!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality shaver that provides a shave almost as close as a blade. I use this exclusively for shaving now and am pleased that I no longer need to buy blades all of the time. The ES-LT71-S holds a charge for about two  weeks and the charge level indicator makes it easy to know when to re-charge. I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning station yet, but a rinse under running water seems to keep the shave clean enough. The built in trimmer works great too. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Work well.  Clean shave.  Like to clean regularly.  Features work well.  Would highly recommend for any man.  Get a good shave.</li>
    <li> it is a great product. and very handy to use. Smooth shave. nice finish. strong body. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used a variety of styles and brands of electric razor.  While my previous Norelco/Phillips rotary razor was still functional, it had never rendered what I&#x27;d call a close shave, and in fact I&#x27;d typically do a second shave when I got home from work (about 15 hours after the first shave) since I dislike the feel of stubble on my chin.  Based on the reviews here, I figured the ES 71 seemed to offer a good balance of performance and price.  I had no break-in period of skin irritation when using this razor, and in fact, the first few shaves seemed closer and left my skin even smoother than the subsequent ones have!  I like the &#x27;floating head&#x27; and by trial and error have found it works best to make a few extra passes with the razor over difficult areas like the neck and jawline after you are no longer hearing the sound of hairs being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to lock out the power supply to avoid inadvertent discharge during travel will be handy, but on a handful of occasions in six weeks of use I have somehow managed to toggle the lock on while using the razor.  It&#x27;s no big deal to remedy, but does give you a bit of a surprise when it happens.  I find myself getting about 2 1/2 weeks use out of a single battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the razor easy to clean on a daily basis by gently tapping the razor and side of the separated head against the edge of sink, and supplement this with running water weekly.  The special setting for high speed vibration for cleaning doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special-- in fact, less hair or water come off in that mode than if you simply turn the unit on without the top attached!  I haven&#x27;t ventured to use the wet cleaning system, since I don&#x27;t feel any special need for it and am somewhat dubious about cleanup and storage once the cleanser is installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: for me this has been a great razor, rendering closer shaves than any of the previous units I&#x27;ve used 40 years of daily (or even more frequent!) electric razor use since the 1970&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m already planning to get a set of replacement blades and screen in anticipation of using this razor for a long time.</li>
    <li> very good, this is just like what i was looking for. price is also balanced. i love it very much and i will tell all my friends about it .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice piece of machine....It takes the hair of, when you&#x27;re in a hurry. But, nothing beets the good old razor blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool looking. It&#x27;s quiet. It fits nicely in the hand. I also love the fact that I can use it in the shower with soap or shaving cream. BUT, no matter what I do, I cannot get the hairs to cut in a couple spots on my neck. I have to get my razor out and go over these areas once I&#x27;m done brutalizing my face. This ticks me off because the sole purpose of buying this razor was to get away from using razor blades. Perhaps one with four blades would do the trick, I don&#x27;t&#x27; know. Maybe Panasonic should stick to TV&#x27;s etc.&lt;br /&gt;Try a Braun..?</li>
    <li> This unit gives a very close shave. There was a slight learning curve coming from a Remington foil shaver. The holes in the foil are smaller on this unit and I have to go slower but the shave seems to be as close as a triple blade razor. I like the cleaning/charging station, I just drop it in to charge it and run the clean cycle once a week. A quick rinse in warm water after each shave keeps the clippings in the shaver head to a minimum and extends the life of the cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I think slightly larger holes in the foil would be better for people with thicker hair and would make it a little faster.</li>
    <li> Fantastic build quality. The best electric razor I have ever used by far. If you buy one, don&#x27;t forget that it has a super fast mode for rinsing clean with and you need to press and hold the power button for a couple seconds to activate it.</li>
    <li> My father loves his new shaver. It shaves really well the first go around, meaning that you don&#x27;t have to linger in one spot. It also is very easy to clean with some water and soap.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cleaner yet for the fear of mold build up and the possibility of shorting out any electrical components.  My only complaint about this shaver is the loud, high-pitched hum.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco shavers for 30 years, I purchased a Panasonic Foil Shaver.  Part of my reasoning was a protest against the high cost of replacement blades for the Norelco shavers.  In addition, I had the Norelco that used Nivea lubricating cream and when I went to order a new supply of this, the cost was $60+ for a box of three.  No way I was going to pay that price so now I am using the Panasonic.  I was immediately impressed with the ease of operation and the closeness of the shave.  It took no time to adust to a new shaving head.  It was quicker and closer than my old razor.  I was initially disappointed with how loud the new shaver sounded but again, it was an easy adjustment.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to replace their old Norelco.  I have not purchased new foil blades yet but I am sure they will not be more expensive than what I was paying.</li>
    <li> Bought this a month ago or so and so far so good. My husband loves it. He says that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like the conventional ones do.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve had a beard fro 27 years, but I&#x27;m shaving now, and I like it.  This thing is easy to deal with because it cleans itself in the charger.  It gives me a decent shave too.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LT71-S shaver is excellent.  I wish I had bought one a long time ago.  I have owned many shaver since I gave up blades a long time ago; this is the best I have encountered.  The other micro-screen shavers give me a rash, but due to the high vibration speed the Panasonic does not abrade the skin.  The rotary shaver don&#x27;t give me a rash but they are slow, don&#x27;t give a close shave and don&#x27;t handle bent or ingrowing beard well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a clean shave, almost like a blade, with great convenience when used dry.  I have not done the wet shave so I may have another treat waiting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a winner.  I&#x27;m not sure how much the more upscale models of Panasonic improves on this models performance, but I suspect the larger head will not do my facial contours as well- especially under the nose.</li>
    <li> I can say now there are some electric shavers that can give very close shave as the conventional shaving.I have this shaver for almost 2 months I feel so much better with great shaving experience. I have tried so many shavers and I can say this is the best shaver.</li>
    <li> good shaver and cleaner</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband back when we were dating, now we are happily married for almost 2 years. Guess I got good-girl-friend points for this purchase ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He still use this shaver and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I replaced a Norelco basic razor with this and love it.  So far, no problems, and am not anticipating any.</li>
    <li> neat， shave like breeze and clean, too. much better than my previous panasonic shaver. bought at 74.99. great buy. enjoying using it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  A nice price compared to other sellers.  Personally do not like the style as much as former shavers.</li>
    <li> I have been using high end Braun shavers for many years, This Panasonic gives me a significantly closer shave with many less passes, one or two versus 4 or 5. My beard is average, not particularly heavy so men with a heavy beard may get different results. My only complaint is the small trimmer, but I rarely use one anyways.</li>
    <li> Holy crap, I love this razor! It is so much better than the Braun and Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past. It cuts closer and never pulls. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a half year and my beard hair is super soft when it grows out a couple days. Panasonic is one of my favorite companies. I&#x27;ve only ever had one bad product from them.</li>
    <li> The quality and price of this shaver is great. It provides a close shave and is easy to clean and maintain. The only problem is the trimmer is crap quality.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for the every day shave. For people like myself, that have a full beard by 5 PM, it&#x27;s nice to have something that will actually get through some scruff in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m coming from another model, three headed senso-whatever. It NEVER got as close as this shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The cleaning base works very well, and you can tell the difference after you&#x27;ve cleaned it. It just shaves closer and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I find myself having to go over the same area multiple times. Even when shaving every morning. The neck is my biggest problem area, but I believe that&#x27;s likely the case with any shaver you&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br /&gt;It does get warm after what I feel is a relatively short time, but that&#x27;s likely unavoidable. It&#x27;s metal on metal so I guess it&#x27;s going to happen no matter what :)</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a great shave from day one. It doesn&#x27;t matter if wet or dry.  No irritation.  Best inversion I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> Very good. I like the cleaner and charging unit. Very convenient, just put in and forget. Nice and close shave especially after the cleaning.</li>
    <li> So goodCheap I like it.So cleanly.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a gift. He is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had to retire the electric I had for upwards of 8 years because replacement blades were getting increasingly hard to find. I read up on shavers that were good for sensitive skin and came across this model.  The feature I most valued was its dual wet/dry capability.  When I use this shaver wet with shave cream the shave is almost as close as a blade with much less irritation, which is key for me because I have sensitive skin.  After 2 months of use, this shaver has definitely lived up to expectations.</li>
    <li> Sitting in my bathroom corner. Tried every way. Read all online help and reviews. Watched youtube videos to make it work for me. Tried hard. Gave it a break and tried again. Nothing helped. Didn&#x27;t return in time. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES-LT71-S (Arc 3) Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning System......This is a great Shaver Package and very affordable compared to other similar systems &amp; looks great too....I may shave ever 2,3,4 days/My beard is averagely tough and this shaver works perfectly wet or dry is 100% water proof very powerful &amp; quiet, easy to remove foil cap/cleans sonically over running water, The on/off switch locks in place so you don&#x27;t accidently turn on shaver while traveling. The separate cleaning system is very quiet, smells good and runs through the clean cycle pretty fast, then dries &amp; charges so you&#x27;re ready for the next shave....Cleaning cartridges last longer than other brands....The Panasonic ES-LT71-S gives the perfect smooth fast shave...Feels great in the hand, is elegantly shaped but tough.....Thank you for a great shaver...!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice electric shaving system. Not noisy at all, actually very soft hum when charging and cleaning. Shaves like a charm.</li>
    <li> At 66 I gave the Panasonic ES-LT71-S one last try. I&#x27;ve tried many before and never got a close shave with an electric razor. But, with the return policy at Amazon I thought I give this one a go. And, happy I did. In less time than it takes to shave with a razor, I get just as close, if not closer shave with this razor. The cleaner is a nice extra, that I have had to use yet. But, a comfort knowing I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest any guy that is thinking about an electric shaver to give this one a try. Hay, if you don&#x27;t like it, go on and return it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ G.</li>
    <li> Its good but its sounds not good&lt;br /&gt;I dont care but somebody would dont like that&lt;br /&gt;Good good good good</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I had some reservations, but was tired of disposable razors. The price was right, so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that most of the concerns I had from other reviews weren&#x27;t as bad as indicated, or completely unfounded. The razor doesn&#x27;t vibrate off the charging posts during the cleaning cycle, not having to take the head apart manually and clean it after each shave is a big time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased and glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Wow this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I used have philips eletric shaver..&lt;br /&gt;But its trash... do not ever buy philips.&lt;br /&gt;I shave it with this panasonic shaver and less than 1min and done... perfect job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But philips shaver takes like 10mins to finish shavving. They do not know how to make it</li>
    <li> Excellent product at reasonable rate. Will recommend to friends &amp; family. Compares to my higher priced Braun I used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received many shavers as gifts (mainly Norelco) and just want to toss them in the garbage as soon as I take them out of the box. I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers in the past and loved them. Tried a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; Braun with a self cleaning rig like this one and paid plenty for it. I&#x27;d get up in the morning, shower, and shave. The shave always carried on into the car. Felt like a chick putting on makeup! So back to Panasonic. I took a look not even a week ago and while some less expensive models had positive results,  the negatives rang true. I saw one that was near $400.00 and had to laugh (although I&#x27;d love to try it).I appreciate the self cleaning models because it&#x27;s a safe place to put them in a small bathroom and I do like the feature. When this came up as a lighting deal AR $69.95 I went for it. I was prepared for the test as I didn&#x27;t shave since I ordered it. I love it! Yes I  love it, but not at $199.95 or whatever the list price is. Shaving is shaving so I  don&#x27;t think I  need to get into why it work right? Thanks Panasonic and Amazon for a great product and great shipping.</li>
    <li> it works... just not as efficiently as expected.  It&#x27;ll shave most of your face but it&#x27;ll leave a few stragglers around your neck and lower chin....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried various products (creams, gels, pre-shave, blah blah blah) without much benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep a razor handy to get at the stragglers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the razor. It doesn&#x27;t irratate my skin and gives me a smooth shave. If I miss a day it still shaves the longer hair - my previous razor would miss most of the longer hair. Had to use a safety razor. Love it.</li>
    <li> I opened package and charged unit. I then went to other end of 2300 Sq Ft and shaved and the noise was so bad I thought it was defective. It woke people that I was trying to be quiet for.</li>
    <li> Far closer shave than a Braun 6520 model I had been using.  Charge lasts close to two weeks is a big advantage too.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic wet/dry shavers for several years now and had to buy this because while traveling I left the same shaver at the hotel when I left.  I will just bottom line this and say these shavers are amazing and just get better and better.  Since using these shavers I have not cut myself once and I shave in the shower using liquid soap on my face.  I have fairly heavy beard and even after not shaving for three (3) days this shaves me smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  The nicest thing with this is the dock charger/cleaner which does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this shaver as I believe you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great shave,as good as razor!</li>
    <li> Great Razor. Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. GREAT PRICE and FAST DELIVERY.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave, charge last a fairly long time, only complaint it the trimmer is located such that it is hard to use and see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a whim when Amazon was running it on special. I really wanted to like it. I have pretty coarse facial hair and I can never get a clean cut with any electric razor, and unfortunately this is no exception. Does great on my face, but really suffers on the neck. I&#x27;ve tried using it wet and dry, and I get the same results. It misses 15-20% of the hair on my neck and throat, regardless of what angle I try. The razor actually seems to cut better when I use it dry versus wet. The good thing is the battery life is outstanding, and the charging/cleaning dock works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have never really liked electric razors but saw this at a good price on amazon in a &amp;#34;Lightning Deal&amp;#34; so I figured I would give it a shot.  It had fairly good reviews.  The usual problem with electric razors is getting a close shave without lots of skin irritation.  This one was no exception.  When dry shaving it wasn&#x27;t that bad but it did terrible when wet.  Decided to keep it for trimming, etc. but I&#x27;m likely going to be using my ol&#x27; Gillette Razor...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;As close as a blade&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;We hear that from other manufacturers but this is the first one that has actually delivered with my beard which could strip paint off of a car.  I have been using Braun for years after switching from Norelco.  Braun did a better job than Norelco but this Panasonic does much better than Braun.  It generally takes 2-3 weeks for your face to get used to a new shaver and get to the level of closeness they will attain but this one right out of the box shaved baby smooth.  This shaver is closest in functionality and style to Braun so I will compare the two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness - Panasonic cut much closer even comparing out of the box day-1 versus Braun after 3 weeks of getting used to it&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - Panasonic, even on my neck that tends to pull hairs there was zero discomfort and zero redness (and SMOOTH, which Braun could never do for my neck)&lt;br /&gt;Noise - about 20% less noise than Braun at a much higher pitch.  More like a loud mosquito versus the Braun which would be more like a quiet leaf blower.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Panasonic uses smaller cartridges with a concentrate and a container for tap water versus the large Braun cartridges which tended to evaporate before the full month of use.  The cleaning cycle is 20% less noisy than Braun&lt;br /&gt;Cost - I would compare this by style and functionality to the Braun that costs $40 more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - would buy again and tell my friends to do the same.  I had my doubts about buying it (Panasonic makes TVs, right?) but I am very happy with my purchase.  I love their TVs and they obviously put the same amount of care in their shavers.</li>
    <li> I would rate this shaver 5 stars except for 1- you can&#x27;t use with cord plugged in when battery is low, 2- the head is so wide it&#x27;s very tough to shave around a mustache/beard and your nose.  (I typically grow a short beard during the winter &amp; shave it off in spring.)&lt;br /&gt;Those two issues aside, I have sensitive skin and have always had probs shaving my neck but this shaver is excellent in that area.  I started out using very little pressure in order to get used to it, especially since I was returning to a foil-type razor after using a Norelco floating head razor for the last three-four years.  This razor is FAR superior to a floating head for me.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I would also add that the pop up trimmer is very small/narrow, &amp; may not really be a problem as it works well, but FYI.</li>
    <li> Am very happy with the shaver. Its my first electric shaver, and hence cant compare to a rotary device. However, this one does work quite well for me, except that it has some minor issues working with some areas of my neck. Needs just a little extra effort in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning unit had some issues though, and started up with some error codes, and when I did get it working eventually, it conked out on the first use, and is back to showing me an error code. I dont intend on using the self-cleaning unit anyways, and am too lazy to return this piece. But again, because I was not planning on using it much, am still giving this item 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Replacing a Braun that I lost the cord to. Change is always hard but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this razor. Only quibble is that it&#x27;s a higher pitch than my Braun when in use. Oh noes! The horror!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who says it works wonderfully and is the best razor he has ever had. He also loves the cleaning function.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s great machine. Shaves well and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Attached cleaner was  little overkill.Takes up the space in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver and love it.This is my second panasonic shaver of the same style. The first one lasted 6 years of everyday use with a needed change of blades and foiles which are also readily available on Amazon. Icould not be more pleased.Lots of shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I have hesitated to move over to a electric shaver because I was fairly disappointed with a Philips shaver that I used years ago. I started to look at this shaver when it was put up as a Gold Box deal (which I missed cause I was reading the many shaver reviews from all the big brands i.e. Philips, Panasonic and Braun. I decided that the Panasonic was the way to go because they provided the most value for money, had great reviews on how they performed and the design appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;I considered the 4 head and 5 head models but was concerned that the head would be too big for when I shaved my upper lip area as voiced as a concern by a reviewer. Also, the 4 head did not seem to have any real improvement in closeness of shave or performance when compared to the 3 head. There are certainly hardware differences but if these do not translate to a better shave, it is not worth the extra money for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it solely for 1 week now and I am amazed. I did not have any irritation at all and the shave has been very close. The battery on the unit is amazing and it is still at 100% after 1 week of use. I use it with Gillete gel foam and despite that cleaning is very easy. I have yet to install the cleaning station and have been flushing it with water after removing the foil from the head and leaving it to dry. I have not had to use my manual razor to fix any areas.... BTW, the unit charges without the base station, All you have to do is to connect the power cord directly to the unit. Useful for travel!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase although I paid more than the Gold Box deal that I missed. It seems unlikely that I will move back to a manual shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed as it was my first online personal gift to my husband for my anniversary. The Panasonic does not help  in shaving as perfectly as the non-electric shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it. Just am too busy with Christmas!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I am skeptical in recommending anything online..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Regards&lt;br /&gt;Asha</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my old braun 3 series shaver.  Perhaps not a fair comparison, but there are a few things I like much better.  This unit has a Lithium battery, so the shaver works as well toward the end of the charge as it does when first charged.  The Braun had NiCD so it got slower and slower as the charge depleted.  You knew it needed charged when it started tugging your beard instead of cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I was concerned about the soap and water cleansing compared to the braun alcohol cleansing.  I&#x27;ve only cleaned it once, but the soap and water seems to do a better job, much less mess inside the unit.  With the braun, I had been rinsing the unit in hot water to clean the oily residue and then let it dry before using the cleaning unit.  This works fine without the pre-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (and it&#x27;s very minor) it is smaller and feels more fragile than the braun.  The braun feels like a solid brick in your hand, this feels more like a piece of art.  Makes me wonder if it will last.</li>
    <li> Sooo Good! No more red marks on my neck.It just glides! Very easy to clean and store.It&#x27;s the best I ever had,GET IT.</li>
    <li> My husband asked for this for Christmas. It arrived promptly- in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;My husband says it works really well. He was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I went from a Norelco floating head rotary razor to this Panasonic foil razor. They are different, but I&#x27;m not sure I would call one better than the other. I would say that the Panasonic probably gives a slightly closer shave and gets some places like the upper lip a little better than the Norelco. I also personally find it slightly less irritating to my neck which for me is extra sensitive and it trims sideburns better since it has a straght blade. However the flip side is I find it doesn&#x27;t contain all the stubble dust in the shaver head. If I shave after I am dressed it leaves dust on the front of my shirt that has to be brushed off. It also does not do as well as the Norelco shaving my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the differences in performance mostly come down to the differences in the way the two types function. The Norelco cuts in circular patterns and you use a circular pattern when you are shaving with it, so it catches stubble from multiple directions, with and against the grain. In addition the floating heads conform to irregular surfaces like the chin better than the flat surface of a foil head. Where the Panasonic excels is on flatter surfaces like the neck and cheek and it seems to cover more surface area in a single pass. However be warned that you may have to turn the Panasonic around and shave the opposite or opposing direction to shave against the grain to get the closest shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to personal choice. Both of mine still work so I can alternate back and forth for various reasons, I like them both. The alternative is shaving with a blade. I still prefer using an electric shaver over shaving with a blade for daily use. All I can say is try a foil or rotary shaver and make your own choice. As long as you don&#x27;t go too cheap on either type, I doubt you can go wrong. My only other caution would be that if you have been shaving with a blade there is usually an adjustment period going to an electric shaver. Your skin has tobe conditioned to it, this usually takes a couple weeks. See the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations on this. If you give up on it in less time, it is probably not the razors fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to make a choice, I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for well over a month. The first shave was amazing, one stroke and it was the closest shave I ever experienced. After a while I takes several runs over the same spot to get a good shave. For me I seem to get a closer shave when it is wet, and when I run over a spot slowly. I still have some problems getting a good shave under my chin in the neck area though, but that might just be my technique.</li>
    <li> I hate that I picked this product up a complete rip off does not work good at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recomend to any one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an electric razor and searched for an affordable one.  I am extremely happy with the ES-LT71-S.  The wet-dry use is great.  Easy to clean and charge.  It took about a month for my face to adapt but now it is a close shave every time.</li>
    <li> So far I like it, works better than other electric razor, haven&#x27;t use the cleaning unit yet</li>
    <li> I switched to electric about 9 months ago. I purchased a Remington foil model for $25 at Wal-Mart. I wanted to upgrade to a better foil model rather than buy new blades for my cheap Remington so I tried this product. First thing you should know about electric shavers is that if you dont shave regularly your going to have to trim your beard for electrics to be effective. I usually use my trimmer before my electric if I skip more than a day. All that being said, this product has major issues getting hairs on your neck. I had to pull out my old remington to clean up the random hairs that no matter how many times I went over would not be trimmed. I switched to trying to shave with shaving cream and ended up with all the hairs it cut being dispersed around my face. Three weeks of trying to make it work I gave up and pulled my old Remington and shaved in about 4 minutes with no issues. I returned the Panasonic and I&#x27;m going to roll with the old Remington.</li>
    <li> The weight is OK. it&#x27;s Shaving clean and not tingling with cleaning barrel clear up is also very easy . i love Panasonic razor</li>
    <li> I like this shaver better than my Braun because the cartridges last longer and in between cleanings you can clean it under tap water and then use the drying mechanism.  This is better.  However, the trimmer with these are lame.  Not as powerful as a Braun.  So one less star.</li>
    <li> Bought two. One for husband other for son. They both use the razors regularly and really like the shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the answer to my prayers over the misery I have endured over shaving for the last 25 years.  I am in complete shock over how good this shaver is!!!!!!!!  A little history about me, I have used electric shavers for the last 25 years on my face, and Gillette Mach 3 to shave my neck area and to shave my head.  This shaver has replaced both the electric (Remington electric rotary system) and the mach 3 after one use.  WHY you ask? 1-this amazing device shaved my face without any irritation at all, and I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out and turns red after every use with my electric shaver, and forget about using the mach 3 on my face because it cuts my face to pieces.  2-I could never use an electric shaver on my neck, or to shave my head, because it would cause redness and ingrown hairs almost immediately so I had been using the Gillette mach 3 turbo to shave my neck and head area.  I used this amazing device on my neck and head without ANY irritation or ingrown bumps or cuts.  THIS SHAVER WITH ITS FOIL SYSTEM BLOWS AWAY ANY ROTARY SYSTEM I HAVE USED OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS, AND ITS MUCH BETTER THEN USING A RAZOR SUCH AS THE GILLETTE MACH 3 TURBO ON YOUR NECK AND TOP OF HEAD AREA BECAUSE IT CAUSES NO IRRITATION WHATSOEVER.  I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN FREED FROM THE PAIN AND MISERY OF SHAVING, THANKS PANASONIC. I WILL ALSO BE WRITING THE MANUFACTURER A THANK YOU LETTER FOR PRODUCING THIS ITEM.  PLEEEASE, IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TRY THIS SHAVER AT ANY PRICE POINT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderfull shaver. does everything it says and more. very close shave and the wet dry part works great in the shower.cleans itself and charges wirelessly in the cleanerstation.</li>
    <li> Too loud, not American origin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks. Shaving is pretty close, it even cut me twice. The trimmer sucks as expected. The shape of this shaver is very nice. However, I hate the cleaner. There is no way to clean the inside of the water container. Since the water runs in and out of it, the inside can get really gross overtime. As for the replacement cart, I don&#x27;t know what is inside of it, but it smells bad. The cleaner should have just been alcohol based so I don&#x27;t have to spend money buying the replacement cart. I don&#x27;t understand the need for this cleaning solution. It&#x27;s such a waste of money. Maybe the solution cleans and lubricates the shaver at the same time, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll want to shave with that lubrication. Also, the cleaner is loud and cleaning/drying last for about an hour. I normally just run water over it, then take the part out to let it air dry. I use the cleaner once a week so that I don&#x27;t have to buy the replacement cart too often. I recommend buying another shaver that doesn&#x27;t have this horrible cleaner design.</li>
    <li> husband loves this shaver</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool shaver but I still have to use a manual blade after.&lt;br /&gt;However using the Panasonic first gets rid of the heavy beard, allowing&lt;br /&gt;for a much smoother second shave with the blade. No tugging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Good for touch ups as well during the day or at 5pm .&lt;br /&gt;Not ready for Prime Time as your only shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I used a Panasonic for 10 years prior to this, once again Panasonic have proven an excellent balance or performance, quality, and value. The docking station is a great option for cleaning and charging.</li>
    <li> Been using shaver for two months and getting good shaves, but have not used &amp;#34;cleaning device&amp;#34;.  Might try the cleaning device someday, but it seems too complicated and probably not worth the effort or expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Manual leaves much to be desired.  Panasonic should hire an American firm to completely rewrite and redraw the manual !!</li>
    <li> If you have a dark beard, this is not for you. If you like your face not to be burning hacked up, this is not for you. If you like to leave the house looking like you have not shaved, then this is for you. Buy a brush and a razor blade. Jack Black makes an excellent brush.</li>
    <li> Everything that I wanted and more.  Love the fact that it tells you the percentage of power that is left, no more running out of power in the middle of a shave.</li>
    <li> VERY VERY GOOD ELECTRIC SHAVER. I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID TO BUY ONE, I&#x27;M GLAD IT WAS THIS ON. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have owned until now.  Well thought out, easy to use and close shave. Great price on Gold Box. Update. After exactly one year of use, the shaver quit taking a charge. Also issues with cleaning system not cycling completely, leaving a wet and semi-clean shaver. 2 year warrantee, so keep invoice and packaging!</li>
    <li> Went from a braun to this brand. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a change. Quality</li>
    <li> My brother had one and he let me shave with it once. Smooth, quiet, and best of all, none of the skin irritation I&#x27;ve experienced with other electric shavers. I then bought mine and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver over a year ago now and have been using it almost daily since. I use this to not only shave my face but also to keep my head bald, a task my last electric shaver couldn&#x27;t handle well. As long as I keep up with keeping my head bald this shaver has no issues shaving my head and doing a good job at it. Now if I forget to shave for a few days I will have to use a non electric shaver to shave my head. The cleaner does a great job and I run it once A week to clean my shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, features, and price.  I love using it in the shower, and cleaning is easy.  I definitely recommend it, especially for shaving your head.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like, thank you</li>
    <li> Good product, I like the Amazon, this is one of my regular meeting site</li>
    <li> I got this shaver on the Black Friday special deal as a replacement for my older Panasonic shaver which i had for eight years.  It provides an excellent smooth shave every time.  The charging and cleaning station is very convenience.</li>
    <li> It shaves closer then any other razor I have had, the wet dry feature makes it easy to clean, also shows the amount of charge which is nice. worth the money, better then rotory razors that I have used.</li>
    <li> This razor does it&#x27;s job well and the charge provides for many shaves. It&#x27;s ease to hold, not to loud and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes some of the best products. I decided to purchase during Cyber Monday deals. I used to have and electric shaver and decided to go back to hand razors, but got tired of the expensive blade replacements. This shaver is so much easier to groom daily.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Love that it dries and cleans itself. Saves him so much time! Would absolutely recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have never found that perfect electric razor.  I have only used it dry shaving.  It stays charged up for quite sometime.  Wished it would just shave alittle closer.  For someone on the go I think it would be a great razor.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend, after a month of daily use, his feedback seems quite positive: very close shave compared with Braun; easy to be cleaned under tap water or in cleaning base; cleaning cycle is noisy. The sonic motor is quite noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even delivered package is manufacturer sealed, when he opened, he found several stumble hairs left in the trimmer, he had to clean it thoroughly before use. Panasonic should have done better inspection when they repackaging those returned products from unsatisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 2013/2/25: charge/clean unit stop working recently, it is actually useless to this efficient shaver; what&#x27;s more 5-stage LED display is confusing as 20% display is combined with low-battery alert, if it blinks 20%, be aware to charge soon to avoid running out of juice. ES-LT41 is a better option, 10-stage display is more precise, and no cosmetic c/c unit, save several bucks...</li>
    <li> It is a awesome product and it is great in the shower, my husband loved and he said that cuts a great time of shaving in the morning for him.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. I have used 3 Norelco razors that I was happy with, but this razor puts them to shame. I really like the cleaning system, too. I do clean the head and screen under warm running water before putting the razor into the cleaning unit to make the cleaning cartridge last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor to shave my head and it gets it very close. I use a double edge razor on my face, so I have not tried it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor highly.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new shaver and this fits the bill.  He likes the smooth shave and way it handles.</li>
    <li> Really works! A quick and clean shave. Much better than my rotary shaver. I am impressed with the quality. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco triple header razors for years. This razor works great. Have not used the cleaning module yet. Only drawback is that my wife says it seems noisier than my old Norelco, but I don&#x27;t feel its any different.  Perhaps just a different sound that makes it noticable to her.</li>
    <li> not a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I previously used a Remington screen razor, and I found this to be a dramatic upgrade. This razor is more that I could have hoped for. Highly recommended. Smooth shave every time (even with the three day stubble) and easy to clean.  Panasonic nailed it with this razor!</li>
    <li> Good blade and love the charging station but it does not get through those thick hairs that are in all different directions.  If I use it twice a day, there is no problem but if I let it slide one afternoon, I need a straight razor the next morning.  Great for travel and keeping it close throughout the day, but I would only recommend if your beard is not coarse and thick.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor, i&#x27;ve been using it every day for about 2 months now, and it always does a really great job. There&#x27;s a couple of spots around my chin that i&#x27;ve had a bit of trouble with, but for the most part, this thing has really changed my opinion of electric razors.</li>
    <li> While I never expected to get as close a shave with this shaver as I got with a blade I was disappointedat how high it leaves the stubble, even after using Williams Electric shave. I also find that I need to go over the same area multiple times from different directions just to get it all. So if you want a close shave and don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of time doing it stick with a blade. This is my first electric shaver so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my 24 year-old son.  When he uses it, it does a terrific job.  A good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun razor for a good ten years or so. It worked OK. It finally died a couple of months ago. I never experienced using a wet/dry razor, but I love it. It gives a great smooth, close shave when using with shaving cream. Dry, it&#x27;s almost as good. Either way, it works great. It is also, um, less dangerous when using it on other body parts. My Braun was dangerous, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because battery life seems to be weaker than advertised, IMO. A full charge does not last two weeks and I use it every other day. Also, it feels &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34; The case is all plastic, whereas I think it should be some sort of metal (you would think it was looking at the picture - I did). Yes, maybe it would cost a few bucks more, but it would be worth it. It&#x27;s also quite loud, but that may be unavoidable given the speed. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the included cleaner unit, as it stays perfectly clean if you run it under hot water after you use it.</li>
    <li> I can see this shaver being great if you&#x27;re in a pinch, but I often find myself having to do little touch-ups with my manual razor.  I tried using the &#x27;Lectric Shave and I&#x27;ve gone every which way in regards to direction of beard growth, but it still doesn&#x27;t quite cut how I anticipated.  The places that it DOES cut, however... well... it gets REALLY smooth.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver, very close shave with lots of stored power</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 10 year old Norelco electric/rechargeable whose battery started to get tired.  That one gave good service, RIP old friend.  (Does anyone else feel like a traitor when you drop something like that into the trashcan, or is it just me?)  The Amazon reviews on this Panasonic looked good and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t care about the wet shave capability so haven&#x27;t tried that - it works very well for what I need it for.  I can get about 20 days on a battery charge (it&#x27;s 4 months old now, so early in the battery life).  I like that aspect very much, as well as the travel-lock that keeps it from turning on if jammed into a suitcase buried beneath others in the cargo hold.  I take a few extended trips and was hoping for 30 days on a charge, but 20 is fine (getting to electrical outlets is not always handy, for where I go).  The only reason for a 1-star shortfall in this review is that my old Norelco (not sold as something to take into the shower) could be used while plugged in to the wall to recharge, and the Panasonic can&#x27;t.  Given the intended range of use (under running water), this makes good sense, but if you&#x27;re on a trip, be sure you don&#x27;t let the charge go too low before recharging, if showing up to a meeting with a smooth face matters each day.  Knowing what I know today, I&#x27;d still buy this one again - it feels good in my hand and does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. After wet-shaving with this razor, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the Panasonic and a real razor. I can get in close around my goatee, unlike the Norelcos I have been using and it does a really good job dry-shaving. So far, in the first week I love this thing!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and it was very well received.  My son said it is the best razor he has ever owned.  So I must give it a 5 star based on his opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I love it. It will hold a charge for several weeks and has a lock for traveling to prevent any accidental battery drain. The washing station is a very nice feature. The razor works great when dry shaving in a hurry and cuts perfectly when used in the shower. I am very impressed. Purchasing on Amazon saved me $60 over the cost for this item at Best Buy. I am very pleased with this razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has been the best electric razor I have ever owned. Shaves very close with no irritation. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver b/c it came with a cleaning system.  The cleaning worked well for 3 months, after that everything went down hill.  Instead of one cleaning cycle it took three cleaning cycles to completely clean the razor (with a new cartridge), then water started to accumulate on the bottom of the &amp;#60;vortex cleaning system&amp;#62; and when I took the shaver out water started to fly everywhere. Its extremely frustrating to buy something that consistently doesn&#x27;t work correctly.  That&#x27;s what I get for jumping on a &amp;#60;cyber monday&amp;#62; deal.</li>
    <li> I try to use this shaver, but never work! The shaver doesn&#x27;t shave! I try several times to shave my face, doing more or less presion, even in my arm! but the shaver only cut a few hairs! Only the trimmer works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; (not a smooth shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recomend this shaver for anyone!</li>
    <li> Let me just say I purchased this for my husband on August of 2012. I haven&#x27;t used this myself but my husband raves about the shave. Before I sat down to write this brief review I asked him some general questions about the shaver. For the record, he raves about the shave...period. I asked if he has ever used the cleaning feature and he said no so when you read other reviews about the cleaning feature I am not in a position to rebutt their comments. Also, my husband has a full beard type of facial hair but he is not course haired type of guy. He really does like this shaver for every day use but has mentioned that it&#x27;s not built to tackle 2 days worth of growth or a beard. He is going to be giving his 2 year old shaver to my son and has asked Santa for another one of these. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reasonably happy with this razor since I bought it a few years ago in terms of how it shaves.  The problem is that the sideburn trimmer recently stopped working with is a bummer.  If this hadn&#x27;t happened, I would probably have given this shaver a 4 (not a 5 since I don&#x27;t think it shaves as close as my old Norelco Triple Header used to.</li>
    <li> must be many panasonic beards out there cause, from my own personal viewpoint, Norelco shavers have it over Panasonic and Braun. yes i&#x27;ve used them for years! everything is made cheaper nowadays and sometimes quality suffers(more often than not) and the prices are always more.  gotta make that money. bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;  Norelco shavers are quieter and shave is better with less effort than the competition. just my opinion of course!&lt;br /&gt;Most leaving reviews mean well, but, have not used the product long enough or compared it to another product.&lt;br /&gt;even if this shaver did 20,000 vibro&#x27;s  a minute doesn&#x27;t mean it shaves better.</li>
    <li> Actually, the clean system is not necessary. And no clean brush found.</li>
    <li> Finally a electric shaver that cuts my beard in less than 5. I have used Remington and Norelco both without long term success . Remingtons screen would fall apart and Norelco even when sharp took a long time and then you had to go over whatever it missed with a razor.  I have just used this dry so far and I shave more now since its so quick. It works on both one day old and 5 day old beards. Update  5/14/2016. Never used the wet clean feature however blades quickly got dull or the unit lost power. Bought new blades recently and discovered it was the unit itself. I only used the shaver once or twice a week. So after 100 shaves the unit it toast. I got over 5 years with the norelco.</li>
    <li> Very smooth operation...</li>
    <li> Great product, super price! Wonderful travel companion...with a full charge, no need to bring the power cord, the charge will  last over 10 days!</li>
    <li> This razor gives a clean, close shave, and charges quickly.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Deducting one star for quality. My previous Panasonic shaver was made in Japan and one can indeed appreciate the QC. This one is made in China. QC not as good as those made in Japan. My Braun (made in Germany) and Philips (made in Holland) feels very well built too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son as a gift.  Have to say I&#x27;m not impressed with the results.  So far it appear to not shave anywhere near as close as a razor.  I came to discover this when I asked him if he liked the shaver and he said he hasn&#x27;t been happy with the results.  Saying it&#x27;s slow, noisy and doesn&#x27;t shave closely.  As a dad giving a gift to my son, that had me upset and also wondering if he was not using it properly.  Did some research online to see how to use it properly and went over to his place this weekend and gave it a try.  Unfortunately have to agree with him, it just doesn&#x27;t shave closely.  Found myself having to go back over areas again and again and still not completely satisfied with the results.  My traditional razor works far better, at least from what I can tell thus far.  I&#x27;d frankly like to return it and chalk it up as bad purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see here there are many glowing reviews.  That has me scratching my chin wondering if we have tough hair or if I&#x27;m missing something.  The unit appears to be working fine.  Just not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed my Panasonic ES-LT71-S electric shaver for several weeks now and I must say I am totally impressed.  I have used both Remington and Norelco electric razors in the past but purchased this Panasonic because of the excellent reviews from other users.  I have not been disappointed at all.  I have not used the cleaning system yet so cannot really say anything about that.  As for the shaver... I love it!</li>
    <li> Previously Amazon had a similar Panasonic shaver in the same price range.  It broke two times in less than one year.  First time, it gets sent to San Francisco to a repair shop; 2nd time it goes to some place in Texas.  Anyway, the darn thing was made in China.  Panasonic sent me an upgraded Japanese made replacement shaver and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  The time I sent the shaver to Texas until the time Panasonic sent me a new one was about 3 weeks.  Didn&#x27;t shave at all.  The new shaver took care of my whiskers like a Weed Wacker.  I cannot recommend this shaver if made in China - Japan is a different story.</li>
    <li> Love the smooth springy motion. I wish it would cut longer hairs a bit better but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Over many years now I&#x27;ve used a few different name brand electric shavers. Some worked fairly well for me, not great, but fairly well. I have a light beard, bristles aren&#x27;t stiff, and finding a shaver that gave me a clean shave, (especially under my chin) was an ongoing task. It looks like my search is over, because this Panasonic model does a great job for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is of pretty high quality, the cleaning system works great (though the included cleaning product smells exactly like Gak, seriously), I love the travel lock mode, and shaving when I&#x27;ve shaved within the past day or two works just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is that I don&#x27;t shave every day, and if I go 3 or 4 days between shaves the razor REALLY has issues and pulls on hairs a lot when shaving. With my previous electric razors I would simply use the built-in trimmer first to shorten the hairs and then switch to the main shaving mode to finish the job, which worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on this razor is so poor that it really isn&#x27;t an option. If your facial hair has grown to more than a couple of millimeters then the trimmer pulls your hair at the edges. Even with that, the trimmer is very ineffective at trimming any hairs, including sideburns. Also, the width of the trimmer is only about maybe 1 inch so it takes much longer to do standard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried skipping the trimmer altogether, but the main shaving mode just pulls too much hair and causes too many annoying little pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you never go more than a day or two without shaving, or your facial hair grows slower, this is a great razor. It&#x27;s just not great for me and my shaving habits.</li>
    <li> Bought it for one of my friends as a gift. He really likes it, works just fine and never complained about it.</li>
    <li> My BF buy it for her father ~and he tried it and feeled very good~~! IT is very worthy ~</li>
    <li> Got this at a special price, and it turned out to be a great shaver. Probably at good value even at full retail when you consider the outrageous cost of name brand disposable razors and cartridges. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It really does the job. Long battery life, handles comfortability, easy to use and a closer shave than using blades.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this razor and am especially pleased that I can shave two weeks on one charge. Upon examining the razor I decided that I would probably never use the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; application.</li>
    <li> my fiance is very happy with his new razor I have bought several we had to take back because they just wasn&#x27;t as good as his 10 year old panasonic razor but this one he loves!</li>
    <li> Very good。Complete accessories, good workmanship,It is very comfortable to use,&lt;br /&gt;Very good。Complete accessories, good workmanship,It is very comfortable to use,</li>
    <li> This razor is great. I use it every day. I get a clean close shave. Easy maintenance...Use Wet or dry...You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this one</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good close shave. Love the self-cleaning design. Great Christmas gift for my husband who had been recovering from surgery.</li>
    <li> So far the razor has exceeded my expectations.  I have been using a Braun for the last 15 years and I guess I am just not as accustomed to such a close shave with an electric razor.  The Panasonic is light years closer than the Braun, much quieter, and easier to manipulate in my hand.  I am finished with Braun razors after having two that just were ok.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first from going to an electric razor after always using a real blade, but getting older and not really wanting to take the time to heat the water and apply the shaving cream and etc... I decided to go this route and have to say I am very impressed.  It is extremely easy to use, it cuts as close as it can to a blade without any burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because the cleaning portion is rather noisy and it takes about 3 weeks for your skin on your face to adjust to using an electric shaver, I think it should be less time than that.</li>
    <li> Use it standing at the basin or use it in the shower (with Edge shaving cream)  -  it works very well.  Gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Top of the line budget shaver!  This razor is the bomb for the money.  If you can spring for the four or five nano blade shaver, go for it and you enjoy a silky smooth result, with a bit faster shave.  I&#x27;ve tried all the top shavers and the Panasonic wins hands down.</li>
    <li> Just switched from blade shaving to the electric after years of blade shaving because electrics left my face a mess. So far this razor is excellent no complaints, really smooth no pulling and a close shave at least as good as a blade.</li>
