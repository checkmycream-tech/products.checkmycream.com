      <li>It should be noted that I gained about 20 pounds during this pregnancy, exercised 3-4x/week, and ate healthfully, so I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t JUST the cream!</li>

      <li>Good luck and enjoy!</li>

      <li>and I was so huge!  </li>
      <li>I did not expect this product to magically remove my stretch marks and keep more from popping up (for reference</li>
      <li>Kind of pricy, but if it helps keep my skin hydrated and free of marks</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff and it does work to an extent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m leaning towards the thinking that whether or not you get stretch marks has more to do with your body and your genetics than anything else.  </li>
      <li>I had cocoa butter before, I like it better</li>
      <li>As the days passed by, I saw more strech marks on my belly.  </li>
      <li>and I got soooooo many marks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary with body and skin type.</li>
      <li>The skin became more healthy</li>
      <li>I love the smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic in a bottle.</li>

      <li>And I&#x27;m really glad that I did.</li>
      <li>I am in my seventh month now, and I still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks (although it is said that the appearance of stretch marks is mostly genetic).  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so much better after using this</li>
      <li>Before going to bed, I use the much more thicker and stickier (and cheaper)</li>
      <li>I was expecting better and more fading of the stretch marks than what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>I didint get that many though, so maybe the lotion helped in that way.</li>
      <li>Really nice and smooth cream.  </li>
      <li>This product made my skin better, more firm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is OK.</li>
      <li>we are in the process of ordering more.</li>
      <li>work much more than Palmers does.</li>

      <li>I have been using it for several weeks now and am quite impressed.</li>
      <li>Love this and will continue to use it...</li>
      <li>My favorite cream while expecting,  </li>
      <li>The smell was nice and blended smoothly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know a better way to describe it.</li>

      <li>I have to get some more, though...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too dry for me. I thought it would be more oily. It absorbs so fast. I had cocoa butter before, I like it better</li>
    <li> I am using it during all my pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very light, what is good if you are feeling sick, And it really works!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my belly and hip area during my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks, even though my mother got them (they can be hereditary).  I&#x27;m using it again with my current pregnancy.  I love this stuff.  No strong odor, not greasy, absorbs immediately, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing.</li>
    <li> Used with Two pregnancies so far and zero stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife, and like many have complaint, she cannot stand the smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of days, she stopped using and bought something else. And I must admit, I did not like the smell of this product either. For those of you who are pretty sensitive, I&#x27;m guessing most of pregnant ladies are, you really don&#x27;t want to buy this unless you checked it out at a local store and you don&#x27;t have problem with the smell.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been impressed with this product at all. I purchased based on reviews I&#x27;ve read from mommy bloggers, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help moisturize my stomach at all. I was expecting it work much better considering how pricey it is. I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction the first time I applied this product. Im currently 12 weeks pregnant and my doctor was very worried. I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen to you, but beware!</li>
    <li> I just bought this item locally and love it so much that I&#x27;m coming onto Amazon to review this in the hopes of helping others with stretch marks.  I just had my second baby six weeks ago and got some pretty bad stretch marks on my lower abdomen.  They were dark purple-ish and I was hoping to find a product that could help.  My expectations were that hopefully I would see some lightening over the course of a few months.  I have been using this product for two days now and the stretch marks are almost back to my natural skin color (no longer purple)!  I can hardly believe my eyes!  Thank you Mustela for creating a wonderful product and helping a mom of two feel that much more back in control of herself!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing an ad in a pregnancy magazine.  I am really pleased with the soft, silky, non-greasy texture and the pleasant scent.  I&#x27;m using it generously and hope it&#x27;s as effective as the product claims.</li>
    <li> I have been using a few different brands while I&#x27;ve been pregnant to protect from stretch marks and I am so far stretch mark free so I think this product works great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream while still pregnant with my first baby as I had gotten some very deep, very purple and red stretch marks.  After three days of using this the marks were about two shades lighter than when I started.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Of course nothing can eliminate stretch marks all together, but this cream is a wonder cure for discoloration and visibally reducing the appearance of stretch marks.  If you&#x27;re looking to remove stretch marks I suggest a doctors laser treatment, as those have been proven to remove the marks all together, but they are expensive and quite painful!  Mustela is wonderful and this was used after I had tried Mederma, which did absolutely nothing and cost about the same.  I also had been lotioning throughout my pregnancy and started seeing stretch marks right at the end.  It&#x27;s been fabulous and I would reccommend it to anyone.  Good luck and enjoy!</li>
    <li> No result and changing shown.</li>
    <li> I used this for my first pregnancy and no stretch marks!  Using it for baby #2 as well!  As for the smell--I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.  Not sure why some people complain about it.  Smells like lotion to me.</li>
    <li> I used this day and night and I still got strecth marks. I didint get that many though, so maybe the lotion helped in that way. But its alright, I later bought Palmers and that worked good.</li>
    <li> I was using belly balm from the Honest Company (which I love) but didn&#x27;t feel like it was really doing much. My skin feels so much better after using this and it has really helped with the itchyness of a growing belly!</li>
    <li> Product came on time and I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Great deal! Great delivery service!</li>
    <li> I also bought this product based on customer reviews I read all over the web. And I&#x27;m really glad that I did. See I am prone to getting stretch marks, as I got some from when I was younger during some growth spurts and was scared that becoming pregnant would give me lots more. So I decided to try this cream, and I applied it vigorously on all areas affected by pregnancy (breast, stomach, lower back, hips, thighs etc) starting around the 3rd or 4th month, when my body really started to change. I applied a nice amount all over after showering, and that&#x27;s it. And here I am, a week after giving birth, and not one mark. I&#x27;m going to continue using it until my body is back to normal, as you can get marks when shrinking as well. I can&#x27;t say it made my older stretch marks much lighter, I believe this is better as a preventative cream for most people, although I&#x27;m not doubting it might help others diminish theirs. In my experience I believe once you get a stretch mark it&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of, so the key is to use the right product to keep your skin supple so when it stretches it won&#x27;t scar. That said, I highly recommend using this product, just make sure you use it diligently, and I think it would be good for anyone wanting to protect their skin while gaining/losing weight, not just pregnant women. Thank you Mustela!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 9 months religiously everyday! And yet I am full of stretch marks on the lower part of my belly.... i look like a tiger, it&#x27;s horrible. I gave 3 stars because maybe if i hadn&#x27;t used it would have been worse; but can;t confirm with that. It seems like this cream worked on everybody but me :(</li>
    <li> I have heard that stretch marks are genetic, but I have the same body type as my mom and did not get a single stretch mark (while she got many) -- I can only assume due to the use of this cream. Also, I am super picky about how things smell, and I thought this cream had a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> My review is based on past and current use of the product.  Mustela Double Action was my MUST HAVE product during my first pregnancy 5 years ago, I was willing to pay whatever it cost! Stretch marks are part of my genetics, I got them badly with growth spurts in high school but I got only 3 tiny ones during my last month of pregnancy, they were so small and I was so huge!  I purchased again this past December (2011) at 11 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child and I am so disappointed.  The packaging changed, no big deal except now the tube is smaller so you&#x27;re paying the same amount for less product, the formula must&#x27;ve also changed because now instead of a luxurious cream it is watery and runny but what has really set me off is the smell!  The original formula had a wonderful light scent but the new version has an awful strong citrus-chemical fragrance. I can&#x27;t stomach the smell enough to continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Works amazing NO stretch marks after baby not one</li>
    <li> Absolutely no stretch marks.  Two pregnancies.  My sister in law and cousin.  All same results.  Applied the cream 3 times per day right from the start of the pregnancy till 1 month after.</li>
    <li> Very over priced for what you actually get. I found it to be clumpy and it made little globs/peels on my skin. It was a very white cream that made my skin look lighter. Also, it feels sticky.</li>
    <li> I like this, haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks yet! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s genetics or this cream but I&#x27;m mark free so far! The texture is a bit funky, it kinda pills up if you rub it in too much</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion when I reached my 4th month. I am in my seventh month now, and I still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks (although it is said that the appearance of stretch marks is mostly genetic).  I use it after my shower in the morning to go to work. It is light, does not stick to clothes, and the smell is very subtle.  Before going to bed, I use the much more thicker and stickier (and cheaper) [[ASIN:B0007V6PK6 Bella B Tummy Honey Butter - 4 oz]], which is also good, but would not wear it during the day.</li>
    <li> i used mustela during my pregnancy -in the beginning almost nothing after 5 month once a day las 2 months 2 times a day&lt;br /&gt;works really great but you must used every day&lt;br /&gt;i gain about 30 pounds but im older,had a big belly  and my doctor said for the last month of my pregnancy  i should expect some stretch marks any day&lt;br /&gt;enough said i give birth 3 weeks ago -stretch marks  one big fat 0 !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU MUSTELA</li>
    <li> a friend recommended to me, she bougth in France.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it!, i&#x27;m using  three times a day, everyday, until my pregnancy end.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is OK. You have to really work it into the skin because it leaves white streaks. Once you do, it does leave a slightly oily/greasy residue, but it smells pretty good. I thought it was okay, nothing special. I actually wasted my money and bought 4 of these, thinking I would be using this moisturizer throughout my entire pregnancy. I prefer to use some other products I&#x27;ve been trying out. For you pregnant ladies out there, I recommend trying out different cream/butters/oils/moisturizers to get a feel for what works best for you. I am no longer using this for my belly, but because I don&#x27;t want to waste the product, I use it on my legs, arms and chest. No stretchmarks so far!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best by far.   Not greasey, no residue, and the best no stretch marks!!  A Little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure that this item prevents stretch marks during pregnancy, but I do know that I used this when I was pregnant with my 1st child and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  And now I am using this for my 2nd pregnancy.  I say that I don&#x27;t know for sure if this works because it&#x27;s hard to tell if I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks because of this cream or because of genetics, or maybe both.  I would recommend this to all though, considering it isn&#x27;t smelling like all the rest of the creams out there (I hated the smell of coco-butter when I was pregnant with my 1st).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now approaching 36 weeks in my pregnancy. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion once a week since my first trimester and I don&#x27;t have a single stretchmark. I love this product so much, I&#x27;ve purchased it for close female relatives/friends who are starting to prepare for pregnancy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had to stop using this lotion after only a few uses because it smells so strongly.  It&#x27;s a shame, since it is so expensive and I heard it works really well.  I was sensitive to fragrances before becoming pregnant, and the pregnancy has only heightened that sensitivity.  It smells very strongly of fragrance and the smell doesn&#x27;t dissipate.  I had it on under layers of clothing in the winter and could still smell it, and it would leave me with a headache.  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t have fragrance since it is labeled hypo-allergenic, but if you are sensitive to fragrances that I would recommend finding another lotion.  I&#x27;m using Palmer&#x27;s Coco Butter Stretch Mark Lotion and, while still fragrant, it has a much lighter scent and is 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> LOVED! The smell was nice and blended smoothly.</li>
    <li> Mustela Stretch Marks Double Action is a very nice ointment. I use it throughout my pregnancy and two months after that.</li>
    <li> So far no stretch marks, smells good, and no greasy feeling. The best product I&#x27;ve found so far.  Definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product I thought it smelled pretty good, but now that I am 16 weeks pregnant it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all and makes me feel nauseous all over again.  A friend of mine has given me a different product, which smells much better and has a thicker consistency. Whether this product really works I won&#x27;t know for several months still, but my tummy does feel better with some type of lotion on it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether this works for existing stretch marks. But it works for pregnancy. My sister still have pretty bad stretch marks so based on that i thought i would have them too. I used this for two pregnancies and i have no stretch marks. i mean NONE. i used it after every shower starting 3-4 month preg. i think i used little less than 2 tubes for each pregnancy. it is pricy but i would rather pay $80 than having stretch marks for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months (I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant) and I have no stretch marks so far! Even those i had before on my hips became smaller and less noticeable. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very smooth and soft. The only thing that i don&#x27;t really like about it is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have any perfumers in it, only natural oils so to me it smells like grass. The good thing is that the scent is very light and u don&#x27;t feel it after applying. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have never had a reaction to any type of lotion before, but this one caused a horrible rash every where I had applied it.&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is that the ingredients are not listed on the package, so I don&#x27;t know what it is I reacted to, and I&#x27;m not sure what to buy to replace it!</li>
    <li> I used this cream during the beginning and middle of my pregnancy.  Upon first use, it had a pleasant smell and was slightly greasy to me.  I don&#x27;t usually like any kind of lotion/cream because of the greasiness factor, but I really didn&#x27;t want any stretch marks.  Truth be told, it&#x27;s not a huge bottle for the price, so even though it tells you to apply liberally, you&#x27;ll really want to use it sparingly.  It did last a while though, but the once pleasant fragrance really started to bother me to the point where I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and switched to a different cream.  I did make it out of my pregnancy without any stretch marks.  Whether this lotion had anything to do with that is questionable.  I also used the Mum to Be lotion you can buy at Motherhood (smelled much better than this stuff), and regular old Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter (which I hate the smell of).  I&#x27;m leaning towards the thinking that whether or not you get stretch marks has more to do with your body and your genetics than anything else.  Like I said, I made it through my entire pregnancy without a single one, but I&#x27;m not sure this lotion had much to do with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help with anything, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money try 100% aloe vera, vitamin e oil, and black castor oil mix.</li>
    <li> I really liked the price and quality on this mussels stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second pregnancy without a single stretch mark</li>
    <li> Used throughout pregnancy twice per day, not even one stretch mark! Very happy about the product. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This has a scent to it so if you are sensitive to odor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to you. It seems to help though but that may just be an effect of time also. I was expecting better and more fading of the stretch marks than what I&#x27;ve seen. I did follow the directions and used it as stated for the full 30 days. It shipped on time and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. Only used it a few times because the smell was too strong. Didn&#x27;t end up with stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Already used this product. I bought two more units to continue the use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;Loved It!&lt;br /&gt;The result is very good</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her first pregnancy and although she had a big baby (and belly) she used this every day and had no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I normally would never pay $40 for a tube of cream, however this is worth it. I received a sample packet of this cream and started to use it after my daughter was born. I only have a few stretch marks - the purple squiggle kind. While using the sample packet for a week I saw improvement. When searching out the cream, I was shocked that it cost $40, but decided to get it since the sample worked so well. I have been using it for several weeks now and am quite impressed. My stretch marks are less purple and are flattening out. I definitely recommend this. The cost is the only reason that I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> It seems like an okay moisturizer, but the smell is disgusting and so strong that once it gets on you, you can&#x27;t wash it off even with soap. It lingers for the entire day. This product also made the skin on my hands itch, which for me is a sign of a mild allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Pricey but stretch marks, no thanks!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews however I felt I should this time... I used this product starting week 19 of my twin pregnancy. I was skeptical at first as I am actually a physician and thought there would be absolutely nothing I could possibly use to prevent stretch marks... It is inherited and stretch marks are supposed to be caused by damage in the deeper layers of the skin. Well, I used it anyway  and hoped... I ended with no stretch marks... Not even one. I did try to use it twice a day. Not all the time though. I did not use anything else. My twins were born at 38 weeks and they weighed more than 6.5 lbs each... And my mom has plenty of stretch marks... And I had a couple from my teenage years on the lateral aspect of my thighs... I am not sure why I ended up with no stretch marks. But i would definitely use it again...and I bought it for my friend who is pregnant now... Highly recommended. And unlike other reviews, I actually liked the smell... Granted I was past the morning thickness when I started using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a charm! I&#x27;ve used this product throughout three pregnancies now and am happy to say I am still stretch mark free! This stuff is magic in a bottle.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been pregnant twice and she swears by this lotion!</li>
    <li> Mustela has changed the formulaton of this cream.  It now flakes off the skin instead of deeply absorbing into skin and it used to provide long lasting moisture (24 hrs).  Today&#x27;s version is &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;  with the moisturizing effects lasting maybe a few hours at most.  The cream has always been expensive. In 2008 it was $30.00 for 8 oz., now however it is even more expensive with smaller packagng, and greatly diminished moisturizing effects which vanish quickly all in an attempt to get consumers to buy more of their product.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Product came in quickly. I used it as directed, every day until I had my baby and no stretch marks! Mustela works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was about 18 weeks preggo (am now 36 weeks preggo) and I can say that my belly is void of any of those bright red/purple, painful looking stretch marks. I did get 3 stretch marks on my side (of course the part where I WASN&#x27;T using this product) but since I found them, I started applying and they haven&#x27;t grown/gotten worse. Weird part is that two days ago, I found what appear to be &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stretch marks on my lower belly which either I never knew I had or got during this pregnancy and never noticed. They say the difference between &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; stretch marks is that the new ones are a little raised, red/purple, and itch. These were invisible and looked like little divets and you could only see them if you had a light source pointed at my belly from the side to cast a shadow. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never the less, I continue to use the product because I think it has helped in some way. I apply in the morning, anytime my body has been in water (bath, shower, pool time, etc.) and bedtime. I will also do an application if my skin feels extra itchy or sore that day too. Using this schedule, I use about a bottle a month or every 3 weeks so it gets pricey!</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is so strong I could only use it once. I put it on at night and had the worst headache from the smell. It also is very thin in consistency, I prefer something that is thicker.</li>
    <li> Came fast, best price I could find! I love this stuff! Worked great for my first pregnancy! Try it out!</li>
    <li> Ladies, Husband talking here. Wife said she had to have this through the entire pregnancy. She went full term and put this on twice a day as soon as she started showing, Not one stretch mark on her belly. I&#x27;m sure results vary with body and skin type. I have one happy wife!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product, I am in my second trimester, and odors are a little too much for me although I am getting better, this product seems to be very moisturizing and I am sure it will work but it gives me nausea every time  I put it on. I would prefer the same cream odor free.</li>
    <li> I learned that its efficiency is nearly 100% in fighting stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I liked its texture and the way it absorbs fast. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Super recommend and the cost benefit is very good!</li>
    <li> This is the best stretch mark cream it really does make your stretch marks fade and go away but you have to put it on everyday.</li>
    <li> This gave me the worst rash ever.. Never using this again</li>
    <li> Did not help me at all!!! I use another much cheaper product which helps me and I don&#x60;t have single stretch mark on my belly after my pregnancy (Palmer&#x60;s product for stretch marks)</li>
    <li> works as advertised!!! my wife loved it. we are in the process of ordering more. this has been recomended to all our friends.</li>
    <li> Strong scent for pregnancy. I dont like the scent of this and i love the scent of the mustela baby moisturizer. Feels very oily. Couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, smells great, the only downside is that Is a little pricey but very good quality. I started using it at 14 weeks pregnant and now I&#x27;m 20 so it&#x27;s kind of early to tell if it&#x27;s going to work for me but I will just keep using it during my entire pregnancy and then we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell good, so I only managed to use it once or twice.  Other stretch mark creams work just as well but don&#x27;t reek.</li>
    <li> Really glad I got this cream. I was feeling proud early on in my pregnancy that I had no signs of stretch marks as I was diligently using coconut oil and Honest belly balm to moisturize, and then one day in my third, they just appeared. I naturally freaked out and looked through Amazon to see what might help to relieve them. I know, I know...stretch marks are genetic and there&#x27;s supposedly nothing you can do to get rid of them or prevent them, but right away, this cream felt different from the coconut oil and belly balm that I had been using prior. It moisturized my belly but I also started to notice that the marks seemed to be getting lighter with time. My stretch marks are still there, but it&#x27;s nice to see that they also don&#x27;t seem to be getting any worse and it keeps my tummy nicely moisturized. Definitely glad that I discovered this product and would recommend to moms to be early on in the pregnancy!</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> After searching for a lot of products and reading reviews. I decided to give mustela double action a try. It is not sticky, smelly or greasy. It does not stick to cloths. Use it 2 times a day. I have been using it since April. My stretch marks are almost gone. I ran out so I am ordering one more. It really really helped me I loved it.</li>
    <li> Just what I need. Just as described</li>
    <li> What can I say, it works.&lt;br /&gt;My wife used it all through her pregnancy, and despite being stretch-mark prone, she got ZERO stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;That is amazing to me in itself, because I look at he pictures of my wife during her pregnancy, and the only thing that grew was her belly, and boy did it.  It grew, and grew, and grew, and nearly took over the world.  I didnt imagine it was possible for that thing to not leave marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it costs a fortune, and I had a hard time coughing up the cash to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;But compare that to the costs (fiscally and emotionally) of having (and potentially trying to repair) tons of stretch marks, and a stretch mark free body is definitely worth a couple hundred bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work for everyone?  I dont know.  Im not a scientist.  But it worked for my wife.</li>
    <li> This is my third pregnancy, and I have been using only this product. My husband is French so I found it in France for the firs time, and now I am happy to be able to buy it here, rather than caring 10 tubes each time when I come back from France. It gives you very smooth non greasy protective layer on the surface, elasticity is guaranteed for 24h. 3 baby and no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> the fragrance in this is STRONG. everything it comes in contact with will stink for hourssssss</li>
    <li> As soon as I found out I was pregnant I started using this product based on all the accolades Mustela products have garnered. The scent was pleasant enough and the consistency was creamy but absorbed after a few minutes. If you use this product 2+ times a day, you will fly through it. About 17 weeks into my pregnancy my skin began to get severely itchy - it was even keeping me up at nights. I found that this product wasn&#x27;t helping to combat the itchiness and I had to try other products to find relief. I did find relief with a mixture of Basq skin care products and Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotions and oils. I tried to go back to this product twice but when I did my skin would get itchy again. Altogether, not a match for me.</li>
    <li> I choose this brand because its famous.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, smells good, I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2x/daily around 10 weeks gestation throughout my pregnancy and about 1x/daily for a couple months postpartum.  I have stretch marks on my hips from a growth spurt I had as a teenager, but did not get a single stretch mark during or after this pregnancy.  It should be noted that I gained about 20 pounds during this pregnancy, exercised 3-4x/week, and ate healthfully, so I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t JUST the cream!</li>
    <li> My wifw said that it&#x27;s very good and smell well.</li>
    <li> Smell good and works for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 33 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks so far.  I started to use this lotion early on, as soon as I felt that my sking was tight and itchy.  Started once a day, now use it morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;I think the regular one (as opose to fragrance free) is much thicker and I end up using less amount than the other one.  I&#x27;ll stick with the regular option, the smell is not very strong and is pleasant.</li>
    <li> While the cream might have been effective , I haven&#x27;t been able to use it due to its strong scent . Pregnancy strengthens your sense of smell, having produced this product for pregnant women , one would assume they would take that into consideration but \\&quot; NO\\&quot; they haven&#x27;t . I tried using it twice , both times the smell made me nauseous and I couldn&#x27;t stand myself . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any pregnant woman who has a heightened sense of smell . It was a waste of money for me unfortunately!</li>
    <li> Disappointing, didn&#x27;t work for me at all. As soon as I put it on, it just dried up and I tried it for two months, thinking that maybe I needed to give it time, but that didn&#x27;t change anything. I ended up switching to 100% pure Shea Butter and I&#x27;m so happy with it, because I had develop severe eczema and not only did it totally cure it, but it also prevented stretch marks. So far, thanks to the Shea Butter, and not the Mustela, I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and stretch mark free!</li>
    <li> I did not order my Mustela cream online, but, I felt compelled to come here and write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the product is kind of steep, so it&#x27;s hard to spend the money when you&#x27;re unsure about how the product is going to work. I went ahead and bought it with expectations of it not working, but I was pleasantly surprised when after a few weeks of using it twice daily, my stretch marks are fading. I can&#x27;t say they will fade completely but, for me at least, they have faded. I started using the product four months after the stretch marks appeared due to pregnancy, and even still, the results are there. The only complaint I have is the scent. It&#x27;s really perfumey. I bought this to use during pregnancy but couldn&#x27;t because I got headaches while using it. Otherwise, it was a successful product for me!</li>
    <li> So far the product is working great. I&#x27;m 3 Months pregnant and my skin looks great. Not one stretch mark</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture or smell. No better than another cheaper product. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many reviews on here saying this product is so great because it prevents stretchmarks.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what you do, if you&#x27;re going to get stretchmarks, you&#x27;re going to get them.  So if you&#x27;re looking to prevent stretchmarks, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money on such a small tube of lotion.    I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks, religiously to try to lighten stretchmarks. All of my stretchmarks are fairly new considering I&#x27;m 35 weeks pregnant, and didn&#x27;t get them until the last few weeks.  After two weeks of use I can hardly see much of a difference, and the tube is already half-empty. I&#x27;m doubting I will waste my money buying more once it runs out unless I start to see some dramatic results.  On the plus side, this product doesn&#x27;t burn or smell at all, unlike Mederma.</li>
    <li> I tell EVERYONE about this product. Started getting stretch marks around my belly button during pregnancy... this stuff faded them all the way and kept other stretch marks from forming.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my stretch marks on my inner thights go away, but it definitely lightened the appearance. Feel much better about myself after.</li>
    <li> I bought Mustela Strech Marks Double Action for a friend. She is pregnant and she loved the gift. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Sadly wanted to like this product. Especially for the price I spent on it. But it just smelled too strong and started to make my belly break out into little bumps. I decided to moisturise with something much more hypoallergenic and simple.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the old version, it REALLY worked.  The new one REALLY DOESN&#x27;T work. EVERYTHING is different about it....1.) the smell is different (Husband complains that I stink)....like cheap old lady perfume, 2.)The thickness - now very runny, 3.) NOT moisturizing - I put it on after my shower in the morning and by the time I get to work, I feel like I didn&#x27;t put anything on. The old one would last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I received a pirated or fake version so I called Mustela. They claim it&#x27;s exactly the same but less thick so it&#x27;s easier to apply.  Who are they kidding?? The old version was better all around. Did I mention that the old version prevent stretch marks like a charm and this one doesn&#x27;t.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this to prevent your stretch marks like it did in the past.  I really wish they didn&#x27;t reformulate to a cheaper quality.  What&#x27;s the point of paying the same amount for less lotion in a bottle that makes you stink, doesn&#x27;t moisturize or help fight stretch marks???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT recommend this to anyone.... I did before.  Hope this helps.  I wish I paid attention to the previous reviewer.</li>
    <li> Smells good, rubs on smoothly, not greasy, and so far it works great! I&#x27;m 38 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> This product was expected to arrive almost two months after I ordered it which I was disappointed with because I have been using this throughout my pregnancy and I don&#x27;t like to run out but to my surprise it arrived a few weeks after I ordered it so I was very happy with the fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;So far I can&#x27;t say if this product has worked or not though, I am 8 months and still using it but I was told to try it by my doctor so I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Not wroth to buy, just a high price body lotion, you could try other brand have the same result (personality I couldn&#x27;t see the result).</li>
    <li> I am 38 weeks pregnant and been using this product since I found out I was pregnant. So far zero stretch marks! I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife used it when she was pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  I don&#x27;t know if it is genitic or if the cream really works for the price it is worth the chance.</li>
    <li> Its a must have for me,as it really proves to prevent the appearance of stretch mark as ur belly is growing.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t cure your stretch marks (nothing will) but it smells nice and goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for others, it works for me. I&#x27;ve used it since I was pregnant 3 months. And I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks at all. Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of using this product or genuine issue...</li>
    <li> My super sensitive pregnant nose couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the Palmer&#x27;s tummy butter so I decided to buy the Mustela Stretch Marks Double Action. I love it! It smells really fresh and grassy and it is not too greasy like the cocoa butter ones. I am 18 weeks pregnant, my belly is already showing and I have no stretch marks so far. I know stretch marks run in my family so I hope this products helps prevent them.</li>
    <li> Even when not pregnant, I have really sensitive skin. My last pregnancy, I couldn&#x27;t use any of the cocoa butter or honey lotions that get such rave reviews - they just felt sticky and made me super itchy and rashy. This time around I&#x27;m making a bigger baby and am really pushing the boundaries of maternity wear in my third trimester. For weeks, I felt like an overripe melon, my skin just hurt from the stretching. Tried a sample of this from a local retailer and ran back to buy a whole tube. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, has a gentle, light and fresh scent (kind of rose/vanilla?) and stopped the pain immediately. I&#x27;m using it 2-3 times a day now, and am much more comfortable. My stretch marks haven&#x27;t vanished yet, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes post-partum. I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> not complaining about the product itself b/c i only used it once due to the strong perfume smell... i&#x27;m pretty sensitive to strong scents and this scent lingers forever... even after washing. i used it once and i&#x27;ll never used it again.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I bought this lotion. So far I like it and I am most likely to continue buying it throughout my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd pregnancy and I have to say this stuff does wonders.  I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks with this pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t have any with my previous.  Love how it makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I start using Mustela Stretch Marks since i found out I was one month pregnant, and today I&#x27;m 9months and it doesn&#x27;t prevent all the stretchmarks on my belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> it is a very good product</li>
    <li> Easy greaseless and does not smell as some day it does! Love this and will continue to use it...no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product! Didn&#x27;t like the smell too much although I could live with it. Used it for two days and developed a pretty bad red rash all over my pregnant belly :( Luckily after contacting amazon they offered me a full refund. I now use pure coconut oil. It&#x27;s greasy but works great and doesn&#x27;t have all the unnecessary chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was pregnant with my first baby and use it 2 a day! And it did help me probably. But not complete! I still have stretch marks.. But with my second baby I did same thing and I got soooooo many marks. Probably there is no best cream not to have stretch marks(((((</li>
    <li> The seller delivered on time and was great with combining my orders.&lt;br /&gt;this stuff works very well.i am not pregnant but noticed faint stretch marks appearing. After just 10 days i definitely see them diminishing.i can hardly see them...</li>
    <li> 2nd pregnancy and used this both times. Zero stretch marks. I know people say it&#x27;s in the genes, but I have stretch marks on my butt and hips from sports growing, so stretch marks ARE in my genes... but I have zero after 2 kids. That makes me a believer!</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But smell is soso.. I think..&lt;br /&gt;I bought two creams.&lt;br /&gt;I given one to my freind. Another one is for me.&lt;br /&gt;Felling is good.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have strech.&lt;br /&gt;Not yet... ;))</li>
    <li> The other reviews are correct, the smell is pretty awful.  Particularly hard to take during the first trimester, but then it just gets old.  And it hasn&#x27;t worked on my old stretch marks, as it claims that it will.  So I&#x27;m doubting it&#x27;s ability to prevent new ones from coming.  I&#x27;m still using it, when I&#x27;ve finally gotten over the scent enough to use it again.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it throughout this pregnancy, because I am at close to 17 weeks and still don&#x27;t have any..but I&#x27;m not big yet. So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Still have 2 more months to go but so far works great. You can feel its thicker than palmers cocoa butter. I have to get some more, though... This won&#x27;t last more than 2 months or so</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy - I was determined not to get stretch marks - and I didn&#x27;t.  I gained 50 lbs and believe me it felt like it was all in my stomach.  I&#x27;ve heard that not getting them has to do with genetics too but I really think the lotion helped.  It also smells good and made my skin feel so much better since it was so stretched out.  I used it with my second pregnancy also and still no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just 5 months pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using belly lotion since the first trimester. I was using the \\&quot;famous brand\\&quot; cocoa butter at the beginning but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I switched to this one, even though its a little pricey, but I love how it smells. Its not greasy on your skin. I rather spend a little more $$ on creams than money getting rid of stretch marks later. I haven&#x27;t gotten any yet, hopefully I wont get any!! But I am watching my diet and trying not to gain too much at once, so I think that will help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! One tube lasted me 6 months of pregnancy and I used it literally every day! Nice and thick and rubs on easy</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days, so this is a preliminary review. The product is as described and arrived promptly. The cream is very light yet rich and does not feel greasy. I actually really like the very light floral fragrance. I hope it works!</li>
    <li> I did not see any results with this cream. Would not purchase this product again, but have heard from others it worked great for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this cream for about 2 months now, and I can&#x27;t see any real change yet.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m still hoping that I&#x27;ll be able to see changes in a few more months.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant. Sometimes it appears some white stretch marks that disappear when I use the product only one time.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell but not sure how well it works.  After using Mustela every day from the moment I found out I was pregnant I still got stretch marks.  I knew deep down it is genetics whether you get stretch marks or not but I will still hoping for some help.  If I got pregnant again I am not sure I would spend the money on this.  Made my skin soft but that probably about it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all does not work got stretch marks don&#x27;t believe me here&#x27;s the photo save your money</li>
    <li> Even though I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the cream, I kept on putting it religiously twice a day since the first day I found out I was pregnant (this is my 1rst pregnancy). I must say that I didn&#x27;t gain that much weight during my pregnancy, only 29 pounds total, which is normal for 1 child. On my 37th week a few strech marks started to appear, so I started to apply the cream more often (5 -7 times a day) in order to stop them from multiplying... But it didn&#x27;t work.  As the days passed by, I saw more strech marks on my belly.  Maybe it&#x27;s genetics, and there was nothing that could have prevented them from coming out... But one thing is true, the smell is aweful!</li>
    <li> Used it during two pregnancies, did not have a single stretch mark. Although I cant say it is due to the cream and not genetics, the cream has nice texture, pleasant mild smell, and definitely works to relief itchy skin. If I have another baby, will surely buy Mustela again!</li>
    <li> I got it even faster than what the website told me to expect! Great product! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Really nice and smooth cream.  Smells good, and I have been using everyday now, and didn&#x27;t see stretch marks yet.</li>
    <li> I always thought I&#x27;d get stretch marks while preggos due to genetics. I started using Mustela Double Action cream half way into pregnancy and now that I&#x27;m at the very end, still not a mark in sight. The cream is extremely moisturizing and I can&#x27;t help but give credit to this double action cream! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I still got some stretch marks. I‘m thinking about using other brand.</li>
    <li> Came on time! This is my second bottle of this stuff, I&#x27;m 7 months along and only have a stretch mark where I took out my belly button piercing.. Not a single one anywhere else on my belly!! Hopefully it keeps up the good work! Will be buying till the end of my pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I am now 7 months pregnant and have bought 5 of these creams and so far no stretch marks. Hopefully after I give birth I will stay the same.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent, too strong. but I am using it everyday in hopes that it will prevent stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream while expecting,  I used it on my first pregnancy and I had great results and no stretch marks.  So am using now five years later with my second pregnancy and no stretch marks so far am eight months pregnant.</li>
    <li> I used 3 tubes of ultimate hydration on my first pregnancy and 1 tube of double action in addition to the UH  when I got really big. There is a history of stretch marks in my family. Happy to announce I am now the only one who doesn&#x27;t have them! I am coming back to buy more in the second month of my second pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the people who and clumps and watery product, I wonder if the store you bought from improperly stored the product - like in a hot window or maybe the product was old. I bought mine at babies r us and had no problem. With the 20% off coupons they always gave out the product became less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is not too much to say except we are hopeful that it takes care of the stretch marks like it states but we have a while to go before we know since she is still pregnant.  Good luck to everyone.</li>
    <li> I applied this lotion twice a day during my entire pregnancy. I am 5&#x27;2 and had an enormous baby for my size at 9 lbs. My mother had terrible stretch marks so I prepared myself for the worse. I did NOT get one stretch mark on my belly or boobs. I truly believe this stuff is a stretch mark miracle when applied correctly. I recommend this product to every pregnant momma out there.</li>
    <li> I really was excited about this product from the reviews. I was willing to spend a pretty penny to keep my skin nice, but I was let down. I did not expect this product to magically remove my stretch marks and keep more from popping up (for reference, I am 7 months pregnant and have a few stretch marks on my hips). But I did expect a quality product and slightly noticable results after one tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the lotion balls up. I don&#x27;t know a better way to describe it. When I am rubbing it in, the lotion balls up and I can pick the balls off. I would expect that it should sink in, right? Second of all, after using the entire tube, twice a day, I saw no results at all and even saw a few more stretch marks appear. Overall I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin better, more firm.&lt;br /&gt;I use without being pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended who have stretch marks and to prevent them</li>
    <li> I dont know if anti stretch marks lotions work but I did not get any after my first pregnancy. I am only 11 weeks pregnant with baby #2 but still use this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it are 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not smell. It has no fragrance.  I was not able to stand the odor of cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not too greasy nor too hard to apply. I live in a hot country without access to A/C all day long. So this is important for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I also bought Mama Bees and also has no odor and is not greasy. And it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mustela after I developed a rash from BIO OIL at the start of my 2nd trimester. I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 3 weeks from delivery and I don&#x27;t have one single stretch mark (yet). I use it about 2x a day (day and night) but lately as I&#x27;m stretching more these days, I&#x27;m putting it in the middle of the day for extra comfort (to avoid itchiness).</li>
    <li> The skin became more healthy</li>
    <li> I use this after I apply Shea Terra Mamas Gold...usually at night, or on its own if I&#x27;m worried about an oil transferring to my clothes. So far the results have been great. Kind of pricy, but if it helps keep my skin hydrated and free of marks it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Stared use at 3 months pregnant i have not see any strech marks yet!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it helped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, hard to tell if it really helps with the stretch marks, I&#x27;m still using my bio oil , I think it&#x27;s better while I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
    <li> This is my third pregnancy and I have used this product every time. I haven&#x27;t had a stretch mark yet.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE THIS!!! It&#x27;s worth the price. Never got one stretch mark, and I have two kids!</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing! I am a first time mom and was told by doctor that they are now discouraging the use of cocoa butter, so I searched the web trying to find products that were safe and pretty effective (though there can be no guarantee) There were so many good reviews about this product I decided to give it a try. Not only was it effective in me not gaining any stretch marks during my pregnancy, but I applied it to some small stretch marks I had on my inner thighs from previous weight gain, after a couple weeks it had almost completely caused those ones to vanish!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it does work to an extent. I used it for weeks and it helped with my stretch marks a little but wasn&#x27;t a miracle lotion like some reviews imply. For the price I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because honestly it didn;t work much more than Palmers does.</li>
    <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t done anything for new stretch marks. I was using coconut oil and Mama Bee&#x27;s belly butter prior to this, but I noticed some dark purple stretch marks on my hips and breasts at around Week 33. I decided to try Mustela to see if it would lighten the stretch marks, and I&#x27;ve been applying it 2-3 times a day religiously.. 4 weeks later, the stretch marks still look the same, and I&#x27;m developing new lighter stretch marks around my belly button. Stretch marks are definitely genetic -- I&#x27;m not sure this cream will help you if you&#x27;ve already got them, or are prone to getting them anyway. It&#x27;s worth a shot, but at $22, it is somewhat pricey. Also, the Mustela cream isn&#x27;t half as moisturizing as Mama Bee&#x27;s belly butter -- when I don&#x27;t alternate both creams, I end up with dry, flaky, itchy skin on my belly. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant, but it&#x27;s bearable, I guess. It&#x27;s got a weird chemical-type fragrance that I don&#x27;t really care for. I&#x27;ll continue using this tube until it&#x27;s done, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not working on me.</li>
