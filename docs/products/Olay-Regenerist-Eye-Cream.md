      <li>wishing to order more! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would love to see the lash serum sold as its own product.  </li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d try it in light of mostly good reviews.</li>

      <li>So nice to have it available to try.</li>
      <li>and now it is much thicker and looks great when I put my mascara on.</li>
      <li>I know that it puts a coat of the gel formula on my lashes and since you don&#x27;t wash it off, I think that my mascara has more  to go on.</li>
      <li>Will be recommending this now! :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>and I still have to use another one on top.</li>
      <li>I looked better rested</li>
      <li>so mascara seems to go on better..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used duo for about a week.  Have seen MOST DEFINITE change in my lashes.....thicker and most importantly longer.  I do put it on twice a day and, yes, under mascara (I just wait a few min to make sure lashes are not wet).  Cream ... well, I think I need another week.  I&#x27;m 65 and not expecting miracles, but skin around eyes does seem to be a little smoother and brighter so far.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great line (micro sculpting) and a good eye cream...but the lash product is useless to me.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara, so don&#x27;t really need to &#x27;condition&#x27;  lashes and I&#x27;m not sure that this gel would do the trick if I did.  The application wand is DEADLY stiff..for what reason?</li>
    <li> This product is OK but is no miracle cure.  It does not&lt;br /&gt;show marked improvement in a week as it claims in its ad.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this when I got it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the eye cream. It is fantastic. The Lash Serum on the other hand made my eyes itch so bad. I stopped using it for a few days just to make sure that it was the culprit. When I used it again OMG! The itch was unbearable. I&#x27;ve notice in other reviews on here and in other forums that this is a problem. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so it is probably one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Questions don&#x27;t really apply to this product.  It is a two-part product.  No color.  Moisturizer part is excellent, however, the lash treatment is hard to apply, or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like the eye cream.  I am on my second tube (each last about 30 days) and find that I am seeing some diminishing of the fine lines around my eyes.  I don&#x27;t really notice any improvement in the elasticity of the upper eye however.  The cream has no obtrusive scent and doesn&#x27;t trouble my make up at all.  I use it and the lash serum both morning and night.  The lash serum isn&#x27;t much to speak of.  I have minuscule lashes and while they look longer when I put the serum on, I&#x27;m not seeing any REAL lasting effect in the length or volume of my lashes.  The good news is that the lash serum doesn&#x27;t make my lashes crusty and works fine under mascara (I have tried several different types of mascara while using it and all seem fine). Bottom line, the eye cream is definitely worth it and the lash serum comes with the package, so why not? (I&#x27;m in my mid-forties btw and am a lover of the sun for those of you wondering about my wrinkle quality!)</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I love it! I have puffy under eyes in the mornings that can make me look quite strange and very tired. The eye cream does a really good job of minimizing that and giving my eyes a very fresh and awake look. I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s wrinkle abilities as I don&#x27;t have any just yet. It&#x27;s gentle, has no odor, goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. By the time I&#x27;m done with the second eye the first one is dried and ready for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lash serum is what really shines for me though. Mine were never too short, but the grew out almost straight and were pretty lackluster to me. I used this for two weeks daily and my lashes look amazing now. I&#x27;ve seriously been asked if I&#x27;m wearing falsies a few times. It doesn&#x27;t do much for increasing the density of your lashes, but holy cow does it make them longer! My lashes are constantly hitting my glasses lenses now and I&#x27;m not even upset that I have to keep cleaning them because of it. I think this may be my Holy Grail lash serum, it&#x27;s really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a great product and I love the results it gives me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price tag. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for a college student like me, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if I had a decent job. Just my little complaint, but it&#x27;s not a biggie.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this item. I had really high hopes for it considering how much it cost! It made my eyes burn and I never saw any results.</li>
    <li> I use many products in the Olay line, and none of them irritate my skin or eyes (unless they have fragrance in them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGARDING THIS PRODUCT:  I like the micro-sculpting eye cream.  It goes on nicely, not too greasy.  Will have to see if it is sold seperately, without the lash serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the lash serum a number of times, and it irritates my eyes.  I was hoping for help for my lashes to thicken them up, but cannot continue using it anymore.  My eyes burn slightly, and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does not give me whitheads on my eye lids like some other products.</li>
    <li> I have used so many eye creams that I lost count a long time ago...  This one is different.  Not only is it good for wrinkles around the eye area...but you can use it on the eyelids as well!  That is a plus...for an area that is often forgotten by many companies.  They can wrinkle too and your makeup doesn&#x27;t wear correctly if the skin there is dry.  This one keeps it moist enough to apply makeup without becoming too oily!  Much better than the higher priced products that I have used in the past!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Lash serum has lengthened my lashes. Cream seems to add a lift to my eye lids. I use it before applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> Read about this eye cream and decided to try. I found that although its not going to make your wrinkles disappear it does smooth fine line around the eyes. Mostly I like it because when you apply to your eye lids it does not stay greasy and effect eye shadow in a bad way. As long as you give it a fair time to absorb your eye makeup does not get in the creases and disappear. The lash conditioner apparently works, after using for a week I had  many people comment on how long and nice my lashes were. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see miracles, but haven&#x27;t so far. There is a little improvement, but not sure it&#x27;s enough at this point that I would buy the product again. I&#x27;m going to use the current products till they are gone and decide then if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister to use. She said it helped her lashes grow back (too many false eyelashes).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the 17th September 2013 and used it until for a week once a day. I could not believe my \\&quot;EYES\\&quot;!!!! I am 44 years old and have been told I look like 35 for the oldest. Olay Products are responsible for that though. Anyways, I HAD fine lines under my eyes and in a week&#x27;s time they drastically diminished by using the eye-cream. The serum for my eye-lashes made them fuller. There were no allergic reactions. Also the darkness under my eyes were gone. Imagine in one week once a day with a little spec of cream and serum this result, far more when if I used it to it&#x27;s directions and the product is not even finished. My eyes look so beautiful and bright. No lie. Thank you OLAY and thank you Amazon for bringing it home to me.[[ASIN:B009GEUOXO Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Eye Cream And Lash Serum Duo 1 Kit, 0.51 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this product, the cream is ok.  I saw no results nor did I feel any thing.  The eyelash serum was a joke, I could not use the sticky little brush with out poking myself in the eye.  This would be a thumbs down for me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything of note, really.</li>
    <li> Nice little due here.  Thicken the lashes and eye cream and you can&#x27;t go wrong with OLAY.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing.  Great product for much less money than the high end brands.  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> I just purchased it so don&#x27;t really know how good it is but I have a whole line of oil of Olay products that I love so I&#x27;m sure I will love this one as well :)</li>
    <li> Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  Look no further.....this product is for you!!</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this but feel there is no real benefit regarding the issue for which it is intended.</li>
    <li> This product really enhances your lashes and the cream is very soft on your lids and makes them smooth.  I am most happy with this product and will be purchasing again,</li>
    <li> The only eye cream that I&#x27;ve used to get the wrinkles gone.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister who absolutely swears by it.  I don&#x27;t know how long she&#x27;s been using it but she says she can see a difference in her eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quick and the packing was more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 5 months.  The eye cream works great.  The appearance of the fine lines is less visible, but most importantly it provides the perfect amount of moisture around the sensitive eye area without appearing oily.  I use it morning and night.  It took about 4 months to notice a results from the lash serum, BUT it was well worth the wait.  My lashes are definitely thicker and longer.  I&#x27;ve used other lash enhancers and they all have caused redness and soreness on my lids.  This serum does not have any of these side effects.  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It takes about two weeks to see the results. It works. I could not recommend this highly enough.</li>
    <li> I had heard that this worked really good for the eyes so I thought I would give it a try.  Sadly I did not notice much difference with the appearance of my fine lines around the eyes or growth to the lashes.  I did use the entire tube just to be sure to give it time needed to get any results.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Eye serum goes on clumpy and you can&#x27;t wear it under mascara unless you want to look like a raccoon.  The cream goes on well and is not irritating.</li>
    <li> The clear lash serum made my eyes itch.  There are several products in the Olay Regenerist line that I use regularly and like very much, but this is not one of them.  The micro-sculpting eye cream is okay, but overall I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! My eye lashes look awesome and if used as directed day and night under your eyes actually does start to look better after a few days!</li>
    <li> Gave Olay Regenerist products a shot after years of spending lots of money on high end anti-aging products (Arbonne, Eliabeth Arden Pervage etc.) Love this eye cream and lash serum....very smooth, minimal fragrance. With using the products for less than a week I DO SEE a difference. Skin is radiant, smooth and my makeup goes on very nice. I am totally impressed and will continue to buy Olay products. The prices on Amazon are also amazing. Compared prices at local stores and Amazon by far beats the prices and the shipping is fast....fast....fast.</li>
    <li> Yes!My sagging eyelids are dimished.The skin around my eyes is brighter and looks more youthful.I would suggest this to anyone over fourty</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  The eye cream is super light and absorbs quickly into the skin around my eyes.  I&#x27;m not sure it has helped with the fine lines i have because i have only used it for 2 weeks but it definitely moisturizes that area very well. The lash serum is great. I apply it and my lashes spread out perfectly.  I can apply my mascara immediately after without my lashes clumping together. Overall I have not been disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, wimpy eyelashes, AND I&#x27;m waging war on gravity. This stuff helps on all fronts.&lt;br /&gt;No, it won&#x27;t make your lashes grow, a la Latisse, but it beefs up what you&#x27;ve already got and provides a good base for mascara (Dior Show + this lash gunk &#x3D; BOOM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is totally comparable to more expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should get it.</li>
    <li> I got this on time but when I opened it the package was old and worn down, I looked up code on box and it&#x27;s 3 years old and was damaged goods from rite aid. So whoever is selling this is either getting them from garbage or stealing and reselling. Very upset</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this as a free sample so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to spend money on this item. The eye cream was a great moisturizer but that is all. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but saw no difference putting it on twice a day. I normally just use Garnier Ultra-Lift eye cream, which is half the price and works a lot better. They lash serum, to me, was a joke. I don&#x27;t wear mascara so I would put this on in the morning after I applied my make-up and I noticed that I would have white flakes in my lashes within an hour. So when trying it at night, after washing my make-up off, I would still have the same problem. Constantly irritated my eyes because of the flakes. Spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> After one month of use I do not see any claimed results. I am not sure I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> its  the onlyeye cream that ever worked on me thats why I reordered its quite small amout but thats ok thanks</li>
    <li> I had to send this back as I had an allergic reaction to the eye cream. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with the lash serum either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends. I did receive it on time and in perfect condition. Just the product was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> great product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product because i&#x27;ve been losing my eyelashes and having trouble restoring and growing them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;within a couple weeks i have notice my eyelashes are growing fuller and longer.  And.... my eye lashes have not been falling out like they were before starting to use this product. I am glad I overcame my fear of trying something new ......I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also say that the great price was the deciding factor of whether I should try the serum kit.</li>
    <li> Great product.made in USA.</li>
    <li> The wand used to apply the lash serum irritated my eyes and it actually hurt to put it on, so I had to discontinue use of the lash serum. The eye cream itself was cakey and flaky and didn&#x27;t do anything to soften my fine line and wrinkles.  Because of the hard, irritating serum brush, I would not recommend.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I buy this just for the eye cream although the lash treatment works as a great clear mascara as well.  Thsi is the only eye cream that I get noticeable results with and I have tried them all from bargain store to high end.  I am 46 years old and people constantly guess I am in my early 30s.  This stuff really keeps the crows feet to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Love the lash serum also.  I would recommend clay always!! So far anyway!! I also like that it&#x27;s a duo.</li>
    <li> love this stuff - but I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore - it took forever just to find the one I just got through Amazon! So glad the person was selling it!</li>
    <li> ok not a great product I really did not see any difference. I think these products are a waste of time and money. There are much better products out there that really help to thicken your eyelashes as well as soften the lines around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the lash serum.  My lashes definitely look longer.  I use it in the morning and at night.  I don&#x27;t even have to use my eyelash curler anymore.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the eye cream is of poor quality.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate nor help with fine lines.  I wish Olay would sell the serum separate because the cream is worthless in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Amazing works ........under the eyes and right before applying mascara; visibly enhances the eyelash length!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it ...wishing to order more! :)</li>
    <li> I tried the cream for about three days before using the serum on my eyelashes. Then the second day of using the eyelash serum I noticed my eyelashes thinning and was going to wash the serum off but the phone rang and I forgot to wash it off. When I went to apply my mascara later (ugh!) I had almost no eyelashes.... What is the serum suppose to do take off my lashes and grow them back healthy? I am not taking that chance.... Now all I want to do is send my duo back and get my eyelashes back.....grrrrr</li>
    <li> I received this fairly quickly and have been using it every morning.  No difference in lashes yet but the eye creme is as good as the 70$ a tube that I had been using.</li>
    <li> The eye cream feels nice but doesnt&#x27;t have any noticeable effect.  I like the eyelash conditioner better but the effect in quite minimal.  Not really worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
    <li> Fantastic product i am seeing an improvement on my  eye area !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this two in one eye cream and eye lash serum, it really does work. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Thought it would be larger.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The only problem is the eye cream which is great runs out ,0before ladh conditioner. Product works well.  I continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is great. I had small wrinkles around my lash line from lack of sleep on a daily basis.. they&#x27;re gone. I&#x27;m actually shocked it worked so well for me. The lash serum helped grow back my singed eyelashes (oh the hazards of working in a kitchen!) but I found it didn&#x27;t make my lashes fuller. My non-singed eyelashes are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been though. So I&#x27;ll be buying this product again just for the eye cream.</li>
    <li> At first. I received a free sample online months ago and tried it once then forgot about it. I came across it a couple weeks ago and have been using it as part of my daily routine and I have to say my lashes are longer or something. I never had little lashes but all of a sudden they r long and I don&#x27;t see to have as many going the wrong direction either. The eye cream may or not be working,I am not sure. I like it but don&#x27;t see any stand out changes as of yet. Will be recommending this now! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use mascara or many other cosmetics but I do like the effects and the ease of this product.  The lash serum goes on very easily and you really can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing anything.  It does thicken the lashes quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t notice much difference with the eye cream but hopefully it will have long-term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this does a nice job of making lashes look thicker and fuller without a lot of effort or mess. If you just want something to give a little more definition to your eyes, this is a nice kit.</li>
    <li> Found this on sale at  a local store &amp; bought it for the eyelash serum.  My eyelashes &amp; eyebrows have really got thinner as I&#x27;ve aged (49) &amp; I was looking for something for my eyelashes.  I use the regenerating serum &amp; am very impressed with that so  I trusted the brand to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for two weeks,  wasn&#x27;t impressed with the eye cream.  I didn&#x27;t see where it was doing anything for me that the regenerating serum wasn&#x27;t already doing &amp; at first I didn&#x27;t think that the lash serum was doing anything either other than giving crusty eyes in the morning, so I stopped using it for a  few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But KD, you gave it 4 stars!&amp;#34;  Here&#x27;s why:  I saw a picture of myself from before I started using the lash serum &amp; I saw my skimpy eyelashes &amp; I saw a picture of myself from a couple of days ago &amp; my lashes are noticeably thicker &amp; longer.  I couldn&#x27;t see the change looking in the mirror every day, twice a day, but I could see the change between two pictures taken about 3 weeks apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have resumed using the lash serum &amp; have started using it on my eyebrows to see if it help them any.  I&#x27;ll report back in a few weeks if I see any change there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 4 stars because I&#x27;m not impressed with the eye cream.  I did see a review where some one said the cream shrunk some skin tags, I have two I&#x27;m going to try it on &amp; will get back on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see the lash serum sold as its own product.  I would buy it as a solo product</li>
    <li> The product seems good, so far.  The red container is smaller than I expected, but I am sure the description is correct.  I will send another review after I have used the portion I received. By than, I should know whether or not the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that I received it very soon after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I bought this sculpting eye cream and lash duo kit because under and over my eyes had some lines and my eye lashes needed thicken up . I have seen some results under and over my eyes in 10 days. The lines over and under my eyes were softer and skin much smother. My eyelashes looked much better then before and had gotten thicken up quite a bit. The serum was fast absorbing and non greasy. The scent is a soft floral scent more on the neutral scent, so I don&#x27;t think it will bother people with sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin do look healthier and younger, and I will continue using this product becuase I love it and also seen result. I just love how my eye lashes look because it was very fine and now it is much thicker and looks great when I put my mascara on. Thank you Olay your product real work. I recommend this for anybody who want fuller lash and smoother skin around the eye area.</li>
    <li> My husband noticed, I know people say that, but he did.  What I care about the most is me seeing the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This is a big eye opener!! (get it)</li>
    <li> I really like this product-BUT- they DO NOT put enough eye cream in the tube to see any REAL difference.  I think the &amp;#34;Lash Serum&amp;#34; is good for the lashes though.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually very skeptical with under eye products but this one really works.  I already see a difference in just one week. The skin under my eyes looks softer and smoother and the fine lines are less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and at night.  A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s very light weight and non greasy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Let me preface this with stating that I have not used this product. I bought on a whim while in the store. I do not use cosmetics without checking the ingredients, so I  researched when I got home. I did not even look at the eye cream... I was interested in the lash serum. I am not a chemist, but I cannot imagine that alcohol denat. would not ultimately dry out your lashes, not to mention irritate around the eyes. The glycerin sounds nice, but I have heard that glycerin, like petrolatum ultimately causes drying, as it traps moisture from the air. Doesn&#x27;t even matter... I will not use with this particular alcohol and I will return... Darn.. I so want to find the great lash moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My lashes are growing in straighter and thicker. Brush really separates them for easy application. I&#x27;ve tried so many but this is the first I&#x27;ve actually been able to see real results!  The cream for the dark sunken look under my eyes is amazing! I actually saw a difference by the second use and is noticeably better each day. I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive products that gave a slight improvement that never lasted til even the next use and after days of use, saw no further improvement. This cream not only lasts til the next application but the change in my under eye skin is amazing! I&#x27;ll never go without it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for weeks and I don&#x27;t see a difference at All. I was excited to try it as the other regenerist products I&#x27;ve used have been good. I don&#x27;t like the lash serum it leaves gunky stuff on your lashes but doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything to them. The cream is ok I just don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
    <li> I do like the brand, Olay and also like this product.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a thorough reply.</li>
    <li> If you use the eye lash serum daily, you will notice a difference, especially when you put mascara on.  The eye cream helps tighten skin and minimizes the dark circles after a week or so.  Work great for me.</li>
    <li> How can I explain how impressed I am with a product that actually DOES what it claims to do?!?  My eyes ALREADY look tighter and more sculpted!  p.s. don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I am 62 years old :)  And my hubby thinks I LOOK MAHVELOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure, I got this free from Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this a couple weeks ago. I had been using the regenerist MicroSculpting lotion so I thought this would be good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an eyecream it&#x27;s pretty good. I don&#x27;t see plastic surgery cancelling results but my eyes look less tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes, on the other hand are kind of a big deal. I hadn&#x27;t been using it twice a day as I should, but rather just before bed, (I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would make my mascara flake off or something) but I went to put on mascara yesterday and WOW! My lashes are a bit fuller and longer than they were before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying it when I run out because my initial impression is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, the wand is kind of stiff like a comb, but I am pleased with the application and especially the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have reached a point that when I have mascara on, my lashes leave &#x27;marks&#x27; on the inside of my sunglasses. They are definitely longer and fuller than they were a month ago.</li>
    <li> I like Olay products as a rule.  I was very disappointed with this product.  I have been using as directed for a month and absolutely no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> the eye cream soothes lids and the lash serum seems to be working the only problem not much cream for the price</li>
    <li> the cream does do a little bit of correction (bags under the eye) however, I expected it to do a bit of a better job; the lash serum brush is very scratchy - only used this 4 days in a row and then stopped.</li>
    <li> Wow - I SWEAR - my lashes were longer the morning after the first application!  The lash serum comes in a tube just like mascara so application is easy!  But the eye cream comes in a TINY TUBE - and as far as I could see made absolutely NO DIFFERENCE!  Olay would be very wise to sell them separately.  Eye Cream?  No! No! No!  Lash serum?  YES!!YES!!YES!!</li>
    <li> I am 32, &amp; was a stomach sleeper for years(now mainly back &amp; side), &amp; stayed outside sans sunglasses for ALL of my childhood...so do have the slightest lines under my eyes. I can say that the tiny lines I had in the corner&#x27;s of my eyes are all but gone! The one&#x27;s under my eyes..not gone yet, BUT, I also forget to use it every night, so that&#x27;s partly me fault. The lash serum WORKS! I have always had very thin and short lashes... this stuff has made a very noticeable difference. The only thing that concerns me is that when I first got it, the serum was clear &amp; uniform in substance.. it is now cloudy &amp; &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;... it still goes on, but not sure why the color &amp; consistency change.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my eyes or my lashes except to make them water and itchy.  I used the whole product but won&#x27;t try again.</li>
    <li> Great product, price, and service,</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  It will be a regular in my beauty routine,  The wrinkles around my eyes are definitely less noticeable and my skin is so much tighter.  The lash serum is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Ironic..on Dr. OZ the other day, beauty experts were on with myths. One was that women needed eye cream...I&#x27;ve always used it..spent tons on it!...They showed several eye creams &amp; regular facial moisutizers; they did this to show they both have the same ingredient except for one and it was last on the list! All in all saying eye cream is the same as moistuizer.  They said Retin A was the only thing that helped. Hope fades again..lol.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Olay eye cream, honestly, it is the same as others..nothing special, saw no change&amp;have used it for weeks&amp;weeks now. The serum I DO like because it gives my thin soft eyelashes some texture to them so mascara seems to go on better..doesn&#x27;t make them grow tho.</li>
    <li> The lash serum is amazing! It worked within several days, extending the lashes and making them thicker. I&#x27;ve used other OTC products, but this lash serum definitely beats all of them! It&#x27;s a good value for what the product does.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! For people who expect this to instantly grow lashes, that&#x27;s not what it does or even claims to do. But it does condition lashes so they will appear longer, fuller &amp; healthier, especially over time. Plus the cream does give an almost instant vibrance to the eyes. Use it twice a day (can be used under mascara, just let it dry first) &amp; you will see a difference. My lashes had grown thin &amp; fragile after I hit 40. A couple weeks of using this &amp; I could see the lashes of my youth appearing again. After a month, they were almost back to normal!</li>
    <li> I use many Olay Regenerist products, but this one falls short of my expectations.  The eye cream is ok, but the lash serum is, in my opinion, useless.  I&#x27;d stick to just the eye cream which is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 and the first application proved Regenerist does what it claims! It&#x27;s winter here in the midwest and my skin is dry. I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great beauty product and  have been using it for over a year. The eye cream lasts a long time and you only need a small amount. I use the lash serum instead of mascara. I do not like the feel of mascara, especially when I  am wearing contacts. I have dark lashes and the serum makes them pop after applying eye shadow. If you have light eyelashes you would still need mascara.</li>
    <li> I have hereditary dark circles and the under eye bags to match. For years, I have tried varies treatments. Some worked better than others. Most not at all. My last resort for improving my eye area is cosmetic surgery. So I gave up on products that &amp;#34;reduced the appearance of dark circles&amp;#34; and begin seeking more productive products like concealer, eye-shadows, and lash enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from biglots one night on a whim for 10 bucks. I was looking for some thing to eliminate the dryness created from using concealer in my eye area. At the same time, I was looking for a product that would help grow my natural lashes. When I ran across this I had a WTH moment and decided to give it a try. Glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lash Serum: Within a week my lashes looked longer and were stronger than before. I had no negative reaction to this product. My eyes lashes did not cake like some reviewers noted. Also it&#x27;s great for separating lashes when applying mas sacra in the morning. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Cream: After the first use my eye area felt better. Remember, I use concealer to hide some of my &amp;#34;baggage&amp;#34; so my eye area was really dry. After one week, my eye bags were reduced and my over all eye appearance was greatly improved. I did&#x27;nt look like a Zombie any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have wrinkles, I&#x27;m 36, so I can&#x27;t speak to what it does for wrinkles in the eye area. But I&#x27;ve had great results even with my extreme circumstances. And until I can save up for surgery I will continue to buy. Please note: Amazons price is the best I&#x27;ve seen. In my local drug stores, Walmarts and Targets its at least 26 dollars. Hope this review helps another &amp;#34;walking-dead&amp;#34; chick like myself.</li>
    <li> Noticed a change after about two weeks. Longer and fuller lashes. The application brush is a little stiff but softens with time. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> I wanted it for gift,but the box is all scratched around and I&#x27;ve left it for me</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure anything could help my lashes, but this product really does. The cream does a nice job firming up and the serum really does help my lashes to be fuller. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like the cream in this duo.  It goes on really nice and does seem to smooth wrinkles and helped combat the dry skin I have been experiencing on my eyelids recently.  However, the lash serum isn&#x27;t particularly useful.  I used it for a while but didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference.  I would love to be able to purchase just the eye cream, but it only comes in the duo kit.  I&#x27;m not inclined to purchase this again as I don&#x27;t want to pay for something I won&#x27;t use just to get the cream.  So, I&#x27;m back to square one, looking for a good eye cream again.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because you can&#x27;t buy the cream solo.</li>
    <li> Cream is great for eyes.I use the mascara as an undercoat and my lashes are so long when I wear glasses they touch the lens.great price too.</li>
    <li> Still working with this product, for my eyelids and dry eyelashes. I really like the lash serum, not so sure on the eyelid cream. We&#x27;ll see in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The product is okay.  Like all of the eye creams...it didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable.  The lash serum is okay for a primer before mascara.  My lashes do look longer.  Overall the products are okay.</li>
    <li> i used this product once under my eyes  the next morning i had golf balls under my eyes .  I had to go to the doctor . they gave me a prescription cortisone cream .  It now seems like i have more wrinkles than what i started with .&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy at all with this product .</li>
    <li> Perhaps I need to use the product more religiously and for longer. I used it for several weeks every couple of days and did not see any benefit.</li>
    <li> really works fantastic and it really does the job. it does exactly what it claims to do. I just kept poking myself in the eye because I&#x27;m not very good at putting mascara types tuff on lol</li>
    <li> After the first night I woke up with welts under my eyes.  It may have been an allergic reaction.  As far as the lash serum, it may a couple of my lashes fall out.  I then read with a magnifying glass that there is alcohol in the serum.  Why would you put alcohol which dries everything out on your eyelashes.  Had to ditch this product.</li>
    <li> it was up to expectation, The eye cream is real good , i have not used the serum long enough to  make a comment</li>
    <li> Good product my wife enjoyed the gift and has said it works, although she was confused about the screw recess on the bottom and to it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!! Love it, does what it says. Will buy again for sure. Thank you for a lovey product!</li>
    <li> was not impressed with the product.  It was delivered damaged and was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> The eye cream definitely decreases the appearance of fine lines . It also helps to lighten dark circles. It feels really smooth. The eye lash serum separates the eye lashes so when you apply mascara lashes are more defined. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After many years of skimpy eyelashes I have found a product to fix the problem!  Lashes are longer and seems they are thicker.  Didn&#x27;t help eyebrows much though.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using eyelash extensions I have lost a few of my own and wanted to give this a try. After using it for about two weeks I definitely noticed longer, fuller lashes. I am absolutely in love with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see more results in the long run. I no longer feel the need to use falsies, I apply a coat of the serum and wait for about 5-10 minutes (to dry) and curl/apply mascara. The end result is awesome! I can&#x27;t really speak for the eye cream, I&#x27;m only 24 and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles around the eye area but I do have pretty bad dark circles under the eyes (genetics). I have not seen improvement with my dark circles but I will definitely keep using the duo, can&#x27;t hurt my dark circles right?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Olay fan from way back.The eye cream is so so. I can see Olay is discontinuing. I like the lash gel though.</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found this since Ulta stopped carrying it.  I especially like the lash serum.  Once the serum is completely dry I use a lash curler and it creates a beautiful curl.  I add a bit of mascara and I nearly look as I did when I was young and had long lush lashes (I am now 56).  Before I found this product my lashes had really thinned out due to aging but since I have been using the serum daily no more &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;.  My lashes have really filled back in and look longer!  A great product.  One thing to be careful with is that the brush for the serum is quite sharp!  I&#x27;ve poked my eye twice and it does hurt so apply carefully!</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it in light of mostly good reviews. Been using it faithfully 2x/day for 6 weeks &amp; see no changes. The primer on lashes makes it hard to apply mascara (lashes are gunky despite letting it dry).  Eye serum is avg. No silky feel like the prestige brands have. Yet, I find prestige brands feel great but don&#x27;t provide results either.  I have tried a number of eye creams &amp; can&#x27;t say I have ever found 1 eye cream that changes things, and my dermatologist agrees.  Trying Nu-Face microcurrent toning device now to see if that helps with puffiness &amp; lifting eyelids - which I think it is.</li>
    <li> I am one of the biggest skeptics when it comes to beauty products. They all claim to make you look younger, erase lines, &amp;#34;defy age&amp;#34; so imagine my surpise when this one actually came through.  It&#x27;s hard to describe....but after the first 2 days I could see it. My eyes weren&#x27;t as puffy, the lines were visably smoother and my lashes actually looked like they grew. It might be my mind playing &amp;#34;beauty tricks&amp;#34;....but when I applied mascara, I stood there a good 5 minutes staring at my long lashes. Skeptical? give it a try. You really have nothing to lose, except the purchase price.....which also was amazingly reasonable.</li>
    <li> the eye cream seems like it works the same as other olay regenerist eye cream. i can&#x27;t tell any difference in my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this duo, it really moisturizes around the delicate tissue of the eye &amp; the lash conditioner does improve eye lashes!</li>
    <li> Love the eye cream. I noticed a difference in a couple of weeks. I am only 32 but time is aging us all. As for the eyelash serum...don&#x27;t notice a difference and the brush is not comfortable to apply the serum to the lashes. Its really scratchy. I wont buy this combo again but I am going to continue to buy the olay eye cream.</li>
    <li> nice product but doesn&#x27;t deliver on the 5 day promise.  I will keep using this product, but may not replace it when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2.5 weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure about the long term effects, but trust the brand and reviews from them and Good Housekeeping.  I do like the feel of the serum (which is supposed to go on after all your other products...and I do wait till the end). The eyelash gel, which is what I originally wanted to purchase it for, I really can&#x27;t tell.  I know that it puts a coat of the gel formula on my lashes and since you don&#x27;t wash it off, I think that my mascara has more  to go on. Therefore my lashes are longer because of the extra coating. Honestly I think I need to wait a few weeks to tell how its working. Since Amazon asked for a review I did so at this early time.</li>
    <li> when used as directed it helps a lot.  It makes your skin soft and silky.  Its easy to use and conveniently packaged.</li>
    <li> I am a reformed stomach sleeper. I mean: face smashed into the pillow, chubby cheek squished onto the side of my nose, and crow&#x27;s feet forming for eight hours a night.  I have since changed my ways and sleep on my back, but the damage is done.  I also laugh a lot.  Big, hearty, mirthful belly laughs that put smiles on the faces of people around me and lines in my own face.  That&#x27;s a habit I&#x27;ll never kick and it&#x27;s definitely starting to show.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and I decided it was time to do something about those little tell-tale lines around my eyes, so I picked up this nifty little product.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use I started to notice a difference.  I looked better rested and my eyes looked brighter. After two weeks, other people started to notice.  My boss asked me if I was getting more sleep.  My friends started asking what I doing and what my secret was. The lines aren&#x27;t gone, but the skin around them looks younger, healthier, and brighter. I noticed that my lashes looked longer and thicker. And that was without mascara!  Once I put mascara on, that was a whole different story:  The lash serum works like a primer and makes mascara work like extensions.  I literally couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a month in at this point and I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;m loving all the compliments and the way I look.  It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and I think it&#x27;s definitely worth what you pay.  I have made it about halfway through the tube with daily use over one month.  I&#x27;d put that at a pretty great value! I may no longer be a hardcore face wrinkling stomach sleeper, but I&#x27;ll never stop laughing.  Hopefully this little Ace up my sleeve will keep my eyes bright while I laugh my way into old age.</li>
    <li> I tried this and had to discontinue use after the itchiness was unbearable.  This was the only thing new that I was using and believe it was some sort of allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I love this duo! The eye cream is the best &amp; so affordable! The lash serum works great &amp; separates each lash before using mascara.</li>
    <li> I already have long lashes but they&#x27;re thinning out.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement since using the lash serum.  My eyelashes appear fuller and even longer.  The eye cream is a bonus; smoothing the fine lines around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and afraid of wrinkles. Thankful I&#x27;m carded everywhere and shocked I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Not 18 (thank god) but I have always had dark circles under my eyes. I became great at covering it up but want them gone. I&#x27;ve seem a little, not much, improvement on my circles but helped the smile lines fade and even my forehead lines from frowning. Completely gone. using fake lashes sometimes has ripped my own out.  I normally have very Lon lashes and the gel works GREAT. Thicker, longer, and helped grow ones quicker. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Same Old Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I fall for the sales pitch every time.  The eye cream had nice feel but the lash serum was a joke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an a Olay girl from way back.  My mom used Oil of Olay, and I followed suit.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and most people thing I am in they 35-44 range.  I usually try any new product they have.</li>
    <li> This product right here yes, stands by its word.  It brightens the eyes, helps with fine lines and enhances the eyelashes.  I ran out of the eye cream and I still have the lash serum.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve had it in my go to drawer for a couple of years now (I&#x27;ve re-bought a few times now). For me the eye cream really works with the tired look that you can get. The lash product is my favorite! Fills out my lashes and they seems longer than when I don&#x27;t use it for a while.</li>
    <li> Since I been using the cream I seen big improvement in the eye area . Lines are smother and skin around the eye looks great</li>
    <li> I bought this because if the reviews, whilst looking to purchase my regular Pro X Olay eye cream, and thought I&#x27;d try it because it had the lash serum as well.  I stopped using the serum after three applications because my eyelids started to itch and also because the serum made my eyelashes brittle. I thought the serum would be like a treatment, but it hardened on the lashes making my mascara hard to apply and defeating the purpose of using an expensive mascara with argon oil, which couldn&#x27;t penetrate the serum after it had hardened.  The eye cream is a little dry for me and I still have to use another one on top.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pricey ones, but keep coming back to the Olay line because the results are the same if not better and the product is less expensive.  I was skeptical about the last serum, but this is my third purchase....It works, lashes look healthier, longer, more supple.  The Eye cream has softened the fine lines around my eyes and decreased the puffiness.</li>
    <li> This product works for me...eye area skin looks better and lashes seem fuller.  Nothing dramatically different but I would recommend trying this combo.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having this product available to try.  Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing what it says it will do.  Hoping as I continue I&#x27;ll love it more.  So nice to have it available to try.</li>
    <li> Its been 3 weeks and I have noticed my eyelashes get a bit thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> Just starting using this product last week. The eye serum seems nice, no results yet. The brush hurts if it touches your lashes. So I have to be extra careful not to put it too close to my eyelid.</li>
    <li> Has actually strengthened and lengthened my lashes in two weeks. I do not get a lot of sleep so nothing can help my under eye circles, but my under eyes are softer.</li>
    <li> Color question is not applicable.  Product is exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the same stuff you get in the red jjar except a lot less.  Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> Although I wish the amount was more, it has definitely done the job for me.  Totally satisfied with the product.  Would like for the producer to increase the amount in the tube.</li>
    <li> My eyes and lashes are beautiful.  My lashes are longer and thicker.  My eyes are smoother.</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this but I read the ingredients and I saw it contains paraben in it. I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
