      <li>it&#x27;s super gentle on your hair,</li>
      <li>I am using this haircolor on regular basis for years to cover grays and it is excellent, way better then any other product in grey coverage.</li>
      <li>It covered every strand well with the first application.</li>

      <li>/&gt;-Nice, rich, natural looking color&lt;</li>

<li> Due to a desire to not use chemicals to color my hair, I was using Henna and Indigo to achieve a natural black but it was VERY messy and time consuming.  </li>

    <li> the best haircolor ever..I love this ..it hides my gray..I color every 2 weeks..with other brands I get too much allergies with this one..just a little bit..I think its safer..I am 50 but I started having gray quite young..I look quite young but these stubborn grays..grrr..but with this..it helps me a lot..</li>
    <li> Great Natural Product. Never had any issues</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with dry, brittle hair for the last several years. I do relax and color my hair and it seemed to worsen within the last year.&lt;br /&gt;I found an Indian hot oil treatment that softened and stopped the breakage in my hair immediately after only two treatments. I felt with these oil treatments my hair was on the mend. At the suggestion of a friend I bought the Naturtint because it has all-natural ingredients so I thought it would be best to use as I get my hair back healthy. I applied this color 2-3 weeks before my realxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nice, rich, natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hair was nice as soft after using conditioner that comes in box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price. I paid $18 for this color at my local HFS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This color takes FOREVER to rinse out. Even then, it still does rinse out completely. Almost a month in the color is still coming out when I wash or apply oil to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-After I relaxed my hair the color came out. This happens with other colors but not nearly as bad as the Naturtint. My roots look like they were not colored at all and it covered the grey very well when I initially applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My hair started breaking and shedding again after using this color before my realxer; and the treatment isn&#x27;t working as effectively now. My anti-breakage treatment worked great with my drugstore brand color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying this color is bad. I think it works best for hair that has no other chemical treatments. For women with relaxed hair that is prone to breakage, avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to using Just 5.</li>
    <li> good product. nice color.</li>
    <li> love this hair color!! order all the time</li>
    <li> Very good product will continue to order some more later</li>
    <li> Very good product, I really recommend to used.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair color- I have been using Naturtint for over 2 years. I like this even better than salon products- it&#x27;s super gentle on your hair, no harsh chemicals (no odor!), great grey coverage and not tested on animals! :)</li>
    <li> Great hair dye without crazy chemicals like most hair dyes. Much better on my scalp since changing to this brand and doesn&#x27;t irritate like store bought ones.</li>
    <li> Best price for the hair color! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Exceeded my expectations. .. great coverage,  color, lasts a good 4-5 weeks, no harsh smell... would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a more national hair color.</li>
    <li> Due to a desire to not use chemicals to color my hair, I was using Henna and Indigo to achieve a natural black but it was VERY messy and time consuming.  After reading other reviews on Naturtint, I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It is quick (30 -40 minutes) and so much less messy then the Henna.  The color lasts and lasts.  I touch it up every 4-6 weeks because of the roots but the rest of the hair stays just as beautiful and shiny as the day I color it.  One caution is to be careful to keep it off the skin as much as possible because it stains and takes a couple of days to wear off.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my mom&#x27;s 80% gray hair. It covered every strand well with the first application. The best part is I was able to convince her to let me color her hair with this less toxic version of dye as she&#x27;d stop dyeing. I&#x27;m happy she&#x27;s happy her hair grows fast though. It doesn&#x27;t say how often you can use it but I told her not to do it more than once a month.</li>
    <li> Great product - Gentle on my hair.  Fast Shipper and great price!</li>
    <li> I have black hair and use it to cover the white hairs that comes with age&lt;br /&gt;As the color fades - it looks natural - unlike other black dyes that fade with a brown or reddish undertone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used over 20 boxes - and still keeping to this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this product im allergic to all hair dyes and im black headed so when the grey came in i looked like a skunk so i figured i would try this and it is great i had no problems what so ever and my hair is soft and grey free and there was no itching or swelling like i have with other dyes i will be using only this and buying from this seller!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, more natural stuff</li>
    <li> Used just a bit to test for allergy. Rash and blister on and around the test area behind my ear (where the instruction suggest).  Had the worst reaction allergy ever.  Had to go to doctor. Has made me paralyzed for few day.  Rash has spread to more areas.  Blister, itching and pain.  This was supposed to be plant base, all natural, ......but hey, poison Ivey is also plant base and natural.  The rash and blister is similar to poison Ivey reaction and even worse.  Have to rest for few more days to heal.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color I ever used. Natural, gentle, great and even color. It makes my hair so healthy and soft. I used it twice so far and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair color for 1 year.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals.  I get compliments on the color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy through Amazon and get six boxes than to buy individually in natural food stores.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great and appears to be new.  It made my hair shiny and wonderful.  I will refer this to my friends and relatives.  Received the hair color in a timely manner.  I am very happy customer.</li>
    <li> color doesn&#x27;t last very long on my greys around the temple (about 3 weeks and they&#x27;re showing again). However, beats the alternative hair colors that are loaded with all those bad chemicals.</li>
    <li> Item does exactly what I paid for and was priced quite reasonably! I received the shipment in good shape and when promised!</li>
    <li> i started using naturtint several years ago when i developed terrible reactions to traditional boxed hair colors.  i have no adverse reactions with this product.  i always shampoo and condition my hair directly after rinsing with a good conditioner.  the color holds just as long as with other brands.  100% gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i always get compliments on how shiny and beautiful my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price value here is so great compared to my local health food stores, where it runs around $18.00 each.  so excited to have found this deal!</li>
    <li> Excellent for coloring hair without harsh chemicals.  However, very runny.  This is the only brand of hair color used by my stylist,</li>
    <li> Love this hair color!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, it smells good and my hair is absolutely gorgeous after using it. It gives my hair very natural color and beautiful shine.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Naturtint has been my hair dye starting the year when I was pregnant. Until now, I&#x27;m still using it...coz its safe and very good for the scalp. The color also lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom a few times.  She seems to stick to this brand compare to others less expensive hird dyes.</li>
    <li> Most off the shelf hair dyes give me a real headache. Even the ones used at the salons don&#x27;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works really well. It covers all my Greys and gives that deep reach black colour and no headache. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and I am so glad I can buy this in bulk. I have to colour my hair every month as I am about 70% grey.</li>
    <li> I was very worried about coloring of my hairs until I found this natural no ammonia color. it is very gentle and covers grey perfectly.</li>
    <li> The hair color is easy to use and no harsh chemicals. The color stays a long time.  I recommend the product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great product no allergies I am allergic to regular dye but with this Product No More Allergies Im A Happy Camper</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It works great for us. we like it. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always take it with a grain of salt with anything self-claimed to be &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nature&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND COMPANY.</li>
    <li> I am using this haircolor on regular basis for years to cover grays and it is excellent, way better then any other product in grey coverage.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair color for several years.  I received different compliments on the natural look and shininess from the coloring.</li>
    <li> love how they gave you the shampoo and conditioner to use with this product! Recommend it to my family and friends for sure!</li>
