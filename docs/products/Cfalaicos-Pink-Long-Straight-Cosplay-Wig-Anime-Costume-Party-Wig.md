      <li>it to be, actually better.</li>
      <li>And if it was just that I&#x27;d be okay</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s mostly styled for you (:</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle that easily and needs to be styled.</li>
      <li>it tangles easy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it for your Yuno cosplay!</li>
      <li>(i could literally stare at it all day tbh) and the wig itself is silky, its has a nice shine to it and the tangles are very manageable, detangling is easy.</li>
      <li>Overall I am super happy with this purchase and will look for more wigs from this buyer~</li>
      <li>it might get tangled quickly but overall it&#x27;s nice quality and looks good.</li>
      <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t have the fringe cut the same as in the picture, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great when I got it it was a tiny bit frizzy and tangled</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>It was super thick and was perfect.</li>
      <li>it tangles pretty easily</li>
      <li>The pink is absolutely perfect and it is so soft.</li>
      <li>but other than that it is a nice color and an overall beautiful wig</li>
      <li>Personally I thought the wig was very accurate!</li>
      <li>this is my very first wig</li>
      <li>Overall I love it!</li>
      <li>Such a stunning wig!</li>
      <li>It even comes with the red ribbons and a free hairband too!!</li>
      <li>Arrived earlier than expect and looks and feels really nice.</li>
      <li>this was the first wig ive ever owned and it surprisngly came styled as yunos hair, unlike most wigs online; theyd require cutting and styling; but this wig already came perfect!</li>
      <li>Other than that, was good quality</li>
      <li>SURE YOU ORDER IT DIRECTLY FROM CF-FASHION so that you will get the exact wig with the bangs and everything.</li>
      <li>Love the wig but, it said it came with the red bow, which it didn&#x27;t and instead came with a wig cap and probably the cheapest hair tie</li>
      <li>The wig isn&#x27;t exactly cut as shown.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the picture, except the bangs aren&#x27;t cut like that.</li>
      <li>The wig is obviously a great quality, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle to bad like my Hatsune Miku wig, which is amazing.</li>
      <li>The color is absolutely spot on</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>but it came so much sooner</li>
      <li>I literally just ran my hand through and it was tangled after I spent an hour or more untangling it.</li>
      <li>IT feels and looks like real hear</li>
      <li>some and layer bangs a tiny bit to give it a more natural look</li>
      <li>The little pointy parts are pre-styled and stick up well but get lost in the rest of the hair very easily.</li>
      <li>I waited for this for over a month super excited checking to see everyday if it came.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this buyer.</li>
      <li>And they wrote a cute little letter.</li>
      <li>but so does natural hair so just gently brush it out</li>
      <li>Nice and thick.</li>
      <li>well to top it off its super thin.</li>
      <li>it was everything i hoped for and came earlier than expected :)</li>
      <li>i kinda noticed that the color was more of a vibrant light pink than a dull mild pink.</li>
      <li>Also it came really fast, only because I chose 1-3 day shipping hahah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are no bangs but that can be easily fixed.</li>
      <li>Overall the quality is really high and the color is just as shown.</li>
      <li>When I got it I had to cut the bangs but nothing major.</li>
      <li>the only problems were that it didnt come with ribbons, and it becomes unstyled after multiple uses; which is normal.</li>
      <li>The pigtails in the back and the pink spiky back hair is already done for you, and the company even gave me a hair tie with a little golden apple charm as thanks!</li>
      <li>If you like it a vibrant pink</li>
      <li>no need to mess with it and its light enough to not weigh down the back of your head.</li>
      <li>Other than that the wig is out of this world and very silky and long.</li>

<li> Other than that the wig is out of this world and very silky and long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s super long,soft and thick!</li>
<li> The bangs came down past my chin and both the front and back pigtails were super long.</li>
<li> (Which sucks cus now I see it at $14 &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;)</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how incredibly long it was.</li>
<li> so I cut them just above my nose and not to mention that the hair is very, very long!</li>
<li> But nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with a little cut.</li>
<li> Let me tell you the color is spot on yuno and the length is long and it does come styled except for the bangs.</li>
<li> The bangs might be too long</li>
<li> REALLY LONG.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s long, thick, and soft!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a reddish pink and it looks just like Yuno&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> Money well spent</li>
<li> but thats about it other than that</li>
<li> its been three months since it came and its still very thick and soft.</li>
<li> Though the only thing is that it came like a week late and mine did not even come with the bows</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and the wig goes down to my hips.</li>
<li> The wig took about 0.9 seconds to get on, and needs little to no alterations or fixing, despite a little frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again and again and again!</li>
<li> Yes the bangs are thick but the back of the head is way too thin.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m having a hard time trying to get rid of it&#x27;s tangles...</li>

    <li> This wig is absolutely beautiful! It&#x27;s long, thick, and soft! It looks exactly like the picture, except the bangs aren&#x27;t cut like that. Which wasn&#x27;t bad at all, you can simply cut it and style it. But It came with the red ribbons as well and it came in ponytails, so you don&#x27;t have to do that and such. Also the sides are sticking out too, which was awesome! They&#x27;ve staved up by themselves too, so I was really happy about that. Overall, it&#x27;s everything I excepted it to be, actually better. It&#x27;s beautiful and I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it for your Yuno cosplay! Also it came really fast, only because I chose 1-3 day shipping hahah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ll also post some pictures so you guys can see what to expect :)</li>
    <li> Love the wig but, it said it came with the red bow, which it didn&#x27;t and instead came with a wig cap and probably the cheapest hair tie I&#x27;ve seen. Overall the quality is really high and the color is just as shown. Doesn&#x27;t tangle that easily and needs to be styled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great when I got it it was a tiny bit frizzy and tangled but that&#x27;s about it love the color and everything. When I got it I had to cut the bangs but nothing major. Overall I love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my phone can&#x27;t upload a photo to amazon?? But this is beautiful, have to trim the bangs some and layer bangs a tiny bit to give it a more natural look, the back shows a tiny bit when your wearing it but I&#x27;ve seen worse. The color and length is beautiful, yeah it tangles easy but so does natural hair so just gently brush it out haha xD this is my very first wig and I was nervous to try it but I love it hehe it&#x27;s even adjustable in the wig, nice</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color or length I thought it was and did not come with the bows as said.</li>
    <li> Tangled a bit but you can expect that from wigs. Other than that, was good quality</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the bows, but not a problem as I had bought the uniform which includes clip on bows.&lt;br /&gt;Pre-tied so no need to mess with it and its light enough to not weigh down the back of your head.</li>
    <li> Took a while to recieve, tangled horribly as soon as I pulled it out of the bag so it&#x27;s completely unmanageable:(</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful! It came with bows and was already styled! It was super thick and was perfect. I highly recommend this buyer. They also gave me a little gift!!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> Personally I thought the wig was very accurate! The bangs might be too long so I cut them just above my nose and not to mention that the hair is very, very long! I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 and the hair pasts my butt and I&#x27;m having a hard time trying to get rid of it&#x27;s tangles...&lt;br /&gt;So it might get tangled quickly but overall it&#x27;s nice quality and looks good.</li>

    <li> Such a stunning wig! I love it so much It&#x27;s incredible! The pigtails in the back and the pink spiky back hair is already done for you, and the company even gave me a hair tie with a little golden apple charm as thanks! It&#x27;s so lovely!! The wig took about 0.9 seconds to get on, and needs little to no alterations or fixing, despite a little frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again and again and again!</li>
    <li> I just received my wig today, the delivery date was for February 10 but it came so much sooner which is amazing. I didn&#x27;t get the extra shipping because my convention isn&#x27;t until August, I was in no hurry. The pink is absolutely perfect and it is so soft. The wig is obviously a great quality, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle to bad like my Hatsune Miku wig, which is amazing. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how incredibly long it was. The bangs came down past my chin and both the front and back pigtails were super long. But nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with a little cut. The little pointy parts are pre-styled and stick up well but get lost in the rest of the hair very easily. Overall I am super happy with this purchase and will look for more wigs from this buyer~</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expect and looks and feels really nice. The wig doesn&#x27;t have the fringe cut the same as in the picture, but it&#x27;s still great. The wig comes with a wig cap and with ribbons, and the ponytails are already in it with some rubber bands so it&#x27;s mostly styled for you (:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect I love it but it tangles easly. Other than that the wig is out of this world and very silky and long.</li>
    <li> it tangles pretty easily and i had to cut the bangs but thats about it other than that its perfect :)</li>
    <li> REALLY LONG. but it&#x27;s good quality. Had to cut the bangs.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! The color is gorgeous (i could literally stare at it all day tbh) and the wig itself is silky, its has a nice shine to it and the tangles are very manageable, detangling is easy. The wig is thick just as i like it! I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and the wig goes down to my hips. The only reason that i gave this a 4 star is because that this doesn&#x27;t seem to be used as a character wig.  1) When I put it in low pigtails like Yuno&#x27;s the wefts on the cap would show.  2) Yuno&#x27;s hair flippy thing on the sides, It was awkwardly cut and was kinda hard for my to style along with it.  3) i kinda noticed that the color was more of a vibrant light pink than a dull mild pink. If you like it a vibrant pink then that&#x27;s totally great! I just prefer a sandyish tone to it.  I think in my opinion it would be a very good wig for Super Sonico or maybe even Luka!</li>
    <li> THIS.WIG.IS.PERFECTION.OKAY. It&#x27;s super long,soft and thick! The color is absolutely spot on it&#x27;s a reddish pink and it looks just like Yuno&#x27;s hair. The bangs came already cut!!! MAKE SURE YOU ORDER IT DIRECTLY FROM CF-FASHION so that you will get the exact wig with the bangs and everything. It even comes with the red ribbons and a free hairband too!! And they wrote a cute little letter. I DEFINITELY reccomend this wig. IT feels and looks like real hear it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m using this at cons!!!</li>
    <li> It is a very silky eig and very good quality. Nice and thick. Though the only thing is that it came like a week late and mine did not even come with the bows :/ but other than that it is a nice color and an overall beautiful wig</li>
    <li> Horrible. I just can&#x27;t. Let me tell you the color is spot on yuno and the length is long and it does come styled except for the bangs. Everything seemed perfect straight out the bag but....it sheds like crazy and tangles with just a touch. I literally just ran my hand through and it was tangled after I spent an hour or more untangling it. And if it was just that I&#x27;d be okay you know I bought it for $28. (Which sucks cus now I see it at $14 &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;) well to top it off its super thin. Yes the bangs are thick but the back of the head is way too thin. You could see the netting and my hair through it. I&#x27;m so frustrated. I waited for this for over a month super excited checking to see everyday if it came. I was utterly disappointed. And my money is basically in the trash because of it. Now I&#x27;m going to go spend an extra $40 on an arda wig.</li>
