### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent Hair Care product for the purpose listed on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference though.</li>
      <li>The product did make my scalp tingle which felt good</li>
      <li>this is a great product and have been very happy withe it and will continue to purchase it in the future</li>
      <li>After 10 days I can honestly say that my scalp has thicken.  </li>
      <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t know that it helped with my problem of noticeably thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>I truely believe this stuff is great for your scalp and promotes a healthy hair environment for hair to grow.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products to try to stop my hair loss which I believe is genetic.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>After having used most of the vials, I cannot see any difference.</li>
      <li>It feels ok.</li>
      <li>I used 10 treatments in the Spring (one box of this stuff), as recommended on the box since that is when hair is most dormant and susceptible to breakage, and will do 10 more treatments (one more box) in the fall.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy any more of this product.  </li>
      <li>but then once I started using these products my hair started falling out more and more in the shower</li>
      <li>My hair for sure has more volume to it, I love this product and plan continued use.</li>
      <li>Smell is nice and ordered on Friday and got following Mon or Tue.</li>
      <li>This product really helps!</li>
      <li>My hair was starting to get better after just stopping the medications I had taken that caused orginal hari loss and taking vitamins</li>
      <li>I did read that you may lose some hair at first</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I know it shouldn&#x27;t really work that quickly, but it really feels different, in my case.  </li>
      <li>but my I certainly have new options for hairstyles.</li>
      <li>HAVE used in past and liked.</li>
      <li>Right now, I do not believe this product was worth all the money I spent.</li>
      <li>Tried this product with high expectations.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect new hair to appear</li>
      <li>Takes a long time to notice cessation of hair loss, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting change with the first box.</li>
      <li>and I noticed an immediate increase in the body of my naturally thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an early 30something white boy</li>
      <li>I purchased this Intensive Treatment to boost my daily regimen, but nothing so far.</li>
      <li>I do have new hair growing - it has been about 9 weeks now and the hair is all over my head and is about 1 1/2 inches long.  </li>
      <li>It DOES makes the hair appear a little thicker, but again, there is supposed to be some new follicle action with this system</li>
      <li>Realize, I have always had thin fine hair, and wanted something to help me grow fuller healthier hair.  </li>
      <li>Other than making my scalp tingle, I have seen ZERO new hair follicles rejuvenating on my head two months later.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Takes a long time to notice cessation of hair loss, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting change with the first box. I do notice change at the temples and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I did not see a dramatic result.</li>
    <li> I started using this with the shampoo and toner about 3 weeks ago.  I have noticed a big improvement in my hair. I know it shouldn&#x27;t really work that quickly, but it really feels different, in my case.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to try to stop my hair loss which I believe is genetic.  I noticed that my hair appeared fuller after just a few days of using the product.  After 10 days I can honestly say that my scalp has thicken.  Now I&#x27;m not saying that I suddenly have my youthful hair back, but it&#x27;s definitely  an improvement. The only drawback is that they recommend you wash hair everyday, which could be a real chore especially if you have long hair.  I decided to wash my hair every other day but still use the product every day.  My hair didn&#x27;t look dirty and on the second day I wore a pony tail.  I intend to use this product every change of season. Stay tuned and we&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
    <li> It feels ok. After having used most of the vials, I cannot see any difference.</li>
    <li> HAVE used in past and liked. Tried this time alone and have sprouts after 5 days. Last time used the intrafoce kit. Really only need to buy this product to jump start ur hair. Will buy again. Smell is nice and ordered on Friday and got following Mon or Tue.</li>
    <li> This product really helps! I have been having hair loss problems for a while and tried a lot of things... This product was definitely part of the solution.</li>
    <li> Takes only a short time to use, and my hair does seem to be thicker than when I started over a year ago.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Been using the Intra Force Hair Advance three step treatment for two weeks and I noticed an immediate increase in the body of my naturally thinning hair. I don&#x27;t expect new hair to appear but my I certainly have new options for hairstyles. Five stars for increased hair thickness and two stars for regrowth (I&#x27;m skeptic)</li>
    <li> I used 10 treatments in the Spring (one box of this stuff), as recommended on the box since that is when hair is most dormant and susceptible to breakage, and will do 10 more treatments (one more box) in the fall. Other than making my scalp tingle, I have seen ZERO new hair follicles rejuvenating on my head two months later. I&#x27;m an early 30something white boy and so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see on the final results. Right now, I do not believe this product was worth all the money I spent. I will absolutely change my review in late fall if I notice a difference after the 2nd treatment. Meanwhile, I am committed to using Redken&#x27;s daily shampoo/conditioner/scalp treatment system for one year. It DOES makes the hair appear a little thicker, but again, there is supposed to be some new follicle action with this system and I&#x27;m just not seeing it, yet. I purchased this Intensive Treatment to boost my daily regimen, but nothing so far. Boo.</li>
    <li> My hair was starting to get better after just stopping the medications I had taken that caused orginal hari loss and taking vitamins but then once I started using these products my hair started falling out more and more in the shower and I didn&#x27;t like how it felt after using it. I did read that you may lose some hair at first but it got so bad I just couldn&#x27;t take the chance and keep using it!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 10 days (that&#x27;s the number of vials in the box).  The product did make my scalp tingle which felt good but I honestly don&#x27;t know that it helped with my problem of noticeably thinning hair.  My hair is still noticeably thin.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy any more of this product.  Too expensive to not notice any difference after 10 days.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical, but figured what do I have to lose and wanted to try.  I knew it could not be bad for my hair.... So I bought it.  I also purchased the Scalp Stimulant that I use 1x monthly, and purchased the shampoo/conditioner.  I have actually rebought this one - the Intensive Treatment and plan to use 1 of the small bottles 1x every month.  I do have new hair growing - it has been about 9 weeks now and the hair is all over my head and is about 1 1/2 inches long.  Realize, I have always had thin fine hair, and wanted something to help me grow fuller healthier hair.  I truely believe this stuff is great for your scalp and promotes a healthy hair environment for hair to grow.  I don&#x27;t think I will rebuy the shampoo/conditioner but will continue with this teatment.</li>
    <li> I actually think it&#x27;s growing hair ... call me crazy, but it seems to be.  My hair for sure has more volume to it, I love this product and plan continued use.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and have been very happy withe it and will continue to purchase it in the future</li>
    <li> Have yet to try the product on a regular basis. Received in gd.condition</li>
    <li> After completing the entire pack of hair treatments, I saw no difference in the thickness of my hair</li>
    <li> Tried this product with high expectations. I used it every other day as opposed to everyday as suggested. Unfortunately, it dried my hair terribly. Left it brittle with breakage. I only used half the package and tossed the rest.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It gives my hair some body and makes my hair easier to manage.  I&#x27;ve been told by several people my hair looks thicker.</li>
    <li> I just went for my package, and they ship the wrong product, the sent me. Intra force scalp stimulate instead of Redken Intra Force Hair Advance - Intensive Treatment For Noticeably Thinning Hair (10 Unidoses x .21 oz.)</li>
    <li> Excellent Hair Care product for the purpose listed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken is a name that you can trust always</li>
    <li> Great product, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference though.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. No improvement in my hair.</li>
