    <li> Helps to detangle my hair but has an awkward smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair. I have 4c hair thick and long, mid back</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because the ingredients list alcohol although it is the last thing listed. I always thought of alcohol as being detrimental to hair but so far so good. It has been 3 weeks and my hair has definitely improved. Less tangling and easier to comb. It smells very nice also which lingers for a couple of days after use. I definitely will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> it detangles my kids hair very well it really helps me to want to comb their hair. not the best in smell but if you use a moisturizer after you wont smell anything.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would help prevent my hair from breaking since I&#x27;m in a deployed location and the water is rough. It makes my hair really dry and brittle. The worse I&#x27;ve used.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has been making much of a difference in my hair health. I use it as recommended and have been using it a little over a month. It does make my hair wet and when it dries it is frizzy. I personally like the smell.  Its not so strong once it dries. I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair frizzy but I love the ingredients.  Waiting to see results. .</li>
    <li> Good leave-in conditioner. The smell is a bit different and overpowering at first, but I have gotten use to it and actually like it now.</li>
    <li> Very good product for conditioning and detangling hair.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SMELL AND INGREDIENTS, I&#x27;M NOT CERTAIN IF IT DETANGLES THAT GREAT, BUT I DID NOTICE I DIDN&#x27;T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR WHEN I WASHED AND COMBED MY VERY THICK KINKY NATURAL HAIR.</li>
    <li> Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In is a product come true for me , at this time I am using it only just to see how my have like it, so far so good. I try to make sure I keep it in stock! I am happy !</li>

    <li> It smells like pickles to me...strange</li>
    <li> Great product, my hair is natural and it works well.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a product that promotes hair growth, and read all about Jamaican black castor oil.  After four weeks of using this product, I swear my hair has grown nearly an inch.  I am also using Jamaican black castor oil, applying it to my scalp every other day.  I would assume the two products compliment one another as far as hair growth is concerned.  I am not too impressed with its ability to detangle hair.  I still use Johnson and Johnson detangler on top of this product to remove my tangles.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. smells horrible, but supposed to be with healthy ingredients inside. I&#x27;m white with thin curly hair and I use it on my hair. My daughter is mixed with thin dry fro and it does nothing for her hair. I use the same line shampoo and conditioner for her and works great. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the smell. This leave-in treatment feels like water on her hair. but on mine it helps define my curls w/out making my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of all natural products on my hair to see which one yields the best results and this gave me the Results i was looking for. It leaves your hair soft, well conditioned, and gives it a great glow.</li>
    <li> Wife liked it but it has a smell</li>
    <li> not for my type of hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product that arrived in great condition. It&#x27;s wonderful on natural, curly hair during the detangling process. I use this and a Hair Bean to have pain free detangling. I&#x27;m not giving it five stars only because this product did not help to give my hair shine, but it did give it moisture.</li>
    <li> I like the idea that this can be left in the hair without residue.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this. I have bought this twice and I will buy again</li>
    <li> I see I difference in my hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I use it on my sister locks.My hair is healthy and growing nicely.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best leave in conditioning , moisturizing spray I have used on my transitioning hair. It works great on the natural section and relaxed portion. I&#x27;ve been using it since the start of my transition. My hair is soft for days, I apply it every 2 days for a refresher..great product!!</li>
    <li> just as good as the other products, will order more soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product ! It is wonderful for your hair especially if you have a dry scalp! I use it on my hair after a cowashing. It is great for moisturizing your scalp while wearing a two strand twist out style.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair tangle-free, and easy to comb... I wear a grey natural.  Maintain hair end in place all day.  Haven&#x27;t been using long enough to show any hair growth.... but still have hopes.  Also using the Black Castor Oil daily .. the oil is dark in color, but does not tint the grey hairs... that&#x27;s what I was afraid of!.... So get some to help make you  hair shine!</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever made my hair this strong and soft without adding oil and causing build up.  Too hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this product , I have tried many products over the last year for nautrual hair, many made my hair hard to manage very tangle; but this leave in conditioner made my hair easy  to manage and a breeze to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Ejc</li>
    <li> Makes hair super soft without build up.  I use it every other day and it makes my natural hair more manageable....love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this leaves my hair feeling , it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Leaves my natural hair feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> will be a staple in my hair care -- the castor oil is very key to moisture!!!!  This also has some protein in it and aloe VERY good product!!!!  I will re-order when needed but a little lasts a LONG while!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, use it every day! I like the entire company. My granddaughter askes me to spray this on her very long, very curly hair every time she comes over. It is a very good detangler.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  It adds moisture to the hair and especially if it is added to the ends after shampoo.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my hair and my daughters hair. I spray this along with the coconut/ b.castor oil and water mix i made. I can come right thorugh her hair and style it and my 7mo. old no longer fusses. I wasn&#x27;t to fond of the smell it is very strong b/c of the rosemary but i cut the smell with 1-2 drops of citrus oils, peppermint or lavender oil and perfecto.</li>
