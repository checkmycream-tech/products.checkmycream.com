      <li>I can tell my menopausal symptoms are much better.</li>
      <li>, just added this to the regimen after reading a recommendation in the book, &amp;#34;Trim, Healthy Mama&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s quite okay</li>
      <li>I learned about this through Trim Healthy Mama and love the authors.</li>
      <li>I will reup on this stuff for sure and I will choose this product again.</li>
      <li>i had run out and thought i might be ok with just progesterone</li>
      <li>this stuff is great and it works fast.  </li>
      <li>I found the Life Flo Estriol care and love it.</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research about the possibility of this causing me any health problems and found that it seemed to be safe to use.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It takes time to feel affects, but I am feeling better now at three months.</li>
      <li>I do better on the combination of Estriol and Estradiol and not the stand Alone Estriol Care product offered by Life Flo.</li>
      <li>I tried this cream instead and am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I should also point out how much I love the brand,</li>
      <li>Its okay,</li>
      <li>Together with a progesterone cream and a healthy lifestyle, I&#x27;m hoping to prevent menopausal symptoms and the return of breast cancer sans radical surgery, drugs or chemo.</li>
      <li>I found another Estrogen cream that works better.</li>
      <li>I will continue using it to see if it continues to agree with my body and helps my emotions through menopause, which is a challenging time.  </li>
      <li>I sleep more soundly than I have in 5 years!  </li>
      <li>and I am happy with it so far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally, I fly frequently for business.  </li>
      <li>Good product, reasonable price</li>
      <li>I love the texture and the feel of this cream, it is really rich and soothing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the pump bottle (creamy foam) lasts about a month of applications.</li>
      <li>Love the product but the second purchase was a disaster as the pump didn&#x27;t work and after trying everything my husband sawed off the top with the band saw!!</li>
      <li>I like this Life-Flo Estriol lotion because it is easy to apply, feels fine, and I need it.  </li>
      <li>I like how smooth it is to apply and spread into my skin.</li>
      <li>Important to speak w your doc or a homeopathic to remedy your symptoms .</li>
      <li>It is just so fantastic that we can get this stuff over the counter.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheaper and parabane free.</li>
      <li>This is a great price for a product I use regularly and that lessens my menopausal symptoms.  </li>
      <li>parabin free &amp; hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>i received this today and slapped some on right away and felt better within an hour.  </li>
      <li>Also, the cream does&#x27;nt smell like much amd it blends into skin very easily with no residue.</li>
      <li>The product is fine and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>help me a lot with hot flashes,it&#x27;s really worth it!!</li>
      <li>(pure mag oil, retinol A 1%, progesta-care) and have been pleased with them all.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural/homeopathic products to reduce hot flashes without success until I tried this product.  </li>
      <li>Yet to find a good doctor locally.</li>
      <li>And you end up spending more because you use so much of it.</li>
      <li>I know it is important for women like myself who are in menopause to continue with the right form of estrogen.  </li>
      <li>I saw that other customers were using this and found that it was great for their faces.  </li>
      <li>so amazon so kindly sent me a second bottle for free.</li>
      <li>I like the unscented cream - a bit waxy but absorbs quickly except on the face - bit too sticky for that</li>
      <li>so she discontinued using quite quickly.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this after reading the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Hope this continues and the medicine/pharmacy monopoly is broken without losing the best.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>honestly I&#x27;m glad I tried this product; hot flashes are less, my skin looks and feels amazing..</li>
      <li>But the price was right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is tricky, however, to find the right dose.</li>
      <li>Price is right too.</li>
      <li>The amount of hormone appears to be about right for me...</li>
      <li>cant even take off my wedding ring right now because of the weightgaining.</li>
      <li>My doctor prescribed it for this purpose; and luckily, I discovered that it really helped my insomnia.</li>
      <li>This did not help my hot flashes very much at all.</li>
      <li>I continue to have hot flashes &amp; night sweats.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using over a month.. honestly I&#x27;m glad I tried this product; hot flashes are less, my skin looks and feels amazing..couldn&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> FIRMS BREASTS, NEEDED BEORE AND AFTER LOSING MENSURATION</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for my face. My daughter recommended it to me, and it seems to smooth out my lines a little. It is fragrance free, which I like, an a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like this product, being menopausal it helps me sleep at night and also helps boost my mood. I use about half the dose recomended and it works for me!</li>
    <li> WOW i feel fantastic - twenty years younger; no night sweats or hotflashes, more energy, even less achy in the joints ( apparently asian women are really prone to &#x27;menopausal arthritis&#x27; ) The pump is easier to use than the spoon that came with the first BHRT cream  i tried - combined progesterone/estriol from Serati. You must use it with progesterone cream. Since the Lifeflo progesterone comes in a separate tube I can tailor my doses.   I like the unscented cream - a bit waxy but absorbs quickly except on the face - bit too sticky for that so it&#x27;s lost a star (and the packaging could be prettier ;) Be careful to wash your hands afterwards and not to get it on anyone else  especially kids or blokes! This is my 4th BHRT month - no major downsides yet. I have only just started trying it on the face - half a pump a day. Will post back comments later.  Yet to find a good doctor locally. So much great information on the web and the appropriate tests are easy to organise. It&#x27;s great to be able to buy this online without having to be told what to do or have my health held to ransom by an uninformed doctor. (they are usually so pompous and won&#x27;t listen if you come in with a \\&quot;shopping list \\&quot;!) Hope this continues and the medicine/pharmacy monopoly is broken without losing the best.</li>
    <li> it was not good for me!</li>
    <li> WORKS but unfortunately contains phenoxyethanol</li>
    <li> I tried this on different days and times and realized that it was not a coincidence that each time I applied the product, I started feeling depressed a few hours later.  I stayed off for a week and tried again and same thing happened.  I had no energy or enthusiasim for anything.  Maybe just wrong for me and ok for others but I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Feel like teen again!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using prescription estrogen, this works just as well for me.</li>
    <li> I guess I can&#x27;t give this a good review get. The first bottle I purchased wouldn&#x27;t pump at all so amazon so kindly sent me a second bottle for free. I have used it for about 2 weeks and I am not sure if I notice any difference. I think I need to give it longer!</li>
    <li> Very helpful. Feeling more energetic for having my hormones balance out. Less hot flashes. They are not completely gone, but I am sleeping much better and am more comfortable and less emotionally edgy during the daytime. I use the Lavender Progesterone Cream by Now as well as the NOW Menopause capsules along with this 2 x day.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it will work but is easy to use.</li>
    <li> love love love! Absolutely necessary in my pharmacy now</li>
    <li> It takes time to feel affects, but I am feeling better now at three months.</li>
    <li> I love this cream especially since it reduces all of the menopausal symptons without having to use higher potency estrogens like estradiol. Below is a link to article on Estriol that I found to be quite good.    I should also point out how much I love the brand, Life-flo. I have tried several of their other products (pure mag oil, retinol A 1%, progesta-care) and have been pleased with them all.    [ ... ]</li>
    <li> The pump did not work.  I have no idea how the actual product works because I couldn&#x27;t get any out.  I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure after two months of use that I&#x27;m finding any improvements.  the price is good and the automatic shipping is dependable.  the cream rubs in nicely, like so many of these things I guess it would depend on what you expect.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I can tell my menopausal symptoms are much better. I got it on time. Buy  it!</li>
    <li> disappointed in difficulty in applying it. It takes forever to rub on, if you touch where it has been applied hours later, you can still feel it. The amount that is pumped out is also a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a different brand to try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to resolve hot flashes. I am 56 years old and recently stopped HRT after 10 years following a hysterectomy. I wanted something that did not have the negative side effects. After extensive research, I came across this and after only three days, my hot flashes have completely disappeared!!! I&#x27;ve been suffering from the hot flashes for  the past year now and nothing has helped. I am absolutely amazed with this product and have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> As a menopausal woman with low estrogen, this stuff gives me just the right amount with out being toxic to my body</li>
    <li> Not for me! I tried it for about 2 weeks and had muscle cramping and headaches. By far the worst thing was insomnia. I&#x27;m choosing to ride this out going solo without Estriol</li>
    <li> I tired this because the prescriptions weren&#x27;t working.  They got rid of my hot flashes, but the side effects were unlivable.  I tried vaginal estrogen cream, but it interferes with certain aspects of my sex life.  I tried oral HRT, and it nauseated me.  I tried the estrodiol patch, and the adhesive raised welts on me.  Both of these made my hotflashes disappear but the side effects were too much.  So, i tried this.  Just finished off a bottle faster faster than I expected, and there was no change in my hot flashes despite using it 2x day.  I&#x27;m going to try the Phytoestrogen cream (estro-care) by LifeFlo instead and see if that helps instead.</li>
    <li> I like this Life-Flo Estriol lotion because it is easy to apply, feels fine, and I need it.  I have only been using it a few days and I am happy with it so far.  I know it is important for women like myself who are in menopause to continue with the right form of estrogen.  What my research has shown me is it&#x27;s best to use Estriol.  I will continue using it to see if it continues to agree with my body and helps my emotions through menopause, which is a challenging time.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Dr. John Lee, whom wrote: &#x27;What your&lt;br /&gt;doctor may not want you to know about Breast Cancer&#x27;, recommends 2-5mg per day of Estriol. Some of the other similar products deliver too much. An hour or so after it&#x27;s use, I get a \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling inside; makes me feel good. Together with a progesterone cream and a healthy lifestyle, I&#x27;m hoping to prevent menopausal symptoms and the return of breast cancer sans radical surgery, drugs or chemo. No parabens, good price, appreciate the pump. Of course, I must check my hormone levels at least every 6 months to ensure dosing is correct for my body chemistry. Sex drive is improved; men no longer completely disgust me!!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s possible that I like this, but have&#x27;t had it long enough to give a great review yet. I learned about this through Trim Healthy Mama and love the authors. I have only been using this for about a week, so maybe I&#x27;ll give another review in a month or so. I will buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I use this as a daytime face cream, it definitely decreases the appearance of wrinkles.  Plus, I will also use this if I am needing some lubricant since by body is in the change of seasons......</li>
    <li> This did not help my hot flashes very much at all. I gave it a try but I will not reorder. I found another Estrogen cream that works better.</li>
    <li> It starts out working good for the hotflashes, weightgain etc. but then it back fires each time on me and I actually have more hotflashes, Insomnia and I cant even take off my wedding ring right now because of the weightgaining. It&#x27;s a hormone and usually our body regulates it automatically but as you get older and have to replace the lost hormones by ourselves we cant regulate it like our bodies do so we either benefit from it for a little while and then it backfires so, I just discontinued use and I actually feel better than I thought I did with out it. Hormones are a dangerous thing to take if their not Monitored by a doctor so good luck! Also, the cream does&#x27;nt smell like much amd it blends into skin very easily with no residue. I&#x27;d like top add that I had to go back on the cream after awhile because of my symptoms . I feel good again but now I&#x27;m getting terible headaches! Has anyone else gotten headaches from using the cream? Help!</li>
    <li> FYI ladies- The difference between this BiEstro Care and the Estriol Care is that the BiEstro Care also contains Estradiol which I uptake well. Some women do fine on Estriol only- but I do not. I need the pure form which this has. Estriol is is the pregnancy hormone and is only found in large amounts during pregnancy, whereas estradiol is found in all women. A developing fetus and placenta produces the estriol hormone naturally. Estradiol is also a sex hormone that is found in premenopausal women. It is vitally important for sexual and reproductive health, but it also affects other bodily organs, such as the skeletal system. It is very similar to estriol, but has a few differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estradiol is found in large quantities in young women who can still bear children. Estriol, on the other hand, comes mainly from the fetus during a pregnancy. Therefore, post-menopausal women and non-pregnant young women have similar levels of estriol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person can find estradiol throughout the entire body, as it is produced in the brain and arteries. Even fat cells create estradiol before and after menopause in women. Men who are obese tend to produce too much estradiol, which can cause bodily feminization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women who are going through menopause commonly use estriol and estradiol as part of a hormone therapy or hormone replacement treatment to relieve symptoms such as incontinence and vaginal dryness. The hormones comes in cream form and pill form for convenience. Synthetic estrogens typically are available through pharmacies, but in most countries, one needs a doctor&#x27;s prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This excerpt was taken from some medical references online that explain the diffs. I do better on the combination of Estriol and Estradiol and not the stand Alone Estriol Care product offered by Life Flo. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This cream comes in a pump container that distributes about a penny size dab with every pump. I have used it less than 10 times and it is already out of cream. Certainly NOT 2 oz !!! The container is SEALED so I cannot see if there is any cream still left at the bottom. I cannot cut open the container because it it a very hard plastic.</li>
    <li> The product is fine and absorbs quickly.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work well and I hope it doesn&#x27;t fail before cream is gone.</li>
    <li> I have use this product faithfully for over 5 years- it&#x27;s great (a LIFE SAVER as far as I&#x27;m concerned!)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Im 35 &amp; it has literally taken 10 years off the face, cleared up my acne &amp; shrunken my pores by 3/4 the usuall size....parabin free &amp; hypoallergenic. .very small amount of bio identical hormones so it increases elasticity &amp; collagen production</li>
    <li> help me a lot with hot flashes,it&#x27;s really worth it!! and the prices are excellent compare to the natural stores.Go for it!!</li>
    <li> Good but a bit pricey for what it is</li>
    <li> It does what is needed, but I was disappointed to find that the label says, &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34; when I purchased it for vaginal use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural/homeopathic products to reduce hot flashes without success until I tried this product.  I was cynical due to past experience but I have been nicely surprised with this product.  Within 4 days of use, my hot flashes were greatly diminished and I had fewer of them.  I used to be kept awake with hot flashes and sweating but no more.  I sleep more soundly than I have in 5 years!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Such a bummer! I was so excited to try this after reading the positive reviews. I used it for 3 months and nothing changed.  I ended up going to a natural doctor.  I got a prescription for a complete bioidentical cream instead.  It may work for you if you are just beginning menopause. I&#x27;m in the middle so it&#x27;s a &#x27;no-go&#x27; for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted a small size of this to try it out.  This small, inexpensive product was what I needed.  I love the texture and the feel of this cream, it is really rich and soothing.  The amount of hormone appears to be about right for me... however time will tell if I need to step up or step down.  I will reup on this stuff for sure and I will choose this product again.</li>
    <li> I read in Suzanne Somers book about bio-identical hormones.  I am now getting estrogen plus this mixed into a cream by a compounding pharmacy. The doses are much higher in the compounding pharmacy product.  Even if the dose is the same... its a stronger product.  My hormones cost $100 per month. So if you can&#x27;t afford a compounding pharmacy you could take this plus the estrodiol and at least you&#x27;d have something.  but as I said the difference is night and day.  My skin is looking younger and my hair all within about 2 months after going on compounding pharmacy version.</li>
    <li> The best brand I have used and I&#x27;ve used many! This formula has a decent fragrance and is not irritating to the skin. It works to balance the hormones wonderfully!</li>
    <li> great way to help control hormones</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a product I use regularly and that lessens my menopausal symptoms.  It was recommended to me by a health food co-op owner.</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to work as well as others that I have used.  But the price was right.</li>
    <li> They need to rework their formula</li>
    <li> Love the product but the second purchase was a disaster as the pump didn&#x27;t work and after trying everything my husband sawed off the top with the band saw!! The bottles are not see through which would have helped to know I was getting low. I would suggest they use normal twist off cap bottles.</li>
    <li> Good product, reasonable price</li>
    <li> My wife uses this regularly. Fair price. We have been unable to purchase it in any stores, heath food or otherwise, so I am glad it is available through Amazon. She likes using it since going through menopause.</li>
    <li> I use this fairly regularly. It has helped me with postmenopausal vaginal dryness and belly fat. It&#x27;s easy to use and the pump bottle (creamy foam) lasts about a month of applications. The component I was looking for is the Estriol part of the product. I could not locate this in any of the health food or other types of stores so I order it online. Sometimes there is a deal for 2 pack.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Fixed my issues the first few days of use. Almost didn&#x27;t buy because of a few bad reviews, but I figured if it worked for some it&#x27;s worth a try. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> I saw that other customers were using this and found that it was great for their faces.  I have used it now and find that my tiny wrinkles on my face are much better.  I&#x27;m almost 70 and I think that this product has caused a real transformation in the brightness of my facial skin.  I get people who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while saying, hey you look great.  I did a lot of research about the possibility of this causing me any health problems and found that it seemed to be safe to use.  At the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I used it for almost three months. At first, I thought I was feeling better,&lt;br /&gt; but I didn&#x27;t know if my herbal pills are helping me or this products.&lt;br /&gt;However, my blood test shows it did not change any hormone level.&lt;br /&gt;One of the preservatives, phenoxyethanol comes before estriol in the ingredients, which is rated 4 with EWG. I do not want to put them on my skin for long time. As far as I see, other commercial products in the market are very similar to this. I am very disappointed, but I came to a conclusion that I need to get a prescription from my doctor to have my healthy bones and better memory back.</li>
    <li> started using the cream to help with the night sweats and mood swings. it works well.  I apple once a day and seems to help. would recommend.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great and it works fast.  i had run out and thought i might be ok with just progesterone but i was wrong.  i received this today and slapped some on right away and felt better within an hour.  it&#x27;s so hot here and i was sweating like crazy anyway but i also had that \\&quot;microwave\\&quot; feeling too that i knew was related to hormones.  i have spent MUCH more for the same results, why do that?  this is my estriol cream!!!  try it girls, it works and you&#x27;ll be so much happier and healthier.</li>
    <li> It is just so fantastic that we can get this stuff over the counter.  I am not saying that the cream base would be my first choice -- I generally like stuff that has no added chemicals like Hauschka.  But it&#x27;s quite okay and it is estriol that you can buy without a prescription.  May that continue for all of us.  It is so, so, so much more expensive to buy from a compounding pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, as I am sure most customers know, estriol is good to prevent drying out of the skin and vaginal dryness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s keep. It takes care of all my symtpoms.&lt;br /&gt;It is tricky, however, to find the right dose. Your needs change all the time, so change up when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;Melanie Konstantinidis</li>
    <li> Very helpful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheaper and parabane free. Its okay, but you have to use 3 times more of this stuff to get the same results as smokey mountains product. And you end up spending more because you use so much of it.</li>
    <li> It must be doing something, my face is breaking out like a teenager. I may have to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 different brands of estriol. This one is the best IMHO. I have no more hot flashes, feel less emotional, makes great face cream (seriously), and here is the TMI: felt like intimacy for 1st time in years. Price is right too.</li>
    <li> Mum asked me to get this for her and she finds a small amount makes her feel agitated so she discontinued using quite quickly. I think it is personal thing and people can take a few different types before finding a hrt suitable for them.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really report on effectiveness, but the lotion doesn&#x27;t have an odor and rubs in well.</li>
    <li> This product works great.....IF you are low in Estrogen.  Quality product.  Get hormone levels checked before taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it as well as their ProgestaCare.</li>
    <li> IF you can get this product OUT of its bottle, it works quite well.  The problem is the bottles, which are often defective.  They are supposed to measure out the precise amount of product for use, however, they frequently don&#x27;t work and there is no way to access the product any other way.  I am in the process of returning two of the bottles I purchased (out of about 5)  I have called the manufacturer to point this out and not only did they NOT seem concerned, they made it difficult and expensive to return them for functioning bottles.  I asked for my complaint to be escalated, but this made no impression on them, either.  Perhaps seeing it on Amazon might do the trick?  Otherwise, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I fly frequently for business.  This manufacturer needs to accommodate me with bottles of product which meet TSA carry-on liquids/creams restrictions.</li>
    <li> I like the applicator instead of measuring cream out of a jar, but it is a little erratic in its portions.</li>
    <li> Real messy and takes along time to soak in if it ever does. I don&#x27;t know if it is really working.</li>
    <li> Delivery was good.  Helped a little ....but....Product is not providing enough estrogen to care for my symptoms hence the 4 stars.  Important to speak w your doc or a homeopathic to remedy your symptoms .</li>
    <li> I have been on Hrt for 2 years, decided to wean myself off of them due to the potential risks involved. I found the Life Flo Estriol care and love it. I was having some vaginal dryness and the HRT wasn&#x27;t doing anything for it. After only a week, the problem is solved. I used a half a pump every day, external use only of course. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I started using this product as a face cream after it was recommended by THM. I like how smooth it is to apply and spread into my skin. I think I&#x27;ll purchase a second bottle to give it more time to see if I notice  the benefits others are mentioning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is room to list all the benefits of this cream.  Had a hysterectomy years ago and was on HRT until my doctor talked me into stopping about 2 years ago.  Then I heard doctors on the TV show &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; recommending vaginal estrogen cream for over active bladder.  I tried this cream instead and am glad I did.  I have been using this cream for over 1 week and only use 1 pump per day.  1 pump does put-out more cream than you might expect.  I originally ordered the 4-oz size, but through some delivery problems I found out that Amazon now only carries the 2-oz size.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Item as described.</li>
    <li> Life is so better with this!!</li>
    <li> This is the first estriol cream I&#x27;ve ever used, so I have no other product to compare it to. I&#x27;ve used it only for about a month and am using only about half or maybe a bit less than half a full pump at a time--almost every day. I skip about every fourth day and can&#x27;t really say why but that works best for me. It seems if I don&#x27;t skip a day every so often I get kind of wound up and snappish with my husband. At least it feels that way, though he hasn&#x27;t said anything to make me think he&#x27;s noticed--I&#x27;m very determined not to become a grouchy old lady. (lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fortunate in that menopause and post menopause have caused me very few problems. No problems really. Almost no symptoms other than a little dryness--vaginal and, well, pretty much everywhere. Using this cream does seem to help considerably in that department, even with the small amount I use. I&#x27;ll likely be ordering it again, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t so far had any of the trouble with the pump that some others have reported. Those reviews made me think twice about ordering, but I&#x27;m glad I ordered anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does make a remarkable face cream, though I don&#x27;t choose to use it there every time. I don&#x27;t have to. A little bit goes a long way...and that&#x27;s not the main reason I bought it. It&#x27;s just a little gravy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the closest I can get to the real thing for the price....&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;m grateful I found this product.</li>
    <li> I am high cancer risk; and I read that Estriol (the good estrogen, that helps get rid of bad estrogens) helps protect against breast cancer.  Also, my doctor made me go off of all other hormones, which caused terrible insomnia.  So I started using this before bedtime, and it helps me sleep (1/2 pump).  It also diminishes atrophy of the urethra, as we age.  My doctor prescribed it for this purpose; and luckily, I discovered that it really helped my insomnia.</li>
    <li> Seems like right after I started taking this I got a period and it lasted 5 days and came 14 days after I had just finished a hard period with heavy flow.  I am going through perimenopause though and not done with it yet.  Going to wait a few months and try it again.  It could just be the perimenopause.  ugh.  :(</li>
    <li> It works very well. No problems.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t help at all! I continue to have hot flashes &amp; night sweats. I followed the instructions by alternating where I placed to product, it didn&#x27;t work....so, I guess I just have to continue using a hand fan.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  I use it on my body and also on my face.</li>
    <li> My face loves this stuff and people have been asking me if I had a laser treatment&lt;br /&gt;Nope, just added this to the regimen after reading a recommendation in the book, &amp;#34;Trim, Healthy Mama&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I just feels it&#x27;s a great product at good price.  It allows&lt;br /&gt;womens to make their own choices.</li>
