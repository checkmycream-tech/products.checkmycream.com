### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great quality henna!</li>
      <li>Happy!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Best Henna I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>Rainbow Research has the best quality henna I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>My friend looks awesome.</li>
      <li>Eventhough this is color doesn&#x27;t show well in my hair, it&#x27;s a great conditioner!</li>
      <li>I use this with a mixture of indigo, coffee brewed, apple cider vinegar, and castor oil, for a good conditioning color hair pack twice a month to keep my gray at bay!  </li>
      <li>Colors my gray hairs beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have a wonderful reddish warmth to my light brown hair now.</li>
      <li>A silicone whisk (no metal) is really good for blending the henna and water without lumps.</li>
      <li>and I thought it was good until I tried some BAQ (body art quality) henna</li>
      <li>And by the way you will save money, because this pack is good for two month.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this hair color!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>She loved it and the fact that it was organic made it even better.</li>
      <li>I liked the price deal and will probably order more soon to mix colors.  </li>
      <li>More importantly, I got good results.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give it one more try but that smell...</li>
      <li>This has great color that actually stays, It is one of the best hennas I have found that I really like</li>
      <li>Henna has so many benefits</li>
      <li>Received the henna looks very fresh!  </li>
      <li>I love this Henna, it is wonderful for the hair, increases thickness and covers grey without harming.  </li>
      <li>I loved my color when it first came out</li>
      <li>Instructions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>When you apply to hair it smells strongly of hay or grass:</li>
      <li>Perfect color no more gray hair and hair became really healthy.</li>
      <li>Used the coffee and cider vinegar as suggested and the color and texture were fine,</li>
      <li>good price, made my hair very soft, all natural/chemical-free.  </li>
      <li>The instructions are in depth and easy to understand and give many good tips on color upkeep and alternate methods to using the henna.</li>
      <li>i have light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Yes it is cheap, but cheap is not helpful when the product does not work.</li>
      <li>Product was packed securely.</li>
      <li>The good points: gave me a very nice color, faded very slowly (could be a con if you were hoping for the 4-6 week washout they claim), easy to find,</li>
      <li>It covers all grey hair and adds great shine and body to all my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the best ratio for mixing the henna is 50 grams henna to 250 grams water (by weight), not too thick or too runny.</li>
      <li>it was a beautiful vibrant red just like I had imagined.</li>
      <li>Henna does give the most amazing realistic red colors, everyone thinks it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;PS</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling thick, soft and best of all the color is true and  exquisite and long lasting!</li>
      <li>My three year old thought it was especially funny</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna for about 20 years and this brand is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, there&#x27;s nothing majorly wrong with this product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to in terms of coloring &amp; conditioning hair; however, after using BAQ henna I can say there are definitely products far superior to this that will give you an easier and more pleasant henna experience.</li>
      <li>I used this and was pleased with the product overall.</li>
      <li>(Reviewing Persian Mahogany color): This is the first brand of henna I used</li>
      <li>Though I do wash my hair often I waited the 48 hours to shampoo as recommended and took care to just condition for the rest of the first week.</li>
      <li>so you may need to use more depending on your hair length, same ratios apply)</li>
      <li>It is super messy but the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand over all others out there!</li>
      <li>Also, have your plastic wrap ready to wrap around your head to keep things in place.</li>
      <li>It covers gray hair very well leaving a copper color silky finish.</li>
      <li>covers grey and easy to use</li>
      <li>I apply first to my roots, let it sit for an hour and then apply the rest of the warm henna to my hair and let it stay on for at least another hour, all the while covered in a plastic shower cap and wrapped in a towel.</li>
      <li>I used too many products to color my hair and without conditioner my hair was like old broom :) and became too thin.</li>
      <li>leave it on for a few hours (I did 4) and you get a beautiful dark red/auburn.</li>
      <li>this color on my grey hair was light and very orangey even when mixed with hot coffee instead of water.  </li>
      <li>My natural hair color is strawberry blonde and this henna turned it to a rich auburn.</li>
      <li>Hoping this will produce more long lasting even color.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few henna products but this is by far my favorite one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to get dirty for a good reason.</li>
      <li>of use - pretty simple</li>
      <li>Rich color, long lasting, no color &amp;#34;leakage&amp;#34; after use (other brands I&#x27;ve used leached color for days after I used it), no residue left- rinses out easily compared to others.</li>
      <li>odd but not bad.</li>
      <li>It is very subtle and a nice brownish red.</li>
      <li>a deep copper and my mother-in-law&#x27;s dark brown/black hair has a mahogany tint in the light, and even turned her white hairs to red highlights!</li>
      <li>The only dye that will give you a natural red/auburn color.  </li>
      <li>The color naturally highlights my red hair.</li>
      <li>Only used it once so far.</li>
      <li>I use it a little different then the instructions, I have a small dedicated for henna crockpot that I heat the henna in and keep it warm until I&#x27;m done applying.</li>
      <li>Washed out pretty well with very little color leeching after.</li>

<li> I followed the instructions and it turned my blonde hair GREEN!</li>
<li> Needs more water than instructions note, as instructed it comes out a thick mud that is very difficult to work through hair.</li>
<li> Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen.</li>
<li> So think long and hard.</li>
<li> i have bought all the colors to try except black!  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I have to color my hair from my 20th.</li>
<li> It took at least a dozen showers before the smell faded</li>
<li> The bad points: tends to be clumpy when mixed up, sour smell gave me terrible headaches and lingered in my hair for days (but I may have an indigo sensitivity), very gritty and extremely difficult to rinse out.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Clean up - Very difficult.</li>
<li> The powder is very difficult to rinse out.</li>

    <li> Great quality henna! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great! The color naturally highlights my red hair.</li>

I will try the Henna again as I have noticed my hair feels much healthier then when using chemical dyes and will try to use dry shampoo only for at least a week. I&#x27;m also going to try letting the henna sit over night in my refrigerator rather then just a couple hours. Hoping this will produce more long lasting even color.</li>
    <li> It covers gray hair very well leaving a copper color silky finish.</li>
    <li> Love this hair color! It is very subtle and a nice brownish red. Love it and I will be ordering it again in a different color too!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and it turned my blonde hair GREEN!</li>
    <li> If you are a neat freak henna is not for you. It&#x27;s fun to get dirty for a good reason. I have tried a few henna products but this is by far my favorite one. It is super messy but the results are amazing. My natural hair color is strawberry blonde and this henna turned it to a rich auburn. I love it! I would say to have someone to help, it is not essential but it does make the process a little easier. I sat in my bathtub to apply the product and my husband helped me to wipe off any henna I dropped during the application since it will stain your skin. Also, have your plastic wrap ready to wrap around your head to keep things in place. My three year old thought it was especially funny the Mommy had mud in her hair...he wanted some too. The instructions are in depth and easy to understand and give many good tips on color upkeep and alternate methods to using the henna.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far. Need to recolor soon. A bit messy  to work with but so much healthier for my hair. Used the coffee and cider vinegar as suggested and the color and texture were fine,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for about 20 years and this brand is my favorite so far. It covers all grey hair and adds great shine and body to all my hair.

(I have very short hair so you may need to use more depending on your hair length, same ratios apply)</li>
    <li> Color change - NONE&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use - pretty simple&lt;br /&gt;Clean up - Very difficult. The powder is very difficult to rinse out. Having read this in some reviews I decided to rinse, then coat my hair with conditioner/oil and let that set before rinsing the second and third times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would encourage anyone reading this review to avoid this product at all costs. Yes it is cheap, but cheap is not helpful when the product does not work.</li>
    <li> (Reviewing Persian Mahogany color): This is the first brand of henna I used and I thought it was good until I tried some BAQ (body art quality) henna and now I would never go back to Rainbow.  The good points: gave me a very nice color, faded very slowly (could be a con if you were hoping for the 4-6 week washout they claim), easy to find, good price, made my hair very soft, all natural/chemical-free.  The bad points: tends to be clumpy when mixed up, sour smell gave me terrible headaches and lingered in my hair for days (but I may have an indigo sensitivity), very gritty and extremely difficult to rinse out.  Bottom line, there&#x27;s nothing majorly wrong with this product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to in terms of coloring &amp; conditioning hair; however, after using BAQ henna I can say there are definitely products far superior to this that will give you an easier and more pleasant henna experience.</li>
    <li> This has great color that actually stays, It is one of the best hennas I have found that I really like</li>
    <li> Received the henna looks very fresh!  I use this with a mixture of indigo, coffee brewed, apple cider vinegar, and castor oil, for a good conditioning color hair pack twice a month to keep my gray at bay!  I leave it on for 2 hours watch tv, cruise the internet with plastic wrapped hair, then shampoo and condition it out!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Turned my auburn hair a deep copper and my mother-in-law&#x27;s dark brown/black hair has a mahogany tint in the light, and even turned her white hairs to red highlights! We mixed with coffee and lime juice and left in for 3 hours.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this brand, another color, med brown, see that for details.  this color on my grey hair was light and very orangey even when mixed with hot coffee instead of water.  it may be just what you want, i like the darker shade.  i have bought all the colors to try except black!  on gray hair, of course, it comes out  lighter.</li>
    <li> Eventhough this is color doesn&#x27;t show well in my hair, it&#x27;s a great conditioner! I love it! I will buy it again when I use all of it.</li>
    <li> My friend looks awesome. She loved it and the fact that it was organic made it even better. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have a wonderful reddish warmth to my light brown hair now.</li>
    <li> I love this Henna, it is wonderful for the hair, increases thickness and covers grey without harming.  Once you get the hang of using this product you won&#x27;t go back to harsh chemical hair dyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I been use this Henna  from 10 years ago</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have to color my hair from my 20th. I used too many products to color my hair and without conditioner my hair was like old broom :) and became too thin. So I remind myself about henna. Every two weeks you put it for like a couple hours (I like to sleep with this at night). Perfect color no more gray hair and hair became really healthy. And by the way you will save money, because this pack is good for two month. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do. No salon can fix this mistake</li>
    <li> Package received on time. Product was packed securely. I liked the price deal and will probably order more soon to mix colors.  Rainbow Research has the best quality henna I&#x27;ve ever used.  Colors my gray hairs beautifully.</li>
    <li> leave it on for a few hours (I did 4) and you get a beautiful dark red/auburn. i have light brown hair. I also mixed it with red zinger tea.</li>
    <li> Instructions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use.  More importantly, I got good results.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I used this and was pleased with the product overall. Needs more water than instructions note, as instructed it comes out a thick mud that is very difficult to work through hair. Washed out pretty well with very little color leeching after. When you apply to hair it smells strongly of hay or grass: odd but not bad. That is, until my next shower when it took me a bit to identify the rotting vegetation smell my hair was giving off. It took at least a dozen showers before the smell faded (thankfully it was only when hair was wet). I&#x27;m going to give it one more try but that smell...ugh!</li>
    <li> Best Henna I&#x27;ve ever used... Rich color, long lasting, no color &amp;#34;leakage&amp;#34; after use (other brands I&#x27;ve used leached color for days after I used it), no residue left- rinses out easily compared to others. Leaves my hair feeling thick, soft and best of all the color is true and  exquisite and long lasting! I highly recommend this brand over all others out there!</li>
    <li> The only dye that will give you a natural red/auburn color.  only thing I use now!</li>
    <li> When I add a little Apple cider vinegar, it totally covers my greys. Have been using this product for about 7-8 years. Happy!</li>
