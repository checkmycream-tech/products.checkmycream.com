      <li>You do have to make sure you have some dots on the brush</li>
      <li>I am officially an OPI convert :)</li>
      <li>I love these \\&quot;dots\\</li>
      <li>I like this, but I think I might prefer it without the micro glitter and more hex glitter.</li>
      <li>It looks great on bare nails too</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cute.  </li>
      <li>Nubar is fabulous and Black Polka Dot is the best!</li>
      <li>The large pieces of glitter are much more sparse than pictured here (unless you use many coats).</li>
      <li>Polish went on smooth.</li>
      <li>The polish dries totally smooth and glossy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this polish...very stylish!</li>
      <li>Very fun polish topper.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about this polish</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this polish from seeing the advertised picture</li>
      <li>polish applies very smoothly, the polka dots distribute very evenly and it&#x27;s a breeze to remove.</li>
      <li>My future daughter-in-law loved this gift and raved about the polish.</li>
      <li>i really thought that the dotes would be more like the picture shown--but they are not--</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>So... I think this nail polish gave me super powers.</li>
      <li>Looks very funny and sofisticated on my nails.</li>
      <li>This and the Nubar Polka Dots (White Polka Dot) go on nicely leaving cool speckles and dots.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to cathch big dots from the bottle but its ok.</li>
      <li>Im very happy with this nail polish, it last tremendously longer than I expected</li>
      <li>I enjoy this polish so much I bought another for a friend.  </li>
      <li>However, once the dots are in place the polish self-levels and is surprisingly smooth and very glossy.  </li>
      <li>Clear would be a better choice.</li>
      <li>its mostly a clear top coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun and flattering.</li>
      <li>Lots of spots and takes some time trying to get them on your nails just right.</li>
      <li>Since ordering this I found a product I like better and is much cheaper but live and learn.</li>
      <li>I felt smart!</li>
      <li>to use, fast dry, cruelty free : perfect, as usual with NUBAR nail products.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more polishes in this brand.</li>
      <li>I bought this before and the product had leaked, probably from being so hot here in vegas.</li>
      <li>Loventhis polish but wish there was more of the big glitter in it.</li>
      <li>there aren&#x27;t enough sparkles - needed 3 coats for it to look like it does in the picture - should be more concentrated</li>
      <li>This is pretty neat polish.</li>
      <li>I think this polish would look better if it was on a white background.</li>
      <li>The polish seems like it is composed of about 90% microglitter/10% dots, so being able to get some of the bigger dots onto your nails is already a bit of challenge.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this polish, since the swatches I had seen all showed something different.  </li>
      <li>My 3 year old was so excited to try this</li>
      <li>She is in her mid 20&#x27;s, although I think teens would also enjoy the fun dots.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and looks good.</li>

    <li> My future daughter-in-law loved this gift and raved about the polish. I felt smart! She is in her mid 20&#x27;s, although I think teens would also enjoy the fun dots. Polish lasts. Good value.</li>
    <li> Black different sized dots in clear polish.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this!!!</li>
    <li> So... I think this nail polish gave me super powers. I know it sounds crazy but it&#x27;s true. I bought this as a gift but I think that proximity and radioactive waste have led to me becoming super human. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you hang around radioactive waste but in the event you have you should really buy this. Oh and it looks nice too.</li>
    <li> The product is great. If you want the polka dots to really be seen, 2 coats should work. the first coat HAS to be dry otherwise the dots might move.&lt;br /&gt;Taking it off is the problem. It looks really great on, but when you are trying to take it off, the dots kinda latch onto the cotton ball or the wipe. You will just have to press down a little bit and use your nail to drag off the left over pieces, or press down for a few seconds with the acetone and then wipe.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old was so excited to try this it&#x27;s super cute.  You could also use it as a top coat. It&#x27;s kind of thick for my liking but I think it has to be to keep the dots on.  You do have to make sure you have some dots on the brush or you might get a nail with nothing on it.  It&#x27;s a good neutral polish that you can do a lot with. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received nothing but rave reviews while wearing this polish. I paired the polish with a peach color and the polka dots popped! I highly recommend this polish...very stylish!</li>
    <li> This polish came out muddy looking on my nails. I could pick out some of the individual little polka dots, but the rest of the polish just looked kind of messy, not really what the photo shows. I put the black polka dots over gold polish, and the gold just looked like it had a grey wash over it, with some random black dots. Looks like I will have to paint on dots when I want that look. This polish just doesn&#x27;t deliver good dots!!</li>
    <li> Every nail polish connoisseur needs a basic matte black glittery topcoat in their collection. The density on this one is just right, and it looks adorable when paired with a mint green for a mint-chocolate chip ice cream look.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on really well and has lots of micro glitter specks, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get the bigger glitter pieces on your nail - I got maybe one on each nail the first try and had to manipulate the larger pieces on my nail manually - this has potential - but definitely needs MORE large pieces of glitter in it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t check the other reviews before I bought this. I can barely see any glitter and there are barely any large hexagons at all. I purchased this in black and white and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I also didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the picture. I expected the polish color and the glitter but that was an error on my part.</li>
    <li> I love all types of glitter. Nubar Black Polka Dot is so unique! It contains a mixture of large flat-black hex glitter and small flat-black microglitter. When worn over creme polish, the flat black glitter really stands out! I love how it isn&#x27;t sparkly. It makes such a graphic statement. The one downside to this product is that the clear base is a bit thick, which makes it hard to apply. Also the glitter isn&#x27;t very densely packed in the base so you may need additional coats to achieve the look in the product swatch. This may mean you end up with a pretty hefty amount of polish on your nails. Just make sure you use a good top coat.</li>
    <li> I do not like that you have to use 2 or 3 coats to get it to really show up.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for this because on nails it looks no different than glitter polish with A dot of perhaps a marker.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this! I have used it over lavender and the white (like shown) and both times, it was a hit!</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GREATLY. ALTHOUGH THE BIGGER DOTS ARE KINDA HARDER TO APPLY TO THE NAIL BUT STILL CUTE</li>
    <li> I thought it was something totally diffeerent when i ordered it and was waiting for it to come in.But i need to  try it again because its been a while.</li>
    <li> Very fun polish topper.  Spices up any manicure (with a contrasting color, of course).</li>
    <li> There are barely any polka dots that actually get caught on the brush,  the majority is just tiny specs of glitter.  If I wanted tiny specs of glitter, I could buy any glitter nail polish at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you will get enough polka dots out of this nail polish, think again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money or time-- come to find out, I can&#x27;t return this type of item...GREAT!</li>
    <li> there aren&#x27;t enough sparkles - needed 3 coats for it to look like it does in the picture - should be more concentrated then it would be a great product</li>
    <li> This nail polish is fantastic! The dots adhere really well, they don&#x27;t pop off or get scuffed, and it stays on a really long time. This is a great product. I am officially an OPI convert :)</li>
    <li> I love these \\&quot;dots\\&quot; I think this polish is lovely. It is a wonderful contrast to any pretty bright summer color. The only problem is the dots sometimes peel off and leave naked colorless spots where polish should be.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this polish, since the swatches I had seen all showed something different.  When I actually tried it myself, it seemed a bit more sheer than I thought it would be. There&#x27;s a lot of the fine black glitter, but the bigger black glitters are elusive even after shaking the polish. It&#x27;s a bit of a struggle to make sure there are bigger black glitters (the \\&quot;dots\\&quot;) on each nail, and required fishing around and strategic placement.  However, once the dots are in place the polish self-levels and is surprisingly smooth and very glossy.  If there were more dots per brush-stroke, I&#x27;d give this five stars.</li>
    <li> I love this nailpolish, but it&#x27;s hard to get some of the bigger dots on the nail. You have to maneuver them a bit and make sure you&#x27;ve even picked them up. But then it&#x27;s hard to see considering the black brush... Clear would be a better choice. If you have a Nubar clear coat I would switch out the brushes.</li>
    <li> This and the Nubar Polka Dots (White Polka Dot) go on nicely leaving cool speckles and dots. Long lasting and looks good. Only wish that the big dots would be more frequent than shown in the  image.</li>
    <li> Nice opaque black glitter polish, dense enough to be evenly distributed over the nail. I like this, but I think I might prefer it without the micro glitter and more hex glitter.</li>
    <li> What an awesome top coat to add just the right amount of pop to your nails.It looks great on bare nails too</li>
    <li> This goes on great with just a base coat or on any colour!! Also, not difficult to take off with simple nail polish</li>
    <li> The polish seems like it is composed of about 90% microglitter/10% dots, so being able to get some of the bigger dots onto your nails is already a bit of challenge.  But then add in the fact that the dots are black, the bottle is black, and the brush to apply the polish is black, which means it&#x27;s impossible to see what you even have on your brush. It&#x27;s like painting blind. After three applications, I have some nails that have 3 dots on it and a couple of nails with that look like pepper exploded all over them in my attempt to get one freaking dot.  Perhaps if Nubar made the brush with clear fibers, it would be easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this polish from seeing the advertised picture but then I got the polish and it didn&#x27;t work as expected. The smaller dots are pretty evenly distributed but it is really hard to get the larger dots on your nail. Even after multiple coats there was still only a few Large dots because of this I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Lots of spots and takes some time trying to get them on your nails just right. Even so I still recommend this to all. The price was reasonable and the shipping came quicker then expected.</li>
    <li> Polish went on smooth. Very good distribution of dots. I will definitely be buying more polishes in this brand. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It only took me one coat, and I had absolutely no problem with the large flecks going on my nails as well as the smaller ones, I just had to use the bristles of the brush to wipe them on.  I didn&#x27;t try to get a perfectly even look.  I applied this overtop a robin&#x27;s egg blue color, and it made my nails look just like bird eggshells!  It went on very easily, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this polish so much I bought another for a friend.  The glitters are super-micro black with larger hex black dot glitters that are still quite small.  This is not a glitter top coat that screams at you, but something that just adds a bit of character to your base color.  Slightly sexy in the black, without being obnoxious.  Looks beautiful over classic shades (got a perfect red?  add this!)  and adds some funky fun to neons and bright cremes.  A must-have for any collection.</li>
    <li> Nubar is fabulous and Black Polka Dot is the best! I&#x27;ve had rave reviews by all who have seen my polish this week!</li>
    <li> Nice top coat to personalize your polish nail.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, fast dry, cruelty free : perfect, as usual with NUBAR nail products.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer noted; the bigger polka dots are a little tricky, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. What I love about this glitter is that it is a super thin coat and there is no 3d feel whatsoever. The polish dries totally smooth and glossy. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my nails while wearing it.</li>
    <li> excellent addition to any nail polish collection. I am glad I bought it and my girls wear it with pride.</li>
    <li> If you love nail polish and don&#x27;t have time to go to get ur nails done , buy this, you just put the color you want it doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect cuz this will cover your mistakes with cute polka dots.</li>
    <li> A little dabbing is required to apply it but the formula is easy to work with and it looks sooo pretty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into nail art, and I  used this polish on top of a base color. I love the way  it  makes the  colors pop. I have been wanting to try the polka dots polish for a while and finally I found it. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. To me this polish is better than the glitters. You do have to &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; for the larger pieces, however it&#x27;s worth it when you see the end result.</li>
    <li> Love the outcome of this nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I give it lots of stars.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible polish and I&#x27;m pissed I wasted my money. The large hexagonal pieces never stick to the brush so all you get are tiny specks of black. Looks like dirt on my nails; not attractive at all. Skip this one and wait for something better.</li>
    <li> I love Nubar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish applies very smoothly, the polka dots distribute very evenly and it&#x27;s a breeze to remove. The black polka dots compliment a wide variety of colors and have the ability to really make a plain polish pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this polish. It&#x27;s fun and flattering.</li>
    <li> Loventhis polish but wish there was more of the big glitter in it. Seem nails only get little glitter and need multiple coats</li>
    <li> i wish the polish looked like the picture here, but it doesn&#x27;t and i think in order to get this look you would have to put 10 coats on....the look you get with 2 coats isn&#x27;t even 3 or 4 dots!!! its mostly a clear top coat. save your money</li>
    <li> Wow - The compliments!  I got a lot of &amp;#34;Ohhhh let me see your nails!&amp;#34;  I did it over a soft gray and it looked wonderful.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it over some other colors - but over the gray it was spectacular!</li>
    <li> I think this polish would look better if it was on a white background. I wanted it on top of a black background&lt;br /&gt;and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other colors yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could copy the look given by Illamasqua&#x27;s I&#x27;mPerfection line, and it&#x27;s, well, perfect! The large pieces of glitter are much more sparse than pictured here (unless you use many coats). The glitter is not very reflective, which is what I was hoping for. Dropped less dough, and now I can have this look with as many colours as my heart desires.</li>
    <li> This item goes on just as it looks in the picture. It&#x27;s a clear plish with fun black dots in it. Forgot I even had this until now ~ so gotta go do my nails!</li>
    <li> it does not look like the picture.. more of a sheer color will not buy other products as this.not a keeper</li>
    <li> the shipping was on time, the product is good is good i expect more fron this polish but for the price was ok i like it</li>
    <li> I really like this polish and it does dry fast, but the glitter doesn&#x27;t come on thick. I did realize if you shake it a while before using it does help a little. But to get it like the image you need 2-3 coats. Im always complimented or asked &amp;#34;wow. what is that?&amp;#34; when i wear it.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish - so cute!</li>
    <li> Looks very funny and sofisticated on my nails. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to cathch big dots from the bottle but its ok.</li>
    <li> This is pretty neat polish. I was looking for black glitter polish to wear over colored polish. This is the closest thing I could find. My preference would be to have just the black flecks of glitter, rather than the larger black dots, but honestly I have searched high and low and this was THE only black glitter in clear polish I could find. Beggars can&#x27;t be choosers, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this nail polish, it last tremendously longer than I expected, the look is amazing, I get so many people asking me where to find them, and of course! I send them to Amazon, Im a happy customer (:</li>
    <li> Ugly ridiculous nail polish.  I gave it to my daughter, but haven&#x27;t seen her wear it.</li>
    <li> I bought this before and the product had leaked, probably from being so hot here in vegas. They did replace the bottle after I had to take a picture of the oopsi and prove I wasn&#x27;t lying. So they sent me another one. Well since then I have used it up because I love the effect it does to my polish colors and so I also bought the white one also. Since ordering this I found a product I like better and is much cheaper but live and learn. This product is good, sometimes the black dots are hard to get distributed, sometimes you get no dots. The brush wears out before product is gone but overall it was worth the look it gives and the price compares with OPI</li>
    <li> I was excited about this polish but it is rather difficult to get the big &#x27;polka dots&#x27; on your nails without going over them 4 or 5 times.  When it did go on though it was as advertised, I just don&#x27;t recommend this polish unless you have a lot of patience.</li>
    <li> i really thought that the dotes would be more like the picture shown--but they are not--but i would buy it again--it does add that something extra</li>
    <li> This just looked Iike a bunch of dirt got all over my nails!! The picture showed adorable polka dots. HA!!</li>
    <li> It arrived fast, and is very durable and difficult to chip. I applied two coats over a bed of pink (it is black polka dots suspended in clear polish) and I got lots of the little specks and only 3 large polkas on the whole nail. However, it still looked good and wore well. It was slightly more difficult to remove than regular polish, but a little pressure did the trick. Nice bottle, plenty of polish, and easy grip lid - as the dots wear they get glittery too :-)</li>
