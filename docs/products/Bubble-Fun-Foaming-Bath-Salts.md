      <li>Once I received it, I realized it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Bubble Fun is just that.  </li>

      <li>Soon, she has super clean nails and soft, sweet-smelling</li>

      <li>Highly recommend if you like fruity smells.  </li>
      <li>Good not great.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My other fave is the &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; flavor- more traditional spa smell and bubbling as well.</li>
      <li>Bubble Fun is exactly what we have had, when we&#x27;ve added a small scoop to the Jacuzzi.  </li>
      <li>I developed a rash.  </li>
      <li>Makes the water soft</li>
      <li>Fun change, but note leaves a pink rim in tub.</li>
      <li>small handful is all you need and the bath is soon filled with bubbles.  </li>
      <li>A little scoop in the jacuzzi and let the fun begin.  </li>

<li> Looking forward to trying the other scents as well.</li>
<li> This was a suggested product for me based on previous Amazon shopping.  </li>
<li> This product was too harsh on my skin.  </li>
<li> Small just like bubble gum.</li>
<li> I am sooo addicted to these bath salts.</li>
<li> There is nothing wrong with the product, but its not something I will rush out to buy again or tell friend and family is a must buy.  </li>
<li> how about a bubble gum bath after a gruesome day!!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely re-order and recommend</li>
<li> I have been searching for a bubble-delicious product for the kids that didn&#x27;t have tons of nasty stuff in it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s bathroom, but I am going back to get some for me.  Not only do they make great bubbles, but they smell FANTASTIC!  I have purchased several different salts from the San Francisco Bath Company and each has exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> These arrived as ordered and were wonderful- how about a bubble gum bath after a gruesome day!!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely re-order and recommend</li>
    <li> These smell great but they dont do anything fancy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent but it makes decent bubbles and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Smell just like bubble gum, love that it foams</li>
    <li> smells so good- salts from this manufacturer are fantastic- can&#x27;t wait to try this. My other fave is the &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; flavor- more traditional spa smell and bubbling as well.</li>
    <li> Small just like bubble gum. But does not foam. Just bath salts, but they smell good.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer so I can&#x27;t review the use of it but it arrived in good time and smells good.</li>
    <li> Bubble Fun is exactly what we have had, when we&#x27;ve added a small scoop to the Jacuzzi.  Plus, it has a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bubble Fun is just that.  A little scoop in the jacuzzi and let the fun begin.  It&#x27;s got a great scent, too.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy taking bubble baths and I just have to say that these bath salts don&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me itch. The scent is very pleasing as well.  Looking forward to trying the other scents as well.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant smelling bath salt. It bubbles up real nice and the grand kids love it. Makes the water soft and I think is helping the skin condition that my grand daughter has.</li>
    <li> Fun change, but note leaves a pink rim in tub. Love the scent.lots of bubbles</li>
    <li> This is the best bath salt I have ever purchased, great fragrance - and makes my skin feel so soft !</li>
    <li> I love this Bubble Bath! I have very sensitive skin and this is non irritating &amp; smells so good! It does not leave residue in the tub either, like the bath bombs. So very happy I tried this :) THANKS!</li>
    <li> Good not great.  There is nothing wrong with the product, but its not something I will rush out to buy again or tell friend and family is a must buy.  If you like the scent and are willing to give it a try, go for it.</li>
    <li> This was a suggested product for me based on previous Amazon shopping.  I loved it so much, I sent 6 of the 2 lbs bags out as Valentine&#x27;s gifts to my sisters and cousins.  Love, love, LOVE this scent.</li>
    <li> I am sooo addicted to these bath salts. I started with the 2 lb bag, and thought the price was a little high for such a small bag. Once I received it, I realized it was worth it. This is the greatest smell ever. I actually got the 20 lb bulk bag for Xmas and it was my favorite gift. I love to relax in the tub with this product. Highly recommend if you like fruity smells.  Delish!</li>
    <li> This product was too harsh on my skin.  I developed a rash.  Plus, the scent didn&#x27;t last beyond 5 minutes. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great bath salts! It has a bubble gum smell, but it&#x27;s not obtrusive or bothersome. I really like the product.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer sent us a sample of Bubble Fun to try out and review.  Well, the resident almost six-year-old is in bath Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter always tries to steal my bath bombs and salts and loves the fact that this product is made just for kids.  The salts are light pink and pretty.  To me, they smell like bubble gum, but my daughter thinks they smell like candy.  Regardless, they smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small handful is all you need and the bath is soon filled with bubbles.  I loved the fact that the salts contain aloe vera leaf juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my daughter doesn&#x27;t know this, but I&#x27;ve also tried them myself.  They were very soothing and my skin felt very soft when I got out of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve also discovered that these are great for cleaning grimy playground-dirty fingernails.  For those times when my daughter&#x27;s nails need a quick cleaning, we just put a bit of this in the sink, turn on the water, and she plays in the water a bit.  Soon, she has super clean nails and soft, sweet-smelling hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves her bath salts!</li>
    <li> We love the San Francisco Bath Salt Company in our house, using them to salt soak the adults on a regular basis.  I have been searching for a bubble-delicious product for the kids that didn&#x27;t have tons of nasty stuff in it.  I was excited to try these, and the scent is strong (fun).  The kids love the scent and the bubbles but I feel like I am using A LOT of it to get a decent return on the my bubble square footage.  Also bubbles dissipate before bath time is over (which really isn&#x27;t long, less than 30 minutes).  For the price, I don&#x27;t currently plan on purchasing these again.  I will certainly miss the yummy scent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, but pricey.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts. Bubble baths are one of my favorite ways to relax and wind down. These bath salts are amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious - like strawberry bubblegum! Bubbles up well.</li>
