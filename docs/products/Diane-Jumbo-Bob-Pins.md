### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They work great!  </li>
      <li>Its awesome though</li>
      <li>Great for my rollers.</li>
      <li>It gives you great hold on your hair and keeps it in place.</li>
      <li>/&gt; although the price is good for one pack</li>
      <li>Nice gauge of metal</li>
      <li>This is the kind of purchase that is why I buy from Amazon.</li>
      <li>so this is a great buy for me and a good price and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Also the plastic coating on them peels very easily.</li>
      <li>The pins are great and very sturdy and i have shared them with friends and family who are thrilled to get them.</li>
      <li>These are okay.  </li>
      <li>Love them :)</li>
      <li>Slip out easy.  </li>
      <li>Athough the price is fine for one pack, I wonder why the reviews and item description say there are 12 packs?</li>
      <li>The kind of large pins you need for curler sets.</li>
      <li>They are excellent heavy duty bobby pins.</li>
      <li>Use these often and the paint has held firm, so very happy.</li>
      <li>Good product but the paint on them completely peels off</li>
      <li>right?  </li>
      <li>Not has strong as the old ones.  </li>
      <li>Living on the coast in Texas where the climate is hot and humid, the hair goes up for comfort, and these pins keep it there.</li>
      <li>This is 12 packs of 40 large bobby pins.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These were much better than the Goody ones I tried first (lots of sharp edges).</li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t slide down too easily.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t like the fact that the black coating starts to break down too quickly, other than that, its perfect!</li>
      <li>These are nice and flat and do not have that strange bump in the middle</li>
      <li>and even then you can&#x27;t push the pins through your hair very far.</li>
      <li>They are well made with no sharp edges.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the old straight black bob pins like the olden days.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just slightly smaller than the Jumbo pins from the leading brand, and the rubber tips are also slightly less robust, but they&#x27;re difficult to locate in retail outlets and a 40 pack is a great deal.</li>

    <li> Unfortunately the material melted while in the mail box. It&#x27;s peeling like hell and isn&#x27;t something I can use on my hair without black flakes decorating my cranium.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of purchase that is why I buy from Amazon. This is 12 packs of 40 large bobby pins. The kind of large pins you need for curler sets. I&#x27;m always running out of pins through wear and tear so this is a great buy for me and a good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> the title say that it is 12 packs and I Received only one pack&lt;br /&gt; although the price is good for one pack</li>
    <li> I was looking for the old straight black bob pins like the olden days.  These are okay.  Not has strong as the old ones.  Slip out easy.  Nothing to write home about.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product describes that you&#x27;ll receive 40 jumbo bobby pins, per pack ... and that there are 12 of them, a 12-pack. I received one (1) pack only.</li>
    <li> It gives you great hold on your hair and keeps it in place. Doesn&#x27;t slide down too easily. Just don&#x27;t like the fact that the black coating starts to break down too quickly, other than that, its perfect!</li>
    <li> Great for my rollers.</li>
    <li> These pins are horrible. They twist and contort after 1 use so you can&#x27;t use then without it hurting and even then you can&#x27;t push the pins through your hair very far. They stick together at the ends, making them very painful, hard, and time consuming to remove. Not worth it at all. Plus, they didn&#x27;t send me the amount they were supposed to. They sent about a seventh of the amount it says I ordered. Not impressed at all and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Unlike the other brands I pick up in the drugstore, these were so flimsy that when I tired to open a pin, it twisted around in my finger and couldn&#x27;t even retain its shape.  Also the plastic coating on them peels very easily.</li>
    <li> poor quality, plastic tips came off right away</li>
    <li> Long, sturdy, holds the hair well, especially for long hair going up in a bun. Use these often and the paint has held firm, so very happy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this package to be so heavy! Its awesome though because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever run out of bobby pins ever again! Love them :)</li>
    <li> It is NOT 12 packs.  It is one pack of 40 pins.  Very misleading~!  Athough the price is fine for one pack, I wonder why the reviews and item description say there are 12 packs?</li>
    <li> The pins are great and very sturdy and i have shared them with friends and family who are thrilled to get them. Living on the coast in Texas where the climate is hot and humid, the hair goes up for comfort, and these pins keep it there. They do not slip and slide but instead hold the hair in place for the entire day. And because they are flat, they can be worn externally to just pin up your hair without looking tacky. They are excellent heavy duty bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Good product but the paint on them completely peels off they&#x27;re black then they look grey</li>
    <li> This is seriously a lot of roller pins. They are well made with no sharp edges. They are a little bit narrower and a little bit shorter than roller pins I&#x27;ve used in the past but they are definitely sized to hold rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived I was surprised at how very heavy it was. It was just roller pins, right?  A lot of pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were much better than the Goody ones I tried first (lots of sharp edges). I recommend these if you need roller pins.</li>
    <li> I like these long bobby pins.  They work great!  The only downside is that the paint chips off.  But I would order them again, and probably will, eventually.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just slightly smaller than the Jumbo pins from the leading brand, and the rubber tips are also slightly less robust, but they&#x27;re difficult to locate in retail outlets and a 40 pack is a great deal. Nice gauge of metal and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy, and they hold hair in place well. These are nice and flat and do not have that strange bump in the middle that some of the other pins have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one card of 40 pins, not 480 hair pins (12 X 40). Amazon should correct the description.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These are large and don&#x27;t have the wavy side that makes it easier to hook to each other which was a disappointment.</li>
