<li> I wish the scent was a little more pleasing, but has been several days now</li>
<li> I have had this for a while (couple months) and didn&#x27;t see any real major improvements to my dark spots.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only noticed a little bit of difference so far.</li>
<li> Strange.</li>
<li> but I think it takes longer for it to actually fade age spots than I expected....</li>
<li> My dark spots are still there, but it hasn&#x27;t been enough time to see results yet.</li>
<li> Some lightness but not very much.</li>
<li> I have very dark spots on my face and not only does it lighten the spots, it also keeps me from breaking out.</li>
<li> It works wonders on skin that has changes color due to birth control.</li>
<li> Porcelana or Avon dark spot corrector instead.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who had dark skin on their elbows and or knees...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried several skin fading creams for my freckles and dark spots, and got the least helpful performance from Esoterica.  </li>
<li> Works well, but takes a few weeks until you reach desired results.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> The scent was very slight, but I want to wear my skin creams, not feel them on me or smell them at all.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s no magic bullet</li>
<li> I have as a small child</li>
<li> have always had dark skin that looks like dirty elbows ///</li>
<li> So sad i spend my money .never</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in some drug stores.</li>
<li> I was unable to use this product didn&#x27;t agree with my skin unfortunately.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all unfortunately</li>
<li> It also felt greasy on my skin and gave it an unpleasant metallic smell.  </li>
<li> again.bad bad.</li>
<li> Bad creammmmmmm.</li>
<li> Darned! :(</li>

    <li> This product shipped fast, thank you! I wish the scent was a little more pleasing, but has been several days now and I guess I&#x27;m getting used to it. The cream feels good on my skin. My dark spots are still there, but it hasn&#x27;t been enough time to see results yet. It does look like they have faded just a bit though and it&#x27;s been just under a week.</li>
