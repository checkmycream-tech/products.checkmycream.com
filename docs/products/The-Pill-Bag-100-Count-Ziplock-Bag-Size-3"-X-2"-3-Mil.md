<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality bags, with thick plastic and firmly-locking closure. Retains Sharpie ink very well.</li>
    <li> The bags were a great value. I got more bags for the money and the quality of the bags met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love these little bags. Great for travel or use in a purse.</li>
    <li> The best pill bags I&#x27;ve found. Nice size, sturdy.</li>
    <li> My husband takes many medications and we eat out often.  He loves these bags because a whole days worth of pills fits in one bag and the bags can be reused many times.  The bag fits easily in his pocket compared to a plastic container, and he always has his pills with him.</li>
    <li> for traveling but sure it will great.</li>
    <li> Great bags!&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy duty</li>
    <li> I am placing my 3rd order!! They are very high quality, good size for those who add supplements to regular medicine. They are large enough to add a small snack if you need in between meals snack. They were a lifesaver during a European holiday for my husband and me!!</li>
    <li> I have had to take over organizing all of my father&#x27;s medications since his recent long hospitalization.  These work fine for what I need them for.  I reuse the bags several times so they are durable.  Good product.  Going to order more.</li>
    <li> I would order again,  They are good quality, stay closed, a good size. I use for pills, or some metamucil/glutamine powder packets I created to take on the go so I can mix at work or while on vacation.  I have also used for crafts to hold small things...beads or whatever.    I would say in regards to powder, I take a rounded spoon of metamucil and a little bit of powder glutamine and it holds that perfect.</li>
    <li> convenient and the right size for my vitamins that I carry with me all through the day.</li>
    <li> perfect to write the hours</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re little bags. They hold pills. The end.</li>
    <li> Great and perfect size for making your vitamin packs for the week.</li>
    <li> When I read some of the reviews of this order , I was hoping it was wrong, since most of the others reviews stated what I wanted to read.&lt;br /&gt;That is, these bags are not the flimsy new 1 ml. bags I see in the stores today.  I like the firmer bags because you can actually get into them easily, and they are good for more than one time use.  I WILL buy these again in the future when I need more.  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Love them. Can keep pills in my pocket or purse. Bottles are so inconvenient.</li>
    <li> These bags are awesome - thick and substantial, and the zipper closure is strong.  I can open and close one bag over and over without either the zip or the bag itself failing (unlike another brand I&#x27;d bought but was manufactured so thin that they&#x27;d tear when you opened them).  I even fold a bag in quarters to fit in that tiny pocket in my jeans, and the closure still works fine.  The bag of 100 should last forever.</li>
    <li> We took a long 21 day trip to Europe.  What a great way to carry our meds.</li>
    <li> love these little bags, which organize my vitamins and allergy pills for travel and hold a host of other small items as well.  Great for keeping track of earrings and loose buttons, even for keeping a lit of moisturizer in my purse for my eyelids in winter.</li>
    <li> THIS is the pill bag you want.  Sturdy, stiff, thick plastic, substantial.  The way the other ones used to be before they cheapened them.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel and to keep in your purse!</li>
    <li> I make up a pill bag with my vitamins and medications for each day.  It makes it easy to carry around and by the end of the day when the bag is empty I know I have taken all my meds and vitamins.  So many of these bags are so thin, that it is difficult to open and close without ripping the bag.  These bags are thicker and hold up.</li>
    <li> I love the thickness of these pill bags.  When I originally started using the pill bags, you could get them this thick at the chain pharmacies.  After using those for several years I thought it was time to replace them.  The new ones were so thin &amp; flimsy; I hated them!  Was so glad to find these thick ones that I will be able to use over &amp; over for several years.  Even though there are a lot in the bag, you could share them or find other uses for them.</li>
    <li> Great quality.not thoes thin bags that tear.these are awesome.</li>
    <li> I liked them and they were very useful for a trip we took.  They take up very little space in your purse or luggage.</li>
    <li> They were perfect.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> We bought these because my brother has a medication that is administered as needed, and his caregivers are only allowed to give him this medicine if it is predispensed. These bags are very handy because the label on them allows us to write the medication name, dosage, and instructions. These are also great quality and inexpensive. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I find these pill bags make it easy to bring my vitamins and perscriptions with me.</li>
    <li> These are nice and thick, and one edge is higher than the other so they open easily.  Great for vitamins or powders.  The ones from the drugstore are too thin.</li>
    <li> Switched to these - heavier gauge plastic than the current version of EZDose, so more re-uses.</li>
    <li> This is a practical solution. I use these to take my vitamins to work with me. I have used other options, such as weekly pill dispensers that can be found at CVS and Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with those are that they can be bulky. Also they take up more space than what these bags take up.&lt;br /&gt;I can either tuck these in my purse, or in my coat pocket before I leave the house in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I had to order these twice.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered, my aunt was so amazed with these that I ended up giving them to her.&lt;br /&gt;I find these very practical, and will recommend.</li>
    <li> I had been buying Pill Bags from another vendor....until they made them thinner and cheaper. There is a place for that kind of product, but I found I liked a higher quality Bag for storing things other than Pills, like small batteries, memory sticks, screws, and other little objects that I want to store for a long time and not have the packaging fail during a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pill Bags are the high quality product I hoped they would be. Pay a bit more and avoid some frustration in your life. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a good product.</li>
    <li> lots of bags for the price, also good weight to the bags. useful little bags for storing pills and other small items.</li>
    <li> Cheap and do exactly what they say. Does not open and all vitamins stay nice and dry.</li>
    <li> Good solution for travel.</li>
    <li> Went on vacations and wanted something small to put daily supliments in.  Was also good to keep small amounts of other OTC drugs handy while traveling.  Now use to take supliments to work</li>
    <li> time/space saving.great.</li>
    <li> I bought these bags for my husband for when we travel because he has pills he has to take at certain times throughout the day.  Since we don&#x27;t travel all that much, I have found so many uses for these great little bags!  As a crafter, you can imagine the unlimited uses for storing tiny objects such as safety pins or beads.  I also use them to make little portion controlled bags of almonds or other small snack foods. They are sturdy like the full size zip lock bags, so you never have to worry about spillage or breakage.  These are just the handiest little bags to have around!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, superior to other products like it.</li>
    <li> These are great for storage! The bags are made of high quality materials and can withstand a high degree of bending and folding without tearing thanks to the thickness.</li>
    <li> Walgreens use to sell these pill bags that were super thick.  They were great.  At some point they changed to this CHEAPO brand and the material was SO thin.  It tore regularly so I threw it out.  The &amp;#34;Pill Bag&amp;#34; is not quite as thick as the original one from Walgreens but is good enough not to tear while using it.  Happy I found this.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.</li>
    <li> These are far better than the ezy dose brand bag.  The Pill Bags are sturdy and not flimsy. Also the zip lock portion is easy to seal.</li>
    <li> Thick, sturdy pill bags.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> perfect size for 25 vitamins and pills!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Love these tiny bags</li>
    <li> They r re usable. They are what I needed.</li>
    <li> These work great for traveling!</li>
    <li> Wonderful to find these bags that are so much better than the now-Walgreens-cheap-bag offering. I use these for taking my supplements with me when I travel and the bags hold up great for multiple uses.</li>
    <li> These bags are perfect for packing pills when going on vacation.</li>
    <li> These are thick enough and strong enough to do the job. They are perfect for pills, coins and lots of other small objects.</li>
    <li> These are great and easy to close and reuse.</li>
    <li> They last much longer than the drug store brand of pill bag. Strong, durable plastic.</li>
    <li> First time using are working great</li>
    <li> These little bags are the shizzle. They make putting all of your vitamins in one place a snap for on the go.</li>
    <li> These bags are sturdy and will definitely hold&lt;br /&gt;up to reuse.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on this type of product, I chose these and I&#x27;m glad I did. They aren&#x27;t flimsy, they are well made.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> I use these for my vitamins. It holds them and I can separate and organize them by days. The night before I just throw a pack in my bag and I&#x27;m ready to go for that day!</li>
    <li> We bagged up our morning vitamins and evening meds &amp; vitamins, and some pain relievers and it saved a lot of room in our suitcase.</li>
    <li> These bags are very strong and reusable. I love them. I will always buy this brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased two. I gave this product 5 stars because these medication bags are good quality and exactly what I was looking for. The stores in my area were out of stock of the little bags. I&#x27;m happy I found good quality bags on Amazon. I&#x27;m also happy because they arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> These are the best for a number of reasons, but especially because they are easy to open.  Unlike other bags, the front top of the bag is shorter than the back enabling me to easily slide my fingernail to open.  I have arthritis and the other bags are difficult to open.</li>
    <li> Too small for my use, but nice little bags. Selling them in garage sale.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace some I&#x27;d bought locally and could no longer find. These are good quality for aliquoting tablets into various first aid kits. I&#x27;ve also used these for segregating and protecting AA and AAA batteries in drybags/backpacks.</li>
    <li> These bags are great. They are thick enough so they don&#x27;t tear and the zipper locks the pills in tight but not so tight that it is difficult to zip or unzip the bags. I&#x27;ve found the bags useful for more than just pills. Any small items can be kept in these bags.</li>
    <li> These are great. I travel a lot and packing my medications took up a considerable amount of space until I got these. It&#x27;s time-consuming to fill a months worth but they take up much less space than conventional pill containers or original pill bottles. There is a place for labeling them and check boxes for AM vs. PM. They are sturdy and reusable, and very reasonably priced; all-in-all a great buy.</li>
    <li> Items a advertised.  They look small and thin, but they hold a lot.  They are also very sturdy, no tearing or splitting.  I pack them once a week, label the days and forget it about.  I do think they are a tad bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent! and you get a LOT of them. Great for hiking and camping. Totally waterproof when sealed.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for so many things! They are super handy for traveling - no one wants to pack bulky vitamin bottles or organizers with limited room in a suitcase but these little pill bags fit anywhere and are so easy to pack pills or powders. When I board my dog in daycare I use these bags to identify her morning &amp; evening supplements to add to her food. I even measured out the coconut oil I add to her food and stored it in these bags successfully without any leaks (so the daycare staff could simply open pre-measured bags &amp; pour on her food so there&#x27;s no fuss &amp; I don&#x27;t worry about my dog getting the wrong dose of anything). Also handy for those days when you&#x27;re on the go but need to take some advil - just put a few in a bag &amp; throw it in your purse or gym bag so you have it when you need it. The bags are a great size &amp; fit a decent amount of powders or different sized pills. I&#x27;ve also had some small hardware parts I needed to take to Home Depot to find replacements for and I stored them safely in one of these bags and tucked it in my pocket without worrying about losing small parts. Very Handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the white area for writing - any pen works on the surface - &amp; it&#x27;s great to be able to write what&#x27;s in the bag and also be able to check off whether it&#x27;s an AM or PM dose. I don&#x27;t get the minor complaint in the other review about not being able to see what&#x27;s in the bag due to the white area. The white area for writing is only on one side of the bag, the other side is clear so there is no issue with transparency. Additionally, the bag seals very well &amp; is easy to open - there are even little tracks on the flaps that help with traction when opening the bag. They&#x27;re very easy to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a really well-designed &amp; versatile product. My only wish is that they were made with recycled materials since most are thrown away without reusing &amp; as much as I love the convenience, the waste does bother me.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Exactly what I ordered and expected. Carries pills in your pocket easily!</li>
    <li> These work great for keeping the vitamins in order.&lt;br /&gt;Just sort once a week and work through them!</li>
    <li> Best quality pill bags on the market. Be sure not to order inferior quality ones. These are the REAL THING.</li>
    <li> We use these on every trip.  Can write on label without difficulty</li>
    <li> These are big enough bags for quite a number of pills. The plastic is thick and not flimsy. They don&#x27;t disappoint and are exactly what is described here.</li>
    <li> if you do supplements; you gotta have these and they have a very good thick zip lock at the top</li>
    <li> perfect for pills when traveling!</li>
    <li> Very useful for travel. I can put any pills I need in a bag, label it and tuck it into small spaces. High quality and way more convenient than a pill bottle.</li>
    <li> I too used to purchase the other brand from the drug store and was very upset when they changed them to be incredibly flimsy.  They are fine for single use but I refill mine constantly so I was looking for a new brand.  These are a tiny bit shorter and just the right thickness for their purpose.  The zip closure works well and I&#x27;m able to use them over and over. Great find!</li>
    <li> Useful when traveling. Or when you hate getting your pills in the morning, separating day, afternoon and gym... Get the time to seperate once a month, bag the, and label.... You have weeks of prepare pill cocktail.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and like to individually bag a few days of morning and evening meds . I also take juice plus and will parcel out a days dose, they fit in the pouch perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have been putting my pills in sandwich bags until I found these great little easy to seal zip lock bags. Holds all ten pills perfectly.  It was just like it was advertised. Will buy again from this seller,</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, so was really excited when I saw this product.  I can write on each label so I can keep track of days, and just discard the bags when emptied.  I don&#x27;t really mind carrying traditional pill minders on trips, but for long trips or trips where suitcase space is at a premium, these little bags are a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I reuse each one at least 10 times, and I tend to carry it in my pocket all day.</li>
    <li> These are great quality bags.  I have some I have been carrying in my pocket every day for 2 months with my car keys, and the bags are still intact.  Do not wast your money on the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> i tried different pill cases. dumb. these are perfect. reuse them. they&#x27;re flex spend eligible.</li>
    <li> I love these. I laid out all my daily supplements and vitamins and now take them to work with me in this tiny convenient bag. When i run out i will definitely order these again for sure!!!</li>
    <li> These bags are great for travelling to taking your vitamins in your bag when you go out without having to take big vitamin containers.  I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and I live in the UK and ended up paying a fortune for postage, a lot more than 50 packs of these bags would cost.  I had purchased before but I don&#x27;t know what happened this time.  Just be careful when ordering if you don&#x27;t live in the US</li>
    <li> Not as thick of a plastic as they use to be, but still a great way to carry pills during the day.</li>
    <li> so much more compact for traveling than using the weekly am/pm dispensers I have been using.</li>
    <li> I use these bags for just about everything, hair clips, bobby pins, safety pins, hair ties, rubber bands, individual eye drops, sewing pins, small nails,individual sizes first aid ointments, makeup brushes, over the counter medicines, deodorant crystal, small bar of soap, glass wipes, dosage dividers, and travel otc medicine packets. These bags last forever and are easy to write on.  I have tried the ezDoz bags and there is no comparison. The Pill Bag is the best.</li>
    <li> Great, hold a lot of vitamins. Can reuse.</li>
    <li> Most helpful when travelling.  Seal easily and securely.  Write info with ballpoint pen.</li>
    <li> Love these little pill bags. Got them for my vitamins. I can just grab them and go.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel for those little things that I want to keep clean, but easy to access. I travel to Asia on LONG international flights so have learned to downsize everything. I use them for ear plugs, sleeping pills (that I only want a couple of them, and not a whole bottle), Advil, my vitamins, my jewelry. They are heavy ml so don&#x27;t tear easily.</li>
    <li> Easy to open little pill bags, can be taken on trips for compact storage; much better quality and sturdier than other brand options.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect size, sturdy and well made. It is particularly good that they are 3 x 2 inches - being wider than tall makes it much easier to get pills in and out of them.  And the thickness makes them sturdy enough to handle - they don&#x27;t flop around in your hands like the very thin bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are almost perfect but sorely need two improvements. First, they are hard to open because the two sides of the locking flaps are the same length. To open them you need to press the flaps between your fingers and then slide your fingers, but this requires you to moisten your fingers to get some traction on the slick plastic, and the last thing I want while handling pills is moist fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the \\&quot;white area\\&quot; for writing info on the bag is very annoying. I don&#x27;t want to write on the bag, I want to see in the bag.  I get tired of that writing area always being in the way. I understand some small text with their company name or web address at an edge of the bag, but it would be great if the bags were clear so the contents are always visible.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and the bags seem to be sturdy enough for my uses. I&#x27;m not going to be really vigorous with them, they just go in my purse so I cannot say whether they will stand a wreckless adventure or not. But they are perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Especially when my husband has to go somewhere without me.  I can write on the bag what they are and when to take them.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse at a homeless shelter.I purchased the bags for when my clients need to take their medications out of  the facility. I can write the name of the med and time it needs to be taken. This was a good purchase for our facility.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase EZ Dose Pill Pouches when they were thicker and sturdier, but the manufacturer switched to extremely thin, flimsy plastic.  I&#x27;m so glad that another company has stepped in to produce a better product.  The Pill Bag is perfect for organizing my family&#x27;s supplements.</li>
