### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best nail file I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>The inside rougher side is the best nail file I have used.</li>
      <li>Thus is a great nail file!</li>
      <li>Best file</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both side work well and the steel quality of the file is excellent.</li>
      <li>but once you get in the groove it is awesome.</li>
      <li>Now the file itself is great</li>
      <li>Great texture on BOTH sides; well-thought-through engineering, oddball curve and all.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve never used or had curved file before, I was a bit hesitant to purchase, but since the brand makes great nail clipper I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
      <li>Has an ergonomic handle and is great for working on toe nails.</li>
      <li>This feels good in your hand.</li>
      <li>The reviews on this item were so good, but I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping I will get used to the curve, but it does not look good for that.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed tip is handy for cleaning under the finger</li>
      <li>Seki products are really nice.  </li>
      <li>Item works as described in is a nice alternative to filing nails.</li>
      <li>Handy and durable.</li>
      <li>Both provide very smooth filing.</li>
      <li>the fine side is very fine and for my nails as effective as any of the &amp;#34;Classical Guitar filing papers &amp;#34;and</li>
      <li>WASN&#x27;T PLEASED WITH1 FILE--</li>
      <li>Seki Edge Nail File with Pusher]] is probably a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The curve may be susceptible to getting bent more or getting unbent in the suitcase.</li>
      <li>Been using for 3 weeks now and love it more and more every time I use it.</li>
      <li>The CURVED surface is what I like the most about this tool.</li>
      <li>The coarse and fine sides of the file do an excellent job of removing excess nail with a minimum amount of effort.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>so I easily straightened it.  </li>
      <li>I just straightened out the file and it works fine.</li>
      <li>The curve takes a little getting used to but the surface is excellent.</li>
      <li>And, the design of the filing surfaces gives as smooth a result as the crystal files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This curved nail file is one of the very best I have found for filing nails smooth and round ...</li>
      <li>Worth the cost!</li>
      <li>It is so cool, easy to use and better than straight.</li>
      <li>This one is made of stainless steel so it should be a lot more durable.</li>
      <li>great product, it is easy to file my nails with files and it is well made, a little pricey but worthy</li>
      <li>I like this file because it goes arround your nail easy unlike the straight nail file.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good - and not wildly overpriced, either!!</li>
      <li>Crystal files are great except dropping it even a small distance can cause it to break.</li>
      <li>I purchased several items from this brand and so far, everything is good.</li>
      <li>If not quite finished enough for you, a super fine file paper can be placed on the curved file to finish the nail.</li>
      <li>The curve combined with the fine file really help shape the nail naturally</li>
      <li>I used my wife&#x27;s straight, diamond embedded nail file and it actually required more work.  </li>
      <li>Over all it is kind of flimsy and average.</li>
      <li>A nice family heirloom I can pass down.</li>
      <li>This nail file features a rough side and a very fine side for finishing your nails after you&#x27;ve cut them.  </li>
      <li>The fine file is on the \\&quot;inside\\&quot; or inner surface of the curve.</li>
      <li>Concave side is fine, convex side is coarse.  </li>
      <li>The curved design is unusual, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>It really does not work</li>
      <li>High quality metal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s high quality that I&#x27;ve seen on all Seki Edge products.</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend any of them including this one.</li>
      <li>I guess I just have had too many years with the usual straight files.</li>
      <li>the metal is soft enough to be bent back straight yet sturdy enough that it won&#x27;t get bent easily</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the curve or the bend is good for since it was not very convenient to use</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>The curve does make it much easier to use, and both sides are equally usable..  </li>
      <li>At first glance, you notice that the cutting surface is nothing more than etched lines in steel, but they really do cut.  </li>
      <li>its thick sturdy plastic handle and strong steel file, I predict this file will outlast me..</li>

<li> Not worth the time and effort</li>
<li> It takes a little while to get used to because of the curve</li>
<li> One side does the tough job, then the second side gives you the finished look &amp; touch!</li>
<li> It files to a round with ease and smoothness.</li>
<li> The kind that come is those awful manicure sets you&#x27;re bound to have received at least once as a gift.</li>
<li> The finer one is useless for me and the coarse one is Ok.  </li>
<li> The finer one did not work as well for me, but I am a man and do not have delicate nails.  </li>
<li> Poor balance, poor design, not sturdy, throw it away.</li>
<li> Besides, it can get expensive overtime.  </li>
<li> Useless.  </li>
<li> can be inconvenient when you run out and don&#x27;t have any when you need it.  </li>
<li> If you get it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> I am disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t file properly.</li>
    <li> Great texture on BOTH sides; well-thought-through engineering, oddball curve and all. I&#x27;ve used SEKI nail clippers exclusively since discovering them, so I thought I&#x27;d try this when needed a nail file. WOW. It&#x27;s really good - and not wildly overpriced, either!! Follow directions on package and you&#x27;ll come up a winner with this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased several items from this brand and so far, everything is good. I like this file because it goes arround your nail easy unlike the straight nail file.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve never used or had curved file before, I was a bit hesitant to purchase, but since the brand makes great nail clipper I went ahead and bought it.  I don&#x27;t like those file that is disposable since it is disposable and can be inconvenient when you run out and don&#x27;t have any when you need it.  Besides, it can get expensive overtime.  Now the file itself is great and there&#x27;s no struggling or getting snagged by the edges but the curve... the metal is soft enough to be bent back straight yet sturdy enough that it won&#x27;t get bent easily so there&#x27;s an option for you to keep it as is or reshape the way you like it.</li>
    <li> WASN&#x27;T PLEASED WITH1 FILE--FILE TOOK TOO LONG TO FILE EACH NAIL--I ASSUMED IT WOUL BE QUICKER! WOULD NOT NOT PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> Seki products are really nice.  I can highly recommend any of them including this one.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed.  The reviews on this item were so good, but I don&#x27;t like it.  I am hoping I will get used to the curve, but it does not look good for that.  I guess I just have had too many years with the usual straight files.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The best nail file I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 weeks now and love it more and more every time I use it. It takes a little while to get used to because of the curve but once you get in the groove it is awesome.</li>
    <li> High quality metal. Arrived on time and properly packaged. Has an ergonomic handle and is great for working on toe nails.</li>
    <li> The curved design is unusual, and it works really well. I uploaded a picture to highlight the curved design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coarse file is on the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; or outer surface of the curve. The fine file is on the \\&quot;inside\\&quot; or inner surface of the curve. Both provide very smooth filing. The curve combined with the fine file really help shape the nail naturally and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed tip is handy for cleaning under the finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after the second crystal file broke (not a Seki Edge product). Crystal files are great except dropping it even a small distance can cause it to break. This one is made of stainless steel so it should be a lot more durable. And, the design of the filing surfaces gives as smooth a result as the crystal files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not pack this in a suitcase. The curve may be susceptible to getting bent more or getting unbent in the suitcase. For travel purposes the [[ASIN:B000SSG0AS Seki Edge Nail File with Pusher]] is probably a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful, please let me know by voting for it.</li>
    <li> Thus is a great nail file! The curve does make it much easier to use, and both sides are equally usable..  Concave side is fine, convex side is coarse.  The curve does increase the chances that you&#x27;ll reach in the drawer and poke yourself, also does not fit in regular manicure set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its thick sturdy plastic handle and strong steel file, I predict this file will outlast me.. A nice family heirloom I can pass down. (Joke)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 years, I finally threw out those old metal nail files that had broken plastic ends. The kind that come is those awful manicure sets you&#x27;re bound to have received at least once as a gift. (I had four)</li>
    <li> See also my review of Seki Finger Nail Clipper.  The finer one did not work as well for me, but I am a man and do not have delicate nails.  The inside rougher side is the best nail file I have used.</li>
    <li> This curved nail file is one of the very best I have found for filing nails smooth and round ... the fine side is very fine and for my nails as effective as any of the &amp;#34;Classical Guitar filing papers &amp;#34;and it gets below the nail well in order to remove nail edges. If not quite finished enough for you, a super fine file paper can be placed on the curved file to finish the nail.Play On !</li>
    <li> The curve takes a little getting used to but the surface is excellent.</li>
    <li> This feels good in your hand. You need to file in one direction.</li>
    <li> This nail file features a rough side and a very fine side for finishing your nails after you&#x27;ve cut them.  Both side work well and the steel quality of the file is excellent.</li>
    <li> Now I have to get another one.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time and effort</li>
    <li> Item works as described in is a nice alternative to filing nails.</li>
    <li> There are two different grid on both sides. The finer one is useless for me and the coarse one is Ok.  I&#x27;m not sure what the curve or the bend is good for since it was not very convenient to use so I easily straightened it.  Over all it is kind of flimsy and average.</li>
    <li> I consider four stars because I never seen curved file ever.  It is so cool, easy to use and better than straight.</li>
    <li> One side does the tough job, then the second side gives you the finished look &amp; touch! Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a quality nail file for some time. I have tried a variety of products, but none of them had the &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; of the Seki file. The coarse and fine sides of the file do an excellent job of removing excess nail with a minimum amount of effort. As for the &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; - it does not provide any advantage for my needs. I just straightened out the file and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Useless.  Poor balance, poor design, not sturdy, throw it away.</li>
    <li> As a male, I have exceptionally long, tough nails which constantly split.  I used my wife&#x27;s straight, diamond embedded nail file and it actually required more work.  At first glance, you notice that the cutting surface is nothing more than etched lines in steel, but they really do cut.  The CURVED surface is what I like the most about this tool.</li>
    <li> It really does not work</li>
    <li> This file means business. It files to a round with ease and smoothness. Handy and durable. What you would expect from Seki&lt;br /&gt;quality!</li>
    <li> Best file I&#x27;ve ever used😃 I would buy it for everyone if I could. If you get it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t work exactly as I expected, it still gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Cutting surfaces seem uniform across both sides; however, the inner curve is fine while the outside curve is course. Easy to use. Have recommended this to family members. It&#x27;s high quality that I&#x27;ve seen on all Seki Edge products.</li>
    <li> great product, it is easy to file my nails with files and it is well made, a little pricey but worthy</li>
