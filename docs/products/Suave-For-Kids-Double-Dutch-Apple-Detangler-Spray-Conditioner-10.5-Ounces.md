      <li>I love this product and buy it in the two packs!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Simply amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great cheap product &amp; does the job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my children&#x27;s hair, and my own hair, and it does the job.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, the mechanism appears to be of much sturdier construction.</li>
      <li>I even use this on my own hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, and with the Suave Kid&#x27;s Shampoo Smoothers.  </li>
      <li>Works, smells nice.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice fragrance and even my wife has used it on occasion.  </li>
      <li>so it gets used up too fast LOL!</li>
      <li>It works pretty well (again, not as good as those 2), it smells great</li>
      <li>, it would just be nice to be able to match the Suave Kid&#x27;s Shampoo Smoothers with similar-smelling detanglers.    </li>
      <li>I am a 31 year old woman with 2B curly hair and just started using this to detangle my hair and it is so wonderful!</li>
      <li>Now that he&#x27;s older, he thinks the apple scent is &amp;#34;icky,&amp;#34; but I love it and find it very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t break her skin out, huge plus!  </li>
      <li>Works okay.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I like it for kids stuff but could be better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking online for some kind of cheap detangler spray for awhile &amp; while</li>
      <li>There is only one smell that I can find anywhere, and it is Awesome Apple.  </li>
      <li>THIS STUFF ABSOULTELY DOES LEAVE A GREASY RESIDUE IF USED MORE THAN ONCE.</li>
      <li>We bought this and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>The girls love the smell.</li>
      <li>I never have to use more than 2 sprays to evenly coat my daughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
      <li>my daughter love this spray.</li>
      <li>but it is better than not using it.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I use this on myself</li>
      <li>I love this detangling spray.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I set my hair in pin-curls to achieve more glamorous loose waves, and this spray is perfect to dampen my hair before creating pin-curls.  </li>
      <li>I use it after towel-drying my hair, to more easily run a wide-toothed comb through my hair, or on second-day hair to freshen up and de-frizz.  </li>
      <li>fine detangler for children and for many adults.  </li>
      <li>I also have naturally curly hair, and love using this spray on my own hair!  </li>
      <li>Works great for our 3 year old.</li>
      <li>Works best when your hair is wet and you spray it on.</li>
      <li>That is an amazingly long time for a $2 product, and that comes out to 33 cents a month, which is GOOD in my book! :)    </li>
      <li>It make her hair smoother and easy to comb</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t as impressed the next time around, but then again I was asking a lot since I had three months worth of tangles to undo.</li>
      <li>It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute.  </li>
      <li>Brushing her hair creates a huge rat&#x27;s nest, and it gets tangled which then makes me wrestle with her to get the knots out.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just fantastic for adults as well.</li>
      <li>This is such a great deal for how well it works.  </li>
      <li>THE UPSIDE IS THAT ITS CHEAP</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky/greasy film on my hair, which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>I use it on my daughter who has think hair and it works wonders, I also love the fresh smell it leaves on her hair.</li>
      <li>Any college student like myself would make great use out of this as much as younger kids that get knots from tossing and tunring when they sleep :</li>
      <li>Oh and it&#x27;s cheap,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tear free.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own for defining my curls--but my hair feels soft and HEALTHY again</li>
      <li>quickly detangled his hair and made it easy to comb or brush.  </li>
      <li>This has saved many tears from our daughter who has very curly hair; tangled bedhead now banished &amp; morning hair-do&#x27;s are tear-free!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super light product.  </li>
      <li>Works really nicely for my two year old!</li>
      <li>Though it hasn&#x27;t grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent  nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.     </li>
      <li>I love this so much &amp; use it every day.</li>
      <li>I liked this detangler, made my hair detangled quickly  Makes hair feel soft and not waxy, oily, or crunchy  </li>
      <li>apple smell is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>She has fine, but pretty wavy hair</li>
      <li>So, I spray this on and use my Remington Detangler (an electric comb especially made for detangling hair) and her hair detangles much more quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>It works great as a detangler and it smells pretty nice, but it is definitely not worth looking like you haven&#x27;t showered the next day.</li>

    <li> Works okay. My daughter has very curly hair I&#x27;m not sure if I don&#x27;t let it sit enough but I still battle a few tangles but it is better than not using it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried different brands... from less than $2 to $15.  This is not my favorite in terms of how well it works (I think Paul Mitchell and Miracle Detangler work best).  However, for the price, this is a best buy. It works pretty well (again, not as good as those 2), it smells great and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  We will continue buying these.  Amazon does not offer the best price, though.  In the supermarket it is less than $2.</li>
    <li> i luv this detangling spray!!! it works sooooo good. it really works good, the smell&#x27;s kinda annoying after a while, but it&#x27;s great!     also, once i finished my bottle i  1) got a new bottly rite away  2) used the old bottle as a water spritzer. perfect 4 when u need 2 dampen ur hair and it works perfectly!    THANK U SUAVE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this detangling spray.  The scent is wonderful and it detangles hair nicely.  I use it for my two daughters, but also for myself.  Works best when your hair is wet and you spray it on.</li>
    <li> Suave Detangler Spray works well on my 5 year old daughter, whose hair is fine, slightly wavy and mats easily.  I normally bathe her at night because it&#x27;s easier to get going in the morning, but then her head is a mess.  So, I spray this on and use my Remington Detangler (an electric comb especially made for detangling hair) and her hair detangles much more quickly and easily.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my daughter&#x27;s hair, so if I fail to wash it the next day, her hair still looks clean.  Build-up can be a problem with some detanglers, but not for Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Detangler Spray has a refreshing green apple scent that my daughter loves.  When I spray her hair, it gets on her arm and she makes me smell how good her arm is.  The scent stays in her hair even after it&#x27;s dry.  I have to admit, I like the scent of her hair when we cuddle.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal for how well it works.  I use it on my 3-year-old biracial niece who gets her curls really tangled at night.  This makes it easier to brush and I get a lot less whining when I fix her hair!</li>
    <li> This contains propylene glycol which is a known ingredient to cause cancer. Just because it&#x27;s sprayed on the hair doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be absorbed through the skin. According to the Environmental Working Group, propylene glycol can cause a whole host of problems. It is rated a 3 by them, which is categorized as a \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; health issue. It has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental/reproductive issues, allergies/immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and organ system toxicity. It has been found to provoke skin irritation and sensitization in humans as low as 2% concentration, while the industry review panel recommends cosmetics can contain up to 50% of the substance. It has also been classified as \\&quot;expected to be toxic or harmful\\&quot; by Environment Canada.</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> Though they say it&#x27;s for getting through tangles, we call it &amp;#34;curl spray&amp;#34;. The woman who cuts my daughter&#x27;s hair turned us to the fact: a little bit of this spray on my daughter&#x27;s hair along with a little gentle scrunching brings out her natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apple smell is pretty strong.</li>
    <li> My little girl is two. She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it&#x27;ll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn&#x27;t grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent  nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.     Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter&#x27;s hair easier to brush, but that&#x27;s about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can&#x27;t imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking.</li>
    <li> The Suave detangler spray works far better then the other brands we have tried. If you have kids, I suggest a bulk order...</li>
    <li> I liked this detangler, made my hair detangled quickly  Makes hair feel soft and not waxy, oily, or crunchy  A great find for the price!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I use this on myself and it&#x27;s just fantastic for adults as well. It&#x27;s smells great, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky/greasy film on my hair, which is a huge plus. Also, the fact that you can spray it on wet or dry hair? Definite pro. It makes getting up and out the door a breeze without having to worry about frizzies and bedhead. Any college student like myself would make great use out of this as much as younger kids that get knots from tossing and tunring when they sleep :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I repurchase this item? Of course! I wish I could just get it in a pack! Haha!</li>
    <li> I had two complaints with this stuff. First the stuff just shot out when sprayed and not a fine mist as I would have preferred. Also my daughter complained that it hurt her eyes. I assume from the scent. We typically use Johnson no more tangles so I guess we will switch back to that.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  It smells really good</li>
    <li> I have 3 daughters with long hair.  This product is great.  We all use it, and it makes the brushing a lot easier.</li>
    <li> This detangler spray really does help.  My daughter has thick hair that tangles easily and we use this spray everyday.</li>
    <li> A lot of reviews for different detanglers seem to mention fine hair, so it was hard to make a choice.  My two-year-old has thick curly hair that gets easily matted overnight.  We bought this and have been pleased with the results.  We use it about every 3 days before bed on wet washed hair, with a hair pick or wide-toothed comb.  The comb slides right through her hair without damaging her curls, and in the morning, her hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I don&#x27;t like with this product is the smell.  When we finish this bottle, we&#x27;ll get a different flavor!  The apple smells fermented, or like beer!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my daughters hair. May they are too tangled.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when watching my two year old niece - she&#x27;s got fine, curly hair and it definitely helps us comb through it without tantrums.  Since she likes to comb other people&#x27;s hair, too, and is as rough about it as you&#x27;d expect a toddler to be I tried it in my own hair.  It worked great.  No greasy residue or stickiness at all.  I also like to go to the gym first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t usually wash my hair until I&#x27;m done, so I&#x27;ve started using it as a hair deodorizer before I go.  It definitely smells better than whatever I manage to get into the day before, but I wish it came in other scents as well.  If it does, I&#x27;ve never found them.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for years on our grandson&#x27;s hair.  This is simple to use as it sprays on and it is a gentle formula that is tear-free and easy on his eyes.  We applied it normally to his wet hair after a shower but sometimes when he took his shower before he went to bed this was the answer to bed head in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It quickly detangled his hair and made it easy to comb or brush.  It also has a nice fragrance and even my wife has used it on occasion.  The only problem we have is that now he has a burr haircut for the summer and we don&#x27;t need to use this, at least for a while!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great! I am a 31 year old woman with 2B curly hair and just started using this to detangle my hair and it is so wonderful! FYI though, they sell it at Target for under $2 a bottle!</li>
    <li> Having had several spray mechanisms of Johnson &amp; Johnson No More Tangles break down on me after mere days of usage, I finally searched for an alternative. This product works just as well and smells really delicious. Best of all, the mechanism appears to be of much sturdier construction.</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST in my house.  My daughter has natural pincurls that are super tight.  Brushing her hair creates a huge rat&#x27;s nest, and it gets tangled which then makes me wrestle with her to get the knots out.  This product has completely eliminated that problem.    PROS:  1.  It works VERY well.  I use the detangler mainly after bath time (when the hair is already wet).  We spray a few times here and there, and the brush goes through her hair smoothly and quickly.  I recommend using Suave Kid&#x27;s Shampoo Smoothers with this product; we use them at home and have been knot-free since we started (and trust me, we went through quite a few kid&#x27;s products and brands before we found this combination).  2.  It isn&#x27;t expensive.  My daughter likes  being just like mommy, so when I spray her hair, she immediately wants to spray mine.  We go through these a little faster that way, but it makes her happy, and she is usually willing to sit down and let me brush her hair afterwards.  3.  It&#x27;s a super light product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling, and leaves behind no oil or residue.  When you use the spray, it glides out in a sheer mist.  I never have to use more than 2 sprays to evenly coat my daughter&#x27;s head.  4.  It&#x27;s a fairly big bottle.  It is the average size of a non-aerosol hairspray  bottle.  For $2, that isn&#x27;t bad.  5.  It smells great!  It has an apple smell, but has no alcohol smell that goes with it (and doesn&#x27;t have harsh smells like hairspray does).  The smell stays in for a little while, so my daughter will occasionally run around telling people to smell her hair.  It&#x27;s super cute.  6.  It&#x27;s tear free.  This is HUGE for me, because sometimes the mist does land in her eyes (especially if she grabs the bottle, darts off, and tries to do it herself).    7.  It lasts FOREVER!  I only have to use 2 sprays for my daughter, and at 2 sprays a day it lasts about 6 months.  That is an amazingly long time for a $2 product, and that comes out to 33 cents a month, which is GOOD in my book! :)    CONS:  1.  There is only one smell that I can find anywhere, and it is Awesome Apple.  I don&#x27;t mind the apple smell, it would just be nice to be able to match the Suave Kid&#x27;s Shampoo Smoothers with similar-smelling detanglers.    Overall, I give this product a 5 out of 5 stars.  It works great both on it&#x27;s own, and with the Suave Kid&#x27;s Shampoo Smoothers.  It has turned hair brushing into a cinch!  I don&#x27;t plan on replacing this product with another one any time soon, and recommend it for anyone suffering from the curly-haired woes.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my daughter&#x27;s very fine but heavy and tangley hair.</li>
    <li> my daughter love this spray. It make her hair smoother and easy to comb</li>
    <li> The girls love the smell. I do not think it detangles as well as another name brand detangling spray, but the kiddos like it, so I will keep it.</li>
    <li> Works for my biracial daughters hsur.</li>
    <li> I use my detangler spray every day.  My curly hair tangles up every night when I sleep.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. No more tears when combing my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Spray on after they get out of the shower or pool and it smoothes out their hair without making it feel greasy or even look greasy when it dries.</li>
    <li> If I saturate my kids&#x27; hair (one fine/tangled, and curly/tangled), I can get the knots out of both kids hair.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, and my kids&#x27; hair dries without a greasy feel or look.  BUT, this product has almost tripled in price.  Even with prime, it is ridiculously priced and worth making a trip to Target for the same thing at less than half the price.</li>
    <li> SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE POSITIVE REVIEWS I THINK THAT IT IS EMPLYEES OF THE PRODUCT COMPANY. THIS STUFF ABSOULTELY DOES LEAVE A GREASY RESIDUE IF USED MORE THAN ONCE. ALSO, DOESNT DETANGLE AS WELL AS OTHER THE UPSIDE IS THAT ITS CHEAP I BUY IT AT THE 99CENT STORE</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I hate the smell.  It&#x27;s the awful general apple smell that they put in dog shampoo and it was not pleasing.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I lived without this product before. I use it in conjunction with a wet brush I bought on Amazon and now my tangle problems are solved!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I thought it worked well to loosen tangles. I wasn&#x27;t as impressed the next time around, but then again I was asking a lot since I had three months worth of tangles to undo.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received it promptly. Used in my daughters hair dry and wet and makes hair more manageable and smooth!</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a detangler for my wig, and I happened to find this one which was a few dollars at Target. It smells nice and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works, smells nice. My daughter loves her &amp;#34;hair spray.</li>
    <li> smells great &amp; works well!!</li>
    <li> My hair got seriously damaged due to hot weather and wearing it in a ponytail every day for work. I have long, very curly hair that is usually pretty kind to me when it comes to style, but I killed my hair with those poor habits. Suave for Kids Apple Detangler spray has become a lifesaver! It most certainly is NOT just for kids. Found it at the local grocery store for less than $2 and it made getting the rough, frizzy tangles out of my hair so much easier while I snipped off some split ends. I&#x27;m not at home currently and have no access to styling products--it doesn&#x27;t do well on it&#x27;s own for defining my curls--but my hair feels soft and HEALTHY again and I&#x27;ll take that any day!</li>
    <li> The Suave Apple Detangler works very well.  I&#x27;ve used it on my children&#x27;s hair, and my own hair, and it does the job.  Things I like about the Apple scented detangler is that it is never greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t  weigh down even fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it on damp hair only.  And I would add that much to my surprise that the Purple bottle Swirlberry doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fine detangler for children and for many adults.  (People with processed hair should probably use something stronger.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom/official family hairwasher</li>
    <li> This product works great after a bath or shower on my toddler with very long hair that naturally curls at the ends. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t find it works as well when her hair is dry. The apple smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, but next time I may try another scent.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this spray to use on my son&#x27;s naturally curly hair as a morning hair refresher to get rid of bed-head.  Now that he&#x27;s older, he thinks the apple scent is &amp;#34;icky,&amp;#34; but I love it and find it very pleasant.  I also have naturally curly hair, and love using this spray on my own hair!  I use it after towel-drying my hair, to more easily run a wide-toothed comb through my hair, or on second-day hair to freshen up and de-frizz.  Sometimes I set my hair in pin-curls to achieve more glamorous loose waves, and this spray is perfect to dampen my hair before creating pin-curls.  The bonus is that it smells delicious!  I always get compliments about the scent of my hair.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a little girl with short, thick, curly hair that mats easily. It works really well, particularly with wet hair. I use it for my daughter with long, thin, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This spray works miracles on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, and I love the smell. I just wish she didn&#x27;t like it so much because she keeps spraying it on herself all the time so it gets used up too fast LOL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very long, thick hair. I have the worst luck with tangles no matter what I do...but this stuff is always there to save the day. If you have really thick hair or really severe tangles you have to spray it a good bit, but that&#x27;s better than ripping your hair out just trying to brush it! Oh and is smells good too!</li>
    <li> I used the Suave detangler on my daughter&#x27;s hair for 6 years. Brushing her bed-head was still always a struggle, with whining and frustration, even with a LOT of product. Recently, I couldn&#x27;t find the Suave one at my regular store, so I bought the White Rain one (for 97 cents!). What a difference! Life changing. I&#x27;m usually satisfied with Suave products - I use their shampoo, conditioner, and body wash - but the detangler is not great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!  She hasn&#x27;t ask me for help with tangles since she got it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Works great for our 3 year old.</li>
    <li> I stock up on this to use each time I brush out my 5 year old daughters long hair</li>
    <li> It looks great. My granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I use it on my daughter who has think hair and it works wonders, I also love the fresh smell it leaves on her hair. I even use it myself at times.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works on many types of hair, even thick hair. This product does not only have to be for kids. Has a great smell and you get a lot in the bottle. It works best after a shower, while your hair is still a little wet. It makes it so much easier to brush and get the knots out.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and works</li>
    <li> This has saved many tears from our daughter who has very curly hair; tangled bedhead now banished &amp; morning hair-do&#x27;s are tear-free!</li>
    <li> I use this as a detangler for wigs, works great, no residue!</li>
    <li> It does detangle but not as good as some of the other products on the market. I like it for kids stuff but could be better.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old has long, thick hair and brushing it has been a nightmare for some time.  This stuff works great and she even asks me to brush her hair now!</li>
    <li> Works really nicely for my two year old!</li>
    <li> Smells incredible and gets rid of tangles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking online for some kind of cheap detangler spray for awhile &amp; while at my local drug store I ran into this &amp; it was very cheap there was no way I could pass it up. Keep in mind I am a 17 year old girl with wavy &amp; relatively thick hair. I love this so much &amp; use it every day. I don&#x27;t have the apple but I have the strawberry &amp; it smells very good. It&#x27;s not sticky nor does make it hard to flat iron my hair. It&#x27;s a great cheap product &amp; does the job. Love!</li>
    <li> I have used this detangle since my babies were small, I don&#x27;t use it so much for how it detangle but more so for how amazing it smells. I even use this on my own hair. I love this product and buy it in the two packs! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the smell of apples.</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin, so when looking for a detangler, I got nervous that anything I used could cause her to breakout.  After reading some reviews on various detanglers from natural to not so natural, I decided to try this one.  It didn&#x27;t disappoint.  It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or make her hair look stringy.  It helps get those morning tangles out without any tears.  It didn&#x27;t break her skin out, huge plus!  Oh and it&#x27;s cheap, look around, I found this for a quarter of the cost in store.</li>
    <li> If you use this more than 2 days consecutively, it makes adult hair look very greasy and feel waxy/filmy. It works great as a detangler and it smells pretty nice, but it is definitely not worth looking like you haven&#x27;t showered the next day. If it didn&#x27;t leave the residue, I&#x27;d be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My kids and I love it! My kids use to be so upset about getting their hair washed because they know that afterwards I had to comb it out. When I bought this product it was no more tears lol. I even add this to my old weave to give it a lil boost.</li>
