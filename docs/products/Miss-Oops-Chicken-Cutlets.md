### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They work perfectly.</li>
      <li>These things are great!</li>
      <li>They are perfect for any type bra in my own opinion.</li>
      <li>It looks great in my structured bras, but I can&#x27;t wear them otherwise or it looks like I have two boobs on each side.</li>
      <li>However, the quality does seems to be good.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>Work wonders for cleavage and even more if you use a push up bra!</li>
      <li>and I just LOVE them!</li>
      <li>OK!</li>
      <li>:) Love love love them!!!</li>
      <li>Made my wife&#x27;s tits look great made her feel even better about herself and that made it worth even more to me!</li>
      <li>What I like about them is that they sit in the bottom of the bra cup to lift the girls UP, and they feel very secure when they&#x27;re in there.</li>
      <li>I thought these would give more lift to my breast</li>
      <li>I love these , after i had my daughter and stopped nursing</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I just got them today and tried slipping them into my non-underwire A cup, and they worked perfectly to plump in the space without looking cartoonish.</li>
      <li>I love this product, A)They wear cheap, B)they gave me the right amount of clevage and it looked amazing</li>
      <li>They are a bit slippery too, no grip because they are coated in a very smooth silky material so I would not feel confident wearing this out of the house,  they could slip right out the bottom of my bra.</li>
      <li>are fairly comfortable but not the most comfortable) for ultimate cleavage effect (like the kind from a really good bustier)  </li>
      <li>or if they&#x27;ll be any help with the gap between my padded bra edges and my actual chest, but if these can manage to smooth that over, I&#x27;ll be a supremely happy</li>
      <li>They are light weight and comfortable</li>
      <li>While they did give me some lift its not as much as I would have liked..</li>
      <li>Lol nothing left to say</li>
      <li>Anyway, they do work and are comfortable to wear, but are visible through my bra and shirt, no matter where I place them.</li>
      <li>, if by chance dirtied they are easy to clean    Cons:  </li>
      <li>used these with a corset I wore for a Halloween costume it totally worked out great, and my girls were up there.</li>
      <li>Cheap and cost to much!!!</li>
      <li>they are very realistic and there very light and fit in my bra easily.</li>
      <li>I took them off and decided I looked better without them especially with a form fitting top.</li>
      <li>also,  since purchasing this I&#x27;ve found a much better and more natural looking insert at walmart of all places.</li>
      <li>These are a bit firm but they still do a great job :) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them with swimwear or anything that does not have underwire.</li>
      <li>Great cleavage effect - combine with the cleavage clips you find at Wal-Mart in the pink box(they</li>
      <li>The product is just fine andi t came very well packed.</li>
      <li>I now own both but only wear one!</li>
      <li>and it fits nice with no extra showing.</li>
      <li>They dont look right or natural when your wearing a fitting shirt?  </li>
      <li>I would never put this right against my skin, however, because of the sweat between the skin and the plastic.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for this item.</li>
      <li>, I will start buying more low cut shirts now!</li>
      <li>Maybe Im not using these right, but they certainly do nothing for my clevage?  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re interested in this product I would suggest measuring out the room in the bras you intend on using these with before purchasing.</li>
      <li>I thought it would lift them back up and more perky.</li>
      <li>I use one of these on the smaller side to even myself out in certain clothes where the difference is more noticeable.</li>
      <li>They are soft and comfortable and look real underneath your shirt.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m older and more spread out than a younger girl</li>
      <li>I am a large busted woman.</li>
      <li>i had reasonable hopes for these and decided to try them out instead of the Wal-mart ones...</li>
      <li>They also didn&#x27;t do much for cleavage.</li>
      <li>Feel very durable</li>
      <li>Product not meet the price, this product is ok, maybe it only last for a month of used!</li>
      <li>I loved this item when I purchased it from victoria secret.</li>
      <li>, the shape is strange, you&#x27;d have to extremely large for this to work, rather than showing through as a lump, but then if you ARE extremely large why would you want to be 2-3 sizes large.</li>
      <li>the quality is probably fine but its hard to say since they arent worth wearing.</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;ll wear this when I want to disguise myself as someone MUCH older - and I mean someone like my grandmother with 12 children older. :)&lt;</li>
      <li>Very comfortable... makes wearing non-padded under-wired bras very cozy.</li>
      <li>It fits in my b cup bra quite nicely, so its not too big for small cups.  </li>
      <li>I forgot I had them on, and I developed a rash.  </li>
      <li>along with making my breasts appear lager than these inserts did, the inserts from walmart were larger and much softer.</li>
      <li>while they added thickness and cleavage they did not look or feel natural.</li>
      <li>now i can use all my old bras and not feel so self conscious</li>
      <li>they look and feel natural even in a sport bra.</li>
      <li>too thick shows through top.</li>
      <li>i didnt fill out my bras as mush as i use to , which is kinda sad when you have a lot of money invested in good quality</li>
      <li>It makes them look very thick, which is why i paid the higher price for these instead of getting some other silicone inserts, but these are not very thick and don&#x27;t make a difference, a highly padded bra does a better job than these which can even be found for the same price.</li>
      <li>No slipping or falling out.</li>
      <li>These should fill the entire cup somehow and not not half, dont spend the money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about a half cup size different between my right and left breast.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m about a half cup size different between my right and left breast.</li>
<li> i have small breasts, these looked promising.</li>
<li> I love these Miss opps Chicken cutlets.</li>
<li> had no problem with anything slipping around, and the bra handles the extra weight of the cutlet without  an issue.</li>
<li> but these are not nearly as substantial as I was expecting in thickness.  </li>
<li> Having had breast cancer this is used to fill in the void in a bra due to one side being smaller.  </li>
<li> These cutlets were very heavy and the outline of the cutlets clearly showed through my tee shirt, making the girls look deformed.</li>
<li> This is really heavy, so it makes the bra sag, so it functions as the opposite of push up.</li>
<li> Tho&#x27;t this would help but it ended up being a big waste of money.  </li>
<li> Size and shape weren&#x27;t as I expected</li>
<li> so thought if I stuck these in under the place that they go (have to word it carefully for this to post)</li>
<li> but I find it very unlikely that this will fit in an A, B, or maybe even a C size bra.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle here, but I&#x27;m a really small cup size, and there&#x27;s always been &amp;#34;space&amp;#34; left in any cup of any bra I buy.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I gained any cup sizes or anything, but it did give my t-shirt a &amp;#34;filled in&amp;#34; look that&#x27;s hard to explain unless you&#x27;re built smaller than average.&lt;br</li>
<li> These work well and definitely increases your cup size by at least once cup.  </li>
<li> Heh, pull down bra</li>
<li> These \\&quot;chicken cutlets\\&quot; are silicone breast enhancers that you place right under your breasts in your bra.  </li>
<li> They felt a little flimsy to me.</li>
<li> I lost 25lbs and became a little droopy</li>
<li> I bought these to correct a little uneveness...</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> They are probably too heavy to be fully supported in anything that lacks underwire.</li>
<li> they were extremely stiff for a silicone insert.</li>
<li> I just slip it into a small sock</li>
<li> I dont just mean the length but the DEPTH as well.</li>
<li> you know what I mean.</li>
<li> The person that said they may not fit a,b,c I have to say that&#x27;s wrong because I am a small B cup</li>
<li> If you are going for a dramatic increase in size, they might not be for you.</li>
<li> The shape seems really wrong.</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>
<li> Looooove these bad boys!!</li>
<li> horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These \\&quot;chicken cutlets\\&quot; are silicone breast enhancers that you place right under your breasts in your bra.  Pros:  Makes breasts look a couple of cup sizes larger  Great cleavage effect - combine with the cleavage clips you find at Wal-Mart in the pink box(they are fairly comfortable but not the most comfortable) for ultimate cleavage effect (like the kind from a really good bustier)  Very comfortable... makes wearing non-padded under-wired bras very cozy. Like gel pads for shoes.  Feel very durable, if by chance dirtied they are easy to clean    Cons:  It won&#x27;t say it here but I find it very unlikely that this will fit in an A, B, or maybe even a C size bra. I wear a 32F and these are about an inch smaller than the cup for my bra.    For your convenience, the measurements:  length of this enhancer is 6 inches, or about 15 cm  width is about 1 inch or 2.5 cm  the height is 3.5 inches or just over 7.5 cm    If you&#x27;re interested in this product I would suggest measuring out the room in the bras you intend on using these with before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Having had breast cancer this is used to fill in the void in a bra due to one side being smaller.  Used in conjunction with another sized unit in order to fill the void.</li>
    <li> These cutlets were very heavy and the outline of the cutlets clearly showed through my tee shirt, making the girls look deformed. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are TINY! I dont just mean the length but the DEPTH as well. These did NOTHING to enhance any sort of size for me. the quality is probably fine but its hard to say since they arent worth wearing. i had reasonable hopes for these and decided to try them out instead of the Wal-mart ones... I now own both but only wear one!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. I would never put this right against my skin, however, because of the sweat between the skin and the plastic. I just slip it into a small sock and I&#x27;m good to go. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are a bit firm but they still do a great job :) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them with swimwear or anything that does not have underwire. They are probably too heavy to be fully supported in anything that lacks underwire.</li>
    <li> I love these Miss opps Chicken cutlets.I love this product, A)They wear cheap, B)they gave me the right amount of clevage and it looked amazing, I will start buying more low cut shirts now! C) they are very realistic and there very light and fit in my bra easily.There was only one con:if i did physical activity(runing,jumping etc.) they would slip out a bit.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle here, but I&#x27;m a really small cup size, and there&#x27;s always been &amp;#34;space&amp;#34; left in any cup of any bra I buy. I just got them today and tried slipping them into my non-underwire A cup, and they worked perfectly to plump in the space without looking cartoonish. I don&#x27;t know how or if they&#x27;ll be any help with the gap between my padded bra edges and my actual chest, but if these can manage to smooth that over, I&#x27;ll be a supremely happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with anything slipping around, and the bra handles the extra weight of the cutlet without  an issue. I didn&#x27;t feel like I gained any cup sizes or anything, but it did give my t-shirt a &amp;#34;filled in&amp;#34; look that&#x27;s hard to explain unless you&#x27;re built smaller than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a backup pair, since these worked so well.</li>
    <li> I had to buy 2 sets on them .. because it wasnt enough so if your an A cup like me i would recommend you getting 2 sets</li>
    <li> Looooove these bad boys!! Lol nothing left to say</li>
    <li> Made my wife&#x27;s tits look great made her feel even better about herself and that made it worth even more to me!</li>
    <li> Product not meet the price, this product is ok, maybe it only last for a month of used! Cheap and cost to much!!!</li>
    <li> i have small breasts, these looked promising. while they added thickness and cleavage they did not look or feel natural. they were extremely stiff for a silicone insert. also,  since purchasing this I&#x27;ve found a much better and more natural looking insert at walmart of all places. along with making my breasts appear lager than these inserts did, the inserts from walmart were larger and much softer. they look and feel natural even in a sport bra.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t stay and fell out of the built in bra in my wedding dress. They also didn&#x27;t do much for cleavage.</li>
    <li> were not the brand advertised</li>
    <li> I am a large busted woman. I lost 25lbs and became a little droopy so thought if I stuck these in under the place that they go (have to word it carefully for this to post) I thought it would lift them back up and more perky. Nope. Can&#x27;t even tell they are in.</li>
    <li> This is really heavy, so it makes the bra sag, so it functions as the opposite of push up. Heh, pull down bra - I&#x27;ll wear this when I want to disguise myself as someone MUCH older - and I mean someone like my grandmother with 12 children older. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shape is strange, you&#x27;d have to extremely large for this to work, rather than showing through as a lump, but then if you ARE extremely large why would you want to be 2-3 sizes large.</li>
    <li> I loved this item when I purchased it from victoria secret. This item is not made for all cup size&#x27;s. However, the quality does seems to be good.</li>
    <li> OK! I recieved these about a week ago and I just LOVE them! They add that cup size you want without hassle. Work wonders for cleavage and even more if you use a push up bra! The person that said they may not fit a,b,c I have to say that&#x27;s wrong because I am a small B cup and it fits nice with no extra showing. They are light weight and comfortable you would never know their there! They are perfect for any type bra in my own opinion. :) Love love love them!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe Im not using these right, but they certainly do nothing for my clevage?  They dont look right or natural when your wearing a fitting shirt?  I took them off and decided I looked better without them especially with a form fitting top. These should fill the entire cup somehow and not not half, dont spend the money</li>
    <li> I thought these would give more lift to my breast but they didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. While they did give me some lift its not as much as I would have liked..</li>
    <li> They work well.  Wash them often with water.  I forgot I had them on, and I developed a rash.  Only once.  No problem otherwise,.  Love them.</li>
    <li> I bought these to correct a little uneveness...you know what I mean. Anyway, they do work and are comfortable to wear, but are visible through my bra and shirt, no matter where I place them. Even if I am wearing a padded bra, I can still see them (I use both in one cup, but even with one I can still see it). If I wear a sweater I can&#x27;t see them, but that is the only way I can get away with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about a half cup size different between my right and left breast. I use one of these on the smaller side to even myself out in certain clothes where the difference is more noticeable. They work perfectly. They stay in place. No slipping or falling out. If you are going for a dramatic increase in size, they might not be for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to give me an extra \\&quot;lift\\&quot; in my pageant wardrobe. However no matter what tricks I have tried with these cutlets they never seem to do anything to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; me at all. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a cosplay costume hoping they would make a difference but they dont. It fits in my b cup bra quite nicely, so its not too big for small cups.  but these are not nearly as substantial as I was expecting in thickness.  The picture is misleading. It makes them look very thick, which is why i paid the higher price for these instead of getting some other silicone inserts, but these are not very thick and don&#x27;t make a difference, a highly padded bra does a better job than these which can even be found for the same price. They are a bit slippery too, no grip because they are coated in a very smooth silky material so I would not feel confident wearing this out of the house,  they could slip right out the bottom of my bra.</li>
    <li> used these with a corset I wore for a Halloween costume it totally worked out great, and my girls were up there.</li>
    <li> Size and shape weren&#x27;t as I expected</li>
    <li> They felt a little flimsy to me. Not what I needed anyway.</li>
    <li> Tho&#x27;t this would help but it ended up being a big waste of money.  Ironically, I can&#x27;t even give them away.</li>
    <li> These work well and definitely increases your cup size by at least once cup.  They are soft and comfortable and look real underneath your shirt.</li>
    <li> It looks great in my structured bras, but I can&#x27;t wear them otherwise or it looks like I have two boobs on each side. I am a size 32C.</li>
    <li> The shape seems really wrong. Maybe it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m older and more spread out than a younger girl but there wasn&#x27;t any type of size chart when I ordered and there is no returns on an item such as this.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t give them away.</li>
    <li> Have no idea how these could work, as I tried them in all sorts of bras. Oh well, I guess they&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love these , after i had my daughter and stopped nursing i didnt fill out my bras as mush as i use to , which is kinda sad when you have a lot of money invested in good quality bras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was a god send! now i can use all my old bras and not feel so self conscious</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for this item. It is just wath I wanted. The product is just fine andi t came very well packed. I will recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> horrible. too thick shows through top. very disappointed. will need to be returned.</li>
    <li> These things are great! What I like about them is that they sit in the bottom of the bra cup to lift the girls UP, and they feel very secure when they&#x27;re in there.</li>
