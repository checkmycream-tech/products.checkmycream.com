      <li>Came in perfect.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but its one of my favorites!!!</li>
      <li>Best Mascara EVER (</li>
      <li>AWESOME MASCARA</li>
      <li>This is a great product for teenagers but not for someone who has used mascara all her life.  </li>
      <li>Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, makes my lashes look longer and a great price.  </li>
      <li>The best mascara ever, my eye lashes stay up for 24 hrs , I&#x27;ve received so many complements&lt;</li>
      <li>plus it smells so good.</li>
      <li>It makes you look more beautiful.</li>
      <li>This Mexican mascara is the best of the best.</li>
      <li>I first found this wonderful mascara when one of my friends lend me some of hers..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the lookout for a better brush that will fit well on the Apple tube because the formula is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better and much neater, but still not the best brush.</li>
      <li>This mascara is actually pretty great for the price.</li>
      <li>Am glad i just ordered one, i was thinking of ordering the ones in a pack.  </li>
      <li>Love my lashes stay curled</li>
      <li>I love this mascara...</li>
      <li>This mascara is okay</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE HOW THIS PRODUCT MAKE MY EYELASHES LOOK FULLER</li>
      <li>I have been using this mascara for a long time now since it is the best one !&lt;</li>
      <li>but works really well if your good at putiing on makeup</li>
      <li>It also easily washes off with soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used drugstore mascara and department store mascara, but hands down, this is THE BEST MASCARA IN THE WORLD!</li>
      <li>*makes lashes look thicker *gives a huge opening of the eye and no clumps .</li>
      <li>I pair it with another mascara that separates my lashes a bit more easily since the brush to the apple mascara is quite large.</li>
      <li>but it smells unpleasantly sweet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for this brand for 10 years.</li>
      <li>Her eye lashes was long and gorgeous</li>
      <li>had the best results and got multiple compliments on a day that I experimented by cleaning off the brush from another tube of mascara (Falsies Big Eyes) that I was ready to toss and using it with the Apple mascara.</li>
      <li>Also, this mascara stays on pretty well even through some tears even though it&#x27;s not labeled water proof.</li>
      <li>Which is only another plus to the so many positives.</li>
      <li>Me Heroine Japanese Mascara is much better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the ONLY mascara that makes my lashes huge, bright black and does NOT uncurl them at all !!</li>
      <li>Yes it costs a little more but it so much better especially if you can&#x27;t get your eyelashes to hold a curl.</li>
      <li>above being said, the brush is ridiculously huge.</li>
      <li>always hold your curl very well, and makes your eyelashes look amazing&lt;3&lt;</li>
      <li>It would really be helpful to buy it in a store</li>
      <li>Thanks...</li>
      <li>Certainly not green!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s also so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issue with smudging, but had a tiny bit of flaking toward the very end of a very hot day.</li>
      <li>Another thing I love is that unlike most mascaras when you wash it off it does not leave any black residues on your face or eyes you can just use a little cotton ball makeup remover</li>
      <li>I have to run the bristle to a hot running water and put it back to give some moisture.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will continue using this mascara as long as it is available, it is not a waterproof mascara, which makes it easier to remove it at night with a simple make up remover</li>
      <li>and if you find it dry.... you can exchange it right away.  </li>
      <li>It holds a a curl very well and does a decent job of both lengthening and volumizing with an intense black color.</li>
      <li>and I ask a young lady about her eye lashes</li>
      <li>anyways I love how it leaves my eyelashes seperated and thick..</li>
      <li>If the Falsies brush screwed tightly onto the Apple tube I&#x27;d be a happy camper, but alas it does not.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you with one layer you have great lashes with two you half party dramatic lashes.</li>
      <li>The product is called Apple Super Lash Mascara- Avocado, so I assumed it would be green inside.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried , my eye lashes are long and heavy</li>

<li> The product is called Apple Super Lash Mascara- Avocado, so I assumed it would be green inside.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried , my eye lashes are long and heavy</li>
<li> In the meantime, I used a pair of very sharp little sewing scissors to trim the Apple brush down to a more manageable size.</li>
<li> and I have tried numerous types of different mascaras, cheap, expensive, natural, not natural and every time I apply them after curling my eyelashes they uncurl immediately as if I applied water to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> *Doesn&#x27;t break off lashes if done in reasonable slow manner .</li>
<li> Used it for few years and find it online only  tried a Mexican mascara in mexico and threw out the bottle in mexico and can&#x27;t remember the brand or whatever the color</li>
<li> Not only does it condition your lashes, but it lengthens w/o weighing them down and clumping them up.</li>
<li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because when applying its a little messing on my hands.</li>
<li> When you pull the brush out, even slowly, bits of mascara flakes onto hands, clothes and whatever you are near.</li>
<li> but it irritates my eyes which hasn&#x27;t happened with any other mascara.</li>
<li> it leaves your eyelashes super long and thick and trust me, they don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
<li> It can also be difficult to really coat those pesky outer corner lashes that we all want to accentuate.  </li>
<li> I promise you this does not smear it does not run down from ur lower lashes.</li>
<li> this has alvacado in it which gives your lashes vitamins and helps with growth I have used this for about 1 yr and a half</li>
<li> Dry and unusually thick brush.</li>
<li> A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m always having trouble finding the mascara that can hold them up all day.</li>
<li> Get my eyelids messy.</li>
<li> This range of mascara is all black, not colored!</li>
<li> TRIED THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MY USUAL MAYBELLINE MASCARA</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my eyelashes curled and it is very messy</li>
<li> I generally end up needing a Q-tip for some errant smudge somewhere which can be annoying when you&#x27;ve already carefully applied shadow, liner, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It is the circumference of my pinky finger and makes the product hard to apply neatly.</li>
<li> AND IT ALREADY HAS DRIED UP AND CLUMPED!!</li>
<li> Just because this is not a known brand doesnt mean anything.</li>
<li> this was some makeup artists&#x27; secret weapon.  </li>
<li> but i was a bit disappointed because when i received this item, it was dry.  </li>
<li> SO DIFFICULT TO DECIDE..</li>
<li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
<li> Always asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!</li>
<li> i know sharing make-up is bad</li>
<li> This mascara is horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first found this wonderful mascara when one of my friends lend me some of hers..yes i know sharing make-up is bad but it was an emergency(i wanted to impress some guy) anyways I love how it leaves my eyelashes seperated and thick..plus it smells so good. Also its the only mascara that doesnt leave my eyelashes all droopy. I have been buying them here at amazon.com and i just ordered two tubes!!</li>
    <li> The only mascara in the market that keeps my eyelashes curled. I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for this brand for 10 years.</li>
    <li> This mascara is okay but it irritates my eyes which hasn&#x27;t happened with any other mascara. It must&#x27;ve been the scent in it</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but its one of my favorites!!! its kinda think.. but works really well if your good at putiing on makeup</li>
    <li> Just because this is not a known brand doesnt mean anything. I am hispanic and I purchased this item in mexico and I searched it and found it here. AWESOME MASCARA this has alvacado in it which gives your lashes vitamins and helps with growth I have used this for about 1 yr and a half and I have noticed my lashed become fuller. Let me tell you with one layer you have great lashes with two you half party dramatic lashes. Another thing I love is that unlike most mascaras when you wash it off it does not leave any black residues on your face or eyes you can just use a little cotton ball makeup remover and it comes off I promise you this does not smear it does not run down from ur lower lashes. God I swear by this mascara it is my holy grail mascara.!!!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara EVER (:&lt;br /&gt;It always hold your curl very well, and makes your eyelashes look amazing&lt;3&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s also so inexpensive. Which is only another plus to the so many positives. (:</li>
    <li> This is a great product for teenagers but not for someone who has used mascara all her life.  Dry and unusually thick brush.</li>
    <li> *Doesn&#x27;t break off lashes if done in reasonable slow manner . *makes lashes look thicker *gives a huge opening of the eye and no clumps . Used it for few years and find it online only  tried a Mexican mascara in mexico and threw out the bottle in mexico and can&#x27;t remember the brand or whatever the color but this is a close call to what had before.</li>
    <li> LOVE HOW THIS PRODUCT MAKE MY EYELASHES LOOK FULLER</li>
    <li> Awesome results..best mascara ever!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara is actually pretty great for the price. It holds a a curl very well and does a decent job of both lengthening and volumizing with an intense black color. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with smudging, but had a tiny bit of flaking toward the very end of a very hot day. I may have rubbed my eyes at some point though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above being said, the brush is ridiculously huge. It is the circumference of my pinky finger and makes the product hard to apply neatly. It can also be difficult to really coat those pesky outer corner lashes that we all want to accentuate.  I generally end up needing a Q-tip for some errant smudge somewhere which can be annoying when you&#x27;ve already carefully applied shadow, liner, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the best results and got multiple compliments on a day that I experimented by cleaning off the brush from another tube of mascara (Falsies Big Eyes) that I was ready to toss and using it with the Apple mascara. My lashes looked awesome. If the Falsies brush screwed tightly onto the Apple tube I&#x27;d be a happy camper, but alas it does not. I cleaned it off again and kept it for a day when I want to make the extra effort. In the meantime, I used a pair of very sharp little sewing scissors to trim the Apple brush down to a more manageable size. It&#x27;s better and much neater, but still not the best brush. I&#x27;m on the lookout for a better brush that will fit well on the Apple tube because the formula is great.</li>
    <li> This mascara is horrible.  The brush is way too big.  It comes out in big globs.  I read online this was some makeup artists&#x27; secret weapon.  They must be using this on clients they don&#x27;t like.  Kiss Me Heroine Japanese Mascara is much better.  Yes it costs a little more but it so much better especially if you can&#x27;t get your eyelashes to hold a curl.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a long time now since it is the best one !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have curly eyelashes and I have tried numerous types of different mascaras, cheap, expensive, natural, not natural and every time I apply them after curling my eyelashes they uncurl immediately as if I applied water to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY mascara that makes my lashes huge, bright black and does NOT uncurl them at all !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this mascara as long as it is available, it is not a waterproof mascara, which makes it easier to remove it at night with a simple make up remover cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that keeps my lashes curled all day. I pair it with another mascara that separates my lashes a bit more easily since the brush to the apple mascara is quite large. Also, this mascara stays on pretty well even through some tears even though it&#x27;s not labeled water proof. It also easily washes off with soap. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because when applying its a little messing on my hands. When you pull the brush out, even slowly, bits of mascara flakes onto hands, clothes and whatever you are near. But this is definitely my number one mascara. Always asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!</li>
    <li> This range of mascara is all black, not colored! The product is called Apple Super Lash Mascara- Avocado, so I assumed it would be green inside. It&#x27;s a decent black mascara. Certainly not green!!! Beware.</li>
    <li> Love my lashes stay curled but it smells unpleasantly sweet. Will not buy again from this brand yuck</li>
    <li> Get my eyelids messy.</li>
    <li> TRIED THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MY USUAL MAYBELLINE MASCARA AND IT ALREADY HAS DRIED UP AND CLUMPED!! A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! UNFORTUNATELY TODAY, THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TYPES, BRANDS AND FORMULATIONS OF MASCARA OUT THERE!! SO DIFFICULT TO DECIDE..BUT THIS ONE BRAND?? NEVER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used drugstore mascara and department store mascara, but hands down, this is THE BEST MASCARA IN THE WORLD! Not only does it condition your lashes, but it lengthens w/o weighing them down and clumping them up. I have teenie, tiny lashes, that make my eyes look bald if I don&#x27;t wear any mascara, and this makes all of the difference. I&#x27;m a fan for life.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my eyelashes curled and it is very messy but I like the length of my lashes when I use it!</li>
    <li> The best mascara ever, my eye lashes stay up for 24 hrs , I&#x27;ve received so many complements&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried , my eye lashes are long and heavy so I&#x27;m always having trouble finding the mascara that can hold them up all day.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, makes my lashes look longer and a great price.  I had never heard of this brand until I saw it on Amazon, read the reviews and thought I would try it</li>
    <li> The brush is nothing like the ones they sell in Mexico. It&#x27;s really big brush. Clumps up your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara... but i was a bit disappointed because when i received this item, it was dry.  I have to run the bristle to a hot running water and put it back to give some moisture.  It would really be helpful to buy it in a store and if you find it dry.... you can exchange it right away.  I did not bother returning as i was going out of town.  Am glad i just ordered one, i was thinking of ordering the ones in a pack.  Thanks...</li>
    <li> This Mexican mascara is the best of the best. Omg... it leaves your eyelashes super long and thick and trust me, they don&#x27;t look fake. It makes you look more beautiful. You just have to know how to apply it. Take your time. Obviously if you rush it on any mascara will leave your eyelashes looking&lt;br /&gt;Lumpy. To remove use baby oil. That does the trick... don&#x27;t wash it off cause you will pull off your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect. I love it. Def going to buy again</li>
    <li> I was at work one day and I ask a young lady about her eye lashes and she showed me this! Her eye lashes was long and gorgeous</li>
