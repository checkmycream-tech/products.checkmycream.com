<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> if you have pregnancy PUPPPS get this!! it smells kinda smokey but does not stay on your skin. I used it and that night my rash was 80% better</li>
    <li> Please ignore anyone whining about the smell of this soap. Some people are really over exaggerating by saying this stuff smells horrid and describing it&#x27;s natural scent as a &amp;#34;stench&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll admit at first it was slightly odd to me too since I am not used to soap smelling like this, but it really doesn&#x27;t smell bad, the pine tar smells a bit smokey like a campfire and the scent does not seem to linger on you much after you bathe with it. I prefer the smell of this way better than some artificial, overly perfumed garbage like most soap smells like. Cleans without overly drying the skin too, rinses clean, as mentioned before no stinky perfume stench. Great stuff! My new favorite soap.</li>
    <li> This is now my only shampoo. It took about two months to adapt.... but now my hair is used to it and I am almost completely dander free. NOTHING I&#x27;ve tried was as effective as this soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...this resolved all my family skin problems..I recommended a lot!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. Makes your beard smell like a tree.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic soap. I originally bought it to wash my beard with but have moved on to using it everywhere. It lathers like crazy and rinses out almost instantly, leaving you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this pine tar soap. I will not go back to using bath washes. You can wash with and shave with it and it gets you nice and clean with out drying my skin out.</li>
    <li> I had a bad rash on my torso after my c-section which could only be relieved by a combination of this soap and a cortisone cream. It smells pretty bad (to me) but the smell does not linger on my skin. This came in a 3 pack and I only needed one. My rash was completely relieved in less than a week.</li>
    <li> Great soap. My dad loves it! The price was good and the product came quickly. I will order more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> Works well for all skin types. Has a very pleasant smell :)</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t smell all that great ... But it is amazing! I developed a very itchy rash towards the end of my pregnancy, pretty sure it was PUPPS, nothing worked and my dr wouldn&#x27;t prescribe anything since I was too close to delivery. Read about this soap online and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt... After two days my itching was completely gone! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is itching as a result of pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> At first i liked its effect. I bought this with me Grave Before Shave beard pack and i used it to wash my beard. It would make my beard feel soft but it has a strong smell witch smells more like a pine air freshener in a heavy smokers car. But after a few week of using it it stated to dry out my skin and then i broke out in a rash under my beard. At firs i thigh it was the beard oil i ordered but when the rash was small it soothed the burning and i stopped using the oil for a little wile just to make sure that wasn&#x27;t it but kept using the soap and then it got worse. Its super dry like a scab and it really itchy its almost like poison ivy.</li>
    <li> The scent of a campfire was so strong I had to return it. I had double bagged the soap in ziploc bags and I could smell the campfire scent.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like a forest fire. Works for eczema.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  We bought it for my husband&#x27;s beardruff but I have been using it for my eczema and when I developed a spot of acne it helped that,  too. It is also good for washing your armpits.  It makes them smell better.  I recommended it to a friend who had had a rash for a month and her prescription cream hadn&#x27;t helped.  This soap cleared up her rash in about a week.  We love it and now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
    <li> He loves it!  Really helps with wintery flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife when she was diagnosed with &amp;#34;pupps&amp;#34; (an itchy rash common in first time pregnancy and twin pregnancy). She absolutely loves this soap.  It is practically the only thing helping her.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent for people with eczema.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I don&#x27;t mind the camp fire smell.  This really helped my PUPPS RASH, BUG BITES, DRY SKIN, ITCHY SKIN, etc!  Wow!!!  Love the price too!  Will keep purchasing!</li>
    <li> Cleared then prevented my PUPPS! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great of Pupps - during pregnancy. My wife was feeling uncomfortable with the itching because of Pupps. we tried so many things but nothing helped. We read about this soap and it worked wonders. Everything was cured in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> excellent product for what it is. just be aware of what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i told my wife she could use it as a deodorant as she was concerned about aluminum in hers.&lt;br /&gt;she tried it for a few days and got tired of smelling like a sweaty campfire.&lt;br /&gt;the remaining bars were distributed as stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> If you thought Old Spice was for men, think again. This soap smells like a literal campfire. I love it. Over the last year I&#x27;ve been moving to natural products, and this has by far been the biggest home run. My girlfriend loves the woody smell. I have dry skin and wouldn&#x27;t say that this soap was any better at moisturizing than any other soap, but it hasn&#x27;t been any worse either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can assure you I will not be buying another type of soap for a long time. I&#x27;m a pine tar man now!</li>
    <li> Smell is overpowering! Smells as if you were sitting next to a campfire for a couple days! Probably the soap smokey the bear uses to rinse and lather! Stuff is pungent and made my whole bathroom stink of smokey pine. 10/10 would not order or even use again even with rice.</li>
    <li> Helped a little. Worth it</li>
    <li> I had a bery bad case of puppps, i tried everything from cortizone 10, caladryl, aloe vera gel, and oatmeal baths amd just nothing worked, i would cry in desperation and anxiety to scratch. I wasnt able to sleep and would wake up to shower with cold water to calm it down. Long story short i read it was great for puppps and acne so i gave it a try. It only took 2 weeks and my puppps were going away. I was reliefed, the down side to it is that it smells like burnt wood. But it works wonders i strongly recommend it for any pregnant ladies suffuring from puppps like i did.</li>
    <li> my father and father in law, always used Pine Tar sosp. So I decided to buy it it&#x27;s an outstanding product very well made</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like pine, it smells more like a campfire. The scent is strong and unappealing. Also the ingredients shown online aren&#x27;t the same as the ingredients listed on the box. I don&#x27;t like this soap, i thought it would smell more like fresh pine, but it just smells like burnt wood.</li>
    <li> Have found no problem with product.</li>
    <li> Bars are smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had either an allergic reaction or PUPPPs while I was 7 months pregnant. I had an itchy rash all over my tummy, arms and legs. I read online that this was a lifesaver and all natural so I bought it. Turns out, by the time I got this, my rash went away, but I gave it to my aunt who has eczema and she said it helped her a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie, the smell is nasty....unless you like the strong smell of campfire. The smell isn&#x27;t faint, it&#x27;s intense. I could smell it in the cupboard under my sink from the other side of the kitchen. would I recommend? Dispite the smell, I&#x27;d say yes because it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. I use generic rogaine which makes my scalp very itchy. Since using this product as shampoo/body soap and face wash, I haven&#x27;t had any itchies!! It takes a few uses to get over the sticky feeling and strong odor, but it really works and is a great product! I always look for stuff that doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and this has NOTHING but real ingredients!</li>
    <li> Bought because I have photos due to pregnancy after 3 uses my rash is clearing up and itching less very happy so far</li>
    <li> largest bath sie bars I&#x27;ve found and far less expensive than retail</li>
    <li> Wow, what a waste of money! This stuff stinks so bad that I had to throw it out right away!! It is hard to describe the smell, like pungent burnt wood....</li>
    <li> Made my sons beard and skin look great! I recommend it for all men into serious beard care.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my itchy dry skin,</li>
    <li> After washing myself with this soap, my skin turned plaid, one of my hands transformed into an axe, the other hand turned into a beer, and I impregnated every woman in a 2 mile radius. I smell so manly I may have actually impregnated myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can imagine what smoldering pine branches smell like, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;ll smell after using this soap. It&#x27;s woody, smoky, and easily the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve always loved campfires and have joked many times about how I wish there were a campfire scented cologne, because I would buy it. Now, I don&#x27;t need to use cologne, and just shower my manly body with this manly soap instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be a better man if you buy this soap. Ladies will line up to touch and smell your rugged manbeard, trees will chop themselves down for you, and you&#x27;ll ride a moose to work everyday. Be like me. Use Grandpas Wonder Pine Tar Soap. Seriously</li>
    <li> Gets you clean &amp; fresh with a scent of campfires in the summertime.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with that!  I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Has a distinct smell but cleans thoroughly without  leaving a soapy feel.</li>
    <li> Great soap for men.  Smells fine enough and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works great, bar seems a little small for the price. Smells like pine tar, not pine trees. This is a medicated soap for minor skin irritations and chronic conditions. I lost my insurance so I have been looking for OTC treatments for psoriasis. This works ok with the addition of Gold Bond Ultimate lotion.</li>
    <li> Everyone already knows that this soap smells a little like road tar, but it is great soap. I have used it for my body, face and even hair. I have some skin problems and sensitive skin as well--and this really helps out. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a road-tar aroma after use (LOL).</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It scours off any greasy residue instantaneously and it smells like I&#x27;m bathing in peaty, Islay single malt. For those two reasons alone this could well be the single greatest male hygiene product there ever was or ever will be.&lt;br /&gt;Throw out that lavender and shea butter moisturizing pansy body wash and start washing with brutal chunks of pine tar like a man. Like a big hairy man.</li>
    <li> I opened the package thinking it would smell like pine. Boy was I surprised. It smelled literally like fresh tar. It instantly made me sick to my stomach. I would not recommend for a good smelling soap</li>
    <li> Worked miracles on the pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) I had developed!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed by this the scent is great (reminds me of a campfire). Cleans very well and no residue. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Squeaky clean and smelling good!  My husband comes out of the shower smelling like a campfire..it&#x27;s really nice</li>
    <li> works and smells great.</li>
    <li> Too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a campfire is being shoved in your nose.</li>
    <li> The only thing that helped with postpartum rash. Horrible smell, but it works.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my wife&#x27;s skin condition. She had extremely dry flaky skin on her back and chest. It lathers great and the smell is not noticeable after a few washes. We go camping every year so somewhat used to that smell. It did not help with acne at all.</li>
    <li> Works, smells nice, cleans you.  Good soap.</li>
    <li> Is this stuff supposed to work on acne? After using for a week, my skin looks a lot cleaner than usual. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The tar scent is a little powerful  and takes getting used to, but I really enjoy using this soap!</li>
    <li> This soap has been a consistent staple in our home since we&#x27;ve discovered it two years ago. Clean, rinses off well, and great for pregnancy when you deal with PUPPPs. Lathers great as well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have had a beard for nearly 45 years and it has never looked better.  In fact, all my body hair is looking better!  Learning vocabulary from the ladies, I would say that this soap gives my beard and body hair more &amp;#34;body.&amp;#34;  It is a different look for me, but my wife loves it.  She has started drawing her fingers through my beard and body hair--never did that before!  She says she likes the way my body hair looks and feels...has lots of body but is not stiff.  She says I smell delightful, too.  I like the smell too.  To me the soap smells like fresh buckskin or untanned soft leather.  Great masculine scent.  Even after bathing with it we do not find the scent overly strong.</li>
    <li> Makes my whole bathroom smell like my grandfather&#x27;s wood shop. Make sure you like that smell because it&#x27;s gonna be around for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This helped tremendously when I had PUPPS and cholestasis during my pregnancy. It didn&#x27;t provide 100% relief (and nothing can for those conditions other than delivery) but provided some relief. It does have a smokey campfire odor which bothered my husband but I enjoyed it. The soap has such a clean feeling without over drying that I continue to use it even after my pregnancy. The only downside is it does leave a brown residue in your bath/tub if it is white.</li>
    <li> Still trying this soap.  I was surprise the tar smell doesn&#x27;t linger like some.  Seems to be helping with skin issue for my son.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I bought it for my beard because I had some irritated skin, it took care of that and I even use it as a dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it has helped my psoriasis a little.  I would like it a lot more if it smelled more like a pine tree and less like tar.</li>
    <li> This soap is totally wonderful.  I don&#x27;t have a chronic skin problem, but use this soap on my whole body because I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. I live in the tropics and work outside a lot. I get insect bites from time to time that this soap soothes and heals. I don&#x27;t mind the smell because of how beneficial the soap is.</li>
    <li> Cleans your body great, suds up well, long lasting, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I won&#x27;t repurchase only because I wish I liked the smell more. My husband won&#x27;t even use it because of the scent, which surprised me. But what do you expect, that&#x27;s how pine tar soap smells right?</li>
    <li> As a soap it lathers up thick and does stop a lot of itching that I have.  The main reason it gets a 4 star is that the smell is really, really strong.  It&#x27;s definitely an acquired smell. It does not smell like a Pine tree.</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as some claim. Its a good bar of soap.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap in the world!!!?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for over a year now. Best soap ever.</li>
    <li> great price, great soap.  despite containing pine tar and looking like mud, this does actually lather white.  i can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;m objectively cleaner than with other soaps, because how do you measure that really?  however, i can say this stuff washes off clean and you smell like a great big manly campfire - reasonably so.  who wouldn&#x27;t love that?</li>
    <li> Well, this stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve never tried a different pine tar soap because I can&#x27;t imagine another company topping Grandpa&#x27;s recipe. The smell is of great concern and consequence, it is truly a man&#x27;s smell and the woman in your life might not be in love with it. I&#x27;ve heard some strange descriptions of the scent, but it&#x27;s really pretty simple. Imagine the last bit of smoke coming off of a campfire made strictly out of pine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell of the soap, but I continue to use it because it helps with the terrible dry skin on my back and arms. I also like how well it cleans my hair, but I recommend buying the Pine Tar Shampoo because I don&#x27;t like the way the bar soap makes my hair feel in the shower. Also, if you do wash your hair with the soap and your lady friend dislikes the smell, I would suggest that you buy a tube of Brylcreem. Not only does it make the pine tar smell disappear, it looks great!</li>
    <li> If you have a beard...buy this...use it...be a man.</li>
    <li> I think this is our default soap from now until forever...haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to use liquid soaps for our bathing and daily hand washing etc but I started thinking about cost of those soaps and how most of the volume was water...Paying for water? Yeesh...Plus liquid soaps ordered online mean heavier shipping which means the whole price is more expensive not to mention you risk a soapy busted surprise any time you order liquids be delivered...&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I know this is going to sound goofy but I really did think &amp;#34;if only we could have a more concentrated soap without the liquid that we could sort of re-liquify to use&amp;#34; durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr that was when I realized I was re-inventing the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid soap. Durrrrrrrr&lt;br /&gt;Solid bar soap has been around for ages, it&#x27;s more concentrated than liquid (easier to take on a plane or travel with) stores very nicely and from my own experience is more affordable to use than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS soap is lovely. Have you ever had lapsang souchong tea? It&#x27;s a tea where the leaves are dried and smoked over pine...so it smells smokey and vaguely piney. This soap smells EXACTLY like that! Which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now, while the soap it self smells quite strong I find that when you lather and use the aroma is much fainter and by the time you rinse it&#x27;s not there at all. Evvvvvvery once in a while I&#x27;ll catch a faint woodsy smoke scent from myself or my husband...very very faint.  I mention this because I am very particular about added scents in our home...and life for that matter and while lapsang souchong smoked pine smell is nice for a little burst I don&#x27;t want to smell it constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients of this soap are about as pure as I can find. Nothing weird or scary in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband even uses it to wash his hair and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers very nicely and I use it for shaving legs and it&#x27;s been great. A very good all around useful soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have concerns that bar soap is unhygienic...I dunno...it&#x27;s been around a long time....also you just need to use a little extra precaution. Don&#x27;t leave it sitting in a puddle. Let it dry out, this makes it last longer as well...I let mine sit and dry on a pumice stone bar that I have. The soap actually adheres itself to the bar and we use the pumice stone as a handle. It&#x27;s a pretty great all in one soap &amp;#34;dish&amp;#34; handle etc.&lt;br /&gt;We do currently live in a VERY dry climate so things here dry out very quickly. If you live in a more humid climate and your soap stays soft or whatever you can always cut the soap into smaller bar chunks to use. This way you avoiding soaking the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s also what we do when we travel and take soap with us. No need for another liquid for TSA to be concerned about and the smaller travel sized bar is perfect for carrying. No need for any extra luggage weight :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read some interesting things about the skin benefits of pine tar soap. Both my husband and I have sensitive skin and have found this soap to be gentle and soothing for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a good price too, as compared to our local health food store (MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THERE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap exclusively for over a year now..so, yeah, it&#x27;s our go to soap for the foreseeable future :)ople have concerns that bar soap is unhygienic...I dunno...it&#x27;s been around a long time....also you just need to use a little extra precaution.

    <li> Grandpa&#x27;s Soap Pine Tar Bar Soap -  best deal. my husband loves this soap. It is the best for his skin, it really helps with dry dkin, keeps it moisturized and the pine tar smell rinses off.</li>
    <li> I have a very acute sense of smell that is practically super-human (lamest super power ever), and while I love pine, cedar and spruce scents, this &amp;#34;pine tar&amp;#34; scent smells more like a burnt log than anything clean and fresh.  I couldn&#x27;t use it and couldn&#x27;t even leave it in the bathroom the smell is so strong (for me).</li>
    <li> Bleh! This stuff has a wicked strong smell. And not a good one. It smells like straight up chemicals. Makes me gag.</li>
    <li> Smells lime pine wood works great for itchy skin amazon sucks for making a certain amount of words for a review</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never smelled pine tar before, prepare yourself. It&#x27;s a really interesting experience. First it smells like burnt rubber, then it smells like rich fragrant pine. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I use it as both a shampoo and a body wash for its &amp;#34;dandruff properties&amp;#34; to nourish the roots/scalp of my hair and help my dry skin. It works miracles for itchy [dry] skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like a camp fire, but you don&#x27;t notice it after a while. Plus, one bar lasted me a very long time (compared to other bars I use) -- about 5 months using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this since I read so many reviews on how it helps with the the pregnancy related rash PUPPS.  I have only used it 3 times so far over the course of 2 days, combined with V8 juice and A&amp;D ointment and so far, I have seen an improvement. It does not necessarily take the itch away but lessens it, and it seems the rash has greatly decreased.  Thanks to all those who shared this information as this rash is truly a horrible condition and doctors don&#x27;t have any medical solution for it, so this information is greatly helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does have a strong odor itself, but leaves a faint odor on the skin when used. It smells like smoke- not the best smell, yet not the worst, and when you&#x27;re suffering, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with PUPPS to atleast try it.</li>
    <li> I am 6 months pregnant and have PUPPP. This soap works great at relieving the itching and irritation during the day. I use it in combination with Benadryl at night.</li>
    <li> The aroma is strong, and many (my wife included) don&#x27;t like it.  That said, my buddy named this stuff right:  &amp;#34;Stank-Off-Ya&amp;#34; soap.  This removes BO better than any &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; some I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And the strong aroma does not linger after the suds are washed off, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for premium odor protection (at the cost of having your bathroom smell like the soap all the time), this is the stuff to get!</li>
    <li> I like this soap, it is smokey like a campfire or smoker that has been going with some hickory in it.  However my girl hates this and says it smells like a llantera (tire shop) for you non-border states.  I like it though and would use it.</li>
    <li> Smells like a camp fire but it will sure take the itch out of poison ivy.</li>
    <li> I like it. strong odor but very manly. Keeps skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
    <li> I bought this product after doing a little research into what soaps would do well for beard maintenance. I have always been the type to just let it grow and wash it with whatever shampoo I was using at the time. I feel that my beard is being washed better with Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap then it was with other shampoos (given those were meant for the scalp). I would give this product 5 stars, but I feel as if each bar would only last me about 2-3 weeks use, if I used it everyday (I&#x27;m still experimenting on whether I will soap everyday or every other day, as I have read that it depends on the individual). Then again, I am not sure if that&#x27;s how fast bars of soap are supposed to be used up (I normally use body wash and liquid hand soap). If you are an avid beardsman or someone that uses bars of soap on the regular and know that this is normal, then consider this a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find that it last longer than expected (halfway thru my first bar), than I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with Rosacea about two months ago. I was prescribed MetroGel and it was not effective at treating my now red, scaly, rash covered face. So, after extensive research...and I mean very extensive, I discovered that there were four items which came highly recommended by Rosacea sufferers all over the world. Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen.  After I stopped using the MetroGel and switched over to these four products, used day and night (sunscreen only in the morning)...I have had clear skin, zero redness, zero irritation and extremely minimal flushing. My triggers WERE alcohol, heat, sun, cold and exercise. None of these have affected me so far since I began this regimen. I  hope this is useful for any other Rosacea sufferers out there!</li>
    <li> When I was around 37 weeks pregnant, I got the terrible pregnancy rash, PUPPPS. It was horribly itchy, terribly uncomfortable and I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone! I searched online for a solution and I found Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap. I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it worked! I used it 2 to 3 times a day in the shower. I would lather it on and let it sit on the rash for a while before rinsing off. It smells very strongly and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but I was desperate. In about 4 days, the rash got much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The reason I say I&#x27;m &amp;#34;pretty sure&amp;#34; it worked is because I also tried another weird home remedy at the same time, and I&#x27;m not 100% sure which remedy it was that did the trick. My midwife recommended taking &amp;#34;Dandelion root extract&amp;#34; pills. I tried taking these in addition to the Pine Tar Soap, and the rash finally cleared up. So talk to your doctor or midwife about dandelion root pills if you are suffering from PUPPPS!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have psoriasis and this seems to help keep it in control. My skin feels clean and fresh after using it. Bonus was that it seems to help keep mosquitos at bay.</li>
    <li> Great product, hard to find in stores anymore, this is a  one step easy solution to a multitude of skin and scalp issues. This product seems to be as good as the one I used nearly 60 years ago. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re reading through all these product reviews you&#x27;re probably very itchy and very desperate. I had the PUPPS pregnancy rash during my pregnancy and post partum for about 5 weeks (lucky me). I scowered the internet looking for anything that would help because if you have it, you know it&#x27;s awful. Many blogs referenced this soap saying it either helped or cured PUPPS. Having nothing to lose, I ordered the gel and the bar pine tar soap as well  as a slew of other lotions and creams and hoped for the best. While I can&#x27;t say Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap cured my PUPPS I can&#x27;t say it hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know...&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, it smells terrible but when you&#x27;re ready to scratch your own skin off the smell isn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;2. For best use, my suggestion is to lather up, (which this soap gives you plenty of bubbles) turn the water off, let it sit for 10 minutes, and rinse with cold water for maximum relief.&lt;br /&gt;3. Be realistic. No soap, lotion, dandelion root, or in my case tears and profanity are going to instantly cure PUPPS. It&#x27;s caused by an allergic reaction to fetal cells so you&#x27;ll need to give birth and wait for the remaining cells in your circulatory system to die... Which could take a few days to a few weeks. The good news is, this smelly soap does help your skin feel better, even if it&#x27;s just for a little while. And that my friends is totally with the few bucks this soap costs.</li>
    <li> The only thing that helped my pupps pregnancy itching. Stinky but was the only relief I got from terrible itching during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I found that I could use when pregnant! My skin was so reactive and dry/itchy but this soap really helped!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a mans soap. It smells a little like a campfire. I bought it for my husband and now he won&#x27;t use anything else. He uses it as his soap, shampoo, and beard cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is awesome if you want to smell like a bonfire. We have a lot of bonfires and want to use soap to smell different from a bonfire. I like pine, though, and was hoping this soap would be woody smelling. For city-dwellers, this may be reminiscent of s&#x27;mores and camping, and for that, you may love this product!</li>
    <li> My family thinks it&#x27;s &amp;#34;bacon scented&amp;#34; soap. I guess it&#x27;s an acquired taste in soaps.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. Never before has my skin felt so soft and moisturized yet rugged and manly. I smell as if I&#x27;ve done a mans work chopping lumber and putting out forest fires with nothing more than the sparkle of my smile and the wink of my eye. Seriously the &amp;#34;campfire&amp;#34; aroma is not overbearing, it&#x27;s quite subtle and someone really has to bury their nose in your beard and chest and inhale deeply to catch a whiff of the campfire tones. I&#x27;ve gone from being a man to being a man Premium+ edition with how good this soap is.</li>
    <li> I developed PUPPP during my pregnancy and this is a miracle soap.  After about a week my rash had cleared up.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it helps to kill chiggers on us after working in yard</li>
    <li> Gosh this soap is wonderful. It smells strong when you first open the box. But it rinses clean and leaves the skin feeling great. My wife likes it on me. Plus it has done really well with my toddlers eczema. If you are on the fence you should really take the plunge and try it.</li>
    <li> Since finding this soap earlier this year.. I&#x27;ve returned several times for more. the smell is not overbearing and the soap lathers very nicely. It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin. The soap is excellent at deodorizing &amp; helps my son keep his face clear of acne. It also helps clear up minor skin rashes. I got the whole family using this 100% natural soap as we try to avoid the harsh chemicals in 99‰ of soaps on the shelves at your local drugstore. It&#x27;s all we use now.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong, but you get used to it. However, I had to put the extra bars into a zip-lock bag to keep my whole bathroom smelling like pine tar. I have yet to realize the supposed benefits to my skin from the soap, so I don&#x27;t expect to purchase any more.</li>
    <li> Smells like smoke, not sure what I was expecting though!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Great for my skin.  I think it smells fabulous.  Has made acne smaller and smaller.  I wish the price would come down on this amazing product, however.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever. I know, it&#x27;s brown and looks like mud, but man it is great to use. It lathers white and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin to greasy or to dry. It&#x27;s just right.  The slight pine smell is an added bonus.  Works well for the hair too in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I never actually used this bar on my postpartum itchy body because it smelled so bad.  The outside of the package smelled before even opening it and made the area it sat in for a few days smell too.  It smells like smoke.. Like when you smoke meats!  My sense of smell is crazy from pregnancy and I really don&#x27;t enjoy the taste or I guess smell of smoked foods, so I didn&#x27;t even use this product.  It&#x27;s too bad because I&#x27;m sure it would have helped my itching but I just couldn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s made by a small, family owned company , and I hate leaving them a negative review but this product just wasn&#x27;t right for me, which isn&#x27;t to say it wouldn&#x27;t have helped my itching!  It may have, I just couldn&#x27;t get myself to use it!</li>
    <li> I was recommended to try this soap by a friend who seems to love it for baths and lathers and was told if I wanted to be a man, this is the soap I needed. As far as &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; is concerned, it does a pretty good job. Lathers really well and I used a bar during showers as well and seemed to work. I have fairly sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative part is the smell. To some, the campfire smell is wonderful and this is probably who it was made for. For me, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but what I got was that &amp;#34;I just came from a bonfire and now smell like smoke&amp;#34; smell throughout my bathroom. If I don&#x27;t use the soap for a few days, the smell dies down and I can use my bathroom again (lawl), but as soon as I use it, it activates the smells of smoldering souls and it bothers my allergies unfortunately. Whether it&#x27;s psychological or the pine tar is what I&#x27;m allergic to, it kind of sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 stars. If you love (and I mean LOVE) the campfire/dying fire/smokey essence, then this soap is for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the appeal - this stuff smells awful, couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of my own face after using this soap.</li>
    <li> Purchase this for my daughter in law while pregnant, she was going crazy with itch skin, this is the Best thing out there, for when you have PUPPS while pregnant, rash skin, or any type of itchy skin... I purchase this size because she was in her early stages!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Good stuff...smells like...pine tar?  Anyway, cleans VERY well without drying the skin.  In some ways this stuff gives the sense of being medicinal.  I have very hard water from a well saturated with iron and this soap cleans and rinses completely.</li>
    <li> This smells like a wet dog slept in a fire pit; a fire pit that was once used to burn Christmas trees and broken promises. I&#x27;ve tested dozens of hygiene products - everything from beard oil and talcum powder to hair tonic and bay rum -- and this bar of soap is probably my worst purchase ever. For reference, this is coming from a half glass full kind of guy. Seriously. It stunk up my entire bathroom so bad that I had to put it in my garage. The family of raccoons living there subsequently moved out without giving a 30-day notice. It pains me to write such a negative review. But, such is life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, if you like smelling terrible, this soap might be for you.</li>
    <li> THE BEST! i use it for my toddler who now has clear skin. No more diaper rashes or eczema anywhere on her body. I love it! Initially i was taken back by its scent, but now, i love the way it smells too! My husband started using this soap as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing.  It makes you smell like a man.</li>
    <li> I used this soap as a child growing up in rural western Kansas and have loved rediscovering it. Pine Tar may be an acquired experience but the rewards are worth it: a very natural smell, a good sense of clean skin with a long day of feeling that way as well as hydrated.</li>
    <li> has helped my psoriasis immensely.  I&#x27;d give it a full five stars, but the smell of it is really strong.  Burning tires on my head is not exactly nice</li>
    <li> Best beard soap made. Cleans freshens and make your beard look and feel amazing. I&#x27;ll for sure be buying this product again</li>
    <li> If you have rough, cracked elbows try using this soap on them. It works great! I have always had an issue with dry, rough elbows and this soap has really helped. I have found that it is much better than the scrubs I have tried.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this based on other reviews that said it was too strong. However, I decided to go for it, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It has a masculine scent and though the bar itself does seem to smell a little strong, that strength of scent won&#x27;t carry over onto your body.  The wife says she can only smell it when she is very close, well within the distance you would have any strangers in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I realize Pine Tar Soap isn&#x27;t to everyone&#x27;s taste but to those of us who like the texture, the smell, and the cleaning it provides it&#x27;s a wonderful blend. Grandpa&#x27;s brand is an excellent choice in this delightful scent. The shipment was quickly done, soap packaged well, and works like I remember. Highly recommended to those looking for a different scent and powerful cleaning abilities.</li>
    <li> I developed a case of PUPPS after my third child. It is a horrible, terribly itchy rash. This soap really helped \\&quot;cure\\&quot; this as well as minimize the itching. It smells just AWFUL!!! Like smoke to me?? I keep it in a zip lock bag in the shower so my whole bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell! If you have itchy skin (I also have eczema which it works on as well)... and nothing is working, you may want to give this a try!</li>
    <li> iv,e bought it before and it,s just wonderful thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used on myself, but I use it on my American Pit Bull Terrier that&#x27;s super allergic to the majority of the dog shampoos on the market. I&#x27;ve even tried using the hypoallergenic shampoos for dogs, but he always breaks out in hives. This soap was recommended by someone who also has an allergy ridden pittie. This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll ever use in my ban</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this soap because I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a sub-tropical flower&#x27;s vagina. That just wasn&#x27;t what I was going for. I wanted to smell like a man. Initially I thought maybe I would exercise and build up that sweat smell, but this was seriously hurting my game. In comes Grandpa&#x27;s Soap Pine Tar Bar Soap. This stuff is basically distilled Paul Bunyan Semen. After one shower you will be able to tell the difference between this and some chemical shower goop that smells like Rosie O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s twat. You smell like a pine tree and you are zestfully clean... wait.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, so clean and fresh. The smell is mild compared to some others pine tar soaps I have used. Comes off good, love it will be buying more.. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I use this once to twice a day in combination with Cetaphil moisturizer and it really helps relieve PUPPS symptoms.  It works so much better than normal soap for the itching.  I got used to the smell after about a week of using it.</li>
    <li> it o k, a little strong on scent</li>
    <li> This soap really works great!  I bought it for bad post pregnancy Pupp, it was hell and nothing the Dr prescribed was working, day 1 itching stopped and after a couple days they were all gone.  I gave it to Grandma and another older friend who have body yeast issues due to medications, worked great rash gone after two uses!  I have given it to friends with eczema and after decades of suffering they have relief.  If you are reading this, then you are thinking if trying it, try it!</li>
    <li> The bar is pretty thin and long rectangular.&lt;br /&gt;Make it thicker and shorter in order to use easily.&lt;br /&gt;I just started to use it.</li>
    <li> the BEST beard soap.. hands down!!! I love this soap, I would recomend it to anyone with a beard.. long or short... I love this for my beard.. here is why..&lt;br /&gt;1. It stops (for me atleast) all &#x27;acne like&#x27; stuff underneath my beard and reduces almost all of my beard itch... I love it and when it runs out and I got the few days without it while I re-order on Amazon, I notice a huge difference and get itchier and oilier on my skin..&lt;br /&gt;2. I use this also for my whole face after my beard wash, and it works WONDERS on any skin blemishes. I&#x27;ve never really had bad acne or pimples.. but I do notice I get almost NONE now and have a very nice skin texture without it being overly dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it for what it is.. it works well for ME, my beard and face... I will comment that the scent is actually very strong and almost annoying too annoying who is not into Ultra Manly scents.. my gf hates it and now has a &#x27;soap container&#x27; for it.. which actually helps the smell from making our bathroom smell like the manliest pine scent ever. Also.. when using it for underarms and a bodysoap. the smell doesn&#x27;t linger and fades away after toweling off.</li>
    <li> I have been  using this for a while and really like the lather and smell as well as the clean feeeling that it leaves behind. I get it three bars at a time and it lasts a while. Great as a shampoo sometimes too.</li>
    <li> I found this and upon smelling it my immediate thought was &amp;#34;MY TEETH HURT!&amp;#34;  I fell backwards and nearly injured myself severely in an attempt to remove myself from the sheer STENCH that came from that brown bar of soap.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it was made by throwing bigfoot into a campfire and condensing whatever was left into this 3.25 ounce bar of testosterone fueled cleansing.  It may clean well, but after smelling it, you might want to reconsider trying it.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little overwhelming but I bought this b/c I read many claims that it would help relieve itching associated with pregnancy rash. It really does help significantly!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It&#x27;s similar to what my father, who was an immigrant from Scotland, used.  It&#x27;s clean smelling, lathers up quickly and&lt;br /&gt;abundantly.  I use it at least once a month, between other products, for my shampoo.  I also use it for my bath/shower.  While it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;hard milled&amp;#34; soap like from France, it certainly is much harder than other bar soaps on the market and doesn&#x27;t leave blobs of dissolved soap in&lt;br /&gt;the soap dish.  Everyone one should try it once and many, I believe, will use it again and again.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Pine Tar Soap.  In fact, first time I ever heard of Pine Tar Soap.  Straight out of the packaging the first time I thought the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; was really strong, and that I and my home would smell like a pine forest, but I think that is just because it was in a sealed package.  Now I don&#x27;t ever catch a whiff of the unused bars where they are stored or on me when I bathe with it.  I use this because of psoriasis on my elbows and since I have it, I wash my feet with it too.  The scent does not linger, and both feet and elbows are happy enough.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use this exclusively, but I&#x27;m loyally using it as I said without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Everyone has already said it.  This soap is AWESOME.  It is like bathing with pine cones, without the prickly needles of course.  I find the smell to be somewhat addicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizes, but also makes you feel squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> Great all natural soap love it use it every time I take a bath or a shower..</li>
    <li> Great Soap. Awesome for beards.</li>
    <li> Weird soap. I thought it would smell like pine (I spent a good deal of time in the Colorado Rockies and love the smell of the pine trees), but to me it smells like aging bacon. Nice smell for breakfast, but not it the shower. It does clean well.&lt;br /&gt;I like to try new things and there are always a few klinkers. This was one of them...</li>
    <li> Smells like a campfire built out of pine logs, which, for me, smells great. The smell does not stick to you much. Lathers very well, could be used to shave. Like other tar soap products such as t-gels, may relieve certain skin conditions and dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients list on package: Coconut oil, palm oil, purified water, pine tar oil, vegetable glycerine</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP REALLY WORKS, THATS ALL THERE IS TO SAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with dermatitis for more than 10 years. I&#x27;ve used every medication, mostly steroids and nothing works well at all. It&#x27;s been a constant losing battle. Yesterday I heard about this soap and have used it 3 times so far. It&#x27;s miraculous, there has been more healing in the last 24 hours than any medication I&#x27;ve tried. My skin felt entirely different after the first wash. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to treat very VERY itchy stomach skin postpartum. I opened it, gagged, and set up my return label. STANKY</li>
    <li> A great soap for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use for pregnancy related hives (PUPPS or PEP).  It has been like a miracle treatment compared to any over the counter anti-itch cream.  Lasts for about 6 hours, so requires showering about 3 times daily.  The results are defintiely worth the smell!</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this soap!! I bought it because of the reviews regarding PUPP rash. I do not have PUPPS I have plain old pregnancy itch and it&#x27;s horrible. No rash just full body non stop itching. I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and I have wanted to crawl out of my skin for about 6 weeks now. I hadn&#x27;t had a good night&#x27;s sleep in weeks. If I was lucky enough to doze off for a few hours I would wake up with gashes in my skin and blood on my sheets. I have literally tried everything from benadryl, oatmeal baths, oils, sugar scrubs and every lotion and moisturizer I could find. I bought this soap and lathered up in the tub leaving it on a few minutes before rinsing off. No it doesn&#x27;t smell great however when I got out and dried off I could barely smell it on my skin. I haven&#x27;t itched at all since my bath last night and I got my first full night of sleep aside from my bladder calling several times of course. I intend to use it again tonight before bed. It left my skin feeling slick and moisturized without feeling greasy. If by some chance last night was a fluke I will update my review but today this soap is my best friend lol......a full night of sleep will do that to you :)</li>
    <li> One of very few soaps that doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s skin. Its a staple for us.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap to help with beard dandruff. Lots of folks recommended pine tar soap, and I&#x27;ve got to say that so far it&#x27;s been working out great! The soap lathers really well and has definitely helped with itchy skin under my beard.</li>
    <li> This stuff takes some getting used to--it smells like a new leather belt mixed with fresh-cut branches when you open a box.  Once you get over the initial smell, you will love this soap.  It is the best lather of any soap I have ever used, and obviously much higher quality than off-the-shelf supermarket soap.  Coconut oil, pine tar and other goodness will leave your skin feeling clean and moisturized.  Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
    <li> Great shipping time and packaging. Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap has a very rich woody&#x27;s pine smell. While the rich strong smell does not stick you as a strong smell.It does lather up real well and leave you feeling clean, with very soft skin.This soap has cured dry itchy skin, eczema, scalp problems, skin blemishes,dog flea&#x27;s for my family. It&#x27;s the only soap I will buy. I highly recommend the soap.</li>
    <li> I discovered this brand because I googled products that helped with beard dandruff, and it was recommended.  The difference between when I use this soap or not is quite noticeable as when I don&#x27;t use this soap,  little dead skin particles pepper my shirt after a day or 2 of using other soaps.  It has a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; campfire smell too, &amp;#34;pine tar&amp;#34; is a pretty accurate description of the smell which may not appeal to everyone, but even on my arms and legs it helps reduce dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. My cousin recommended it to me because of my acne, and it has helped quite a lot to clear up my skin. It&#x27;s pretty good to shave with too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Used it many rears ago, and after recent flaky skin problems decided to give it a try again.  It really seems to be helping!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and this soap really helped a lot. I used it in combination with light treatment. It does have a bad smell when it is just sitting there but doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any odor on my skin after I use it. Smells much better than tar shampoo in my hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for about 4 days and I love the way it smells.  People have made comments about how the like the way my bathroom smells, but a warning for those of you who don&#x27;t like strong smells, this soap will make your entire bathroom smell like it, which is remnant of a camp fire, but it leans towards wood more than the smoky smell of fire.&lt;br /&gt;A few things I&#x27;ve noticed about it&#x27;s use.  As I want to smell super manly all over, I have been using this in lieu of shampoo as well as on my body.  One negative about using it on my hair is that it really removes the oils in my hair, or at least it makes my hair stick together a bit more and knot easier when I comb it.  As of yet it has not helped me with dandruff, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days so you can only expect so much.  I will update if it resolves my minor dandruff issue.&lt;br /&gt;This is also an awesome gift for your grandfathers, because they enjoy the old fashioned smell and how manly it makes them feel(Gave one bar to my grandfather and he loved the way it smelled)&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Smells awesome(but strong) and may not contain magical properties to fix all your woes, but feels nice on your skin.</li>
    <li> Makes a really nice lather and smells amazing. Strong earthy smell for sure.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin and hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells like a camp fire. Skin doesn&#x27;t seem to feel dry after it&#x27;s use. This is good.</li>
    <li> summer means skin irritations from insect bites to skin rashes.  Have been using this soap for years and love it&#x27;s skin soothing properties.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this actually existed when my boyfriend told me how much he loved this soap.  And let&#x27;s be honest, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to smell good, at all.  Well I&#x27;ll be the first to say I had it all wrong. It smells great and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I&#x27;ll be sure to try the other styles when this one runs out. Or, I&#x27;ll just get more for some variety.</li>
    <li> smells really strong at first but give it 15 minutes after you shower and the smell really mellows down however as a bearded and extremely hairy dude, this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells good, lathers better than gel and better than any other soap I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and break out in rashes when my clothes are washed in TIDE detergent and have had absolutely zero problems with this. I use this on my head (thin hair), and my beard (EXTREMELY THICK), and body (thick and on nearly every inch of my body). Lathers white and leaves my hair/beard and skin feeling amazing, smooth, clean, and fresh. Lots of soap bars leave me feeling gross but this one is great. Works great and doesn&#x27;t conflict with beard oil&#x27;s smell nor with cologne. Literally after 15 minutes it&#x27;s not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good product. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of gels, shampoos, dandruff shampoos, you name it, and this is something that all of my roommates have quickly converted to as well. As a sidenote you would be able to tell who was using your soap if you&#x27;re in a shared shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> This soap is the only product that gave my wife relief from her skin itching in the last two months of pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I kinda like the soap, but my wife says I smell like a pitcher&#x27;s resin bag.  Since I&#x27;m no longer allowed to use this soap, its been relegated to office/shop use, but its pretty good soap.  If you want clean hands that smell like pine tar, this is the soap for you.</li>
    <li> Good soap. The smell does not bother me at all. At least I know I am using a natural product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works magic! It helps greatly with PUPPP rash and make my skin very soft and cleared up my blemishes!</li>
    <li> I love the clean feeling I get from the soap.  I can wash my hair down to my feet with this soap.  I have used it for a long time and found it recently on Amazon.  Thank you amazon for selling it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement on my skin already. Highly recommend for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  My wife hates the scent, but I think it&#x27;s frickin&#x27; awesome.  The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> My daughter said that this soup left her skin clean and soft.  She suffer from psoriasis and with this soap she does not have dryness.</li>
    <li> Had to keep it in tupperware because fiance couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement to psoriasis areas (the reason I bought it).</li>
    <li> This soap is just like we used to use when I was a little kid, and it does a great job too.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this soap after it was recommended for PUPPS hives.  After reading reviews, I was intrigued to learn that it could help with eczema and ordered it immediately.  As a long time eczema sufferer, I have tried EVERYTHING to rid my hands of their dry patches.  Unfortunately, this has not proven to be any miracle soap.  After a week of exclusive use, my hives and eczema rashes are still in abundance.  It is a nice enough soap and hasn&#x27;t aggravated my symptoms, but it has not solved any of my problems.  I will also agree with other reviewers that it smells like one would after going to a bonfire.  I do not find it unpleasant, but some might.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
    <li> For reasons I can&#x27;t fully explain, this has been my soap of choice for the last 4 years.  No joke!  I got it for a temporary case of eczema, but was so beguiled by the scent I just kept reordering it and using it. It makes you smell like a beach fire--wild and free.  Doesn&#x27;t conflict with fragrances, just leaves an incredible smoky outdoors smell as a basenote.  Makes all other soap fragrances smell like pitty pat amateur stuff--this is the real deal.  Slather it on and soak in the mystery.</li>
    <li> The Soap is Awesome. But it Smells like a South Carolina Truck Stop.....Next to a Trash Incinerator.....Somewhere in a pine forest.</li>
    <li> My husband said he isn&#x27;t pleased with it, as far as skin improvement, ....  The label and packaging is nice...It washes and lathers well he said.....</li>
    <li> This soap is definitely worth trying.  I used in on a weird rash on my upper arm that has re-occurred every 4 or 5 months for a couple of years.  While it has always eventually cleared up, this time it did not respond to coal tar soap,  antibiotics, prescription strength steroid cream, or an antifungal cream.  I also tied tea tree oil which didn&#x27;t work either.  In the past, the area was not larger than a silver dollar but this time it grew to an oval that probably was about 4&amp;#34; by 3&amp;#34;.  I am a RN and have had extra education in skin care.  This left me, my long time family doctor, and her very experienced  Physician Assistant stumped.  The next step was to wait several weeks for an appointment with a  dermatologist and a possible biopsy.  Before making the appointment, I decided to order this soap.  Meanwhile, this rash was spreading and was larger that it had ever been in the past and I wanted to chew my arm off.  It was itchy but painful if I scratched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap arrived in the mail and I began washing the area 2 to 3 times a day.  Basically, if my arm felt itchy then I washed it.  There was a small improvement after 24 hours and then a slow and steady improvement for about 12 days  until the rash was gone.  I have barely put a dent in the bar of soap.  I would guess that I have used less than 10 percent of the first bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that this will not work for every skin condition because nothing will work for everything. For me, the only downside is that  I really dislike the smell, which is like stale wood smoke.  I would deal with the natural smell than have the manufacturer add a potentially irritating fragrance to the soap.  However, given my experience, I would recommend giving it a shot.  It is cheaper and less damaging than many other treatments.  Also, it saved me time, money, and probably a small invasive procedure by avoiding a trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are sensitive to the ingredients, give it a shot.give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I used it when I was 30 weeks pregnant and was suffering from severe pupps. This soap worked like magic! within 7 days pupps came down and itching reduced drastically....  Eventually  i was pupps free! :)  highly recommend this soap</li>
    <li> This works great for my periodic seborrhoeic dermatitis which flares up occasionally, but lately in the fall. I get it on my scalp, but a dose of pine tar soap rubbed into my scalp and left on for a while to be rinsed out later with head and shoulders does the trick. It cleared up a patch of seborrhoeic dermatitis I have had for two weeks now and which I normally treat with steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say the scent of pine tar is that wonderful. In fact, I don&#x27;t care for it. But it does its job and I can&#x27;t complain about the results!</li>
    <li> Favorite soap. Makes you smell like a forest. Very strong smell, but not overpowering when you finish washing and rinsing. You can use it as shampoo, but your hair gets rather heavy and stiff over time if it&#x27;s all you use. If you&#x27;re looking for a very slicked look without having to use any product, it may be just the thing for you.</li>
    <li> I had read that Pine Tar Soap helps keep insects away.  So, I tried it. I must say that it DOES appear to significantly ward off mosquitoes.  I&#x27;d suggest that anybody who tends to be a mosquito magnet might want to try this. I think it works and while not a miracle cure for insect repellents, I definitely see a difference.  They don&#x27;t swarm around me as they used to! I am sure the scent has something to do with it.</li>
    <li> received my first bar as a &amp;#34;here try this&amp;#34;.  was hesitant at first but it&#x27;s the bomb!  the smell of pine tar doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;in fact, i prefer it to those flowery scents and the &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34; chemical smell of other soaps; those give me a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;the floor of my shower feels clean, too.  it doesn&#x27;t have that slick, somewhat slippery feel  other soaps or other organic washes&lt;br /&gt;leave.</li>
    <li> I was super itchy with this latest pregnancy for MONTHS, and finally invested in this soap. After using it twice daily for 2 weeks, the itching resolved and now I only need to use it 2-3 times /week. I also use Gold Bond medicated lotion after I shower and that has helped a lot too.</li>
    <li> If you have come here looking to see if this helps with PUP rejoice, because it does! Now it will not take the itch away completely, but it will help after your shower and shorten the time of the rash. I used a stiff body brush and the soap twice a day and mine cleared up in a week. Beware it is so stinky. But if you have PUP I don&#x27;t think you care. I had postpartum pups which covered my legs and arms. This really helped the misery.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping awesome product! Don&#x27;t use anything else in for my beard and hair. It makes me smell like a camp fire.... I mean a man. It&#x27;s liquid fire.</li>
    <li> A quick review of Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap. And my thoughts and comments  http://youtu.be/hikzAkOaEGM</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with PUPPPs pregnancy rash at 33 weeks pregnant.  I was getting covered with the most unbelievably itchy rash and nothing seemed to help it.  I went online in desperation and found that many PUPPPs-inflicted pregnant women used this soap and found great results.  With skepticism, I ordered it and have used it as others have suggested during two daily showers (morning and night), leaving the lather on my skin for about 1-2 minutes, and rinsing with lukewarm water.  I have found that miraculously this is the only thing that helps me - honestly it helps better that the prescription steroid cream my OB and dermotologist recommended to me.  If I start to feel the least bit itchy in an area, taking a shower with this soap helps calm the itch pretty quickly.  Unfortunately for PUPPPs, this lasts throughout pregnancy so I have had to stick to my two showers a day regimen for nearly 2 weeks now (gets old, but it&#x27;s worth it for relief).  This soap has bought me more sleep and some relief!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. Its very strong. But it is a decent soap</li>
    <li> This soap is lovely. Works like soap should! Has a rich, smokey pine tar scent; very strong. Arrived fast. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This soap completely stops beard itch. Plain and simple. It also clears up skin very nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, and not one day have I experienced beard itch, even when I let my neck beard grow in. I use a straight razor to clean around my neck and cheeks and using this soap after my usual shaving soap softens the stub preventing any razor burn afterward. For you gentlemen trying to grow a beard or suffering from beard itch, use this soap. It does smell like a recently doused campfire, but hey, that&#x27;s a plus in my book. I also use Dr. Ganix Beard Bomb conditioning oils afterward while my beard is still damp to keep it soft and add a chocolatey orange scent.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome for curing itchy skin.  I had PUPPS rash at the end of my pregnancy and nothing else even took the edge off the itch.  The only downside is the smell.</li>
    <li> I had PUPPS during pregnancy and after spending many agonizing weeks during pregnancy clawing my skin off on sleepless nights i finally found this miracle soap. My PUPPS were gone in two days. It does however smell like a campfire which was an odd fragrance for someone who was in labor.</li>
    <li> This soap stinks all to be damned, but it works so my wife allows me to use it in the guest bathroom. I actually ~like~ the smell... but no one else does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks since it was recommended for the rash i developed bc of pregnancy. I am seriously amazed that this soap (along with colloidal oatmeal lotion). My rash has completely disappeared. One con, The soap smells like fresh leather. It makes the entire bathroom smell like that. But, it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent on the skin, so I guess thats okay.</li>
    <li> Soap works and cleans good. It has the smell of a camp fire. But once you use this regular soap just don&#x27;t seem like it cleans you as good.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap and has used it for years. This is a MUCH better price than we can buy it anywhere locally, it&#x27;s like getting one bar for free.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly. My husband uses this soap for skin breakouts due to unknownb allergy. It takes time to get use to the smell. My husband says he itches less when he uses this soap. We will buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells great on my Fiance !</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin firm yet supple. Not too abrasive but works well to get oil dirt and other stains off of me that lesser soaps can&#x27;t handle. Lathers really well. I don&#x27;t know what to say. It&#x27;s soap. Rub it in your butt and smell better.</li>
    <li> I like it but the smokey smell is more on the soap box than the bar itself.</li>
    <li> I have many chemical allergies. It is almost impossible for me to buy soap, dishwash liquid,etc.BUT THIS SOAP IS PERFECT!I love the smell, I love how it makes my skin soft,I love how it cleans.GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel extremely clean.  There is a strong sent but it really does fade away and I actually enjoy it...</li>
    <li> Have used this for several weeks now and I can see some improvement in my psoriasis.  It  does have a distasteful smell but it rinses off.  This is a good product for the skin.</li>
    <li> Little lather, but nice black-fly repelling smell. Makes the whole bathroom smell. Cleans well despite the lack of lather...</li>
    <li> At first the smell is weird. But I actually really like it now. It&#x27;s kinda like a smoky fire smell. But it&#x27;s really nice lather, and it makes my beard feel great.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell like an auto parts shop... If you don&#x27;t want that then this probably isn&#x27;t the soap for you. Why wouldn&#x27;t you want that though??</li>
    <li> Ok soap. But overpriced</li>
    <li> I bought this soap after seeing what great reviews it got. This soap has lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. Another benefit is using it to wash your hair. I use grease style pomade which can be a chore to wash out if you&#x27;re not using Dawn dish soap. Lather some of this into your hands, run it through your hair, and all the gunk you put into your hair comes out rather well.&lt;br /&gt;The soap&#x27;s aroma can be tough to deal with though. It&#x27;s pine tar soap. It smells like wood chips and liquid smoke condensed. It is not unpleasant but also not what you would expect from soap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about the smell when I received this product as a gift, but all of my fears went away once I stepped into the shower and lathered up in this glorious soap.  I was reminded of being young...going camping, the scent reminiscent of a campfire.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever been left feeling so clean, and the scent dissipates very quickly upon rinsing off.  There are no animal products in this soap, which is a huge plus for me.    It&#x27;s a different shower experience for sure, but be brave and give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did, and I hope you do too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the strong scent at first. It will fade to nice musk in about 10 minutes after you shower.</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality pine tar soap I&#x27;ve ever found &amp; it&#x27;s great for hair, hands or body!!!</li>
    <li> Got a great smell and gets things clean!</li>
    <li> If you have PUPPS as I do, this soap is a life saver!  The smell of the soap is strong, and while I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I could see how others may find it dis-pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a problem with smelling like the soap though.  As long as you rinse off and put on fresh clean clothes and use body spray or perfume I doubt anyone would notice the soap smell.</li>
    <li> I live in a very humid climate and have struggled for years now with tinnea versicolor.  I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days now, but it is already soothing my skin.  Use it to wash my face as well.  Definitely need to moisturize after and the smell really takes some getting used to, but I am very happy with how it is calming my skin irritation so quickly.  Like the other reviews I read, the smell does not stay on your skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you, my eczema is almost disappeared. I am so glad I remember about Tar Soap and could easy find it on amazon at a reasonable price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A 5 star product with a 1 star smell.  Seriously?  People think that the smell of this soap can be described as anything approaching pleasant??  Trust me, it smells like old cigarettes.  HOWEVER, it works!!  I am on my second pregnancy using this soap for itchy skin and it works!  I love it, despite the smell.  It will make your whole bathroom smell.  It made every other item in the Amazon box delivery smell.  But it works, I am a lifelong eczema sufferer and I definitely recommend.  The plus side about the smell is that it doesn&#x27;t make you smell afterwards.</li>
    <li> Definitely smells like a fire but does the trick</li>
    <li> Great soap with none of the harmful crap we&#x27;ve been getting from all the perfumey modern toiletries available.  Woodsy, clean scent.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem any better than other high quality soaps but the smell was SO strong.  Even after throwing it away the bathroom wreaked from the smell of dry soap in the trash.  I think this product is only for those with very sensitive skin problems and no alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can confirm that the smell doesn&#x27;t cling to you after having washed up.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this soap for years.  He recently tried a different bar soap and I hated the smell, so he&#x27;s back to his regular.</li>
    <li> Great for the beard and &#x27;stache, keeping dandruff to a minimum. Started working the 1st day!</li>
    <li> This soap smells how being a lumberjack feels. It got me laid several times and the ladies love it. If you&#x27;re looking to smell like a rugged man, you need this soap.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any of those sissy flower smelling soaps.  This is a great cleaning soap with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I had heard about how good this would be for ski problems. I was skeptical because so many people make such claims. It had reduced the flakiness tremendously. I highly recommend this for anyone with psoriasis, eczema or even flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Face feels great! I love the smell almost smells like your camping in the woods. Recommend to anyone with a beard. No more dry skin patches.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this soap for anyone struggling with rashes. My daughter had a shin guard rash and this soap has been helpful in getting rid of it as well as preventing it when used daily. I recommended it a family member who has been fighting a sore rash for some time. He has experienced relief with the use of this soap. It may smell strong, but it&#x27;s worth it. It reminds me of a campfire smell. Not my favorite, but the good outweighs the smell.</li>
    <li> It has helped my puppp but I do not like the smell. I thought it would smell like pine but it smells like campfire. It&#x27;s not too strong  but my hands still smell like campfire afterward</li>
    <li> This soap has helped my eczema a lot.  I had a painful red patch on one hand that would occasionally bleed as well.  I keep a bar of this by the kitchen sink and use it regularly.  My eczema is all but gone.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the smell, it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin.  It&#x27;s very rich in emollients and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I have PUPPS and it is my second pregnancy and it is a boy. The itching was worse than morning sickness-I can tell you! Hell on earth. I tired everything, even neem cream and no luck/. But when I heard of this product I decided to try it out. I bathed with it twice and it worked beautifully. I would say the itching has gone down  say 80%.  I strongly recommend anyone with a skin irritation to use it. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.&lt;br /&gt;Pupps you have met your match.</li>
    <li> I developed a skin rash while pregnant and NOTHING worked. I saw a recommendation for Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap and thought, what did I have to lose? It worked, it actually worked. It works best if you later up and let it stay on your skin a while before rinsing. Yes, it has a strong (slightly unpleasant) smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long once you rinse it off and it is worth it for the relief.</li>
    <li> Smell is horrid gave me a headache could smell it through out the house</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the smell, sorry true!&lt;br /&gt;Good seller, just can&#x27;t get past the smell... Not for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve exclusively used this soap for years for body, shampoo, and shaving. I&#x27;ve recommended it to multiple people for different ailments; eczema, dandruff, athletes foot, skin yeast rashes, dry/cracked skin, etc. It always works. The smell is very masculine and will fill your bathroom with that aroma. I think that smell comes down to preference. I personally love it. And if you don&#x27;t at first, it&#x27;ll grow on you.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> For a few minutes after the shower you smell like a campfire and I love that. Works great on minor skin irritation as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and had a rash on my chest for over a month...this soap (along with the use of witch hazel) cleared it up in less than a week. The smell is god awful and lingers in my bathroom throughout the day after use, but I&#x27;ll sacrifice that to clear a rash, haha.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for showering, shaving, and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;What your hansom papa used to use...</li>
    <li> Used this when my eczema was horrendous during my pregnancy. I showered in warm water, lathered and let this sit on my skin for 3 minutes.  I would rinse and pat dry. I applied oatmeal lotion after drying. This completely cleared my skin in about 6 days, washing sometimes twice a day. I continue to use this about twice a week as a preventative. Smells like bacon meets the outdoors, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. And after it healed my skin, it could smell like hot garbage and I would have been happy!</li>
    <li> I use this for tenea versicolor. Seems to help a lot.</li>
    <li> Great soap for my husbands beard. He requested me to buy more. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> great for problem skin but mostly for guys</li>
    <li> This product works wonders, my wife is pregnant and got this rash and and bumps all over her body, finding out it is PUPP. We searched online and the Grandpas pine tar soap has allot of reviews by women who have had this issue and this was one of the only things that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife can tell you this made life much better.</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this soap&#x27;s aroma. I haven&#x27;t used soap since I was a child, so I was a bit reluctant to give up my skin detergents. The soap&#x27;s scent is incredibly strong of creosote (it leaves no strong lingering odor after rinsing). I hate to get out of the shower ;-)  Update: I cannot give it six stars; too bad. I have almost finished my second bar and I noticed a few things. I do not have to use underarm deodorant any longer, my skin is softer and I don&#x27;t have any whiteheads or annoying skin soil like I tended to get on my forehead and back. I tried it as a shampoo and it also works great. The only product in my shower now is my Grandpa&#x27;s soap!</li>
    <li> Really good lather into beard, leaving a nice leather,  tar and woodsy masculine scent in your beard.</li>
    <li> This soap works wonders for my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> I love this soap and my grandson who is in sports especially loves it...I always receive it quickly and a good price. Thank you. This is my second order.</li>
    <li> great, refreshing soap. go get it.</li>
    <li> I like it it . I like how much lather it makes when you are taking a shower!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not the best but,it only last a little while. You can smell the ordor&lt;br /&gt;in the shower more than you can  when you are towelling off. But do not let my&lt;br /&gt;comment of the smell of the soap stop you from buying this soap it is great soap!</li>
    <li> I love the soap, but it will make your shower smell of a campfire. That said, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on you like that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he says he really likes it. He has a skin condition but its too soon to tell if it is helping with that. It isn&#x27;t hurting it, we do know that already. It smells nice, not all perfumy, just a refreshing and different aroma than most soaps. After my husband raved about it, I started using it too and I thought it might be too manly for me because I am NOT manly, but it just leaves a refreshing scent. I love it too and am ordering more now. It lathers nicely, leaves you feeling really squeaky clean but it does not dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for rashes, but this cleared up my beardruff (dandruff from my beard)!  I hadn&#x27;t realized it until I read it on here, but I haven&#x27;t had to brush the dandruff out of my beard in a couple months, which is awesome since i used to make it snow by scratching my chin.</li>
    <li> Love this Pine Tar Soap.</li>
    <li> This soap smells like a campfire. If you like that, great. If you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t worry because it doesn&#x27;t linger throughout the day. Your wife may not like it, but if she leaves you over soap, then she wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this soap does do is clean really well without you smelling flowery or like a frat boy at a mixer. Odds are if you are a man looking to buy this soap, you read about it on a DE shaving forum or a site like The Art of Manliness. You probably use Brylcream and Pinaud Clubman aftershave. This is your kind of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp. In fact, it has made my hair more manageable and has left it looking a bit thicker. People say you can shave with it, but that&#x27;s up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews of the people who gave it one star. After you decipher their horrible writing skills, notice that they mostly talk about opening it, smelling it, and throwing it away. Give it a chance. Soap is meant to clean and this soap does it well.</li>
    <li> Okay. I bought my husband a variety of pine-scented objects for his birthday including this soap. Instead of a strong pine scent, it smelled more like bacon, campfire, and rubber boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were joking: It smells like an old man, wearing rubber boots, in the woods, cooking bacon, over his campfire. Lol.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap. Although it didn&#x27;t work well with my eczema, it smells great and I would definitely use it if it weren&#x27;t for this sensitive skin.  I gifted it to my partner and friend and they both really like using it.</li>
    <li> Smells like manliness. I always feel very clean afterward.</li>
    <li> Product as described, arrived right on time. Ordered to help treat pregnancy related  rash and actually seems to be working! Will order again if needed.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this soap.  It is strong smelling--makes the bathroom smell a bit woodsy--but the odor does not linger on his skin.</li>
    <li> was very pleaed with the product and with the delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap for years.  I love it.  I use it for my daily soap and also I wash my dog with it.  The coconut oil base is great for my skin and my dog&#x27;s fur. The soap bar is brown, when wet it lathers white.  There&#x27;s just enough lather, not too much, not too little.  My dog has occasional skin issues due to contact allergens ... we run him a lot in woods, on farm-lands, etc. When I add 20-Mule Team Borax to a 5-gallon pail with warm water and lots of Pine Tar Soap and lather him up, then only rinse a bit of it out and let the rest stay on him, it clears up any skin issues incredibly quickly.  Also whenever I&#x27;m working outside and get near poison ivy, when I come home I immediately shower with the pine tar soap knowing that it will take care of any urishiol (the despicable oil that causes poison ivy rashes) that might be on my body.</li>
    <li> Bad smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last and you can&#x27;t smell it after you get out the shower however I used this since I broke out in PUPPS, which is crazy itchy hives all over the body,after labor and this was the only thing that helped a lot! Not even Benadryl worked</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap.  We live in Oklahoma, in tick and chigger country.  As anyone will know who has been attacked by chiggers, the bites itch like crazy and can continue for as long as 2 weeks.  Not if you use this soap!  As soon as I realize what has happened, I immediately come in the house, drop my clothing and lather up with Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap; leave it in place for a minute or two and then rinse it off.  The chigger bites are gone!  Seriously.  (But never make the mistake of putting the same clothing back on.  The chiggers are in it.) Until now I had not needed it for tick bites, but this is going to be a very bad year and we already are loaded with the nasty things.  I just ordered more soap to use on those bites also.  Because it&#x27;s pine tar, I think it disinfects as well as cleans and acts as an anti-itch.  It&#x27;s marvelous stuff, and we&#x27;ll never be without it again..</li>
    <li> After struggling with a rash due to pregnancy and being itchy right from the beginning I decided to try this soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and my skin is almost cleared up and is feeling so much better.  I even started using it on my face.  It leaves my face feeling and looking nice all day!  The soap itself smells like beef jerkey cooked over a campfire but don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like smoked meats all day haha.  This soap is wonderful, definitely give it a try!!</li>
    <li> This soap has a hell of a smell, but dayum it feels great on my beard/mustache. For sure follows through with soothing my skin and it lathers like a mo****f***er!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a skin rash I have, I find it too drying to use in the Northeast in the winter.  I might try it again in the summer, it might not bother&lt;br /&gt;my skin at that time of year.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after giving birth to my first child.  I came down with a horrific case of PUPPPS, which is basically an itchy rash all over my body.  This was one of the only products out there that provided some relief for me.  Since I was exclusively breastfeeding, I was wary about using a steroid creme to get rid of this rash... And although this soap did not get rid of the rash, it did relieve the itching. It does has a rather manly scent, kind of like a campfire burning, but if you can get past that, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft. Odor was worse than expected. Purchased for rosacea after reading other reviews. My skin tone is unchanged.</li>
    <li> This soap did not work well for me. It really dried out my skin and caused really bad break outs. The effect was almost like an allergic reaction. That being said, I have very sensitive skin. This soap will probably work for most people, just be cautious if your skin is really sensitive like mine.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent. It takes grease and grime off better than most of the citrus soaps. It definitely has a smell though. My fiance hates the smell but loves how soft my skin is after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells like the inside of a hardware store. She says it smells more like tires. Either way its a good clean feeling with a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it if you need to get clean and you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a pep boys.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients on the pictures then read the ingredients on the actual box.</li>
    <li> Miracle soap for PUPPS rash!!! When I was pregnant with my first,  I suffered that horrible rash for weeks giving myself bruises and bloodied claw marks from the scratching. My Dr had no idea what is was so I finally did my own research after yet another  sleepless night sobbing from the intense itching and discovered what I had on my own. Further research brought me to this soap and after a week using this product twice a day, I finally had some relief!! The smell is definitely a unique one but I very quickly grew to love and look forward to it. I am now pregnant with my second and have been stockpiling this soap :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff before so I reordered.  I like it mainly because I am not rubbing myself with strange chemicals and I don&#x27;t come out smelling like a flower basket.  Unfortunately they either changed their recipe or the labeling.  I&#x27;ll probably still like using it because I don&#x27;t give too big a care, but it is worth noting the advertised ingredients are different than what came for me on 1/13/15.  So I dock 2 stars for scumbag-worthy advertising.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Lather was fine and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger that long, but I cant bring myself to use it again.</li>
    <li> DOS;T SMELL VERRY GOOD</li>
    <li> Very good soap for who suffer head demodex.</li>
    <li> The smell is the first thing you&#x27;ll notice... its VERY manly, I mean so manly that you&#x27;ll think that Grizzly Adams just jumped in the shower behind you. Don&#x27;t worry, that campfire smell is not your house burning down while you&#x27;re in the shower (unless you hear the smoke detector as well, then maybe double check just to be safe). I imagine the scent of this soap is what manly men in the wild west smelled like after spending weeks doing whatever they did on horseback, be it robbing banks or driving cattle, or riding the fence. Either way you&#x27;ll be so manly you&#x27;ll have to shave twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf doesn&#x27;t like the smell which is very smoky like a campfire) and is trying to convince me to get some Old Spice Fiji instead so I can smell fruity like a vacation.</li>
