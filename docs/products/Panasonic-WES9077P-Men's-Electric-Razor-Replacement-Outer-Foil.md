      <li>I got the saver back in the nineties and the replacement foils were better made back then</li>
      <li>This is the real thing....not the cheap knock-offs like other products that are being sold.  </li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference it would make compared to my old used up one.</li>
      <li>Now, my razor cuts like new and I highly recommend this part if you have a problem like this.</li>
      <li>I maintain them and this gave me the feel of a brand new shaver.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the Inner Blade set WES9070P as a replacement for the original ES9072 blades and installed  both at same time.</li>
      <li>Claimed to fit the model of Panasonic razor I have, but it did not fit.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
      <li>Although my ES7024 was not listed among the models that this &amp;#34;Outer Foil&amp;#34; replacement was intended for, I knew from the ES7024 manual and other sources that the WES9077P was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>why did i wait so long makes my shaver work like new!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Claimed to fit the model of Panasonic razor I have, but it did not fit.</li>
    <li> The screen that came with my razor lasted me years until it finally broke, so I purchased this one, and within ONE MONTH, it broke.   I didn&#x27;t have any problems(ex: dropped it or hit it on something), it just one day was broken.    Very crappy product!     Panasonic used to be the best, but I&#x27;ve noticed lately, since they&#x27;ve gone \\&quot;made in china\\&quot;, that they really have quality issues now.</li>
    <li> I thought my blades were bad, i bought the foil and blades at the same time but the foil came first, it was amazing, it ran like new blades were installed too.i still replaced the blades when they came, but the foil is a big part of the system and i did not think so at first</li>
    <li> The Razor is preforming as expected.  No issues about delivery.  I had it shipped to a different address than my original and the product arrived on time and w/ no damage.  The seller was awesome and kept me informed through the entire purchase and shipment.  The whole process, from start to finish, reaffirms my confidence in Amazon and the products they support.</li>
    <li> I have had no problems using this replacement foil, excellent price too.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing....not the cheap knock-offs like other products that are being sold.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great replacement part.  Made the razor as good as new</li>
    <li> This item is almost unavailable in stores so Amazon is the only resource for it. I&#x27;ve ordered two since I&#x27;ve owned my razor and have been happy with them both. They are delicate though so I suggest using the plastic cover that accompanies the razor, especially for traveling. If your razor still holds power than I definitely suggest this replacement foil, It makes sense financially and you can have the shipping expedited.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and a god price.</li>
    <li> Used for razor already owned. Glad to have found it, considering the electric razor is over 20 years old. Great!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect replacement...did the job with no complaints. Delivered within a week, as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of Democrats and Republicans!!</li>
    <li> Simple replacement, just what you would expect. Best of all it works like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> This product was as advertised.  I would have preferred a black one because that is what is on my shaver now.</li>
    <li> This part is a perfect fit and restored my old Panasonic to like new along with new blades and battery.</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep my shaver going.  I don&#x27;t like to throw out shavers every few years.  I maintain them and this gave me the feel of a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad, he likes it - works just fine! He was able to use his shaver that he loves again.</li>
    <li> why did i wait so long makes my shaver work like new!</li>
    <li> This WES9077P outer foil fits my ancient Panasonic shaver ES8068. I also purchased the Inner Blade set WES9070P as a replacement for the original ES9072 blades and installed  both at same time. Hope these replacements last as long as the originals. 1st shave with new set was fine.</li>
    <li> received it quickly, works great and it was exactly as shown.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I got this replacement outer foil, I didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference it would make compared to my old used up one. It works very good, my shaves have been a lot better since I bought this product. I wish I had gotten this sooner.</li>
    <li> Great replacement product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to replace these products in my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Must have had something to with the ridiculous price the shop wanted to charge me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same wet/dry Panasonic battery operated shaver for about ten years now. I buy replacement foils and blades every two years. These are genuine OEM replacement parts and they work as intended. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> works well but isn&#x27;t made the same as they originally were with the shaver.  I got the saver back in the nineties and the replacement foils were better made back then</li>
    <li> Perfect OEM replacement.</li>
    <li> Despite being the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; replacement, it does fit the ES8068 and works well, it is just grey when the correct one is black</li>
    <li> Although my ES7024 was not listed among the models that this &amp;#34;Outer Foil&amp;#34; replacement was intended for, I knew from the ES7024 manual and other sources that the WES9077P was exactly what I needed.  It was delivered on schedule and securely packaged.  In seconds I had it in my shaver and confirming its perfect operation.  I&#x27;m sure that when I need another replacement in the future, I&#x27;ll gladly be repeating this order.</li>
    <li> The screen on my razor had worn through and would pinch if it was tried to be used.  This part was complete and snapped into place with little effort.  Now, my razor cuts like new and I highly recommend this part if you have a problem like this.</li>
    <li> Had the Panasonic ES8036 shaver since it came out many years ago, and this is only the 4th set of replacement blades. Quick shipping</li>
