      <li>I love the product.  </li>
      <li>I have used similar products for years, and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>I like the spray bottle nozzle, it covers more hair with fewer pumps.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, but most importantly it helps a lot with the comb-through after a shower.  </li>
      <li>no expert on this stuff, but it seems fine to me.  </li>
      <li>Mister itself delivers a very fine mist over a very large area.</li>
      <li>I spray it on before hot culling my hair and my hair comes out beautifully curled, and not stiff.  </li>
      <li>When the heat protector was delievered, I opened it and though the bottle was too light.</li>
      <li>Tried a few products but this one works best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something good.</li>
      <li>Very good product, makes my hair shinier than the other heat protectants I have tried.</li>
      <li>A better suggestion is ION heat protector as this is more oil based and goes on more like a sheen (not wet).</li>
      <li>This product works great at &amp;#34;forcing&amp;#34; your unruly hair to flatten - with the help of a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it great for helping protect your hair from the heat, but it smells amazing and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
      <li>And, most of all, perfectly straight.</li>
      <li>This is a good spray for pre blow drying and flat ironing protection.</li>
      <li>I blow  dry and use the curling iron on my hair every day and it feels so good since I started usuing this product.  </li>
      <li>But I like it, the spritz is a full cloud of tiny mist, which is nice and covers a lot.  </li>
      <li>Well, everything went nice and fine for a while as I styled pin curls until I started to use this product and blow dry.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go !!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried similar products from other companies, but this one has the best results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, spraying too much will make it a bit sticky.  </li>
      <li>It makes makes the hair very soft, smells very fresh, and makes styling easier.</li>
      <li>My wife takes special care of her hair and raves about this product and would highly recommend it to others</li>
      <li>I take the hot curlers out put my fingers through my hair</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I gave it two more chances, but the allergy came back again.</li>
      <li>I am not sure how to describe the scent, but it wears off extremely fast, which is great because it can be very overpowering when first sprayed.</li>
      <li>Without using this first, too much hair would be pulled out.  </li>
      <li>My scalp and eyes were itching for the whole day.</li>
      <li>It really takes the frizz out.</li>
      <li>But since I&#x27;ve used this the heat doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing as much damage as before.</li>
      <li>Feels like it&#x27;s really protecting and nourishing my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy, wavy hair</li>
      <li>This product has really helped to protect my hair while keeping it conditioned and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about three weeks now and my hair feels much healthier.  </li>
      <li>and it calmed the waves, but didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for the friz.</li>
      <li>I consider it to be a real find.</li>
      <li>Like touching a black olive, kind of slick.</li>
      <li>Light weight fix for thin, fine, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product along with my new BaBylissPRO</li>
      <li>I live in L.A.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating is because of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years on my long, blonde, fine, sometimes frizzy, hair.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy this product at a nearby CVS, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately.</li>
      <li>While this product made my hair silky smooth after I applied it and blow dried my hair, it caused me to have some sort of allergy reaction.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair shiny and soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>This product seems good enough when spraying on wet hair but on dry hair it is a wet substance so it makes your hair fry when applying heat styling tools.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who uses a straightening iron regularly.</li>
      <li>I emptied the product into the empty bottle of my last protection spray (different brand) and now I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
      <li>Completely non-sticky, it leaves my thick hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Bought with her curling iron and now apparently I am the coolest Mom in the World!  </li>
      <li>My hair is normally wavy and can become dry or course, but it is always soft, sleek, and shiny after using this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well it protects the hair, but so far the hair is left super soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I cannot say I really notice a difference in regards to shine and heat damage/protection, but I use it before a blow-dry too (use only on wet, not dry hair).</li>
      <li>When I looked inside of it, more than half of the product was missing!</li>
      <li>I have dry, brittle, over processed, naturally curly frizzy hair.  </li>

<li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>

<li> As mentioned by a previous reviewer, it is actually &amp;#34;Pro-Mend&amp;#34; heat protectant.  </li>
<li> and we have very hard water with a lot of mineral deposits, so my hair gets very tangled after washing using the spray showerhead.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am in the habit of washing my hair in the evening and then using heat to set it the following morning. I have used similar products for years, and this one is the best. Completely non-sticky, it leaves my thick hair feeling silky and smooth. It isn&#x27;t heavy or waxy, and you cannot feel the product after application. A little goes a long way. I consider it to be a real find.</li>
    <li> I have dry, brittle, over processed, naturally curly frizzy hair.  I have to blow dry it section by section.  This product has really helped to protect my hair while keeping it conditioned and shiny.  I have spent tons of money on hair products and few rarely work for my type of hair.  I can actually see a difference. I have been using this product for about three weeks now and my hair feels much healthier.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very good product, makes my hair shinier than the other heat protectants I have tried. The bottle has a nice design with a lock feature so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it opening in my bag. Mister itself delivers a very fine mist over a very large area. My only complaint is the smell, which reminds me of the blue polo sport Ralph Lauren perfume that I detest. I am not sure how to describe the scent, but it wears off extremely fast, which is great because it can be very overpowering when first sprayed. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works well.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! It does not weigh your hair down or makes it greasy. It makes makes the hair very soft, smells very fresh, and makes styling easier. I&#x27;m not sure how well it protects the hair, but so far the hair is left super soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I love this stuff! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this product even though it is now discontinued. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years on my long, blonde, fine, sometimes frizzy, hair.  I love the smell, but most importantly it helps a lot with the comb-through after a shower.  I live in L.A. and we have very hard water with a lot of mineral deposits, so my hair gets very tangled after washing using the spray showerhead.  Without using this first, too much hair would be pulled out.  I cannot say I really notice a difference in regards to shine and heat damage/protection, but I use it before a blow-dry too (use only on wet, not dry hair). I find the shape of the bottle and sprayer a bit awkward, and it gets drippy when near the end of the bottle, but I put it into a better spray bottle which is smaller and also within airline travel guidelines.  I would recommend this for all hair types, but I imagine it&#x27;s particularly great for all frizzy hair types.</li>
    <li> I love it , works great.</li>
    <li> Feels like it&#x27;s really protecting and nourishing my hair. I will definitely buy this stuff again. Tried a few products but this one works best.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work at all. It made my hair dry and didn&#x27;t help to smoothen when I iron my hair. I will stick to my &#x27;Shu Uemera&#x27; which I have been using for 2 years (though it is very expensive).</li>
    <li> I tried this product after getting a sample travel bottle. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it but I wear it even when I&#x27;m not using the heat!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really takes the frizz out. I like the sprayer because it has a button to stop the flow when you are not using the product which I think will keep it from clogging.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, easy to use. I like the spray bottle nozzle, it covers more hair with fewer pumps.  I have very frizzy, wavy hair and it calmed the waves, but didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for the friz.</li>
    <li> This is a good spray for pre blow drying and flat ironing protection. I love the Smell. I also use their shampoos. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It protects the hair from heat styling and keeps it shiny and soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!! I thought it might leave my hair feeling sticky, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product seems good enough when spraying on wet hair but on dry hair it is a wet substance so it makes your hair fry when applying heat styling tools.  I would recommend only using it before blow drying.  A better suggestion is ION heat protector as this is more oil based and goes on more like a sheen (not wet).</li>
    <li> As mentioned by a previous reviewer, it is actually &amp;#34;Pro-Mend&amp;#34; heat protectant.  But I like it, the spritz is a full cloud of tiny mist, which is nice and covers a lot.  It&#x27;s true, spraying too much will make it a bit sticky.  Smells very light for just a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert on this stuff, but it seems fine to me.  I would ask, how would I know if it&#x27;s working or not??  I just spray on before heat, and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> Light weight fix for thin, fine, frizzy hair. I use it everyday and would recommend it for any hair type. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  I blow  dry and use the curling iron on my hair every day and it feels so good since I started usuing this product.  Was so glad it was so promply sent to my house!</li>
    <li> Product was good deal for the price range.  There was no sticky residue, and it didn&#x27;t leave hair flat after heat blow dry</li>
    <li> My wife takes special care of her hair and raves about this product and would highly recommend it to others</li>
    <li> When the heat protector was delievered, I opened it and though the bottle was too light. When I looked inside of it, more than half of the product was missing! I got sent the used almost empty bottle! Im so pissed!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great at &amp;#34;forcing&amp;#34; your unruly hair to flatten - with the help of a flat iron.  Nice light fragrence.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with my new BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium 1 \\&quot; flat iron.  The two together have made a world of difference.  My hair looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Not only is it great for helping protect your hair from the heat, but it smells amazing and leaves your hair very soft. I actually have used it as a spray in conditioner and works well there, too. I just wish I would have paid attention to the shipping charges. But then again I do Love this product!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a bottle of Heat Protexx , thats what the picture claimed it to be. What they sent me was Pro-Mend. I already had a bottle of Pro-Mend and just wanted to see how the other product worked. I guess I will never find out.</li>
    <li> While this product made my hair silky smooth after I applied it and blow dried my hair, it caused me to have some sort of allergy reaction. My scalp and eyes were itching for the whole day. I gave it two more chances, but the allergy came back again. Now I need to look for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Finally! A heat protecting spray that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily or greasy. This stuff is light and smells great. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something good. Hope it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this is the bottle sucks...the spray thing doesn&#x27;t always work or breaks. However, just switch it to something else and its fine!</li>
    <li> Bought with her curling iron and now apparently I am the coolest Mom in the World!  Keeps hair protected and curl bouncy .</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Heat Protexx Spray works great and does everything it says it does.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating is because of the bottle.  I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the spray bottle to work.  There were no instructions with it, and I ended up breaking the handle off trying to figure it out.  I emptied the product into the empty bottle of my last protection spray (different brand) and now I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome for any type of hair. My whole family uses it. It gives your hair shine and luster. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years !!  I spray it on before hot culling my hair and my hair comes out beautifully curled, and not stiff.  I take the hot curlers out put my fingers through my hair and I&#x27;m ready to go !!  The product is great !&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hair !</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product at a nearby CVS, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately. I was very happy to see it&#x27;s available on Amazon. This is a great product to use with a curling iron. It protects the hair from heat and also seems to reduce frizz. My hair is normally wavy and can become dry or course, but it is always soft, sleek, and shiny after using this product. And, most of all, perfectly straight. I&#x27;ve tried similar products from other companies, but this one has the best results. I highly recommend this product to anyone who uses a straightening iron regularly.</li>
    <li> So... I bought this because I wanted to try something different than Tresemme and a stylist recommended it. Well, everything went nice and fine for a while as I styled pin curls until I started to use this product and blow dry. My scalp and forehead began to itch and feel taut. Yeah, I had a reaction to this product and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a hair care product before, that I can remember. I&#x27;m a bit of a fashionista and use make up and hair care products a lot so it kind of shocked me when my skin started to feel weird with this one product. Also, it leaves a rather odd texture feel to the hair. Like touching a black olive, kind of slick.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Seems to work well for her. She&#x27;s almost through it so I guess that is a good thing</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair shiny and soft to the touch.  as well as not damaging my hair while blow drying..... I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff has a very pleasant smell, and it does the job. I noticed that before I used this, my hair broke easier. But since I&#x27;ve used this the heat doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing as much damage as before. And the size of the bottle is bigger than I expected.</li>
