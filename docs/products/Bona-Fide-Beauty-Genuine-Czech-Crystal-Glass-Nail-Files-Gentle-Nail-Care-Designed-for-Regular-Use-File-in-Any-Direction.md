      <li>They are attractive looking and I carry one in my purse, the other in my car and another in my makeup drawer</li>

      <li>There is also a rougher and smoother side like most other nail files which is nice.</li>
      <li>I was able to file my fingernails and toenails and rinse the file off and it looks brand new.  </li>
      <li>My wife says these are great little nail files.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re just fun.</li>

      <li>But just a word of caution, these files will make fast work of filing your nails</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>A traditional emery board just leaves them still with a rough edge and doesn&#x27;t really do a good job.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these nail files which work very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been looking to replace my nail filers and these are the best nail files I have ever used! Each one comes in it&#x27;s own protective case and the neon colors are lovely.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased as  they did a wonderful job on my nails and are very gentle. I can file both ways and they produces an exceptionally smooth edge. I appreciate that these files are durable,hygenic and will last a long time! They will never rust or tear apart. I think it is cool that they can be washed! If all products lasted as long as these it would be terrific! I highly recommend them! They come as a pack of 4 and so I keep them in multiple places- one in my office desk, one in my dresser , one in my bag  and one in the bathroom ;) so that I can file my nails whenever I feel like shaping them or whenever I have time.&lt;br /&gt;  I got this in exchange of a honest review .</li>
    <li> Love these nail files.  Have bought several.</li>
    <li> These are amazing files. Having a multi-pack allows me to have one in my bedroom, in my office and in my car (and one to spare). They file quickly and smoothly. They&#x27;re lovely and although I don&#x27;t anticipate needing more anytime soon - when I do I will be reordering these one...maybe in a different color but if you like  neon, you&#x27;d love these.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price. I am happy with the purchase. However, I will say that they do not last a super long time. After a couple of months, one side of the main file I have been using is pretty much smooth.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Bona Fide Beauty Czech Glass Nail Files. I will never use another metal file or emery board again.&lt;br /&gt;These files give your nails a very smooth finish without damaging the nail itself. I will be giving these as gifts to family and friends&lt;br /&gt;in the future. I am going to order the pedicure foot file for myself as well.</li>
    <li> Seriously guys, this has got to be the best invention in the field of nail files and I am very fortunate to even get the opportunity to try it out and give my unbiased review. I love how it doesn&#x27;t break at all, it is not too thick and it files my nails smoothly and pretty quick without making a mess. I tried bending it and that was unsuccessful, so these bad boys are here to STAY! The bright colors are very neat and fashionable. So drop those &#x27;temporary&#x27; nail files and get you a permanent one.</li>
    <li> just as advertised. I love these nail files and will never buy another type. Recommend these to all.</li>
    <li> This set of four neon colored etched glass nail files is a great value and let&#x27;s face it, glass nail files are eventually dropped. As for quality, these files are excellent. The abrasive is uniform and fast-cutting, but does not shread or tear my very thin nails. I will most certainly buy more of these excellent nail files.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to try out these nail files in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. First of all I love the fact that there were four they come in Pink, Orange, Yellow and green. They are small and compact so they fit just about anywhere, perfect for your purse, makeup bag, bathroom You can literally keep then about anywhere. They are made out of glass and they are etched on both sides so you can use them longer and dont have to worry about them tearing up or breaking. When you use them you get a smooth edge on your nails you dont have to work as hard to file down those little hang nails that we all know we get. So not only are they cute but they actually work! I would recommend these products to anyone who wants to look cute but be fashionable with it as well.</li>
    <li> I thought about buying these for quite a while before I actually jumped in.  I absolutely love them.  My nails are so smooth after using them - completely different from the way they feel after using any other file.  The colors make them easy to spot.  I&#x27;m very happy I got them.</li>
    <li> I tried one of these because I was curious, and I found that they&#x27;re perfect for my thin, weak nails.  So I bought the 4 Piece set.  Now I have one stashed all over the house.  Love them!</li>
    <li> My wife says these are great little nail files.  Price is right, great product, you get 4 of them what else could you ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gadget</li>
    <li> I purchased these because in the past I was given a glass nail file and the thing sucked.  As a matter of fact the rough part came off while I was filing my nails.  It was garbage.  So because of all the positive reviews I decided to take a chance and buy these and you know what, they are everything everyone said they are!  I was able to file my fingernails and toenails and rinse the file off and it looks brand new.  My nails look great and I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of time doing it either.  But just a word of caution, these files will make fast work of filing your nails so be careful that you pay attention or you may file your nails shorter than you want them.  The tip is pointed so it is great for cleaning under your nails (which is something an emory board and my old p.o.s. glass file didn&#x27;t do).  These would make great gifts too (maybe given with a bottle of polish) because at this price, it&#x27;s so worth it!  The colors are cool (awesome neon colors exactly as shown) and yes, you get 4 for that price.  I can put one in my purse, one by my bed maybe leave one the kitchen and the other in the bathroom.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase.  Best part, my nails are soft and weak and they didn&#x27;t tear them up or leave ragged edges like emory boards do!</li>
    <li> Glass nail filers. Now that’s one product I had never used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and the most important feature that I like about these filers are the colors. They are bright and neon color. Second feature is that we get four in a set. So I have these filers everywhere- office, purse, restroom and bedroom. Each one has a protective cover. Third and the most important feature is that since they are made of glass they will not rust. The glass is a durable and sturdy. Since it is glass it can be cleaned with water.  I can file my nails using both sides of the glass and the result is soft and evenly filed nails.  I am fascinated by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of foot files in my life and this has to be the BEST file I have ever used!!  Amazing...easy and made my feet baby smooth in five minutes after many summer miles logged in flip flops!  I have not tried the nail files but the tri color foot file is great...don&#x27;t wait :)</li>
    <li> These files work great. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. Each file is in a plastic case, and the group came packaged in a sturdy box. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I will never buy any file except glass now.  These make great little gifts!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I OVE these nail files!!  I wear acrylic nails, so I don&#x27;t have a big use for a nail file , as I have somebody else do my nails every couple of weeks. One of my acrylic nails broke a week or so ago, and when an acrylic nail breaks, they leave a super sharp edge.  A traditional emery board just leaves them still with a rough edge and doesn&#x27;t really do a good job.  So I broke out my Glass Nail File, and WOW what a difference!  It filed down the sharp edges and left my nail nice and smooth!  Seriously the best file I have ever owned HANDS DOWN!!!  I received this product complimentary and this is my honest and unbiased review  Keep in mind that all  thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> These are great! As pretty as they are effective.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition and as advertised.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of glass files for at least 8 years however they can vary in quality. Some are too fat and just don&#x27;t file properly. They may also be cheaper in price but do not waste your money. I had broken a few of my good ones and needed to replace them. These are perfect and they file the way they&#x27;re supposed to file. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed these so much I brought extras for my family and friends to introduce them to the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, arrived on time. Would reorder if we needed more. Excellent value!</li>
    <li> These are excellent nail files, as good as or even better than the more expensive ones that I have tried. These nail files are better. You will not be disappoointed. They also provide are genuinely concerned about their customers and how they feel about their product. I highly recommend these nail files which work very well. They are also very attractive and each nail file comes in its own sleeve.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I have now had 4 friends ask where I got them.  :)</li>
    <li> What I love most is how super hygienic glass nail files are! These priced right and so I gave them a chance. So glad I did. I will never go back to regular emery board files after using these. They are stylish to look at. I’ve put one in my handbag and one in my office, one in the bathroom, one by my bed. I hate having a split or torn nail and looking for an emery board that still works. These work great!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I had never used glass files before making this purchase. The product was recommended to me by a friend so I picked them up because they were priced right. Now, I love them! I&#x27;m not sure that I will ever go back to regular files after using these. They are attractive looking and I carry one in my purse, the other in my car and another in my makeup drawer so I&#x27;m never without a file. Not everyone loves neon, but I think they are great! Maybe offering a variety of non-neon colors would be the next step or darker tips for men (yes, men use nail files, I&#x27;ve witnessed it haha).</li>
    <li> Colors are just like picture and work wonders on my jamberry nails</li>
    <li> Received these beautiful glass files.  I always used the metal files because I did not know glass files existed.  The metal files are very damaging and you basically have no control as it quickly takes down most of your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glass files are so pretty and have a nice feel and do a great job.  The product description speaks for itself... all true.  I think they are awesome.  Thank you, Bona Fide Beauty.</li>
    <li> Best files I&#x27;ve ever used.  These are great files.  They work so well on my natural nails.  I love having multiples and love the little slip on cases.  I have these in both bathrooms, my car, my purse and my coffee table.  They work so great I&#x27;m going to purchase as gifts.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give these a shot.  extremely happy with these.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had these files for very long but so far they work just fine. It&#x27;s too early to tell if the surface is really permanent or will eventually wear off, but it seems permanent as far as I can tell. There is also a rougher and smoother side like most other nail files which is nice. Not sure they have made a huge difference in my nails as far as splitting or peeling, but again it&#x27;s probably too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I love the look and quality of these files! They look exactly as pictured and the colors are even more vibrant and beautiful in person. My nail clients are loving how these feel on natural nails. These will definitely be a staple in my Nail Tech kit.</li>
    <li> Great files, great price.  I&#x27;ve given up on regular emery boards.  The colors &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;  and they&#x27;re just fun.</li>
