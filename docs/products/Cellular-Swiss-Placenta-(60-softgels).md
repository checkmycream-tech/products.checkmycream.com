      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend to all of my friends.</li>
      <li>is better now than ever</li>
      <li>However I wish there were more literature on the packaging,</li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look smoother and softens the appearance of my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>container looks cheap.</li>
      <li>Softgels are lightly scented.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s a bit sticky when I apply to face, my skin becomes soft and bright just overnight.</li>
      <li>Beside that, the cream smell goods and it smooth too.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and absorbs pretty fast.</li>
      <li>It smells really good like a jasmine scented,not what I expected to be from placenta.</li>
      <li>i really really love this product, it makes my face so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the effect is superb - it soaks into your skin and leaves it soft and silky for 12 hours, at least.</li>
      <li>It does have a funny smell when you first apply it, which stays for about hour, then the floral undertone takes over.</li>
      <li>But it is smells pretty after its wears off a bit</li>
      <li>The capsules are easy to snap open, the oil does sink into your skin very fast.  </li>
      <li>I dont really see the added benefit.  </li>
      <li>so that I know if the ingredients are really what it claims to be.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so cheap, but I&#x27;m definitely not complaining.</li>
      <li>This product keeps the much needed moisture around my eyes all day.</li>
      <li>It was fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>These capsules are very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, makes my face feel a bit greasy at first but within mins it sinks right in and keeps my skin looking dewy all day.</li>
      <li>I have normal tone skin.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely, I use this with other facial cream.  </li>
      <li>I can use one soft gel for 3 days.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find placenta, but am grateful.</li>
      <li>skin feels soft and moist in the morning.</li>
      <li>I would not apply it and eat or drink right after that - it&#x27;s slightly nauseating.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These should be kept in their container at all times, althought the cap does not need to be closed, but the little capsules tend to smell more when they&#x27;re out of their container for a while, or if they get wet at all.</li>

<li> The only minus - I wish it were fragrance-free.</li>
<li> I have actually stopped using anything else other than a sunscreen before I go outdoors.  </li>
<li> Works so well for dry skin!</li>
<li> The product goes on a little greasy, but this works for me because I have such dry, aging skin.  </li>
<li> My skin was rough when you bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
<li> well it&#x27;s what I expected at this price.</li>
<li> I would recommend buying the cream placenta over this one becaue the other one doesn&#x27;t grease.</li>
<li> - I had noticed her skin (she&#x27;s in her mid-50s) looking firmer, less wrinkled, and glowing.</li>
<li> a little odd,</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my face probably because I already use Dead Sea muse and a face brush.</li>
<li> I use it overnight or in the morning when i feel my skin looks dull.  </li>
<li> I used to use a thin lotion, a medium moisturizer, then a thicker moisturizer (a day cream with SPF 15 or a night cream).</li>
<li> it gives my face a glow that makes people thinks i am using very very expensive products..........as soon as i am all out i will be buying again to keep the glowing going...</li>
<li> But the smell of the oil is nasty.</li>

    <li> This is a great product, worth at this price. Although it&#x27;s a bit sticky when I apply to face, my skin becomes soft and bright just overnight. I love it and would recommend to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> The product goes on a little greasy, but this works for me because I have such dry, aging skin.  It makes my skin look smoother and softens the appearance of my fine lines.  I have actually stopped using anything else other than a sunscreen before I go outdoors.  And did I mention the price?  You just can beat it!  I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
    <li> much fragrance added, waste of money. I did not use it after i tried one capsule. I regret having bought it</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product. It was fast shipping too.It smells really good like a jasmine scented,not what I expected to be from placenta. Overall,very happy and satisfied with this. Will be ordering again soon :)</li>
    <li> i really really love this product, it makes my face so soft. it gives my face a glow that makes people thinks i am using very very expensive products..........as soon as i am all out i will be buying again to keep the glowing going...lol....</li>
    <li> These capsules are very moisturizing. I believe that everyone has their skin type, and they need to find the correct moisturizer. For me, this works well for me. I have normal tone skin. I used to use a thin lotion, a medium moisturizer, then a thicker moisturizer (a day cream with SPF 15 or a night cream). Now, I just use this, then the thicker moisturizer.  My mom got me started on these - I had noticed her skin (she&#x27;s in her mid-50s) looking firmer, less wrinkled, and glowing. When I asked her, she said that she had been using these, and these were only $5 a container!  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so cheap, but I&#x27;m definitely not complaining. They do smell funky though.  These should be kept in their container at all times, althought the cap does not need to be closed, but the little capsules tend to smell more when they&#x27;re out of their container for a while, or if they get wet at all.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely, I use this with other facial cream.  I dont really see the added benefit.  Can do without.</li>
    <li> The capsules are easy to snap open, the oil does sink into your skin very fast.  But the smell of the oil is nasty.</li>
    <li> container looks cheap. well it&#x27;s what I expected at this price. Used it twice. It smells nice and absorbs pretty fast. skin feels soft and moist in the morning. However, I had a breakout. Maybe once a week is enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great price and an awesome product. The smell is. a little odd, but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, makes my face feel a bit greasy at first but within mins it sinks right in and keeps my skin looking dewy all day. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest though.</li>
    <li> Works so well for dry skin!</li>
    <li> My skin was rough when you bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive cream that I was using also did not fix it&lt;br /&gt;Skin is better now than ever and I started using this product</li>
    <li> smells nice. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I can use one soft gel for 3 days. It makes my skin glow immediately. I use it overnight or in the morning when i feel my skin looks dull.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> very good quality with reasonable price</li>
    <li> Product feels nice on the skin.  Softgels are lightly scented. However I wish there were more literature on the packaging, so that I know if the ingredients are really what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out - very strong smell too.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s greasy and oily. Beside that, the cream smell goods and it smooth too. I would recommend buying the cream placenta over this one becaue the other one doesn&#x27;t grease.</li>
    <li> This product keeps the much needed moisture around my eyes all day. I&#x27;ve been searching for years for an effective product. I was surprised to find placenta, but am grateful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just enough for the face and neck. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my face probably because I already use Dead Sea muse and a face brush. But it is smells pretty after its wears off a bit and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice and is very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;is kind greasy but I use this alone like a mask&lt;br /&gt;at night and feel so good in the morning the skin&lt;br /&gt;are hidrated plus have amazing price</li>
    <li> The only minus - I wish it were fragrance-free. It does have a funny smell when you first apply it, which stays for about hour, then the floral undertone takes over. I would not apply it and eat or drink right after that - it&#x27;s slightly nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;However, the effect is superb - it soaks into your skin and leaves it soft and silky for 12 hours, at least.</li>
