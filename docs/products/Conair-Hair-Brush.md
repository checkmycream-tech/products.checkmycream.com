      <li>Well made perfect size for long hair</li>

      <li>Exactly as pictured and the bristles don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
      <li>The feature which really catapults this brush over its competitors is the super comfortable gel handle.</li>
      <li>Anothere great Conair brush that you won&#x27;t hace to deal with the bristle tips falling of after a few months.</li>
      <li>I love the soft gel handle.</li>
      <li>The bristles feel very strong, yet flexible enough to bend (not break) if you brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the soft handle, and it works very well for my hair.</li>
      <li>This bruch was exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>- this was my first gel grip hairbrush</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Love these brushes and I have multiple!</li>
      <li>The soft gel grip is extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>Soft on the scalp and a comfortable handle.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t like buying a hairbrush unless I can see it and feel it, but this was precisely what I wanted -- a good half-round brush with bristle tips that don&#x27;t hurt my scalp or snag my long hair.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a decent brush with the gelly grip</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Easily keeps me tangle free when used on wet hair and does not over groom or flatten my hair when I use after round brush ( also conair gel handle brush) hair drying.</li>
      <li>The reason igot the second brush was becaise my teenage daughter stole my original one</li>
      <li>First experience buying hair products online was definitely a plus in this case.</li>
      <li>I love the brush part too because it isn&#x27;t too soft and isn&#x27;t too hard on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Soft squishy handles.  </li>
      <li>OK, it&#x27;s a lot thick.</li>
      <li>It might be good for thin hair, or naturally straight hair, but for thick hair with a lil curl to it, this brush leaves you wanting a little more.</li>
      <li>so I had to search for a new one online and finally found it</li>
      <li>wish I had gotten to choose the color of my hairbrush before I bought it, as I really didn&#x27;t want a pink hairbrush.</li>

    <li> I love this hairbrush!  The back of the brush is hard plastic without  the rubber cushioning at the base of the head which has a tendency to rip and tear over time. The bristles are semi-rigid with ball tips which allows for effective brushing  and tangle removal while still being comfortable on the scalp. The feature which really catapults this brush over its competitors is the super comfortable gel handle. If and when this brush needs replacing, I would repurchase this again.</li>

    <li> Great. Soft on the scalp and a comfortable handle. Love these brushes and I have multiple!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable handle and feel good bristles. My favorite brush ever. I have fine hair but a lot of it. Easily keeps me tangle free when used on wet hair and does not over groom or flatten my hair when I use after round brush ( also conair gel handle brush) hair drying. Handle snapped off after about 5 years of use. I said \\&quot;darn it\\&quot; &amp; bought another  just like it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and the balls on the end of the bristles don&#x27;t comb it</li>
    <li> The hairbrush is really nice and feels good on my scalp. It&#x27;s a hairbrush that works - what else can you say about it? Haha, I really liked the gel grip - this was my first gel grip hairbrush and I&#x27;ve liked it a lot. The bristles feel very strong, yet flexible enough to bend (not break) if you brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gotten to choose the color of my hairbrush before I bought it, as I really didn&#x27;t want a pink hairbrush.

    <li> Great brushes. Soft squishy handles.  Scratch free bristles.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!  Works well with my hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I have used a brush like this for years and sought this one as a replacement.  I love the soft gel handle.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and the bristles don&#x27;t break easily.I had one of these Conair brushes for years until I lost it so I had to search for a new one online and finally found it, Works great for people like me with long/coarse hair.</li>
