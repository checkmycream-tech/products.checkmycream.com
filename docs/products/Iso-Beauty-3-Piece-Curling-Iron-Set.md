      <li>That being said they were willing to replace, refund, whatever would make the situation better for me.</li>

      <li>This one is by far the best for several reasons.</li>

      <li>it comes with a special glove so that you do not burn your fingers.  </li>
      <li>I love how the heat settings are electronic and it heats up super fast.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>Gets very hot</li>
      <li>If you are purchasing this make sure you press the barrel attachment onto the bottom part completely!</li>
      <li>but the curls are worth it.</li>
      <li>Heats quickly and my daughter&#x27;s curls really held!  </li>
      <li>so they fall out pretty quick</li>
      <li>It gets really hot and the glove is great, definitely not long enough.</li>
      <li>The glove came in very handy since I have a small tremor.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work correctly which made me pretty upset because it was a Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>This was the first curling wand we&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>I love how it comes with 3 different sizes to change out.</li>
      <li>Curl seems to hold with these curling irons more than others I&#x27;ve used like the gold ones from the big box beauty stores.  </li>
      <li>this wand is terrific super hot !!</li>
      <li>This is my first This heats up so fast.</li>
      <li>Gets really hot really fast just like it should.</li>
      <li>I like the different size options its easy to change out and feels sturdy</li>
      <li>Time will tell if the curl holds but the initial results are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>It really protected me from burning myself.</li>
      <li>and very reliable product would reccomend to anyone ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this curling wand</li>
      <li>fast shipping...</li>
      <li>so it is very versatile.</li>
      <li>(this is a presumption based on the materials it&#x27;s made of), but for the price I wouldn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Next time i&#x27;ll just buy the original curling iron the size I want.</li>
      <li>, I can use whichever size I want on that particular day.  </li>
      <li>I love the color changing to red for hotter and blue for cooler</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The other attachments work fine.</li>
      <li>The large attachment didn&#x27;t work but that&#x27;s ok because I only really use the medium and small attachment.</li>
      <li>It only took me about 15 minutes the first time I used it</li>
      <li>Picked this one for the large digital display and ability to control temps also has a swiveling cord to prevent tangling.</li>
      <li>Just feels a little cheap.</li>
      <li>This product does not get hot enough to make an actual curl.</li>
      <li>Plus the glove does not really help with the wand being so hot.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer mentioned that you have to plug in and hold down the button for it to turn on, I love this feature and in order to turn it off you hold it down again.</li>
      <li>The iron itself seems like it might not last a whole long time</li>
      <li>Basically my advice is buy another brand, it seems that this exact curling wand is not only sold under other companies&#x27; brands</li>
      <li>Annoying to get it to snap into place properly and wish the thickest one was just slightly thinner but great value and makes quick work of curling hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many of these clamp-less curling wands. This one is by far the best for several reasons. 1. You can adjust the heat temperature which is very important for me as I have fine hair and I hate to burn it. The other wands I have used got either too hot or not hot enough. 2. The on/off button is in a good place so I don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while using it. I had a horrible time with a wand by another maker turning off constantly &amp; changing the temperature when I didn&#x27;t want it changed. Another reviewer mentioned that you have to plug in and hold down the button for it to turn on, I love this feature and in order to turn it off you hold it down again. This prevents accidentally turning on or off while in use. 3. The 3 sizes are perfect for me. I could never decide which size I like best and now I don&#x27;t have to decide, I can use whichever size I want on that particular day.  Also as my hair progresses from short to long I will likely start using the larger barrel size, and now I do not need to invest in another curling wand, I can just switch the size of the barrel. 4. This wand is lightweight yet it feels very solid, well made. The kick stand is also solid and the wand does not tip over accidentally like another brand I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this curling wand and I am so glad I invested in it.  I will update this review in a few months as I see how this product holds up with prolonged use.</li>
    <li> This is my first This heats up so fast. Its easy to interchange the barrels and has a good size difference between them.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot really fast just like it should. Annoying to get it to snap into place properly and wish the thickest one was just slightly thinner but great value and makes quick work of curling hair. Picked this one for the large digital display and ability to control temps also has a swiveling cord to prevent tangling.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Material is made cheaply but can&#x27;t complain for the price. Will see how it holds up</li>
    <li> The Iso curling wand is great and I love that the three barrels give you options. I have tried other (cheaper) wands before and they are hard to deal with and usually pretty gimmicky. Loved Iso. The only complaint I would have is that its hard to work with the wand while wearing the glove. Plus the glove does not really help with the wand being so hot. I have actually been going without the glove and as long as your careful you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem avoiding burning yourself.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I love how it comes with 3 different sizes to change out. I have only used 1 size on me so far and a different one on someone else but both hairstyles were great....</li>
    <li> I was looking for a curling wand and stumbled upon this one- the three size of barrels are great, I like more options. It heats up fast and keeps my hair looking good :) I wasn&#x27;t used to  not having a clamp, but it is great- I love that I don&#x27;t get that kink in my hair anymore from it.</li>
    <li> Nice, comes with a glove too.... Works well, a bit hard to detach the different wands.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and it worked incredibly well.  I have difficult to curl hair and I love the way it came out. Time will tell if the curl holds but the initial results are fabulous. I used the second to largest barrel and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I do recommend using a heat protecting glove or you will burn your fingers. The adjustable heat is great for all hair types and is better than the other wands that do not offer heat settings. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this and the fact that you get interchangeable barrels is the icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact ISO 3 piece product less than a year ago and I truly thought it was awesome. Interchangeable sizes, different heat settings, and because you have to hold down the on/off button for an extended time you can&#x27;t accidentally turn it off when you are curling your hair. However, I went to turn it on the other day and ERR popped up in the digital screen. I have called the ISO company/manufacturer over and over again and no ones will answer the phone. After a long time trying to figure out if it&#x27;s fixable I figured out that when I attach the other sized wands it will still work, however, I really only use the one size that must have shorted out and doesn&#x27;t work so it&#x27;s a loss. This product has proved itself to be a bit janky. Basically my advice is buy another brand, it seems that this exact curling wand is not only sold under other companies&#x27; brands but it also can be found cheaper by these other brands. That way, if something happens to it hopefully you will have better luck than I.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has more than one size and I can change it at any time it also has a best heat ever and I would recommend this to any one like to have all in one curling iron its easy to take it any where you go.</li>
    <li> This is a good set. It gets hot enough to to curl my thick hair. The barrels are a a bit hard to remove. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price and heats up in seconds.</li>
    <li> The ISO 3 piece curling iron/wand set is really amazing.  I finally have the waves I want without damaging my hair.  No frizz either.  it is so easy to use.  it comes with a special glove so that you do not burn your fingers.  It is the same one my hair stylist uses!!  i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the 1.25 inch piece because I have a 1 and 1.5 inch barrel already from different brands. I thought it was a great deal for the item because it was a 3 in 1 but the 1&amp;#34; piece just gives me an error so I can&#x27;t use it. I am in contact with the seller to see if there is something I can do.</li>
    <li> I love my lso clipless curler. The sizes are so convenient. My curls last forever! The only problem I have with this is some times I&#x27;m in a bit of a hurry, please take your time. It gets really hot and the glove is great, definitely not long enough. Ive burnt my arm a couple of times.</li>
    <li> The large attachment didn&#x27;t work but that&#x27;s ok because I only really use the medium and small attachment. The other attachments work fine. Just feels a little cheap. Next time i&#x27;ll just buy the original curling iron the size I want.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Heats quickly and my daughter&#x27;s curls really held!  This was the first curling wand we&#x27;ve bought. The glove came in very handy since I have a small tremor. It really protected me from burning myself.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price and the heat is adjustable, goes up to 400 degrees! Comes in a nice box to keep iron in. 3 sizes is a plus.</li>
    <li> The glove that comes with this product is not a big help. The heat penetrates almost as if you were not wearing one. The curling waund was difficult to use and my hair twisted rather than laying flat on the iron as I was attmepting to wrap it around the waund. I found it difficult to figure out how to use it properly and got frustrated trying. It was returned!</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used all 3 barrels its nice to know the option is there. It heats up quickly. If you haven&#x27;t used this style before it takes some getting use to but the curls are worth it.</li>
    <li> The size listed are incorrect. The actual sizes are 3/4&amp;#34;,1&amp;#34; and 1-1/4&amp;#34;. I love the 1-1/4&amp;#34; barrel, but would&#x27;ve liked to have have a 1-1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> this wand is terrific super hot !! and very reliable product would reccomend to anyone ... Iso is a great product we have the iron and wand</li>
    <li> This curling wand set makes the prettiest waves and curls. It is nice because you have the three main sizes so it is very versatile. I love how the heat settings are electronic and it heats up super fast. A lot of people complain that it doesn&#x27;t work and says &amp;#34;err&amp;#34; on the screen, but it is because they don&#x27;t push it in all the way. If you are purchasing this make sure you press the barrel attachment onto the bottom part completely! I would definitely recommend this set because it works the same but is cheaper than a lot of other curling wand sets out there.</li>
    <li> Heats up well. Creates nice curls my hair just doesn&#x27;t hold up curl too good so they fall out pretty quick but I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with the curler.</li>
    <li> My daughter was ecstatic to get this.  We didn&#x27;t realize it came with the glove, so that was a bonus.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron buti had to work with it to get the big one to work. It kept on saying err so i pushed on it to get it to clamp tighter to the electrical device</li>
    <li> It is easy to use but the curl would never stay in my hair. When I used my straightener my curls would stay til I washed my hair. With this wand my curls last about an hour and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my hair holding a curl before. But for that hour my hair looks great. I like the different size options its easy to change out and feels sturdy</li>
    <li> The glove provided does not protect enough from the heat. You risk serious scalding. Definitely would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product does not get hot enough to make an actual curl. Ii was very disappointed and I would not recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about this working, but it&#x27;s so easy and you truly get great curls that last all day. I even have very fine hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl very well and it still worked great. It only took me about 15 minutes the first time I used it and I can do all my hair in 10 now. The iron itself seems like it might not last a whole long time (this is a presumption based on the materials it&#x27;s made of), but for the price I wouldn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot I love the color changing to red for hotter and blue for cooler</li>
    <li> Great sizes, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great Purchase!  Just as expected.  Heats up very quickly. Curl seems to hold with these curling irons more than others I&#x27;ve used like the gold ones from the big box beauty stores.  3 barrels for a good price.</li>
    <li> Seriously the only way I will ever curl my hair.  My hair holds the curl even after sleeping and being in the humidity! Best hair tool ever!</li>
    <li> L♡VE this, best investment I would recommend. All of the 3 pcs fit, heat and work well.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product stopped working after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> fast shipping... My daughter loves the item!!</li>
    <li> My Iso curling Iron came on time and I get so many compliments on my hair. Very happy with everything overall!</li>
    <li> Here is what i have to say about Pittty outlet. I order this product. It didn&#x27;t work correctly which made me pretty upset because it was a Christmas gift. That being said they were willing to replace, refund, whatever would make the situation better for me. I will purchase from this seller again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
