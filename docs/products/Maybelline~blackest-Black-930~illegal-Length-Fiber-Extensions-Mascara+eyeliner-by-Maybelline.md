      <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased another kind since.</li>
      <li>Its nice</li>
      <li>I bought this online and was excited at a great deal --- but the mascara gets crusty (on eyelashes) and doesn&#x27;t coat well</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t run at all, easy to apply, and the pencil is good quality too.</li>
      <li>It clumps very easy and you have to continue to apply in order to get somewhat of the desired look</li>

      <li>Most mascara products irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my Rimmel Lycra Lash works much better for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>which I find that liquid eyeliner is better for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter in law we both love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara and believe me I have tried plenty.</li>
      <li>I love the lengthening abilities of this mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is ok, not as good as other name brand fiber lashes but if looking for an everyday I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I usually love Illegal Length mascara - it&#x27;s been the only mascara to help with clumpness, and make my eyelashes noticeable. But this particular package was strange. The wand that came with it was horrendous, and it clumped like crazy. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why, but it was so bad I ended up using an older wand in it. Still clumped! I threw it out after weeks of trying to make things work. I&#x27;m not positive as to why this package in particular gave me this issue, seeing as the ones from the stores are totally fine.</li>
    <li> Mascara It&#x27;s perfect!!!!! beautiful black and works!! mmmm eyeliner its ok, but not for me :) fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great bundle. The eyeliner is great and smooth. The mascara is good but I prefer a bigger brush. Overall a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful lashes. Not for people with contacts.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It really does add length to your lashes. Just be sure to do one eye at a time. You need to get all the mascara on to get the length you want before it dries.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner pencil was smashed when I received it and anytime I sharpen it the actual make up in the pencil just falls out. The mascara is the blackest of black which I love and goes and neatly just not very thick has to have SEVERAL coats to show up.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and daughter is very happy.  I tried it myself and it works to extend your lashes but not too clumpy and lasts.</li>
    <li> The mascara is great, but the eyeliner is not good, it doesn&#x27;t last all day long. But for the price is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Love the liner combo. This shipped incredibly fast  And I even ordered two  I love this product and the price was even better</li>
    <li> The product was exceptionally reasonable in price. It does its job, but my eyes quickly became irritated. This, however, is not uncommon for me. Most mascara products irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this product is excellent!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and believe me I have tried plenty. Some as much as $30-$40. I&#x27;ve recently had a hard time finding this in any of my local stores, so glad I found it here and at such a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Need to apply several coats before it really defines the lashes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara.  I have pune eyelashes,  and this mascara really does wonders for my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Hmmm... I thought about getting away from fiber mascara. I read so many positive reviews of this mascara that I believed this one was THE one for me.  Well... its not. I spent more time applying this all in one fiber mascara than the 2 step fiber ones.  My review is spend the extra $$ for 2 step fiber if fiber lashes is what you desire.</li>
    <li> Nice dark mascara. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wow, it really does give extra length!  I already have fairly long lashes, but wanted my eyes to stand out a little more under my glasses.  I used the fiber mascara and eyeliner today, and it really works.  In fact, I kinda got a little too much length as my lashes were brushing up against my glasses lenses!  The eyeliner was really nice and went on smooth like butter.  Only thing was I had to reapply the liner after about 6 hours.  So far, I&#x27;m super happy with this!</li>
    <li> Double pack, great value. Arrived quickly. Love this mascara, and the eyeliner. The eyeliner has a side that has a brush that&#x27;s good for smudging.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I had trouble with other 3D fiber mascaras but this one is very user friendly!</li>
    <li> I really really like this mascara and the eyeliner is a plus! :-) Since its such a great price I figured why not give it a try?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t dried out but it definitely don&#x27;t seem like new.. eye liner was good though..after the last 3 I bought on here won&#x27;t be doing it again..</li>
    <li> I bought this online and was excited at a great deal --- but the mascara gets crusty (on eyelashes) and doesn&#x27;t coat well and I agree with the other reviewers, the eyeliner smudges and leaves me with a slight &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying the FALSIES mascara now!</li>
    <li> Mascara is good and does have fibbers in it but the pencil sucks! It smudges with the slightest touch. Its nice but if you want something that&#x27;ll last the whole day then this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I like mascaras with a wet formula, it clings to my lashes a lot quicker.  This makes my lashes look darker and separated them well.  For the price I paid it&#x27;s a good deal!  Keep in mind, my eyelashes are long and thick and it worked well. It definitely isn&#x27;t the most volumizing mascara in the market but it definitely separates and elongates the lashes. Also, make sure to not wait long if you want to add more layers because it does set quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The eyeliner isn&#x27;t the best in the market but it&#x27;s totally workable if you&#x27;re like me and are always misplacing your go to eyeliner lol.  The eyeliner is a little dry so to achieve a bold look you have to go over a few times.  Don&#x27;t worry though, it&#x27;s not those old school drugstore eyeliners that you practically had to scratch your eye in order to achieve color lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this package. The price is a steal and will continue to buy more!</li>
    <li> For my daughter, she loved it! Great product especially for the price! Her absolute, favorite product as it enhances her eyes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. Lengthens lashes easily, does everything I want it to. And the price is AMAZING! Love this mascara!</li>
    <li> I Will Be Buying this Again I Loves The eyeliner Perfect What I Was Looking For I Recommend This To AnyOne</li>
    <li> Not what i hoped it would be....makes my lashes clumpy...My lashes are short so I need something that extends them..:)..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big believer in this mascara for about a year, and when I found out I could buy it online for half price I was floored! This stuff is great! Apply one coat for a full day time look, or two coats for a dramatic, thick, night-out look. The fiber extensions truly do lengthen the look of your lashes. This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake or smear throughout the day, it stays put and looks flawless. I recommend this stuff to everyone who asks, and since I&#x27;m an Esthetician, I get asked quite a lot. A definite buy!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and I LOVE it. I have long lashes but this is my favorite mascara of all. It lengthens and thickens without the chunky stuck together look. I deinitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner!! The mascara isn&#x27;t the best, just average. However the eyeliner comes very pointy and is now my favorite eyeliner I own.</li>
    <li> This is a great back up mascara to my normal one. It lasts pretty much all day with minimal fallout. Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is mascara for lazy girls, like myself, that want the dark longer lash without much work. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes within hours.  I read in a beauty magazine that this was a good option so I gave it a try.  It actually did the trick.  I haven&#x27;t used it in humid weather. It will eventually give you the raccoon eye but by then you&#x27;ll will be probably be about ready to call it a night. I haven&#x27;t purchased another kind since. and for the price $5 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my go to when I want extra length. I usually never wear it alone. I found that in order to go above and beyond , use it with your favorite mascara to lock the fibers in to get longer lashes. The eyeliner is great too.</li>
    <li> This mascara has always been my favorite to use and I have never seen it cheaper anywhere else! I very much recommended this product and user!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and the package was already opened, but nothing inside was damaged or used. So I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my self and a friend and she and I absolutely love this combo. I have to buy again and from same seller.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I have ever bought.  It truly makes your eyelashes so much longer!  You can keep applying it to make them as long as you want.  Its AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> People say I take long applying my mascara on &amp; its true,I like for my lashes to have that dark,long,thick look &amp; thats what I get using this mascara,people ask if my lashes are fake &amp; they don&#x27;t seem to believe that a mascara alone can give you that look!thanks Maybalene,from now on my mascara will be 930-illegal length fiber extensions! !</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since this was so inexpensive but it&#x27;s actually great! It builds easily &amp; comes off at night easily but did not run.</li>
    <li> I have been looking fort a go to mascara. This one coats nicely with multiple coats and extends lashes like WOAH! I really like it. Not clumpy or too wet. Just right. Also no flaking.... which is huge for me. The liner was just a bonus.</li>
    <li> Really does make the eyelashes pop. Doesn&#x27;t run at all, easy to apply, and the pencil is good quality too.</li>
    <li> Great value and it goes onto my eyelashes very nicely. I would recommend, especially for the price. AND it is not very toxic (based on the EWG.org&#x27;s website ratings</li>
    <li> it came early. and i used this mascara countless times before. first time ordering from them . the price is great. and it lengthens ur lashes.</li>
    <li> Cheap and works really well.. I have super short eyelashes and this makes them SUPER long! Definitely my favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> Like most people buying this, I bought for the incredible deal on the mascara - the eyeliner is a kind of bonus! But in terms of the mascara, it is fantastic! It&#x27;s honestly much better than my higher end mascaras; like Benefit They&#x27;re Real and Elizabeth Arden Double Density. I bought this because it had such high reviews on makeupalley, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I also like that it washes off fairly easily, unlike some which feel like glue on your lashes. All in all, I will 100% be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> everything is such a good price! i ordered 5 of these haha Christmas presents all the way!! and it looks like u spent the 10 dollar that they are at walmart! win win!</li>
    <li> Just awesome!!!!&lt;br /&gt;for the price, I would recommend this, and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I thought they meant this was some black market s***. Boy was I wrong. Not only does it NOT contain whale blubber, but it also contains no childrens tears? WTF? Ther eis nothing about it that is illegal, but oh well. Makes your lashes look like lashes! But more Lashy!!! Whooooooo 5 star BM!</li>
    <li> This item was an amazing deal, and I did love it at first but then I felt like it dried out too soon</li>
    <li> Cool that you get a bonus. Eyeliner is very basic and not waterproof but a staple to add to your makeup bag. Mascara is great when applied per instructions but I found it only lasts about 6 hours.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I was amazed. It looked like I put false eyelashes on it extended my lashes so much. I accidentally bought regular instead of waterproof the first time but it worked great. When I did get the waterproof, I was disappointed. It was very hard to get off my lashes. I use make up remover wipes and it just tore them up. Moral of the story: try the regular first. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge, surprisingly.</li>
    <li> Maybelline has some great eye makeup, and I love this set.  The mascara goes on without clumps, lasts, and looks great!  The eye liner also goes on nicely, lasts, and looks great!  This was a really good price too!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this mascara, but it is great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> For the prize this  combo is very nice. Mascara  works very well  and the liner goes well with it.i recommend it to bargain shoppers</li>
    <li> Love the product. My eyelashes were long afterwards. Stays all on all day. I love the product. I recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use both the mascara and eyeliner often good product!</li>
    <li> they were great.  eyeliner makes a nice thin line very easily and you can blur the line with the other end of the pencil.  Mascara is terrific  looks like fake looong lashes</li>
    <li> I like the eye liner, it defines my eyes more :) as well as the mascara. I am happy I bought 3 coz I love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara gives you some length but no as much. It clumps very easy and you have to continue to apply in order to get somewhat of the desired look you are seeking.</li>
    <li> Love this and quick shipping</li>
    <li> My all Must have Mascara and while the liner won&#x27;t last long the Products are definitely worth purchasing, bc they make your lashes look so big and plump, and the liner is soft and dark, a very Good Find!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! The mascara makes your lashes so long! It kind of clumps a little but it&#x27;s hard to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t so whatever. The eyeliner is the best, it goes on so easy and it&#x27;s such a rich black color. I use this mascara with another one that adds volume.</li>
    <li> Good product. Although loreal voluminous will always be number one!</li>
    <li> Great buy, the price is way better than in stores. I think the waterproof formula is slightly better than this one. The black eyeliner is VERY smudgy! Very, I found its best for the base of eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Visibly lengthened my lashes and gave me enough volume that my lashes were definitely noticeable, without being spidery or clumped together. Seriously – no clumping, even after several swipes. Held the curl all day. After 12+ hours, I noticed a couple of black specks on my cheeks from mascara fallout – not enough to bother me. Absolutely no raccoon eyes (which is a mascara deal breaker for me). The best part was it washed off easily with just warm water, no dark residue left behind. The eyeliner is soft and dark; I use it as a spare. But the mascara is the showstopper in this duo.</li>
    <li> Barely shows on my eyelashes...  I only paid a couple of bucks so I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I ended up tossing it.  Everyone is different, it may work great for some folks.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter in law we both love it. It goes on smooth and easy. Does add length to the lashes. It doesn&#x27;t make them all stick together and clump. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will definitely buy this again and will tell family and friends how much I love it.  I&#x27;ve already told mom and now she wants to try it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and such a great deal at 4.99 for both.  The mascara makes my lashes look so long, I love it!  The only reason I didnt give the 5th star is because I went through this mascara so much faster than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.  The eyeline is good too.  It&#x27;s very soft so easy to apply.  I didnt have a problem with smudging but could see how it would happen if you touch your eyes a lot (again, very soft eyeliner).  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Illegal length but made my eyelashes droop.</li>
    <li> Wow! The packaging was battered as if the product was quite old. I didn&#x27;t use the eyeliner but the mascara seems nowhere near as moist as mascara should be, probably due to the age of the product. What a disappointment. This product should have been thrown away, not sold at a discount rate.</li>
    <li> It actually lengthens my eyelashes to the point that i feel them when i blink in my sunglasses which i was very impressed with.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is fine, though it does smudge a little. One con is that it can be irritating to my eyes. After a few hours I end up having to take it off because my eyes keep stinging.</li>
    <li> Bought it when it was very cheap. Love the quality that it&#x27;s in. Would recommend it to a friend. Nice overall.</li>
    <li> Great product, I can always count on Marvelling  mascara. Great price when I purchaed!</li>
    <li> Good product but they dont make my lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product &amp; very fast delivery thx!</li>
    <li> This kit is a great value. It is easy to create your desired length through layering multiple applications. The pencil is good for creating bold smoky eyes with ease.</li>
    <li> If your think you will make your thin lashes long and lusshious, this product will not do it. I think it is the wand the teeth are very sparse, i like Boots # 7 masacara</li>
    <li> I love this mascara a lot! And makes it nice and convenient that it comes along with a pencil eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Really like the Fiber Extensions... I do not care for the eye liner as it really does end up all over the eye and every other place it doesn&#x27;t belong within an hour.  Extensions are well worth the cost of the purchase, just be careful of eyeliner placement.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have any eyelashes or fake eyelashes, this will do the trick, seriously! Send me more, please!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I pay 3-4 times more in the drug store for this item. I love this mascara. However, this seems to be different that what I usually purchase. Not as many fiber extensions. The eyeliner has come in very handy and for that I think it is worth the cost. Only warning I have is that it is not equivalent to the ones I have purchased in store.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily for the mascara which is the only mascara I will buy on the market today. Lengthening, glossy, pitch black, not too clumpy, good to go at two coats, and volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is smeary. What I do is line my eyes with the eyeliner, then go in with mascara. By the time I&#x27;m done with the mascara the eyeliner is already smudged all over my lids! It does glide right one when you&#x27;re applying, and the pencil itself is pretty soft (hard to wing it out as a result), but it will also glide by itself onto the rest of your makeup when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara for 30+ years and this is, without exception, the best mascara ever! My lashes nearly doubled in length without clumps and my usually-sensitive eyes had no negative effects whatever.</li>
    <li> Love the fiber extensions! It maximizes my already beautifully long lashes and it&#x27;s no need for me to use glue/stick on lashes when I have this product. Easy to apply and remove but it LASTS during the time you wear it. The eyeliner was just a bonus! Nice bang for your buck with this one!</li>
    <li> I love the lengthening abilities of this mascara. I have been using it for a while, and I will continue to do so. Very nice product for the price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this, addes length to my lashes without clumping...</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and eyeliner, Its definitely worth the money, I got it for $5.00 and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I want on to thank you for a wonderful commodity, all is simple ideally! Qualitatively and accessible, it is pleasant to get a good commodity, thank you.</li>
    <li> my daughter just wanted the eyeliner but this was cheap so i bought it. She decided to try out the mascara and now this set is her new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Eyeliner goes on easy and smooth and the mascara made my lashes look  longer and fuller. . .</li>
    <li> Love it. The price is nothing compared if i bought it in store.  Love it and it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> As a self-described mascara &#x27;ho, I try them all.  My favorite by far is Lancome Definicils. It&#x27;s pricey and I&#x27;m always looking for better drugstore mascaras which led me to this one. It supposedly is pretty close to definicils. In my opinion NO, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a decent mascara it has a perfect consistency and the brush is long and thin (the ones that work well for me). It darkens and lenghtens pretty well, but I can&#x27;t put my finger on why I dont LOVE it.  Maybe becasue my Rimmel Lycra Lash works much better for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara lasted through the day well into the night with no flaking or irritation. It&#x27;s always a plus when mascara stays put until I take it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the dollar, it&#x27;s a great mascara if you are not as picky as I am with mascaras. it works &amp; it&#x27;s fairly cheap</li>
    <li> I loved this but it made my lashes a little spiderlike. I loved how early it came it was here before it was supposed to be. Both of the products work and are for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Not for me. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara several times it is my favorite and it is at a great price.  I use both the mascara and the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this mascara. If you want beautiful natural looking eyelashes with some volume this is the mascara and it leaves them looking longer than usual. This is my second time purchasing this product. Same thing for the eyeliner... It is extremely dark :)</li>
    <li> Mascara does work well, adds length and volume. It is a dryer formula, so if you like that I&#x27;d really recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> Was a touch dried until I left it in the sun for a little bit.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it!! Tangles my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t make them look any longer. Only a bit blacker. Clumps too. And the eyeliner ughh smudges a looot. Definitely won&#x27;t buy it again. It is worth mentioning however that the seller provided a fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is my to go mascara. I got nice long lashes it just bring them out a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but you have to scrap off a decent amount to ensure no clumping .  If this is done, you get a nice result. Just  don&#x27;t  blink until it&#x27;s  dry, or it&#x27;ll look like a child drew sun rays around your eyes .</li>
    <li> First, the price of this item was amazing ($4).  The mascara is really dark black, but it is not thick at all.  It leaves no clumps and it is not hard to remove; simply warm water does the trick. The only drawback to the mascara is that the brush is long, so when applying the product you have to be extra careful because it can on your skin around your eye.  The eyeliner is dark and better for creating lines under than eye rather than above the eye...which I find that liquid eyeliner is better for that purpose.  Overall, I would recommend to any aged women looking for some definition to your eye without looking too made-up.</li>
