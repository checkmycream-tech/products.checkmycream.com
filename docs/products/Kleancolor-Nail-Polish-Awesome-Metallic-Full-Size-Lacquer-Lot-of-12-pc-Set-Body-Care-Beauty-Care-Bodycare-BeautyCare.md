<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great way to get a variety of colors. Really great colors....</li>
    <li> Dries super fast.  I like the colors.  They are not as bright as pictured.  Covers in 1coat.  I like to have different looks and these are a fun change.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Polish is clump and goes on horrible, plus 2 of the bottles arrived damaged.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors - my daughters loved these!</li>
    <li> These were her favs...</li>
    <li> It came exactly as described. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors, maybe you should make new diffrent metalic colors</li>
    <li> They stain nails and it is hard to remove that stain.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying these based on the nail colors pictured, RECONSIDER. The nail photo is under harsh light and is likely &#x27;corrected&#x27; in an image editing program. The colors shown in the bottle image are more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the colors are vibrant and beautiful. I love the shimmers in the set and for the price this is really a great value. These paints go on evenly. I only needed a second coat with two of the colors (and probably that&#x27;s user error). The polish is fairly durable but you&#x27;ll still want to protect it with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Photo: 4 days after painting. Protect your paint with a clear coat!)&lt;br /&gt;*Edit!* The pink, green, and blue pictured here will stain your nails even through a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;**Second Edit** More colors. These chipped fairly quickly. This photo is taken day two and you can already see wear and tear. None of these colors stained.</li>
    <li> The polish just started to peel off within hours of applying it. It reminded me of kids nail polish that doesn&#x27;t stay on but just peels off. I think this polish was either old or diluted with another chemical because I own other polish by this brand and it doesn&#x27;t just peel off.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!! The smell is very strong, but other than that a great product</li>
    <li> Beautiful metallic colors.  Basically there are 6 colors and another 6 that are a shade different. Niece loved them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my granddaughter because she wants to become a cosmetologist! She was going to try them out with her friend the night she got the package!</li>
    <li> Green is not a bright as color pictured. All have great one coat coverage</li>
    <li> all the colors are very beautiful and shiny. Its what I expected</li>
    <li> Color are awesome and it don&#x27;t chip loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 &amp; 11 year old who love to paint their nails.  The colors are amazing! Bright and sparkly and they love it.  They are contstantly changing their nails.</li>
    <li> I love this set but it doesn&#x27;t come with that silver color, it&#x27;s more white</li>
    <li> Using these for craft projects and they are very pretty selection of colors.</li>
    <li> I love kleancolor nail polish, they are just like the picture, I wish they had metallic in neon colors too. I received them in one week. I&#x27;m a very happy customer, 😊💅👍</li>
    <li> unfortunately one of the polishes arrived broken. The seller did indeed send me a replacement for that one polish which arrived intact.  These polishes are beautiful and easy to use. Wear well if using a topcoat.</li>
    <li> Bought this polish for my daughter.  The polish did not stay on for even a full day.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Our favorite polish!! Bright and vibrant!</li>
    <li> I was missing one of the dark blue colors</li>
    <li> AWESOME colors and a lot for a small price!! Invest in a pricey top coat!</li>
    <li> Nice, made a great gift</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and love these colors ! They are very rich and opaque ! If you stamp they stamp well !! I would highly recommend them ! You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Christmas Present for my Step Daughter.  Big Hit!!!</li>
    <li> when i get my set of this polish i,ll let you know maria t</li>
    <li> These nail polishes are pretty but they stained my nails even if I used a base coat.</li>
    <li> One coat needed, very thick vibrant colors!</li>
    <li> Skeptical about getting metalic color as but glad I did looks very pretty love it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, I would buy again</li>
    <li> This polish is seriously awesome. The colors are just as vibrant and beautiful as the pictures, it dries quickly and one coat is all you need. I was so surprised at how high quality they are. I can&#x27;t recommend them enough!</li>
    <li> Takes a very long time to dry ! Very thick polish</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty but the nail polish is already chipping before the day is over even when I put several coats. However it was inexpensive so I can&#x27;t complain about the quality.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, it looks great!</li>
    <li> Love love love these colors!</li>
    <li> Have ordered many if the other colors before. Love the packing and the polish itself. Quick delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> Right away I fell in love with the rich vivid colors...and these polishes are thick enough to only need 1coat.  And 12 beautiful different colors for $15....you cannot beat that.</li>
    <li> The colors are so pretty and look exactly how I wanted them to!</li>
    <li> Over all i enjoy the all the colors. Applying it is dry fast and goes on nicely. BUT what&#x27;s frustrating is when i put them on and including a clear coat it peals off by the next day. If any1 has a solution that wouls be great!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, very pretty colors and came earlier than I expected</li>
    <li> Great quality colors!</li>
    <li> Each and every one of these colors is beautiful! The Polish has good coverage and quite often I only use one coat. As an added bonus, when I put two colors on my nails... Kinda like an ombr&amp;eacute; thing- all the colors are the same hue so mixing and matching is easy. Adding a top coat over the p two toned colors makes for an awesome effect. I have purchased four sets of this polish- everyone that has received a set as a gift was very happy. Would definitely recommend this nail polish to anyone that asked.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my stepdaughter. She loved the colors.</li>
    <li> Colors are bold and plenty.  Good sized bottles.  Fun!</li>
    <li> Good investment, beautiful color selection, large bottles, perfect for painting your nails or painting miniatures.</li>
    <li> The Nail polish is chipping as you apply it. The nail polish is thick and you have to dribble acetone in it as you get it. Otherwise the colors are great except the black.</li>
    <li> Love the sparkle and my client loves them too!</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set as one of the bottles was broken when I received it. I used the metallic purple first and it was chiipping off by the next day, and that&#x27;s at home, not even at my job.</li>
    <li> Step daughter loved the set.</li>
    <li> Bright and vibrant colors. My girls absolutely love these nail polishes. It&#x27;s easy to be creative with so many options!</li>
    <li> I love the colors but the nail polish only lasts one day. Everyone compliments me on the colors but I&#x27;m having to reapply daily</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She loves the colors and they are nice size bottles at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very nice and original colors.  Arrived late due to weather, but who can help that.</li>
    <li> The colors are terrific. They&#x27;re very vibrant, and the metallic looks great. They arrived on time and in good condition. None of them were dried out or damaged at all. One word of warning, and this is the reason for the 4 stars instead of five simply because it&#x27;s not in the description anywhere (which is really annoying). Some of these are actually matte (no shine at all) and even the one&#x27;s that are not matte are a bit on the &#x27;not shiny&#x27; side. In my opinion they all need a good top coat, which is ok. A base coat would probably be a good idea also. Once you do throw a top coat on them, they&#x27;ll look nice and shiny. I got these for my granddaughters birthday, she should really enjoy all the colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-19-15 update. Still like the colors, and my granddaughter is having a ball with them. I did downgrade this to 3 stars though, because the colors chip off pretty quickly even if you use a base and top coat. The colors are beautiful, but they just don&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m still kind of baffled over the five bottles of &#x27;matte&#x27; polish. Why would anyone ever want &#x27;polish&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t shine? Overall, fun colors, good variety, great for younger girls to play around with, but poor quality. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself to use.</li>
    <li> These colors are much nicer than I expected.I expected this to be cheap nailpolish that i would use a few times and toss. I actually got some really pretty colors and nail polish that was just as good as anything i would have got in the drugstore. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this set with a gift card from Christmas. She got way more for the price than I expected. The colors are really cool and it is a good polish for such an inexpensive and large set of polish. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors and great for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on too well, but that&#x27;s without a topcoat. I&#x27;m going to try next time with a topcoat.</li>
    <li> The polish seems to be as described (gift for my my daughter), but be aware of possible packing problems.  I received the package via USPS in four days, which was well within my expectations as far as shipping speed.  The problem was noticed immediately upon opening my mailbox. The strong chemical smell hit me like a brick...I couldn&#x27;t tell from the box what was in it, but I knew from the smell something was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;painty&amp;#34; (that should be a word) smell was so strong I could already feel a dull headache beginning to take hold.  I brought the package to the garage and carefully opened it.  I found two smaller boxes with 6 bottles of polish packed in each, two rows of three bottles per box.  There was a piece of bubble wrap in the middle of each box between the two rows.  There was nothing to protect the bottles from damage caused by drops, etc. except the cardboard of the outer box and the cardboard of the inner boxes.  This obviously was not enough to provide complete protection as three of the twelve glass bottles were broken (a single bottle in one box, and two bottles in the other).  Needless to say there was fingernail polish everywhere!  There were only four bottles total that weren&#x27;t covered in polish.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been that bad if it was just three bottles lost, but the fingernail polish from the broken bottles contaminated all but four of the original twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter seemed happy with the four bottles she did get as this was surprise and she wasn&#x27;t expecting anything.</li>
    <li> I loved the polish from the moment I opened the box. They were not damaged and got to me very fast. My only 2 concerns are the very strong smell and a few of the colors stained my nails. I put on several base coats and they still stained!</li>
    <li> Mom and Dad got this for me for christmas because I have recently gotten really into doing my own nail art. It was much better than I expected for the price. The colors are of great quality, none of them came broken, and they stay on my nails better than the stuff I buy at Walmart for 2 bucks a pop. My only complaint is that a few colors, such as the green and pink, dye my nails. When I removed the colors from my nails the first time (I had used ALL the colors except black and white in order to test them) I noticed this, and while my nails are still dyed, It is easy to cover up with one of the colors that does not do that. This is still a great item, and I strongly recommend. Just.... Use the green and pink for accents only XD</li>
    <li> Put on three layers of this with two clear on top and it still tends to chip and come off after just a couple of days.  I guess you get what you pay for!  The colors are great.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 9 year old daughter and she loved them.  The colors are great and the polish dries pretty quickly.  I even use them every once in a while!!</li>
    <li> I just got these and OMG they are beautiful!  The bottles are full sized and the colors are so funky!  I love these!  The colors are great for year round use.  I can&#x27;t wait to take off my polish and use these bad boys!  The package was wrapped well, there were no broken or opened bottles.  The polish is  a good consistency not too runny and not to congealed. I am going to have a blast with these!!!!  I will definitely be getting more of this brand of polish.  I have a lot of their glitter polish and let me tell you it doesn&#x27;t disappoint and neither did this stash I just got.  Buy this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Bright, vibrant colors. Lasting quality. I work with my hands and this polish can handle my abuse. I am very happy with the value. A+</li>
    <li> Great colors! Both of my daughters and myself really enjoy the vibrancy of the colors. These are slightly lower end in quality and tend to peel after a couple of days but they are a lot of fun and we don&#x27;t mind switching the colors out.</li>
    <li> Good deal but you have to like colors like yellow and green etc</li>
    <li> Pretty good collection but it does require a base and top coat to last very long. It also takes a long time to dry compared to many polishes out there.</li>
    <li> great colors...but chips easily</li>
    <li> the colors are a bright as the pics. love them.</li>
    <li> Nail polish chip off too quickly but cute colors and good price</li>
    <li> Nice vivid colors this was a gift. So that is all I know</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my niece,  she loved it! The day it arrived she had a big nail polish party.  Great gift!!!!</li>
    <li> Love them came right on time</li>
    <li> I thought they were going to be cheap but to my surprise there amazing and beautiful these colors look good on your nails there a must have , bought one set ,but definitely ordering more you won&#x27;t regret it,&lt;br /&gt;i love the look of matalic have to try them&lt;br /&gt;10 star..**********</li>
    <li> Sometimes you only need to use one coat.  Nice product and good vibrate colors.</li>
    <li> The polish is very pretty but it peals off within a days time. I can literally paint my nails in the am and by bedtime the paint is badly chipped.</li>
    <li> Colors are just as beautiful as they are in the picture and a lot of fun to wear.</li>
    <li> The nail polish chips to fast</li>
    <li> Wow! These colors really POP! They are ALL intensely pigmented with tons of shine! Each color is gorgeous and goes on very smoothly. Usually just one coat is all you need which is a time saver! I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves nail art. ALL of the colors work perfectly with nail stamping too. They provide a crisp image with great color. These are full sized bottles too! They were shipped in two little boxes in one package which kept them safe in shipping.This is a fantastic deal! You will love this polish set.</li>
    <li> My wife just received the nail polish and she very happy with the products. Thank you for the awesome nail polish!</li>
    <li> The colors are nice everything was great about it, but when I got my package it was thrown outside open and one of the nail polish broke. I wasn&#x27;t too happy because the color I seem to love happen to be all over the inside of the box and my hands &#x3D;\</li>
    <li> They are great colors, but half of it has chipped away after two days. Every time. Haven&#x27;t tried it with a top coat yet, but considering how often I change my nail color and none of my other polishes need a top coat, wouldn&#x27;t recommend, which is sad because they are beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this five stars, but now that I&#x27;ve tried all of the colors I need to amend that. The reason they lost a star in my book is because a few of these colors WILL stain your nails yellow. I used a top coat before applying, but it didn&#x27;t matter. I wish I had taken pictures, because the stain was that bad. The worst offender was the green, although the blues did it as well. They have been thrown away. I liked the colors on my nails, but that didn&#x27;t outweigh the horrible stain they left and the work it took to remove them. I tried everything from toothpaste to baking soda and lemon. Eventually I had to buff them off. OTHERWISE I think these are nice polishes for the price, just be careful of the greens and blues.</li>
    <li> I was expecting actual metalics, they are colors with smallll pieces of glitter in them like really small, so not EXACTLY metalic, but i still really like the colors it just is more of a super small glitter and i mean SUPER small, than a metalic, they do the job just fine though!!</li>
    <li> Cute nail polishs, got two of the same color but for 13 bucks it&#x27;s worth it. Just gave the extra to a friend!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is horrible it starts coming off like an hour after you out it on</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; great product! Very pleased! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed and of course they don&#x27;t sell nail polish here. I was super excited when my package got here and the product looked exactly like the picture shown. It&#x27;s really the little things that make the days better here so thank you.</li>
    <li> Dries a bit slow, but my wife reports she really likes it, and it only takes one coat. Shipping great.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love these colors. Especially the golds and coppers. These colors are my colors for fall and winter shades.</li>
    <li> Nice size, nail polish is a great quality</li>
    <li> Awesome. Totally happy</li>
    <li> Polish looks great and really stands out also dries fast but the polishes chips so easy even with a topcoat and only one layer of polish i have to redo my nails the very next day after painting with these polishes</li>
    <li> i just love this..... good price</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish at great price! Thx!</li>
    <li> Colors looked different. Not really metallic colors like I expected.  There more like shimmering glittery colors.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these!  Colors are so bright and just too beautiful to describe.  I plan to use every color; there are no ugly colors in the lot!</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail after 4 days of shipping and one was broken. I was kinda disappointed because I really wanted all the colors. They do go on smooth and dry very fast.  I do like this polish but had to give a 3 star because their packaging is so poor that it a wonder more bottles didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I love the colors :))thank you fast delivery&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I was shocked at the vibrancy and evenness of the color with only one coat, and no top or base coats. Very smooth, no brush strokes at all. Very happy with this collection, and I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely junk. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Colors and price were attention grabbers. Quality is awful. It&#x27;s true - you get what you pay for. I painted my nails at night - woke up and by 8am it had already chipped..I hadn&#x27;t even showered or washed my hands yet that morning..There was not reason for it to chip off. Terrible terrible quality. I will not be repurchasing, ever, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> gorgeous i want to try all the other sets too.</li>
    <li> Love them. ..thanks....very good</li>
    <li> Loved the colors. Great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> The colors are ver pretty, however the polish chips very fast.</li>
    <li> not all my polishes are full one of the polishes was almost empty , love all the colors just would they would of sent me polishes that were full seemed like they were used  or maybe old.</li>
    <li> These polishes are very vibrant and colorful, they look just like they are pictured! I received these polishes as a gift for Christmas and I was very surprised with how smooth the polish went on, my favorite has to be the blues as it is my favorite color, but they are all pigmented properly. this was a very nice gift from my mom and they came in separate boxes which had Kleancolor on them. I would recommend these to any of my girl-friends. Dropped my stars down to two, after trying these polishes for a while, I noticed that they chip easily unless you have a top coat on them to keep them from chipping. It&#x27;s annoying that every time I wash dishes or anything for that matter that they chip, no matter how careful you are. If you want to make quality nail polish then why not make the polish stronger? It&#x27;s annoying! I recommend China Glaze or Sally Hansen nail polish if you want polish that won&#x27;t chip in a day or two of wearing. If you still want to buy these polishes, then I recommend you buy a coat to protect the polish something clear--otherwise you&#x27;ll be very mad.</li>
    <li> I love this collection because its so pretty and it keeps the wet look.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with nail polish it only took one coat to put it on and it lasted for a good while love the product</li>
    <li> My daughter has the most fun with all of these.</li>
    <li> Kolorize me had the best deal with kleancolor polish.. I ordered a bunch! I love the colors. Very nice variety. Very shiny and metallic. My order was shipped very quickly. The polish smell is not a bad as everyone makes it seem. Goes on smooth. Didn&#x27;t need a 2nd coat either..very satisfied with the quality for the price I paid... i will order again when b4 i run out!</li>
    <li> LOVE...LOVE...LOVE....</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and beautiful colors! I will be shopping again in the near future</li>
    <li> Excellent product will buy all the other colors,no smell and 1 stroke dry very quick .</li>
    <li> The colours are so vibrant, I love them! Some of the colors do stain your nails though (Red, Blue, Green).&lt;br /&gt;None of my bottles came broken :) They shipped rather quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Mine chip after a few days though so I guess I&#x27;m rough on them.&lt;br /&gt;The colours bleed too, I painted my niece&#x27;s nails with the green and put white acrylic paint on top and the polish stained the paint! I put the light blue on top of the green too and it turned it dark green.. Maybe it&#x27;s just the green.&lt;br /&gt;Also the green isn&#x27;t as vibrant as it is in the picture, every one thinks it&#x27;s yellow when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these few things, I really do like this polish set because they&#x27;re beautiful!</li>
    <li> Fast and safe delivery, perfect colors, perfect bright, I love it! Are awesome, Im gping to buy more of the metallic and pastel colors because my sister in law and a friend bought those and love it too soo 5 stars for this product!</li>
    <li> great polish love the colors and the full size bottles will buy more for my daughters and friends and mother inlaw.</li>
    <li> I ordered these specifically for nail stamping.EXCEPT for the green and white nd maybe one yellow all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.I think for the price this product is worth it..</li>
    <li> Thick, tacky polish that can&#x27;t be applied smoothly. Figured the poor quality was a fluke based on other reviews so attempted to resolve the issue with the company but their customer service is so awful that they never even got back to me.</li>
    <li> LOVE them and thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I am surprised by some of these reviews. It smells like typical nail polish. It dries fast, one coat was dried in about 8 min. One coat gives great coverage and is more then enough, goes on smoothly. Oddly enough I love most of the colors, the green is quite amazing as is the pink and I don&#x27;t even like pink. I usually use a nail bonder as my base and so far, after 4 days, no chipping or peeling. I was a bit surprised how it arrived. It took a bit more then a week to get here. Each bottle was wrapped individually in a bit of paper, then in a perfectly fitted small padded envelope inside another padded envelope. Overall for the price I&#x27;d say 12 bottles is a steal, since I typically pay up to $8 for one polish. I wish you could order the colors separately.</li>
    <li> love the colors, seems to be good quality</li>
    <li> I just got into stamping and needed a good variety of colors to practice stamping with. I didn&#x27;t want to end up wasting the expensive special polish I had while still trying to master the learning curve. After reading all the reviews saying these polishes could be used for stamping I decided the price was low enough for my purposes. I figured if any of the colors didn&#x27;t work so well for stamping I could always use it as a base to stamp on top of. I was able to stamp with each of the colors onto white paper and got good results with all of them except \\&quot;Metallic White\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t metallic at all but more like clear lumpy, glittery glue. Its not opaque enough to use for stamping and almost too hard to work with as a regular polish. I tried to use it as a base color to stamp on top of because it has the potential to be pretty but that didn&#x27;t work out so well the first time I tried it. Metallic White has a strange consistency, different from the other colors, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or dry properly on its own. I put on 2 coats &amp; added a coat of [[ASIN:B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] over the white to get it to dry better, but only the very top layer dried with the polish still wet underneath. After waiting an hour it hadn&#x27;t improved &amp; I was able to peel away the top layer in one piece leaving a sticky layer of polish on my nail. I was going to throw away the bottle but I decided to give it one more chance. This time I only put on one coat (I could still kinda see my natural nail underneath it) and did the best I could to get it to go on evenly. Then after letting it dry for 8 to 10 minutes (it was still slightly tacky) put the Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat over it &amp; this time it dried completely all the way through. I was able to stamp over it with Metallic Black then put on another layer of top coat. I&#x27;ve had this manicure on for 3 days now without any chips or peeling in the polish but that might be due to the top coat I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the colors work great for stamping and go on smoothly &amp; evenly as a regular polish. Unlike Metallic White, they also dry in a normal amount of time (use a fast dry top coat to speed things up.) The first color I tried for nail art was Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Red\\&quot;, which I used to make a small simple heart over the top of my smile line with a light gray base &amp; darker gray tip. Metallic Red was easy to work with &amp; made the heart look almost like a glittery sticker. When my manicure started chipping, each of the hearts stayed intact until I removed them with acetone. On the next manicure I tried stamping a mesh type pattern with Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Black\\&quot; over a clear base coat, painted the tips also with Metallic Black &amp; went over it with a top coat to give the impression of thigh high fishnet stockings. Kleancolor metallic polish works great for stamping, the whole pattern transfers cleanly to the stamper. When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with Konad Black. I couldn&#x27;t see any of the metallic sparkles at all, it just looked matte. However, once I put a top coat of Seche Vite over it the black looked much darker &amp; shiny plus you could see the metallic sparkles again which added a certain something to the overall design.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have encountered besides the Metallic White color having multiple issues to work around, are the colors staining your fingernails. Using a good base coat (preferably one that has some opacity) helps protect your nails but if you still get staining try a second base coat. The staining issue can also stain the stamper &amp; make it difficult to completely clean off the stamping templates completely. Its especially a problem with the [[ASIN:B00CJIOG0Q Winstonia Stamper]] since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper. It helps to clean the plates with 100% acetone. You aren&#x27;t supposed to clean this type of stamper with any kind of polish remover, just sticky tape, but it helps a little to wash it with dishwashing soap &amp; water. (I had to prime mine with acetone then wash with soap to get it to work so I do use acetone to help clean the stains off of mine. It doesn&#x27;t remove all of the staining but stains don&#x27;t affect the quality of the stamping.)it helps a little to wash it with dishwashing soap &amp; water.

    <li> The colors are beautiful but the polish chips very easy.</li>
    <li> Love these colors. Leaves a bit of a stain if you use nail polish remover but stain doesn&#x27;t last long. Pretty minor. Other than that, Great product.</li>
    <li> I really love every single one...</li>
    <li> Ordered these on a Wednesday, and to my surprised, I received them on a Saturday (Prompt Delivery!) I&#x27;m very satisfied with these nail polishes because they come in full size, and that they polish is thick. You get your money worth; it&#x27;s good when you are in designing nails and stuff, Iike I do, and of course I haven&#x27;t gotten around that yet. The best thing about them is that you only need one coat! I will definetely be ordering again... I do recommend it. (with the picture attached, excuse the bumps on my thumb nail, I slept on it while it was still wet (Oooopz!))</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and exactly what is pictured. They&#x27;re beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these about two months ago. They shipped quickly and nothing was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this polish is that it does not last long at all. I&#x27;ve painted my nails with these polished about once a week since getting them and they&#x27;ve never lasted more than a day without getting huge chips. I&#x27;ve even used Orly rubberized basecoat and anti-chip topcoat. They helped extend it to a full day without chipping; that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve lost patience with these polishes and I won&#x27;t be using them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to wear your nail polish for a while without having to repaint it, I wouldn&#x27;t choose this product. This may be better for kids. I gave it three stars because the colors really are nice. I just wish they had lasted long.</li>
    <li> Got this and put it on the same day I got it. 5 days later hardly and chipping. Tried super fast and still looks really good. (Don&#x27;t mind my Alien looking hand)</li>
    <li> This set is as good as the neon.  It is more glittery than foil-like metallic but still beautiful.  Any color that you might want, with even more shiny metallic &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than any I have seen.  Good buy, good shipping;the vendor was quick and easy to reach when my package got damaged in the mail.</li>
    <li> (Katie G.)I purchased the nail polish for a bridal shower and they were a big hit. I had these for a favor. I added small pink nail file and tied them together with white ribbon. They&#x27;re nice vibrant colors everyone went crazy for them. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. I will definitely purchase these again :-)</li>
    <li> These colors are super vibrant! I&#x27;m a nail polish maniac and have tried solo many brands and have always been a fan of Kleancolor. The odor is so mild and these metallic colors are awesomely durable. I ran errands for six hours today and have been wearing them since last night with zero chipping. So pleased! The delivery was fast too!</li>
    <li> Fun colors.  Only last a couple days.</li>
    <li> I love the colors.  The brush is a bit rough and the polish is a bit thick which makes it a little challenging to apply at times.....but once you get it on and dry the colors are stunning and very glossy. Would recommend it&#x27;s a great deal for the price!!!</li>
    <li> lots of colors-gave it as a gift-she really loved it!!! Only complaint was that it would have been nice if it came in a gift set box, instead of just thrown into a package. Still worth it though!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in tact.</li>
    <li> packaging was ripped when it arrived but the polish looks nice and bright.</li>
    <li> Awesome love the colors!</li>
    <li> Great metallic colors.  Wears well and I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. She loves them. I saw the colors and they&#x27;re beautiful!</li>
    <li> package arrived quickly. the colors are beautiful and only takes one coat to shine. i would definitely recommend to others</li>
    <li> great deal really cool</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. Only takes one coat. Im very impressed :)</li>
