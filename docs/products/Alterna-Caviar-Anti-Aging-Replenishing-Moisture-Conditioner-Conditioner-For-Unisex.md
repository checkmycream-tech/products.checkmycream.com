      <li>Good product though.</li>
      <li>Sure, it smells great.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>At this price point, I reckon it best to try a different condish that leaves hair more luxuriously delicious than this.</li>
      <li>I love Alterna products!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Within days, my hair was transformed from frazzled to amazing.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells amazing</li>
      <li>The absolute best conditioner for my hair.</li>
      <li>have very fine, processed hair.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>I switched from Aveda to Alterna and use the Caviar and Bamboo shampoo and conditioners for about 8 months now, LOVE &#x27;EM.</li>
      <li>more moisturized and shiny, with no buildup.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite shampoo and conditioner EVER.</li>
      <li>but I still like Pureology products better.</li>
      <li>The price tag is in my head whenever I reach for the bottle, so I make sure to be frugal with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(actually, feels great!)</li>
      <li>Love my Caviar shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
      <li>Works well on many hair types.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light fresh scent is pleasant but not overpowering or cloying.</li>
      <li>This makes your hair so incredibly soft and smells very nice.</li>
      <li>I have not seen my hair this healthy and shiny since high school!!!</li>
      <li>Obviously, I feel the product is good</li>
      <li>I have tried many expensive brands and this one is the best!</li>
      <li>Now I can go a whole day between washings (huge for me) and my hair still looks pretty fresh and healthy.</li>
      <li>I have seen huge heath changes in my hair from the first time I used this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, point blank.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it to me.</li>
      <li>so i need a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
      <li>far as moisturizing benefits go, Caviar is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>(I actually had a travel set prior to this purchase) and can honestly say that I notice HUGE differences in my hair quality.</li>
      <li>If you have curly hair - this product really conditions and mosturizes!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re unsure, try a sample/travel set by Alterna first.</li>
      <li>and it does so much!</li>
      <li>I have (barely) shoulder length, fine hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really astonished by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>I have damaged hair from lightening and straightening it so much.</li>
      <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
      <li>He is very picky and loves this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Your hair stays soft and silky and very manageable between shampoos.</li>
      <li>You only have to use a thumb nail worth of product</li>
      <li>This is totally worth the extra money</li>
      <li>One of the striking results is that my hair is far less greasy in between washings than it has EVER been.</li>
      <li>Definitely makes my hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use it daily and have to make sure it is thoroughly rinsed out, but this way it keeps my hair soft without weighing it down much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair feel younger, if that makes sense.  </li>
      <li>But as many reviewers here have stated, if you&#x27;re careful with the amount you use, it should last you a long time.</li>
      <li>My main concerns prior to using Caviar: dryness, dullness, hair loss/thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and was pleased to see it at such a low price (half the local price).  </li>
      <li>Apparently, Alterna no longer makes the formula with the silver cap.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and your hair feels silky and smooth while your hair is wet.  </li>
      <li>My hair is also thin and fine</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have curly hair - this product really conditions and mosturizes!  I would recommend this for anyone with curly hair that frizzes.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but great stuff.</li>
    <li> I did not like how oily it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I will never buy any other conditioner after using this product just once!! I have not seen my hair this healthy and shiny since high school!!! And I am 35!! I have gray hair so I am forced to color every month which leaves it feeling dry and processed no matter what I have tried. This conditioner makes my hair look like I never have!!!! It&#x27;s AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I have seen huge heath changes in my hair from the first time I used this product. I have tried many expensive brands and this one is the best! I have damaged hair from lightening and straightening it so much. You only have to use a thumb nail worth of product and it does so much! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Within days, my hair was transformed from frazzled to amazing. It&#x27;s light fresh scent is pleasant but not overpowering or cloying. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, point blank. Problem?? It is VERY expensive, even at a bargain rate here on Amazon. But as many reviewers here have stated, if you&#x27;re careful with the amount you use, it should last you a long time. I have (barely) shoulder length, fine hair and I use a dime+ sized amount of product. The price tag is in my head whenever I reach for the bottle, so I make sure to be frugal with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, processed hair. My main concerns prior to using Caviar: dryness, dullness, hair loss/thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Caviar for a few weeks now (I actually had a travel set prior to this purchase) and can honestly say that I notice HUGE differences in my hair quality. One of the striking results is that my hair is far less greasy in between washings than it has EVER been. I typically have dry and greasy hair, which is a horrid combination. By the end of the day, my hair typically looks visibly greasy and oily despite a morning washing. Well, NOT now. Now I can go a whole day between washings (huge for me) and my hair still looks pretty fresh and healthy. I&#x27;m really astonished by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing benefits go, Caviar is FANTASTIC. It leaves your hair weightlessly and effortlessly moisturized. My hair never feels filmy or heavy as it does when I used other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though my pocket book is telling me NO, I can&#x27;t see myself changing to another hair routine now that I am using this one. This is totally worth the extra money and I just can&#x27;t get over how well it actually works. Buy with confidence. If you&#x27;re unsure, try a sample/travel set by Alterna first.</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal.</li>
    <li> I get perms every few months so my hair needs a good conditioner. My hair is also thin and fine so i need a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. This is the one that works for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner.  I am very happy with the performance of this conditioner.  Definitely makes my hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> For the price, this conditioner did not live up to my expectations. Sure, it smells great. But the fragrance does not last a long time after washing out and it&#x27;s pretty thin in consistency and not very moisturizing. At this price point, I reckon it best to try a different condish that leaves hair more luxuriously delicious than this.</li>
    <li> The absolute best conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement for same item purchased locally.  Obviously, I feel the product is good (actually, feels great!) and was pleased to see it at such a low price (half the local price).  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well on many hair types. I have long thin hair. I can&#x27;t use it daily and have to make sure it is thoroughly rinsed out, but this way it keeps my hair soft without weighing it down much.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has thick curly hair and sensitive scalp/ dandruff issues and this conditioner TRULY helps his scalp issues. He is very picky and loves this conditioner. He uses it daily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have coarse curly hair that is thinning a bit. This makes your hair so incredibly soft and smells very nice. Your hair stays soft and silky and very manageable between shampoos. Pricey but worth it to me. And a little goes a long way. It will last a while.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite shampoo and conditioner EVER.</li>
    <li> I like this product bc it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and your hair feels silky and smooth while your hair is wet.  It feels that way when it is dried.  Really makes your hair feel younger, if that makes sense.  I wish the price was a bit cheaper but what it states, it does. I have very, very long hair.  It is also highlighted.  It feels like I never put any chemicals on my hair.</li>
    <li> I give this one star simply because the item in the picture is not what I received.  Apparently, Alterna no longer makes the formula with the silver cap.  The picture needs to be changed, as it is false advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love Alterna products!  I switched from Aveda to Alterna and use the Caviar and Bamboo shampoo and conditioners for about 8 months now, LOVE &#x27;EM.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! My hair is colored and mostly grey at this point, this shampoo softens the texture. Great find!</li>
    <li> Love my Caviar shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> Needs new packaging too hard to get product out of bottle. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.  Good product though. Needs work.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells amazing but I still like Pureology products better. I expected more for the price.</li>
    <li> I can not comb my hair out after a couple of uses hate this and spent a lot of money on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent as always!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. For the money,  I haven&#x27;t found anything that leaves my curly/wavy hair more moisturized and shiny, with no buildup.</li>
