      <li>I had this fragrance many years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Keep it up guys :)</li>
      <li>In contrast, the drakkar noir I got at the same time purchased is perfect.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re already in your mid-twenties, this one gets better as you age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More something for yourself and your \\&quot;other\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It will turn heads because it&#x27;s memorable.</li>
      <li>My sweetheart loves this colgne and he has for years; In fact, it&#x27;s his favorite.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very unique.</li>
      <li>Its very unique and not for everyone.</li>
      <li>This has a nice, sweet smell to it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances, eucalyptus, incense, and benzoin--masculine and yet sweet!</li>
      <li>Its very sweet almost perfume.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I sprayed it did not smell good at all.  </li>
      <li>It really is that good</li>
      <li>Very smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>No that not justice it came very quickly and wrapped so there was no breakage.</li>
      <li>Can easily become someone&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
      <li>This cologne had a strong odor of baby powder to it after it settled .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, either.</li>
      <li>Though i&#x27;m sure there are people who like to smell sweet and powdery</li>
      <li>so you are in fine hands my friends.</li>
      <li>the fragrance will be fine.</li>
      <li>This is fine though.</li>
      <li>It has a creamy vannilic background with a bit of incense &amp; light woods.</li>
      <li>Its fabulous.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Homme is one of my top picks, so figured this&#x27;d be worth a try.</li>
      <li>It was a smooth purchase.</li>
      <li>If you wonder why and how Amazon can sell their fragrances so cheap, this is it--a lot of bottles have been sitting around for a while.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot!!!</li>
      <li>It smells like a cheap knockoff version of the original.</li>
      <li>no i&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
      <li>I used the original Kouros in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I was searching for some unique perfume for myself.(age -27)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>Just say &#x27;unique&#x27;&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Its soft, sexy, &amp; smooth!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent but is enough to give the confidence of smelling good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love switching btw this and Hanae Mori&#x27;s HM!! It can be for casual wear, clubing, or work. My GF slightly likes this more than HM, which is strange because I slightly like HM more than Body Kouros. lol    both are great though and complement each other. It has a eucalyptus, vanilla smell. Its very fresh!!     But I don&#x27;t think it last that long on me. The people I&#x27;m around smell it but the projection dies down after 3 hours. It become subtle then.    Wonderful, safe, and cheap blind buy. Very unique too!</li>
    <li> I love this fragance. But since a couple of years it is not available on airports duty-free shops. To find this perfum in online shops was a very nice surprise to me, and I&#x27;ve just bought five!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy everthing was exactly as they stated deliverd in a timely manner. No that not justice it came very quickly and wrapped so there was no breakage. Love it!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Somehow I stumbled into purchasing this cologne about 12 years ago. I literally have grandmothers walk up to me and ask me what I am wearing. Even guys will ask me. Awesome product. Keep it secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DL</li>
    <li> Sadly, this becoming more and more hard to find. Its very unique and not for everyone. So my suggestion is unless you know what this smells like already I wouldn&#x27;t just buy it</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay at best. L&#x27;Homme is one of my top picks, so figured this&#x27;d be worth a try. Very powdery dry down. This is a somewhat pleasant but unremarkable scent. Much too powdery for my tastes. Lasts and projects well.</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it was a total fake. Not even the same smell. Ive been using this same perfume for 12 years now. I guess it has to do with the bottle as the one i usually buy is that of the removable cap.</li>
    <li> mmm! I smelled this on my friend and had to ask him to loan it to my husband! yummmmmmm!  And then I had to buy it for my hubs. It&#x27;s a very sexy and inviting scent. mmmmm!</li>
    <li> great scent. Cant go wrong with YSL!!!</li>
    <li> FAKE !! FAKE !! FAKE !!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this perfume since 1997&lt;br /&gt;and I know how it smells like !!&lt;br /&gt;this one smells very diffrent !! so bad&lt;br /&gt;its a waste of money</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Super Excellent service the item arrived so fast I literally thought they shipped it from next door. A+++++++++</li>
    <li> I typically only purchase the original Kouros but took a chance on the Body version.  I think the fragrance is great and it is just enough to be different from the original yet with some of the same quality aromas.</li>
    <li> The smell is gone 15 minutes after spraying, I have purchased this item before and never had trouble with it until now</li>
    <li> It took me a while to know about this spray. It leaves a very soothing remark on your mind and you love it... not a strong perfume but a light flavor which lasts for long. Worth spending money for it.</li>
    <li> Product according to purchased. Recommend it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time or even earlier. Well I recommend, met my expectations.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this since we met. It is an absolutely irresistible, unique smell. Just give it a shot. I&#x27;m not sure what the reviewer who mentioned coconut was experiencing, but coconut is not at all what I notice from this fragrance. It&#x27;s sweet, woody, and a little bit spicy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is great will update with longevity this weekend</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast delivery. Product is amazing &amp; I am very happy with it. I recommend [[ASIN:B000C1W6YA Kouros Body By Yves Saint Laurent For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]to wear it for the evening get-togethers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for 20 yrs.  Nothing comes close to it!  Nothing but compliments from everyone!  Keep sending it! LOL!</li>
    <li> The scent is very unique. I&#x27;ve received many compliments regarding this cologne. It can be used universally for men or women.</li>
    <li> After spending 30 years trying different men&#x27;s fragrances, this one stands out a mile. Now, I won&#x27;t buy any other. My wife bought me the first one, and (for once) she was right. Better still than the spray is the no-messing aftershave bottle version, but that&#x27;s becoming hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents ever... My ladies love it and I never get tired of smelling it..</li>
    <li> I used the original Kouros in the 80&#x27;s. I was hoping that this would be a modern version so I did a cold buy. On first spray I was turned off. It smells like a cheap knockoff version of the original. Like powder from the 70&#x27;s if any of you remember called Talcum powder which my barber used to use for me. An absolute waste of money for me, I would suggest don&#x27;t do a cold buy but smell it first. I couldn&#x27;t wait to rub the stuff off my body!</li>
    <li> This sets you a part. I couldn&#x27;t get through the day without being asked what cologne I was wearing. This captures the aroma strength and sensuality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A good and long lasting scent. I like the way the scent lingers throughout the day. It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent but is enough to give the confidence of smelling good.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the original one seems like fake to me</li>
    <li> It is sad people write \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; when in reality it is paid employees write luring sentences about stuff they sell. I have been using YSL products for a while and then came across this. First day it lingered. My friends said I smelled like a father. a good one. I let my friend use it. His wife also had similar comments. It might be a good one, for gentlemen over 65.</li>
    <li> I bought a number of different colognes while experimenting for my scent. This is the one. My girlfriend absolutely drools after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spritz my neck and my wrists and that&#x27;s enough. It lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all colognes, I&#x27;d recommend experimenting on your skin because it will interact your own scent differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But YSL is a quality house, so give it a try.</li>
    <li> Super buy. Smells very good and the price is incredible low for the product.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  It smells like new tires.  The notes for this product is the same as the original Kouros but this product was either deffective or too old or there&#x27;s something weird about it.  I have no idea what to do with it.  I can&#x27;t even return it because it is not returnable.  I fell in love with the Kouros fraicheur but this one is worst than stetson after shave from dollar stores.</li>
    <li> Too sweet too powdery, I like to smell sweet spicy and earthy. I figured this would have been along those lines but alas no i&#x27;m disappointed. Though i&#x27;m sure there are people who like to smell sweet and powdery it&#x27;s not for me</li>
    <li> Looooooove this product.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  Very smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Still getting to know it, but totally different that the regular &amp;#34;Kouros&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years. It&#x27;s one of my favorites, and comes with a very cheap price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This has always been a good scent and still is!</li>
    <li> Had this stuff a number of years ago...found the empty and decided to buy again...if you&#x27;re looking for a light smelling cologne this is it... Similar to mugler...</li>
    <li> I have had this cologne since 2000 and it is simply amazing.. Its not well known which makes me happy because I smell unique within a crowd.. Great price... came quickly... I will be buying this over and over..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a soft sweet smell.. that isn&#x27;t overpowering like some colognes are.. you can even spray a few more like shirt neck arms.. and it won&#x27;t stink you out of a room.. Over time it is just a nice subtle scent that when you hug a woman she will sniff you telling you how good you smell.. Yes.. It really is that good</li>
    <li> It does remind me of LeMale and Lolita. Has good projection and longevity.</li>
    <li> This has a nice, sweet smell to it. It&#x27;s not too strong, either.</li>
    <li> Very good.. Thanks a lot!!!</li>
    <li> A wonder mix of feminine roundness (Benzoin/Vanilla) and masculine edge (medicinal Eucalyptus and cedar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compliments from both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy again once I run out!</li>
    <li> Re: Body Kouros, either they sell a bogus product at amazon or all the other reviewers are lying.  This only qualifies as a room freshener and that too a bathroom freshner.  The base smells like coconut oil.  No matter how much I sprayed it did not smell good at all.  At best it smells like a melon scented candle.  In contrast, the drakkar noir I got at the same time purchased is perfect.  If you want to buy body kouros test it out someplace first.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent and so does my wife. i have even had the PYT&#x27;s compliment me on it, and it really lasts!</li>
    <li> Far from the beast that is it&#x27;s older hairy chested brother KOUROS (just had to put that in caps). It&#x27;s good, unfortunately i got the reformulated bottle so i have no idea what the vintage stuff is like; i assume similar based on descriptives i&#x27;ve read. What&#x27;s this like? Ummm... Vanilla and Eucalyptus(ever had that in your shaving cream? Yeah that&#x27;s it) It doesn&#x27;t blow me away, longevity is fairly poor at about 4 hours and projection just about an hour until it dies right down onto the skin and the calm vanilla really melds well with the medicinal powerful eucalyptus in the opening.&lt;br /&gt;This is perhaps a much better offering for those timid as well as those disgusted by KOUROS... i can&#x27;t find a reason to hate it, its just alright. Best use? I&#x27;ll say before bed; there&#x27;s something soothing and calming about the composition of this one for me.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s smell good at the first time use but not hold so long</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances, eucalyptus, incense, and benzoin--masculine and yet sweet! It is a truly YSL, great longevity and moderate silage, which is a great combination if you are looking for something that is distinct but not overpowering, this would be a good candidate. Priced around $30, this is not a bad buy at all. There is a girl who works in my office who loves to hug me when I wear Body Kouros--this one has probably gotten me the most compliments!</li>
    <li> I was searching for some unique perfume for myself.(age -27)&lt;br /&gt;In this quest I got several big names in my closet  - Armani code ultimate (not impressed) , green Irish tweed Creed (not impressed), 1 Million (nice) ,silver mountain water( ok).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using all these randomly and now after few weeks seems like I wear body kouros much more than others.&lt;br /&gt;Its unique and its balanced as compared to other ones in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I am liking it very much.</li>
    <li> Love this scent on my man!!! YSL discontinued so glad I found on this site!!!</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he loved it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the smell. Its very sweet almost perfume. Not manly scent at all.  Other YSL cologne i have i love.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne after reading it on a message board of good colognes. My girlfriend loves it and I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments from the ladies in my dorm. They say, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never smelled this before...very unique&amp;#34;. And then I say &amp;#34;Thanks, but you don&#x27;t have to say the word &#x27;very&#x27; before unique. It&#x27;s unnecessary. Just say &#x27;unique&#x27;&amp;#34;. And then they say &amp;#34;WOW YOU ARE A JERK&amp;#34; And then I say &amp;#34;Yeah, but I smell great&amp;#34;. Then they say &amp;#34;True.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars</li>
    <li> Smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite as good as the one in the white, but it still gets me compliments.</li>
    <li> I used this scent years ago and bringing it back now brings along a whole bunch of good memories too. The best part though is that its still an awesome fragrance! For sure I thought my tastes would change in more than a decade, but I guess this is actually a timeless piece of work ))&lt;br /&gt;Never picked up much incense in this scent and still don&#x27;t. Just some soothing eucalyptus and sweet vanilla/benzoin with a quality cedar base. Very happy I re-introduced this back to my collection.</li>
    <li> My sweetheart loves this colgne and he has for years; In fact, it&#x27;s his favorite.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s no longer being produced so finding it on Amazon has been a delight.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent on him. It&#x27;s a classic scent and very sexy, yet soft. As long as we can continue to find it at Amazon we&#x27;ll be in pretty good shape. The cologne was shipped on time as promised.  It was a smooth purchase. I&#x27;m sure  I&#x27;ll be making another purchase at Amazon as long as we can continue to find it.</li>
    <li> This cologne had a strong odor of baby powder to it after it settled . I did not expect that . I will keep it regardless because even that does not smell that bad, I just thought that it would be something different . Will not order this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. Perfume snobs say it&#x27;s only for fall &amp; winter. Personally, I think you can pull this off anytime. Though in the evening, it&#x27;s scrumptious. An absolute delight. Not a clubbing scent. More something for yourself and your \\&quot;other\\&quot;. Not cloying either. It will turn heads because it&#x27;s memorable. Can easily become someone&#x27;s signature scent. Not for old people either. If you&#x27;re already in your mid-twenties, this one gets better as you age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: A fragrance, typically, has a shelf-life of ~36 months. The bottle I received is from 2011 (just 1 month shy of the expected shelf life expiration date). Oh well. If you wonder why and how Amazon can sell their fragrances so cheap, this is it--a lot of bottles have been sitting around for a while. This is fine though. As long as it&#x27;s in a dark &amp; cool place (warehouses usually are) the fragrance will be fine. It will last. Just in case: always use a cosmetic calculator and check your batch codes!!!</li>
    <li> wonderful product,thank you!</li>
    <li> bought this for my boyfriend. lets jus say he smells awesome :). i recommend this scent for any guy. you would jus wanna small on him all day</li>
    <li> Bought this from \\&quot;Amazon.com LLC\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my favourite perfume for almost 15 years now.&lt;br /&gt;All these years using this perfume, i have been getting ONLY positive comments from all spectrum of ages.&lt;br /&gt;I have used 20 or so perfumes over the years, but my nose LOVES this one, so this is my default &#x27;to go&#x27; perfume! I hope it never goes out of production! Thanks YSL for such a great perfume.</li>
    <li> I have recently started collecting fragrance again which is quite addictive I must say...anyways Body Kouros is a beautiful fragrance. Its soft, sexy, &amp; smooth! The eucalyptus note is very light. It has a creamy vannilic background with a bit of incense &amp; light woods. Annick Menardo is the Parfumier behind this one. She also did Hugo Boss Bottled,, Bvlgari Black, Lolita Au Masculin among others so you are in fine hands my friends. Enough rambling... Its fabulous. Buy it! :-)</li>
    <li> Am actually wowed by your services...Keep it up guys :)&lt;br /&gt;Your customer care services is also amazing...Brent was very professional with me last time, and I appreciate that a lot!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy YSL products and Body Kouros is great, I am glad my wife likes it also. This is a great choice ladies and gents.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this and just love it. The longevity is great. I highly recommend it if your into oriental spice scents.</li>
    <li> I had this fragrance many years ago and fell in love with it. It definitely brings back memories.</li>
    <li> Love...love...love the sensuality of this cologne....love it when my husband wears it...best price ever....thanks amazon...is very difficult to find this fragance sometimes...</li>
    <li> Being a fan of Atelier, Creed and some other high end cologne brands, this cologne smells good but nothing I&#x27;d wear on a date! Maybe if I was a doctor or Dentist for a everyday cologne! Lol</li>
    <li> I have worn this since it came out.  I get soooo many compliments on this fragrance!</li>
