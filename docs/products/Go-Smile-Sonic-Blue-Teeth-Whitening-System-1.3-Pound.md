### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Now again, this is me, some may think it&#x27;s the best in the world for teeth cleaning as well.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product and customer service.</li>
      <li>Great product!!!!</li>
      <li>It a very good toothbrush</li>
      <li>To begin, the brush is great.</li>
      <li>I read an article about how great it was and thought.....</li>
      <li>whitening has been great as well</li>
      <li>and had great results.  </li>
      <li>: Seems to be doing a GREAT job at whitening teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Seems to be doing a GREAT job at whitening teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She says it works great</li>
      <li>this was a great buy for this product.</li>
      <li>This system is amazing!</li>
      <li>and see a remarkable difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is one AWESOME product that really does kill bacteria and whiten teeth as you brush!!!  </li>
      <li>However, what was more surprising is the plaque control I am experiencing.  </li>
      <li>Besides, if this unit is as effective for whitening teeth as it seems to be, I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it on a continuous basis, thereby over-whitening my teeth.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to work better.</li>
      <li>first of all is a great brush and sturdy in your hand even if I’m not using the gel I have liked the electric brush</li>
      <li>Gave it to my Husband for Christmas, he&#x27;s very happy with it and has informed me he will be giving one to me for my next Birthday</li>
      <li>I like the sonicare toothbrush better.</li>
      <li>I have been a coffee/tea drinker for many years and was hoping I would see a difference.</li>
      <li>especially happy with the changes I’m seeing in my lower teeth – which have always remained a good 5 shades darker than my upper teeth (on the GO SMiLE shade chart  provided).  </li>
      <li>I am seeing whiting of my teeth and pleased with the progress.  </li>
      <li>So far it seems great.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, if it whitens as good as it seems to be doing, and holds up for a decent amount of time, I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I’m finding the GO SMiLE system is great at whitening all sides of my teeth unlike strips which focus on the outside front teeth.  </li>
      <li>Makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s primary job as promised, but for me, it&#x27;s not an effective toothbrush for general teeth cleaning and plaque.</li>
      <li>I found it to be much more gentle on the teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>Still, I think for the high price of this unit, I should mention this one, very important point.</li>
      <li>Prior I was using another Electric Toothbrush as I found that one to be the best for removal of plaque vs. prior electric toothbrushes used over the years.  </li>
      <li>I will be a loyal customer for life because of these two reasons.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product to others and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>So again, it&#x27;s been only a few days of use, I have no idea of its longevity, but it does seem to do a really good job for teeth whitening, not so great for teeth cleaning.</li>
      <li>Oh WOW!!!!!  </li>
      <li>The Sonic Blue toothbrush is amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Go Smile system for about two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Go Smile electric brush</li>
      <li>Is it worth the price?</li>
      <li>It made my whole mouth feel clean and the whiting gel that comes with works as well.</li>
      <li>I especially like that this toothbrush has a&lt;br /&gt;setting for sensitive teeth, although the regular setting is great too!  </li>
      <li>I’ve been using the Go Smile system for just over a week, and started noticing a change in my teeth after the first use.</li>
      <li>It seems to do a thorough job, has nice weight/balance, settings for regular or gentle brushing, and quadrant timers.</li>
      <li>I purchased this last December, had it for 7 months and it already has to be replaced and on top of the shirt life span it never changed the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I experience better results later on</li>
      <li>While it may not for me have been in the first day or two, after a week there is a noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>They will never be bright white, and I&#x27;m only using it once a day, but.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t misunderstand - it of course, does clean my teeth; I just don&#x27;t think it does so nearly as well as the Soncare.</li>
      <li>I just got it but find it easy to use and will report back on how well it works for me.</li>
      <li>Results appear to be slower than advertised, brush heads seem to be a bit large.  </li>
      <li>but I am not noticing much difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>fast deliver--good product</li>
      <li>It’s good to have a way to keep teeth consistently white without sharp changes every 6 months with the use of strips as I was doing before.  </li>
      <li>It seems to me that the combination of the toothpastes and the sonic movements are preventing plaque buildup better than any other toothbrush I have used.  </li>
      <li>My teeth definitely feel more clean and less plaque.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very light weight, to the point that it feels cheap and poor quality.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good electric toothbrush, but it took a little getting used to because the brush head is larger than the brush head of the sonicare toothbrush that I had been using.  </li>
      <li>: Have no idea yet as to its longevity.ng, and holds up for a decent amount of time, I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used other sonic brushes, in the past but the Sonic Blue is the best.</li>
      <li>The brush seems to clean well enough for an electric toothbrush but the whitening system so far is a no-go.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this unit for whitening first, then use my Sonicare for general brushing.</li>
      <li>Smile Sonic Blue Teeth Whitening</li>
      <li>– I changed toothbrushes and now I apply 2 gels – my regular toothpaste and the GO SMiLE Teeth Whitening Gel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the, Go Smile System for only four days, and I believe it is already whitening my teeth, and quite well.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, unless something is truly bad or truly good.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is old news.</li>
      <li>maintains treatments with strips and professional cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I can see some brightening of my 66 year old teeth.</li>
      <li>i am really hoping for the the white teeth</li>
      <li>System\\&quot;, and have a Sonicare (or an Oral-B), DO NOT get rid of your old electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, seems to not have a very powerful motor, for me, not such a great ergonomic design for general teeth cleaning, especially behind the teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lightweight, seems to not have a very powerful motor, for me, not such a great ergonomic design for general teeth cleaning, especially behind the teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The toothbrush works extremely well, better than other electric&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thank you GO SMILE for your quick response and resolution to my broken brush head.</li>
      <li>The only thing to happen after a week is my teeth are now very sensitive and so are my gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised how lightweight the unit is, not flimsy, but also it&#x27;s not a hefty unit, it certainly does not have the power, nor the design ergonomics of a Sonicare, especially for cleaning behind the teeth (where tooth destroying plaque builds up the most).</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new and different from other tooth whitening systems</li>

<li> The bristles are extremely stiff (even though I tried running it under hot water as suggested by another review) and the outer rim of non-moving rubber bristles are irritating to my gums.  </li>
<li> And with the Sonic Blue Toothbrush, there seems to be less foaming and therefore less accidental drooling onto my shirt!</li>

<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the brush head can be tough to remove.</li>
<li> I could see an improvement after one use, and with regular use it keeps my teeth whiter than the dentist&#x27;s awkward trays and stuff.</li>

    <li> I’m finding the GO SMiLE system is great at whitening all sides of my teeth unlike strips which focus on the outside front teeth.  And it’s been a simple tiny adjustment to my routine – I changed toothbrushes and now I apply 2 gels – my regular toothpaste and the GO SMiLE Teeth Whitening Gel.  How easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I had never used an electric toothbrush previously, I had some adjustment, but have already found my gums are less prone to bleeding when flossing.  I think it might even help reduce a ‘deep pocket’ I have behind a lower back molar with the action of the Sonic Blue Toothbrush  working from all sides.  I moved shelves in my medicine cabinet to allow storing the charging station and standing toothbrush – I plug it in one night a week (I probably could go 2 weeks) and my bathroom countertop remains uncluttered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m especially happy with the changes I’m seeing in my lower teeth – which have always remained a good 5 shades darker than my upper teeth (on the GO SMiLE shade chart  provided).  Try the system and see for yourself!  It’s good to have a way to keep teeth consistently white without sharp changes every 6 months with the use of strips as I was doing before.  And with the Sonic Blue Toothbrush, there seems to be less foaming and therefore less accidental drooling onto my shirt!</li>
    <li> Twice the benefit, I have been using this toothbrush and whitener for&lt;br /&gt;about 3 weeks and see a remarkable difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works extremely well, better than other electric&lt;br /&gt;toothbrushes I have tried.  My last dentist visit a week ago was extremely&lt;br /&gt;quick and had great results.  I especially like that this toothbrush has a&lt;br /&gt;setting for sensitive teeth, although the regular setting is great too!  I&lt;br /&gt;think this was a great buy for this product.</li>
    <li> maintains treatments with strips and professional cleaning.  wouldn&#x27;t say it gets my teeth whiter but it does keep them whiter longer after other treatments.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my Husband for Christmas, he&#x27;s very happy with it and has informed me he will be giving one to me for my next Birthday</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks. I like the way it cleans my teeth but I am not noticing much difference in the color of my teeth. I have been a coffee/tea drinker for many years and was hoping I would see a difference. I am using it as instructed and will continue using the product and hope I see some difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I think it is a bit expensive for an electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, unless something is truly bad or truly good. This system is amazing! To begin, the brush is great. It seems to do a thorough job, has nice weight/balance, settings for regular or gentle brushing, and quadrant timers. Makes my teeth feel really clean. And, when used with their whitening gel, it makes a noticible difference in whitening teeth. I could see an improvement after one use, and with regular use it keeps my teeth whiter than the dentist&#x27;s awkward trays and stuff. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I can see some brightening of my 66 year old teeth. They will never be bright white, and I&#x27;m only using it once a day, but. I do see a difference.  I realize that the special toothpaste is expensive and not available at your local drugstore, so that may factor into my once-a-day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m retired, with nothing but time to experiment with whiteners, so will continue with this until the tube is gone, then decide.</li>
    <li> I did not see an obvious change , I really disappointed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference... I could&#x27;ve went with the 4 dollar drug store electric brush and gotten the same results.</li>
    <li> I am not using it long yet, the head is bit large (may be problem for small mouth). i am really hoping for the the white teeth</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed.  The light never worked, useless.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just awful!  The head is so large that I can&#x27;t reach parts of my back teeth and brushing the back side of my front teeth is nearly impossible.  The bristles are extremely stiff (even though I tried running it under hot water as suggested by another review) and the outer rim of non-moving rubber bristles are irritating to my gums.  I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for years and this sonic toothbrush by GoSmile pales in comparison. It is very light weight, to the point that it feels cheap and poor quality.  Unfortunately I also have seen no change in the whiteness of my teeth and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do after I use my Sonicare.  Unfortunately I will be returning this disappointing product...</li>
    <li> Oh WOW!!!!!  This is one AWESOME product that really does kill bacteria and whiten teeth as you brush!!!  I read an article about how great it was and thought.....we&#x27;ll see.  The article was correct!!!  Whether you have dental problems (like me) or not, this is the toothbrush to have.  I found it to be much more gentle on the teeth and gums.  Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> She says it works great it was a present</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and see zero difference in my tooth whiteness. The brush seems to clean well enough for an electric toothbrush but the whitening system so far is a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I experience better results later on I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new and different from other tooth whitening systems and I could never use the mouth piece system so I thought I would try this product.  The Go Smile electric brush first of all is a great brush and sturdy in your hand even if I’m not using the gel I have liked the electric brush and it doesn’t rattle my teeth when brushing.  My teeth definitely feel more clean and less plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening has been great as well I started noticing a difference in just a few days.  Looking forward to seeing the results over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> The Sonic Blue toothbrush is amazing. I have been using this toothbrush for over three weeks now. It has made my teeth feel like they have been cleaned by the dentist. There are 2 settings to accommodate if you have any sensitivity.  It made my whole mouth feel clean and the whiting gel that comes with works as well. I drink a lot of coffee and my wife noticed that my teeth were not as yellow from the effects of the coffee.  The toothbrush runs for 2 minutes at a time and lets you know every 30 seconds.  The toothbrush comes with a charger and two additional replacement brushes. I have used other sonic brushes, in the past but the Sonic Blue is the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Go Smile system for about two weeks.  Prior I was using another Electric Toothbrush as I found that one to be the best for removal of plaque vs. prior electric toothbrushes used over the years.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I am seeing whiting of my teeth and pleased with the progress.  While it may not for me have been in the first day or two, after a week there is a noticeable difference.  However, what was more surprising is the plaque control I am experiencing.  It seems to me that the combination of the toothpastes and the sonic movements are preventing plaque buildup better than any other toothbrush I have used.  I definitely recommend this product to others and have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> not much change in whitening teeth.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and customer service. I will be a loyal customer for life because of these two reasons. Also the products work, my dentist said my teeth are too white! So I alternate with a regular sonicare brush. Thank you GO SMILE for your quick response and resolution to my broken brush head. My only complaint is that the brush head can be tough to remove.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is old news. Still, I think for the high price of this unit, I should mention this one, very important point. Mind you, this is subjective; what I like, someone else may not, and vice versa. But this is how I see this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to purchase a, \\&quot;Go Smile Sonic Blue Teeth Whitening System\\&quot;, and have a Sonicare (or an Oral-B), DO NOT get rid of your old electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using the, Go Smile System for only four days, and I believe it is already whitening my teeth, and quite well.  So I do believe it does it&#x27;s primary job as promised, but for me, it&#x27;s not an effective toothbrush for general teeth cleaning and plaque. Don&#x27;t misunderstand - it of course, does clean my teeth; I just don&#x27;t think it does so nearly as well as the Soncare. I&#x27;m surprised how lightweight the unit is, not flimsy, but also it&#x27;s not a hefty unit, it certainly does not have the power, nor the design ergonomics of a Sonicare, especially for cleaning behind the teeth (where tooth destroying plaque builds up the most). Now again, this is me, some may think it&#x27;s the best in the world for teeth cleaning as well. I&#x27;m just saying, this is my personal take on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution: I keep both brushes on my bathroom counter. I use this unit for whitening first, then use my Sonicare for general brushing. If I hadn&#x27;t a Sonicare, I&#x27;d probably still opt to brush my teeth afterwards with an old-fashioned toothbrush.  Besides, if this unit is as effective for whitening teeth as it seems to be, I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it on a continuous basis, thereby over-whitening my teeth. Perhaps this unit was never meant to be one&#x27;s everyday toothbrush, but to be used only when whitening. (Just a guess.)  So again, it&#x27;s been only a few days of use, I have no idea of its longevity, but it does seem to do a really good job for teeth whitening, not so great for teeth cleaning. Is it worth the price? In my opinion, if it whitens as good as it seems to be doing, and holds up for a decent amount of time, I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Seems to be doing a GREAT job at whitening teeth.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Lightweight, seems to not have a very powerful motor, for me, not such a great ergonomic design for general teeth cleaning, especially behind the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;TBD: Have no idea yet as to its longevity.ng, and holds up for a decent amount of time, I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Seems to be doing a GREAT job at whitening teeth.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Lightweight, seems to not have a very powerful motor, for me, not such a great ergonomic design for general teeth cleaning, especially behind the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;TBD: Have no idea yet as to its longevity.</li>
    <li> fast deliver--good product</li>
    <li> I have tried this for over a week and still no progress on whiter teeth.  The only thing to happen after a week is my teeth are now very sensitive and so are my gums.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> So far it seems great.  I just got it but find it easy to use and will report back on how well it works for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last December, had it for 7 months and it already has to be replaced and on top of the shirt life span it never changed the whiteness of my teeth. It&#x27;s a scam.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the Go Smile system for just over a week, and started noticing a change in my teeth after the first use. I’m three shades WHITER already! The head of the brush is a bit big for my mouth, and I’ve noticed slight tooth sensitivity with the gel, but the immediate teeth whitening far outweighs the difference in the toothbrush size.</li>
    <li> Results appear to be slower than advertised, brush heads seem to be a bit large.  It a very good toothbrush and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product worked about as well as strips. I would have liked to work better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good electric toothbrush, but it took a little getting used to because the brush head is larger than the brush head of the sonicare toothbrush that I had been using.  I have followed the directions and have brushed with it two times a day since the end of December. My teeth don&#x27;t appear to be any whiter.  I&#x27;m disappointed. I like the sonicare toothbrush better.</li>
