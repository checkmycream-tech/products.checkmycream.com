<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay too sharp long. Never had another so I can&#x27;t compare. Didn&#x27;t think it stayed sharp long.... Other than that, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked ok for a while, but then quit working.  A new battery did not help.  I would recommend finding another brand.</li>
    <li> Only had a chance to use it one time.  Seems to work well and cuts the hair pretty close . I would recommend this trimmer</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding trimmer! It trims even the really fine hairs around your nose and ears and it doesn&#x27;t bite your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this just a couple times, it suddenly stopped working. A new battery did no good. Upset, I first inquired about exchanging through Amazon for a new one, but they were out of stock. I was offered a refund - including shipping charges - but I decided to write Mangroomer first to see what they had to say and that&#x27;s where this becomes a very happy story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They responded to my email within three hours and they requested a digital photo of the product, a detailed explanation of the problem and my order number from their website. Order number? Uh, oh. I didn&#x27;t buy it from them, so all I had was my Amazon invoice, a photo of which I sent them along with the other information they&#x27;d requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They again responded very quickly, apologized for the issue and asked for my mailing address because they were sending me TWO new trimmers to replace the bad one and I did not need to send the bad one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacements arrived two days later and while I&#x27;ve only used one of them, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems at all after a few weeks of use. I am extremely impressed when a company stands behind its product this strongly and be assured they won a life long customer with their handling of this situation.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for about two months and it works well enough but it sometimes turns on, sometimes not. I think the switch is starting to go. I would be wary of purchasing one. I&#x27;m hoping this is not just another piece of Chinese junk.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st battery operated nose/ear hair trimmer. From what I read here this was a good product for the money. And it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair someone said. Well I agree for the most part. The only time it pulled my nose hair is when I had some weak batteries in it. So my advice to keep this little thing humming is to not let the batteries get to weak or you might get a not so pleasant wake up call. Ha! Ha!</li>
    <li> This product worked ok, not great. Then it broke after about 6 months of occasional use :-(     I suggest trying a different brand, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
    <li> A nose and ear hair trimmer becomes more essential the older a guy gets. I&#x27;ve owned a few, including a Panasonic and a Sharper Image. This is the first one I&#x27;ve had that actually performs its intended job. The Panasonic did a mediocre trim job that left me finishing up with scissors, and it devoured batteries. The Sharper Image was totally useless. It made noise and appeared to be running, but did not trim nose hair. This one is a great tool. It leaves my nose and ears as clean as a whistle, the motor is strong and steady, it&#x27;s sturdily constructed, and you can rinse it under the faucet. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.    This is the real deal: a good nose and ear hair trimmer.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to trim your sideburns or other manscaping chores, I&#x27;d recommend the Wahl 5537N.  Ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for something to trim your eyebrows or upper lip, keep moving.  This baby&#x27;s optimized for one job: taming the jungle sprouting out the caves in a man&#x27;s head.    The business end of a good nose and ear hair trimmer is shaped like the top of a domed bird cage.  To be effective, the spinning blades have to cut on both the sides and top of the dome. (The top of the dome being the end of the trimmer you stick in your nose or ear.)  I&#x27;ve had several trimmers that cost 1/3 less and worked 1/100th as well.   I&#x27;m just throwing away a Remington model NE-300 because it only cuts on the sides, not the top.    The Mangroomer mows down the hedges like crazy.  Completely painless; no cuts or pinching.  Sure it could stand a little more power, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want the additional battery weight.  Easy to clean, just rinse the blades and head in water.    As delivered, this model gets the job done right for me.    As always: YMMV.</li>
    <li> Probably the thing that I miss most about Sharper Image is their efficient nose hair trimmer.  My SI trimmer finally bit the dust, and I made the mistake of buying this unit.  So very weak in comparison.  I don&#x27;t think that this thing could cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay sway.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely manner.  Quality of product was good.  Product performed well in the purpose that it was ordered for. Thanks</li>
    <li> Mine lasted about two weeks then died. it worked fine in the beginning, it didn&#x27;t cost much and it ain&#x27;t worth much</li>
    <li> I bought this nose trimmer based on it&#x27;s reviews even though I was a bit skeptical of the product considering it bears the name \\&quot;mangroomer\\&quot; on it. My first impression was that the packaging was pretty unimpressive. My initial thoughts after removing the trimmer from the package was that this thing had to have been made in some factory over seas, and it very well might have been. Nothing on this trimmer feels solid or like it was quality built. After putting a battery in it and giving it a try, I have to say I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Like many other reviews has stated, this trimmer does not pull your hair and their is absolutely no pain when using it. It takes a few passes to fully cut the hair, and I do wish that it would cut a little closer, but something has to give if you don&#x27;t want to risk a bloody and sore nose. I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this product, but for $11, I&#x27;d be satisfied if it only lasted for 6 months. If you are looking for a pain-free nose hair trimmer that produces acceptable results and wont cost you $20-30 like many other units, you should be as satisfied with your purchase as I am!</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my original purchase. Mangroomer sales department contacted me immediately and are in the process of sending me a replacement unit. Thanks for listening to your customers!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. As men age we grow hair in places where we don&#x27;t need it. I say trim that hair away! I picked these up on Amazon and they work well. They travel well and a battery will last for a long time. The top does seem to come off magically and of its own accord in my shaving kit. That being said I would still strongly recommend these to a hairy friend.</li>
    <li> This is a good nose trimmer, and excellent quality.  I have had it for 2 years now and no problems.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was a very pleasant surprise.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and does an very good job of getting those pesky and annoying ear and nose hairs.  It&#x27;s compact, well designed, and cuts hairs very crisply with no pulling.  Takes one AA battery, and you can do a complete trim in about a minute.  Noise level and vibration are not issues. Uncap, switch on, cut hairs, turn off, blow away the hairs, recap, and you&#x27;re done.  Cutting head is small and round and fits in an ear very comfortably.  Inexpensive too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this face reamer.</li>
    <li> very good product. wonder y this product doesn&#x27;t run on Duracell AA battery. but it runs on the normal AA battery.</li>
    <li> Broke way too easily, sometimes doesnt start when you out in a fully charged battery. just get a reasonably priced panasonic or remington brand trimmer, should be more than enough for you.</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!!!  its does exactly what its suppose to do .... no pain involved!!  But my husband and i both don&#x27;t like the way our nose feels afterward. The trimmer can trim the hair down to the skin inside the nostril and it just feels weird as they grow back haha.  Maybe we&#x27;ll just have to ease up a bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for trimming minor nose hair.  While it works, it tickles my nose and seems to irritate my skin.  Each time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve experienced some discomfort and extra sensitivity in the skin just inside my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for construction, this thing seems about as durable as a magic marker: very cheap.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t last, but I wouldn&#x27;t drop it too many times!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago after forgetting to bring along my Panasonic trimmer.  After reading a few reviews here, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m glad I did.  The trimmer has a stronger motor, and spins faster that the other. So much so that you can use it for such things as eyebrows.  Also, the battery seems to last longer.  Given the choice again, I&#x27;d choose the Mangroomer every time.</li>
    <li> I bought the Man Groomer Ear and Nose Hair Trimmer for $15 and it&#x27;s a great little grooming tool.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m getting older but I&#x27;m growing hair in places that don&#x27;t look too cool (ears and nose).  I&#x27;ve been snipping away with scissors but could not seem to do a decent job.  The Man Groomer buzzes off those wierd hairs coming out of my nose without damaging the delicate tissue inside the nostrils. Does a nice job on and in my ears too.  Anyway, two thumbs up for this product, only $15 and does a great job.  You&#x27;ll only regret you didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
    <li> My dad is 96 yrs old.  He is practically bald but has an unbelieveable amount of hair in his nose and ears!  LOL   I bought another brand of ear and nose hair trimmer (rechargeable) and it was worthless.  It would crank away but make little progress.  I looked at reviews of the ManGroomer Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer and decided to order it.  I just used it yesterday and finally got all the hair out of my dad&#x27;s ears!   Maybe his hearing aids will work better now!</li>
    <li> no pain at all on this guy.  takes maybe a minute or so per nostril (mine aren&#x27;t particularly hair packed but there are a few annoying stragglers) and i haven&#x27;t tried it on my ears as i don&#x27;t have any ear hair yet.    cleaning this was real easy and the entire product is pretty sleek.  definitely doesn&#x27;t have an embarrassing appearance.    highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I thought by the reviews and my first few uses I finally found a decent nose/ear hair trimmer. It seemed to work well. Well it stopped working after about 3 times. Even with a new battery it would not start again. So back to searching for a decent nose/ear hair trimmer!  I&#x27;ve changed this review from 2 to 4 stars because of the exceptional customer service I received from ManGroomer. I contacted them about the issue, and within an hour they had emailed me back, and told me they would send a replacement. Hopefully, I have better luck with the next one.</li>
    <li> I suppose there&#x27;s a website for anything.  Here&#x27;s one for nose hair trimmers:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The before-and-after photos of actor Vince Vaughn is a humorous touch.  [[ASIN:B00006ADFY Swingers (Miramax Collector&#x27;s Series)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Mangroomer for a few years, and it works fine.  It gets points for the name of the product. Sounds like something out of a Seinfeld episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the problems is that the battery terminals get coated with natural corroison and the contraption stops working.  I think any battery operated appliance that is kept in a moist environment like a bathroom is going to get the battery contacts coated.&lt;br /&gt;Hint: keep the machine in a Ziplock bag. [[ASIN:B0002ZOY5A Ziplock Type Bag, Clear Reclosable LDPE 2\\&quot; x 3\\&quot; 100 Pcs, 2 mil Thick.]]&lt;br /&gt;Hint: clean the battery terminals with a pencil eraser, and it starts right back up.[[ASIN:B00125Q75Y Dixon Ticonderoga 13872 Woodcase Pencil, HB #2, Yellow Barrel, 96 per Pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Mangroomer machine gave out, and I was a little mad, but then I realized I had owned it for probably 4 years.  That would seem like an acceptable time for a $15 machine to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a Panasonic model that looks very much like this one, but reviewers say it doesn&#x27;t work as good as past models.  I don&#x27;t get the point of a \\&quot;mirrored top\\&quot; or a light on the Panasonic models.  You stick this type of machine in your nose or ear and when you don&#x27;t hear it cutting hair, you&#x27;re done.  I&#x27;m not going to need to have a mirrored top of a light so I can style my nose hairs.  \\&quot;Nice nose hair cut.  Can I get the name of your stylist?\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Getting older sucks... this is something I have thought of getting for a long time. It was nice to be able to put down the scissors for a change. Happy with how it works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be an EXCELLENT choice.  It&#x27;s rare I rave about a product because so many are \\&quot;junk\\&quot;, but this one delivered.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this very inexpensive groomer a month or so ago and decided to take a chance since it cost so much less than some of the others groomers. I have been pleasantly surprised at how solid and well-constructed it is and it does its job very well.</li>
    <li> The device is good, but the battery has to be changed  quite frequently even if device is not being used a lot.</li>
    <li> Reading all the reviews on this guy, I was pretty confident that this would be a real beast, but...not so much. I bought this as an upgrade from a previous, \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; trimmer.    The motor seems slow. At first I thought I just needed a fresh battery, but no, it still seems to be sort of chugging along. To be fair it does seem to cut ok, but it just always sounds like it&#x27;s about to die on me. It also needs to be shoved around into various areas in order to cut---the actual clipping portion of the head is pretty small, and I definitely can&#x27;t just jam it in there and go, but rather have to maneuver it around quite a bit to get all those pesky hairs.     I guess that&#x27;s it. It works fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful. I&#x27;m always slightly in fear of having the ol&#x27; nose hairs \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; out rather than cut. Looks high-end, but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> I have owned two Panasonic trimmers, and they just have not worked well - weak motor, dull blades. The man groomer has a V8 engine compared to the Panasonic V4. Spins fast and sharp blade!. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Having gone through three or four well known brands that did not do the job, I tried this one. What a surprise, even though the features have been similar the operation and close cutting are worlds apart. With the old ones, my wife would say \\&quot;that thing is so slow and doesn&#x27;t cut close,\\&quot;  I wish I had found this one sooner.</li>
    <li> *UPDATED below*&lt;br /&gt;I originally started by buying the Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs okay.  The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I bought the Panasonic Panasonic ER421KC trimmer.  The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago I bought this Mangroomer nose hair trimmer.  The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  If I go slow enough, it&#x27;ll cut the hairs.  Otherwise, the Mangroomer likes to pull hairs.  I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s bad enough that I decided to write this review for the 3 trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the Mangroomer lasts.  But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Obviously, I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer though.  After only +/- 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try something else (if / when the Mangroomer dies) but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag. I have no idea if it still works or not, and have no desire to ever try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco NT9110 for about 2 years, and recently remembered my prior review/s, so I decided to update them. This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers. I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it. I also never put the cap back on. Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate. I&#x27;ve never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed this trimmer before, but something about the design turned me away from buying it.  For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me (which was a concern with this design, and I&#x27;ve jammed/pushed it into any areas as needed).  If something ever happens to it, I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.  I hope this is helpful to someone.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews before purchasing this trimmer for my boyfriend, and thought it would be a good pick.  I guess it works fine other than the fact that it turns itself on when it&#x27;s in the off mode.  Therefore the battery runs out constantly!  He seems to think it works fine when it has fully charged batteries, but wishes it wouldn&#x27;t just run randomly.  Just thought I should throw that out there for people who are considering buying it themselves.</li>
    <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer for my husband, unlike previous one from Panasonic, he stop using it.  According to him, the motor torque is not stable and pinching his hair.  [[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver]] is a bit pricy, but perhaps it is better product in comparison to this one.</li>
    <li> I just received my mangroomer. Took a little work to get the battery cover off, but once I got it put together, I was very impressed with both this unit&#x27;s power and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other unit I purchased for nose and ear hair was purchased at a local drug store. That thing was useless. This is really very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The best nose hair trimmer around. I say this as the (more or less) proud but (somewhat) disappointed  owner of dozens of similar products none of which came close to the Mangroomer in term of performance.    On the negative side, the Mangroomer is kind of ugly and the power switch is not as convenient as the one on Panasonic&#x27;s nose hair trimmers.    Nevertheless, the Mangroomer outperforms the Panasonic in what it was  designed to do: trimming nose and ear hair.    I had some initial issues and Mangroomer resolved the problems immediately to my 100% satisfaction (and more).     I highly recommend the Mangroomer.    P.S. The Mangroomer&#x27;s cutting head perfectly fits the Panasonic nose hair trimmer&#x27;s body and this seems like a match made in heaven.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and much better than Conair product. Rotating head works fine for me. I had a problem with the groomer, contacted Mangroomer customer service and they immediately sent me a replacement without askng me to return the original product awesome service. Replacement works fine.</li>
    <li> I had to do much research when purchasing my new nose and ear hair trimmer.  My previous one was a WAHL trimmer and it worked effectively for a while and then the blade would sporadically go from full force to less effective force.  You could actually hear it trying to build up the speed.  And it was also supposedly a wet/dry model but it was hard to clean.  It was just always more trouble than it was worth and when it started that battery life would last only a mere few weeks and it stopped working altogether at times I was in the need for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this MANGROOMER model and am thrilled with it.  I have definitely learned over time that the more expensive an item in no way reflects on its quality.  And with this model you get a superior high end trimmer at an excellent price.  The motor is very strong and the blades very effective trimming very close without pulling the hair and irritating the skin or being too sharp.  The user can very easily direct it where the trimming is needed.  The motor on my previous WAHL never sounded so consistently strong when running.  The power never lessens with the MANGROOMER and its selling point of dry/wet use is very accurate and makes the model very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this item.  Finally an item that actually does what it says.  It trims the nose hair and ear hair very effectively.  Now my trimming chore time is cut in half with a product I can truly rely on.</li>
    <li> this product worked good enough for what i need it for,i may even check out other products from this company, only if they have a rechargeable battery i don&#x27;t enjoy switching batteries.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great.  It really has to power to do the job. No more pulling out hair.  It actually cuts.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This groomer is great.  I&#x27;ve used most of the other types of men groomers and this blows them away.&lt;br /&gt;If it does not last forever, I only hope I can find this exact groomer somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor, long battery life, comfortable action and wet/dry is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic devices like this and they inevitably died a premature death ... so far I like the more rugged feel of this -- although it&#x27;s a bit on the loud side</li>
    <li> This does a nice job and it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt too much. Its construction is high quality. I have no complaints about this.</li>
    <li> This product is weak and takes a long time to do its job. It sits in the cabinet now, forgotten.</li>
    <li> While it worked, it did a good job, torquey and removed hair w/no pain. Unfortunately, it just died on me. It&#x27;s 3 years old, so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected, but still disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other nose trimmers before, and man did they hurt.  This one cuts clean, takes 10 seconds per nostril, and you don&#x27;t feel anything.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used the MANGROOMER nose and ear hair trimmer several times and been very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.  It performs far better than a more expensive trimmer that I got from Brookstone, which just didn&#x27;t trim the hairs close enough to the skin.  The MANGROOMER feels much more solid and durable than cheap models that I have tried by Conair and others.  The MANGROOMER trims close, but it&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t nick or pull the hairs.</li>
    <li> Simply, it does what it is supposed to do very well! I am very satisfied by the power and closeness of the trimming.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how excited my boyfriend was when I handed this tool over to him. Even more surprised that it works pretty well. His nose is especially hairy, so he has to go in a couple of times to make sure he gets it all, but he really likes it. It just took him a little bit to get used to the \\&quot;tickly\\&quot; sensation.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked very well out of the box.  The all important cutting blade is designed to be removable...therefore replaceable. I can&#x27;t find any information about blade replacement. it would be a shame to throw away the whole trimmer just because it needed a new blade.  I bought several of these trimmers (by different manufacturers) in the past. This one seems to work best.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he was uninterested until he tried it!  He is mid-thirties and was just using tweezers for his nose hairs. He is now a believer. Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Used it once and it worked ok. Went back a week or so later to use and it didn&#x27;t work. Changed battery and it didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This device broke the second time it was used (normal use); the plastic ridge under the cutting head broke apart, rendering the device useless.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been through many. and because this one was inexpensive, i thought no way it works. but holy smokes, this one rocks. more openigs and better blade design. and hi speed. awesome</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for the price. Solid construction, good battery usage, and I love the ability to rinse it off in the shower or under the faucet.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After thinking this was dead in the water after 6 months, it turns out the head needed cleaning.  After taking it off (just a slight twist to unlock the tabs), the unit worked. I cleaned the head under water and let dry for a day, and it is working again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a jungle in my nostrils, but sometimes there&#x27;s 1 or 2 hairs that grow extremely long. I find it hard to trim them if these hairs are located deep in the back. It takes more effort than I would want to get them.    Overall it keeps people from staring at my nose because of hair sticking out and I can&#x27;t ask for more with the great price of this product.</li>
    <li> I have ear hair like Yoda, and so this was the ultimate challenge for an electric trimmer. I found that the Mangroomer rocks, especially for $15, it&#x27;s a bargain and is well constructed from thick plastic.  You can take it apart and clean it in water. It runs off a single AA battery, and is no more noisy than a regular electric shaver. And it does shave close, not quite as close as a blade, but very acceptable, even for nose hair. Use it about every 5-7 days.  It does not pull the hairs, and the tip gets a bit hot while it runs...  Since I would not buy a panasonic anything, this would be my number 1 choice. I do wish that there was a rechargeable version, but I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it to you- buy it for sure.</li>
    <li> This trimmer did a good job of getting close enough without pulling or pain. It worked for four months before dying. UPDATE: After contacting Mangroomer, they are sending a replacement, so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty good customer service, although we would have preferred that it last longer.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new trimmer, and had in the past been underwhelmed by battery-powered models.  I saw this trimmer and decided I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  It trimmed like one would expect it to, and it doesn&#x27;t have issues with losing power and not cutting well.  It may not be flashy or have a lot of bells and whistles, but if you are looking for a trimmer that does a good, dependable job, this one fits the bill.</li>
    <li> After this trimmer fell apart I bought the Panasonic Vortex Wet/dry Trimmer ... which Really IS Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID love this trimmer though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It WAS Way Better than the last one (all silver slender cheap thing sold in Pharmacy stores) that never worked well, and fell apart when I tried to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The original Battery still worked after 14 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It did start to nick me inside my nose a few times though, even though I quickly learned that if you just put it Straight up your nose, with no angles, then it is safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Was easy to clean until it completely fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Did work fantastic.  Quickly and easily got everything.</li>
    <li> I have two Panasonics that have both been worthless, and just tried the new one with the vacuum and it is also lousy.  I also have a one handed manual which does not work very well.  But, this is the one!  It trims the hair short and when the others stop finding hairs this one keep cutting. It is comfortable and does not pull.  I finally found a hair trimmer that really works well for me and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have used it for a while now and find it to be the hair trimmers of hair trimmers.  Excellent unit works how they all should work.  Forget Panasonic as they do not have it figured out yet.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Works exactly as designed, gets the job done quick and easy. Nice packaging as well. If you&#x27;re looking for a simple trimmer that works as designed then this is the product. great price too. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> The groomer works really well with no grabbing or pulling.  A very nice trimmer that lives up to it&#x27;s reviews.</li>
    <li> This Man Groomer Nose and Hair trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  It trims gently without ripping the sensitive hairs out of my nostrils. I bask in its gentleness and look forward (not really) to when I have to use it.  Instead of using a proprietary battery that needs a custom charger, it takes 1 easily replaceable AA battery so you can refresh it on the go. If a meteor crashed through my roof and demolished this trimmer, I would buy the exact same one to replace it.</li>
    <li> Hi, I ordered this based on the price and the other customer reviews here. I received one and it didn&#x27;t work out of the box. I tried new batteries, everything, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted MANGROOMER and they immediately sent me two more units (I didn&#x27;t have to send back the defective one). Much to my surprise, one of them was already defective (the negative end of the battery mechanism wasn&#x27;t in there) but the other one worked. However, after two uses, that one stopped working, too.  So...3 units, all of them non-working. I&#x27;ll go with a more reputable brand next time. Good customer service, though.</li>
    <li> I would not buy their product.  The product stopped working shortly after I bought it.  When I contacted the 800 number, they said to email them.  I did.  Three times.  I never received a response.  I made a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  The company said they responded to me telling me that there is a 30 day warranty and there is nothing that they would do for me.  I never received that response and the BBB told me they had to close my file since Mangroomer didn&#x27;t respond back.  I think this product lasted maybe two months but more likely 1 1/2 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the whole body man groomer and my husband still says they were the best gift I ever gave him!</li>
    <li> Wish it took one more battery for more power. It works at shaving hair better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works great--even on those very short hairs.  Best ever owned.  Not sure how it will last since I just got it, but the little motor hums along smoothly.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Everything good said about this unit in other reviews is true.  There is no pulling.  The motor is strong.  It cuts close enough, without cutting so closely that ingrown hairs could result.  It is seldom that one finds a product that actually does what it purports to do.  This one does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALL the other personal groomers for men that are on the market, and all of those are disappointing, mainly because they have week motors which result in pulling and snagging on the really coarse hairs.  Mangroomer was purported to have a stronger motor and hence smoother cutting, and that is exactly what it has and does!  Don&#x27;t be deterred or uncertain, buy the Mangroomer!</li>
    <li> Item performed job it is made for but is not very impressive.I would not buy another one. It is very weak.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is easy to use, and works well for a low cost.  I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of gadgets, but this is by far my favorite for the price.</li>
    <li> I had owned three Panasonics and a Wahl, before buying a Mangroomer.      One Panasonic worked well.  I had bought it for my brother.   So I bought another for myself.  But it was unusable right from the start.  It was pulling my hair out.  The third, it started pulling my hair out after about 3 or 4 use.    Wahl was a good product.  It cut very comfortably and very consistently.  The only problem is that it just suddenly stopped working in about a year.     I bought a Mangroomer, based on great reviews. But, it was pulling my hair about about 3 or 4 uses.  I thought maybe it was the low battery, but it wasn&#x27;t.  In frustration, I threw it out the window.      I guess I will go back to Wahl.</li>
    <li> While this trimmer does a good job at trimming, the whole product becomes pretty much useless due to its poor battery locking design. It difficult to determine whether the battery lock is locked or not. After using the product about 2-3 times (in a span of about 3 months), the lock has broke off and is now pretty useless. It uses a tiny plastic locking mechanism, making it very easy to destroy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned other trimmers and found the Mangroomer to give a close cut with less pulling than the others.  It is also easy to clean out.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Unlike other trimmers, this one does not cut to close to the skin or actually pull the hair so it doesn&#x27;t hurt esp around the ears and nose.  However since the blades do not cut too close to the skin, you will need to use it on a daily basis vs. other trimmers that cut close (but may hurt) can last few days before trimming again. Another drawback is that it&#x27;s pretty loud when trimming in the ear.  Otherwise good product wished it would cut close to the skin it would then be an excellent 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This is the first nose trimmer I have used so I cannot compare. In reading the description I had a hard time finding that it runs on 1 AA battery. I was first looking for a rechargeable or plug-in but could not find one. I was very happy it does not pull any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 6 AA rechargeable batteries that I use for various devices. At first I thought this would eliminate the need to buy batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: After owning this for almost a year I began to run into problems with the motor slowing down or stopping. I tested my old rechargeable batteries with the [[ASIN:B0002EH4YO Mini Multi-Battery Tester]] and they seemed good. I decided to buy some new rechargeable batteries and at first it was fine again. NiMH batteries deliver a lower voltage (1.2 volts). Apparently this device does not work well with NiMH rechargeable batteries as another reviewer noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering the purchase of a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> The groomer is very efficient and easy to use. A little big for its intended use and bulky for air travel, but otherwise very happy in its performance.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews here I was ready to have a good purchase.  But the item arrived, and it was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I started out with freshly recharged AA batteries, and it sounded like it was on the verge of dying.  The motor would not keep a decent speed, sounded like someone trying to cut through a tree or something and getting it wedged constantly and jamming it up.  Battery tested at about 1.49V.  So I got a pack of brand new energizers, AA size.  Also tested them with multimeter and were right about the same power level, and the unit did the exact same thing.  As if there&#x27;s a little poltergiest in there with a rheostat that keeps varying the speed of the thing.  Sure, it can cut when it&#x27;s at a high RPM, but that lasts for about 3 seconds, then it drops back down to barely moving and pulls painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just have a bad one, and I will try to return it, but I won&#x27;t get this as a replacement, I&#x27;ll try another one.</li>
    <li> When I first unpacked it, I was disappointed at how easily the cap came off...  Nevertheless, the unit worked adequately for 10 days. Then it stopped working entirely. I changed batteries but it still was dead. I called the customer support 800 number and gave them all the information... model number, date of purchase, Amazon order number, etc. I was told that I would hear back either by phone or by email. I waited a week and then called again. I gave all the same information and was told that this time they would ask for a rush response. It has now been 2 weeks and I have still not heard back. Thirty days since purchase have now expired and I have little hope of getting satisfaction.  Save your money and your aggravation and do not do business with this company.  Follow-up: After writing this review and waiting another week or so, I contacted Amazon which, within minutes, had issued a full refund! Don&#x27;t deal with ManGroomer, but DO count on Amazon. They were great.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Well made, powerful and cuts without pulling. Seems the best choice for the price.</li>
    <li> I keep putting batteries into this thing, and the level of power it puts out is disappointing. It always sounds like it&#x27;s running down and out of power. Terribly disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had a bit of a problem with the first one, before I sent it back to Amazon I noticed the manufacturer had put in a card asking to contact them if there were any problems.  I sent them an e-mail and within 4 hours (on a FRIDAY night) they responded and told me they were sending another one immediately, and did not require me to return the one I was having problems with. In 2 days I had the new one that works perfectly. It does a great job on the nose and ears. Great experience with the company and the product!</li>
    <li> across the board a bad product.  blades do not cut close enough.  just plain flat does not cut well.  across the board a bad product</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever used!! - Close to perfection, to use its effortless, easy to carry on holiday etc and silent.  This is just one of mangroomers amazing products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these clippers with varyingly mediocre results. This is the best of the bunch and is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just like the Mangroomer back shaver the quality is very cheap and not rechargeable, the protective carry case it comes with is a joke. But for the price it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these Mangroomer trimmers 19 months ago. It does a very good job of trimming thoroughly and closely without nicking or irritating the skin -- much better than any trimmer I previously used. It seemed more powerful -- spinning fast and never seeming to bog down. It is a little bulkier than most other trimmers, but not enough to be a problem. I found it easy to grip and control.     Unfortunately the trimmer died this past week. I was surprised at its sudden demise -- I expected it to last much longer than 19 months. The first time it was dead, I was able to resuscitate it by tapping a few times, but the next time I went to use it, it was dead for good. I am disapppointed that the trimmer did not last longer, but I liked its performance enough that I will be buying another.</li>
    <li> When he said he wanted a nose hair trimmer for his birthday I almost didn&#x27;t take him seriously.  This battery operated trimmer is compact and efficiently gets the job done without the pain of plucking.  My man is happy, so I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few cheap electric nose hair trimmers. This one really isnt much better than any of those. Most of which I paid half of what I paid for this one. It does have a nice sturdy non-slip handle.</li>
    <li> This broke after two uses. Even if it did not break I still would rate it low. You really have to grind this in your nose to get it to work and it is not very efficient. I would try the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I purchased a ManGroomer about 6 months ago.  I have only tried two nose trimmers.  The first was a Conair.  The ManGroomer is definitely better.  The motor and blades turns at a slower speed, and may be why it cuts better (hair has more time to get in front of the blades).  I also like how easy it is to disassemble to clean, and the head can be immersed/rinsed in the faucet without harm to the motor and battery compartment.</li>
    <li> Pulls at the hair occasionally. It&#x27;s like shaving with a time bomb. No idea when it will make you yell...</li>
    <li> This is the second nose hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve tried. Several years ago I bought the basic Panasonic trimmer that looks almost identical to this one. The name is cool, but the motor is very weak. It stops multiple times instead of cutting. I don&#x27;t believe that my nose hairs are too thick.</li>
    <li> This fell apart after a couple of months. The switch fell off and then i could only get it to work by twisting and putting pressure on the base. Now it does not work at all. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Great tool for men that have nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> This Trimmer works Great! The Best Ive found and Used... This Is worth every penny. luv it!!! Mangroomer makes a great Product.</li>
    <li> No comparison to other devices in quality.  Good cutting edge, no pulling and long battery life. Way better than some bargain brands that are sold in department stores. Once again Amazon provided the best range of options and choices an were easy to review and select item.</li>
    <li> it works just fine, inexpensive, does the job.  I use every other day. Does what it&#x27;s meant to do more than adequately.</li>
    <li> happy with the trimmer - small, light, attractive, comfortable, works well.  anyway, had one that died on me, so i emailed them and asked them what to do. i had a response in less than 20 mins, and they offered to ship me a brand new one free of charge. they didn&#x27;t even require me to send back the broken one first! they ended up sending me two, so i&#x27;m going to gift one of them.   solid product + stellar customer service &#x3D; lifelong customer. thanks guys, you made my day. can you teach other companies to behave like this? please?</li>
    <li> While this product worked, it worked well. The problem was it didn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m nervous about buying from them again, because this died so quickly. Kind of cheap design, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> After going through years and years of painful Panasonic nose grooming hair pulls and weak motors, I bought this and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Why?  The motor on this is strong and fast, it doesn&#x27;t pull at all, right on ManGroomer!</li>
    <li> Up until buying this Mangroomer nose hair trimmer, I was using the Panasonic ER411 nose hair trimmer. I put up with the Panasonic model for several years, even though virtually every time I used it,  it would inevitably cause me pain. Not only that, the thing would slow down and speed up randomly for no good reason, even if you just held it out in front of you without touching the tip to anything. It would eat up batteries also. It seemed like you had to have a fresh battery in it all the time, or else you get a slow motor and lots of ouchies. It worked, but it made every trimming a dreadful experience.    In the comments on amazon for the Panasonic ER411 nose hair trimmer, you can see that others had the same problems with the device.    So after having had enough with that lousy Panasonic device, I spent a good amount of time looking at the comments for all the different nose hair trimmers out there.  I was beginning to think that they all had the same problems as the Panasonic model had.  But the Mangroomer model&#x27;s comments were a bit better, so I bought one and crossed my fingers.  To my surprise, it had none of the problems that the Panasonic model had.    This Mangroomer nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t nick you and won&#x27;t slow down or speed up randomly. It won&#x27;t pull your hairs out. It&#x27;s much more powerful than the Panasonic model, and it doesn&#x27;t lose its power over time except when the battery truly needs to be replaced. It works well. I&#x27;m very happy with this device.    Those of you just starting out with nose hair trimmers, if this is your first one, you&#x27;re going to be spoiled by it. You won&#x27;t know how good you have it compared with the other ones out there.    About the only negative thing I see with this device is that the tip does warm up a bit during normal use (due to friction I think). It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, but it is noticeable. Since you only have to spend 2 or 3 minutes using the device, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.    Oh, and before I bought the Mangroomer trimmer, I bought a Groom Mate manual nose hair trimmer because of its positive reviews. People said they loved it and don&#x27;t get nicked from it. I don&#x27;t understand that, since I get nothing but ouchies with it. It&#x27;s also really cumbersome to work compared with motorized nose hair trimmers, and it leaves longer stubble. I don&#x27;t recommend it, except maybe for ear trimming since it would be very quiet (although I&#x27;ve never used it for that purpose).    I definitely recommend getting this Mangroomer trimmer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in March. The 1st one I received did not work well at all. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on half the time, and when it did turn on the motor sounded like it was dying. I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one no questions asked. After receiving the second one I ran into the same exact problem. I would not and cannot recommend this. I would like to say that this is not Amazons fault as they have been nothing but accommodating.</li>
    <li> This works great! I am a female and needed this to trim nose hairs, and it works great! I love it and will recommend to anyone!! :)</li>
    <li> have always bought panasonic but thought I would give this one a try.  It only worked the first time.  The blade is rusting and will not turn.</li>
    <li> it takes care of hair. it hasn&#x27;t cut off any limbs there have been no fatalities from my using of this</li>
    <li> This product serves its purpose. I only used it as a nose trimmer.  It is easy to use and relatively quiet. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a dying Panasonic (which was the second one I had owned).  It&#x27;s \\&quot;ok\\&quot;, but the main problem is that it&#x27;s not as close as the Panasonic.  I really have to work at some spots get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely constructed better than the Panasonic; however, I don&#x27;t really care for the design.  The case is pointlessly oval shaped, which means you have to align the cap just so to get it back on.  And it&#x27;s quite large and heavy, which makes it feel like a good product, but it wastes precious space in a travel bag.  And finally, the rubber grip looks and feels good, but it has that cheap \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; plastic smell that&#x27;s just starting to go away after three months.</li>
    <li> I have one from another manufacture I bought through Amazon and I wanted a second one for my travel case. It was not available so I purchased this one. Not really of much use, it cuts very poorly and feels very cheap in your hand. Hairs are pulled before they are cut making it a painfully process.You can tell by the sound the trimmer is underpowered for the task. Only the very longs hairs are cut leaving an unsightly short hair behind. The top or cover is poorly made and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all and won&#x27;t stay on leaving the cutting tip exposed which means for my travel case I have to wrap it with a rubber band to hold the cap on. Very disappointed all the way around with this product. Workmanship is very crude and considerable pressure is required to replace the battery because the parts do not fit well together.  I would have to strongly advise against purchasing it.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this purchase was that it was made through amazon.com and the return was painless. I elected a refund rather than replacement and will try a competitor&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer. Works just great.</li>
    <li> my unit was barely powerful enough to trim hair. Most of the time it felt like it was pulling it out as opposed to cutting. Tossed in the garbage after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Got the trimmer out of the package and put a brand new battery in per instructions.  We turned it on but nothing happened.  Put  a different battery in still nothing.  My husband got it to make some noise by tapping it on the table. It stopped making noise when he lifted it up - he couldn&#x27;t trim even one nose hair:).  We called Amazon and had not problems getting a refund.  Thank you Amazon.  The seller has a no return policy - very surprising even though it was a defective/non working product.  I would not recommend buying this brand. I give this product NO stars but for some reason I could not write the review if I didn&#x27; give it at least a star.</li>
    <li> This is about the 4th nose trimmer I have purchased in my life, with each one working a little less than the previous.  That is until I decided to try this Mangroomer Essential Nose and Ear Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I had almost given up, as my other product which is very popular (and one of the first to sell this type of item to my knowledge) was just NOT cutting it, pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;So i thought maybe my hair is too tough or too something!  Not for the Mangroomer!  It cuts the really nasty looking nose and ear hair without the least discomfort.  And keeping those out of sight is one way to maintain a more youthful look because let&#x27;s face it, visible nose and ear hair is down right gross!  I love products that work better than I expect, and Mangroomer has now delivered twice for me.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the range that are available, but now that I have this one, have no reason to look further!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again Mangroomer!&lt;br /&gt;(I also reviewed the Pro Back Shaver as it is awesome as well)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003NCXXIS Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
    <li> If you have a strong resistance to something tickling the inside of your nose buy this product.  Otherwise, buy something else.  I&#x27;ve had several of this type of trimmers in the past and never had a problem until this one arrived.  I can&#x27;t stand to use it because of the intense tickle it inparts in my nose.</li>
    <li> does not do the job waste of money</li>
    <li> Great value, great quality, simple product.</li>
    <li> it is a good trimmer worth the money compared to other trimmers out there on the market. Gets those hard to reach ones.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have owned and been using this trimmer for half a year now. The trimmer is no better than any other one I have tried. It don&#x27;t seem to have a very strong motor for cutting and it does seem to pull the hair rather than cut it quite often. I was hoping for something a little better than the average trimmer but I was disappointed. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is far superior to other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. It is noiseless and painless and leaves me feeling very trim.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic trimmer which was cheaply constructed. It was painful to use this since it pulled the hair everytime. So I stopped using it for few months and after that, it stopped working. Junk! I looked at this Mangroomer for several months on and off, but did not bother to buy it. But finally I purchased this item with other item so I can get free shipping. This item is realy good. As other reviewer mentioned, you might have to use it more often but at least it does not pull hair. I am very satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> We received this product so quickly it was surprising. My husband has purchased 3 of these and nothing has worked. This one is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pesky nose hair growth (more like a jungle). This did as advertised within about one minute.</li>
    <li> well, it performs ok for a while, eats batteries quickly, slows down and gets flaky as time goes on; however, my big complaint is that, despite their claims, their customer service is non-existent: I&#x27;ve tried several times to contact them, thinking that maybe I wasn&#x27;t cleaning it right or something, and have never heard a word from them.</li>
    <li> If this product worked 100% of the time it would be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, it dosent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I got from Amazon had a bad motor.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than returning it I decided to contact Mangroomer CS and they were great and sent out 2 replacement units very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the replacement unit is working as I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would urge anybody considering buying this product to understand that you might receive a bad trimmer, but the manufacturer will replace it without much hassle at all.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be a near-exact replacement for the &#x27;Best&#x27; trimmer I first purchased from Hammecher-Schlemmer 15-years ago and wore out. All the specs matched and the reviews seemed alright. Unfortunately this unit proved under-powered, which means it tends to grab more than it cuts. I recommend tht you take the $12 you were going to spend for this seemingly good deal and apply it to the $20+ price tag for the &#x27;Best&#x27; trimmer found elsewhere. Maybe you&#x27;ll be able to go 10+ years without having to deal with this again (I hope to).</li>
    <li> By far, the BEST nose trimmer on the market!!!! My husband has pretty much tried them all until he found this one. Really clears out ALL of the hair in his nose &amp; ears.</li>
    <li> It works flawlessly, and it&#x27;s the most comfortable hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used to date.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I have purchased. The first was for a friend of mine. He thought that it worked great so I ended up getting one for myself. I don&#x27;t use it very often, but when I do use it, it does the job just fine. I&#x27;ve only used it for nose hair without a problem. Over 2 years and counting.</li>
    <li> Does real well on the nose and ears. Good power and easy to use. Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> If you are into pain and poor performance this product is for you. It should be a crime to release something like this. I feel it is a danger to use in sensitive areas. Get an attorney and document, may turn out to be a great civil case.</li>
    <li> the item works as described.. haven&#x27;t used it longterm as yet to judge durability.. trims well.. i haven&#x27;t used one before so can&#x27;t compare.. overall works well.. asd tfyug uhkjhg iyfuf lkglig</li>
    <li> Works good. No pulling of hair.  Cleans up easily.  Nose, ears, eyebrows, where ever you need a little trimming up.</li>
    <li> This unit broke after using only a few times.  It was a total waste of my money buying this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Batteries last a looooong time.</li>
    <li> This groomer does the job.  There is slight hair pull but   not enough to not use it.</li>
    <li> This is the facial hair groomer for me, I went to others over the years but I came back -  Yay Me!! (and Mangroomer :)</li>
    <li> Ferfect for a quick trim befor heading out, small, light and easy to store in your bag. The top acts like a protector for the blades it never falls off</li>
    <li> Stopped working after the first use. tried new batteries, and no go. Not recommended at all unless you&#x27;re looking for a paperweight.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I thought maybe it would be painful, but you don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> Light, takes a single AA, have not tried it in the water yet, but it&#x27;s works GREAT.  Trims my nose hair right down to the skin, quiet, clean, and can use it to trim stray eyebrow hairs, and even get in the space between my ears and hairline.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic model that was fair but gave out after using 30 or 40 times.  So I decided to this the Mangroomer a try.  However, this was even worse,  Both brands have two very small blades on springs that whirl around inside a slotted head.  The concept appears simple and effective if the components are of sufficient quality so that the blades do not get stuck on the slotted head or if hairs do not get stuck in the slots because the blades have gotten dull.  Unfortunately, this unit worked fine for a few times, then the blades got dull.  It pulled out hairs rather than cutting them as they got stuck in the slots.  Finally the blades would not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;this was not a battery problem, because the drive shaft would spin normally when the cutting head was removed.  Very disappointed.  This is headed for the land-fill.</li>
    <li> never worked well then died</li>
    <li> It works, but it takes very little hair off at one time.  You have to use it frequently.  The old Panasonic I had did a better job.</li>
    <li> When I received my trimmer, I put a new battery in.  It started up then immediately stopped working.  I tried several different batteries with no luck.  I contacted the manufacturer and had a new one that worked within a week.  So far, it works great.  It feels a little cheap at first, but it actually works and is really light, compared to my old one.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my worn out but still functional Remington NE-3.  The motor seems much more powerful on this one and I noticed that I only need to trim once a week compared to 2 to 3 times a week with my old unit. Must have a closer cut.  It is not as ergonomic as the NE-3 because it doesn&#x27;t flex in the middle, but I am getting used to it. I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far it is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really does a nice job. I think this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  My previous trimmers usually gave up after being dropped on a tile floor.  This feels good in the hand and you&#x27;re less likely to bobble it and send it flying.  Like I say, it&#x27;s the best I every used.</li>
    <li> i am an international purchaser and to my utter disappointment on receiving the product it just did not start , I have to just dump it , I cant even send it back So pls check before u buy</li>
    <li> i had mine for a very short time. I dropped it by accident on carpet and the head piece broke off making it unuseable. it worked great before that though</li>
    <li> this unit seems overbuilt and underpowered, no matter how fresh the batteries it simply hurts to use it. There are other options on the market (some with no electricity) that are better for the job.</li>
    <li> This thing worked right out of the box.... that&#x27;s about the last time it&#x27;s worked without me messing with the battery... or the removable top part.. whatever that thing is called.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t work at all until I mess with something.. and I&#x27;ve had this piece of junk less then 3 months.  Would only recommend this to my closest enemies...... otherwise... it&#x27;s clearly not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this trimmer. He surpassed all expectations.he is better than braun,panasonic</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve owned trimmers by Panasonic, Remington, and Wahl.  Most trimmers last for a few years then eventually die--either it won&#x27;t turn on, the blades don&#x27;t cut like they use to, rechargeable ones won&#x27;t fully charge, or something.  I use a trimmer only 2-3 times a month, so I&#x27;m not looking for the most expensive, high-tech, state of the art product, but I don&#x27;t want a low quality trimmer that tugs/pulls at hair or cuts poorly. It&#x27;s not a huge dollar spread between the best and the worst, but still no need to spend more than needed.  I&#x27;ve owned this one now for about 5 months, and I can definitely say it&#x27;s my favorite thus far.  It does it&#x27;s job VERY well--cuts quickly and sharply with no pulling whatsoever.  When this one dies in a couple years, whatever the current Mangroomer model is at that time, I&#x27;m going to buy it.</li>
    <li> Absolute dollar store trash. Not worth the cost of the batteries you have to frequently replace. Would not cut hot butter.</li>
    <li> Great device. Performed as instructed. Got it on Amazon for way less money than at Brookstone.&lt;br /&gt;At this price and for the quality you can not lose!</li>
    <li> I love this I do not use it but I love it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Husbands with nose hair,you know who you are.Rejoice! No more nose hair and no torture in \\&quot;pulling it out\\&quot; that was the norm for previous devices.&lt;br /&gt;My Hubby has hair that you could climb coming out of his lovely nose but no more! Mangroomer has changed our lives I HATE nose hair and he hated having it \\&quot;pulled/ripped\\&quot; out with the not to be named device used previously. It holds a charge quite well has worked non stop since Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Happy hubby Happy wife Happy life Great product!!</li>
    <li> nice trimmer,very good price.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Panasonic trimmer which lasted many years but always seemed a little flimsy and slow speed.  I was attracted to this one because of its muy macho name and was not disappointed.  This is a pretty basic little device, but it appears to be well made and the motor runs fast and steady.  The rubberized grip keeps the trimmer firmly in hand when fighting through long tufts of thick ear hair.  It&#x27;s all that I&#x27;ve ever dreamed of in a nose hair trimmer, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I already had a Remington nose groomer that worked reasonably well. I thought that I would give this one a try and I&#x27;m glad that I did. The Mangroomer is slightly larger than other nose trimmers. But, it seems more powerful. It cuts closely and safely. It is now my trimmer of choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several. This make and model is the best.</li>
    <li> Trimmed my hairs neatly and is easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripe is with the strong electronic/metallic smell that comes from cheap electronics.</li>
    <li> I am a 40+ yr.old man, not &#x27;Julie&#x27;.  This is a dude review for sure.  Had a nice older panasonic trimmer that was dropped (my bad) and the replacement models&#x27; reviews were not promising.  Went with the Mangroomer based on reviews.  However,  this has not been what I expected.  It runs slowly too soon on a new battery.  It does not have high quality stainless, causing discoloration and a strange metallic odor even after cleaning, and is way loud.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and it worked well for about 2 months. It trimmed unwanted hair quietly and efficiently. Then one morning, it made a horrible noise when I turned it on. It was too loud to put in your ear for trimming and it stopped cutting hair altogether. I took the tip off and cleaned it out, but it never went back to normal after that morning. I just bought a replacement. I am disappointed in this product and that it only lasted for two months of occasional (once a week?) use.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I was about to give up on electric shavers and groomers since they never really worked right until now.  Tried other top brands but Mangroomer is the best.</li>
    <li> i bought this product and used it once...it never worked again...i tried a new battery to no avail...what a piece of junk..i contacted the seller and they blew me off saying they werent responsible for thier own garbage products...fair warning folks...avoid this seller and their products...[[ASIN:B0019ZZFJ6 MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer</li>
    <li> I was initially pleased with the way this item worked. It seemed to have a strong motor and do a good job. After about two months of use, the power got touchy. I had to shake or hold the unit in just a certain position to get it to be on at all. From there, it went downhill fast. Despite my taking it apart and cleaning the head often, the motor got weaker and weaker over the next few months, and eventually would barely move at all. Fresh batteries did not help. Bottom line: this is cheap junk that does not last. I threw it away and ordered a [[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]] which doesn&#x27;t trim quite as close, but at least it is hand-powered and reliable.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve owned several of these groomers since my turbo groomer broke a few years ago and i feel like i know what i want. there is still nothing which compares to that product, which was from sharper image.  this trimmer is lightly-built, maybe three ounces with battery. the blades are tiny and delicate, kind of like fly wings. when you turn it on, it takes several seconds to start going unless you have just replaced the battery. it does not pull the hairs or pinch, but it does not trim very thoroughly either. it takes a good five minutes to get a full trim done. battery life is poor-- it seems like i need to replace monthly or so. all in all, this item works, but don&#x27;t expect a great job. i don&#x27;t get the impression it is very well built. ok item, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. i&#x27;ll wait till something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and all I can say is that it&#x27;s okay.  Doesn&#x27;t always come on without some fiddling but once it does it works.  For such a simple device it seems difficult to get one that really works consistently well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does the job.</li>
    <li> works better than prior similar implements i&#x27;ve tried.  just wonder if the blade inside is replaceable.  if you know, please comment.</li>
    <li> A nice conpact trimmer that works well for a while.  Its the Bic Lighter of trimmers.  After a year &amp; 1/2 of use it&#x27;ll be barely running.  At the current sale price of $12 (10/20/13) I bought four.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Been Looking For A Good Nose Hair Trimmer For A Long Time.&lt;br /&gt;I Had A Sharper Image Trimmer Years Ago That Took 2 \\&quot;C\\&quot; Cell Batteries.&lt;br /&gt;This MANGROOMER Comes As Close As Anything To That Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I May Buy A Few More, Just To Have For The Future</li>
    <li> This is a man size unit.  I have grown so tired of the weak cute little gray metal, but it is probably plastic, can&#x27;t cut it hair trimmer that I had come to believe that there was nothing out there.  Best hair trimmer I have purchased in twenty years, and I have been buying one every year for a decade.  Throughout the 90s I had a Panasonic, they were really good back then.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother.  He now looks neat and groomed.  It&#x27;s amazing how a simple item like this can&lt;br /&gt;make the biggest difference! I would recommend you buy it for your BF, husband, brother friend...you know they need it!&lt;br /&gt;And once they get used to the idea of using it, they&#x27;ll think it was their idea.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with this gift. It works great on all his stray hairs....</li>
    <li> All my ear hair has been trimmed! Loved this item &amp; hope it lasts for a while because I don&#x27;t like ear or nose hair!</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase.  It works as described.  It is nicely designed and looks attractive as well. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Sucks getting old and hairy especially where you don&#x27;t want or need extra hair.  This trimmer is great for nose hairs.  It cuts really well without grabbing and pulling.  Very powerful, comfortable and cleans up in a snap.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Trims hair effectively.  Works well and is reasonably well made.  What more can you say?</li>
    <li> Hubby says that his is nearly as good as his old one. Yes, the occasional pulled nose hair, but not enough tug to pull them out or cause tears. I bought him one or two others before this one that he didn&#x27;t like at all. Either they didn&#x27;t trim close enough or they pulled hairs constantly. This mangroomer seems to be the best of the lot of currently available nose trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this review helpful? Please vote. :-)</li>
    <li> I used a trimmer before and I had mixed feelings about it.  I purchased this one and have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not as expected.  Stopped working 6 months after purchase.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use was OK.. nothing great.. the tip got rather hot.. was not as effective as some other machines out there but was OK for the price. But i wish i had paid a little more and bought something that would actually last longer than one use!</li>
    <li> I like this groomer for the price that it&#x27;s at.  Sometimes I have to give it a little shake to get it spinning at its full speed but it does the job well either way.  It cuts pretty smoothly too; I&#x27;ve never felt any pain from the groomer \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; out the hair, as some reviews say.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. I like it very much,. It&#x27;s even great for ladies. This groomer met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item</li>
    <li> This is very convenient and works well.  You can tell it is working by the sound it makes when he cuts each hair.  It is much easier than using a big mirror and tweasers.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer feels great in my hand.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job trimming.  Great quality...but even better price!!!</li>
    <li> Fast, sharp shave without pulling hairs. Now, isn&#x27;t that what you want in a trimmer like that? I&#x27;ve used trimmers that pull hairs and take too much time doing something that shouldn&#x27;t take much time. Now that my hubby is getting to be that age that hair sprouts from the ears, I bought this so he could remain flawlessly groomed. His nasal hairs are starting to get grayish, too. Or something. This is a man who will unabashedly wear plaids and stripes, with a paisley tie if I let him get away with it. But he does pay attention to facial hair. (Well, I make him, really.) So this works well for ears, nostril hairs, eyebrows, and whatever else little hairs you have on your face that need trimming. Go for this one!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered it and wrapped it up as a Christmas present for myself. I use it every day. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of it long ago</li>
    <li> This thing makes trimming quick and easy. It works well and I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort or issues with the blade pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase since I was just using trimming scissors previously and this works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement that could be made is an option for rechargeable batteries. But for the price I can&#x27;t find a reason to give it anything but 5-stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago, it worked great at first then the blade got dull and you cannot get replacements (boo) it took about 5 months to dull. I powered through it ripping out my hair untill now, a year in. The motor is so worn it wont do anything but stop as soon as it touches a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess not bad for a piece of plastic crap. I wish they could make stuff that lasts longer than my boxers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for at least 10 years, and it&#x27;s just as strong today as it was when it was brand new.  The batteries last a long time, and you always know when to change batteries because the trimmer will slow down a little.  Even if you can&#x27;t afford to switch batteries, this trimmer will still work when it&#x27;s running slow.  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It does the job but I can&#x27;t escape the feeling that one day it&#x27;s going to fall apart in my hand.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer for me has been great, trimming nose and ear hair without getting cut like you would with scissors and pain free. For the nose hairs that are hard to get to you still may want to purchase the specialized scissors you can buy to really trim those nose hairs very close safely, however just for keeping your nose hairs from sticking out of your nose and being able to see your nose nostrils, these will do the trick. And for the ear hair this is the only unit you will need. It runs on a AA battery. It is not the most sophisticated gadget but I found it meets my need for grooming the ears and nose.</li>
    <li> I have had a trimmer or two in the past. The battery operated one finally hit the dust after many years of service. I have a stainless steel one that is small and is manual. Great for traveling. But this Mangroomer does the job and is totally painless. I would recommend it to any one that likes to look clean and fit.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 7 years ago for my husband. He said it&#x27;s the most useful gift ever. After he disposed of it just because of over use, he bought other brands. He said every time, none are as good as the one I bought. I realized this year I bought this one. Of course I purchased it for Christmas. Needless to say, he was happy and tossed the one he bought the week prior. Now I know what brand it is and will never forget.</li>
    <li> I like this little thing. It is small and stylish. It works great too, just fire it up and stick it up your nose and it mows it all down. Well it works for me any way, and I have to use it about once a week. I used to use a nose hair trimmer \\&quot;attachement\\&quot; on my beard trimmer, but this one works better by far! It does exactly what it is made for! I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I was not sure that this product would work but was very pleasantly surprised.  The trimmer handles nose and ear hair like a pro.  I would highly recommend this item to any man.</li>
    <li> The MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer arrived quickly and undamaged. It is the best nose and ear cutter that I have found since the OLD Sharper Image Nose and Ear Cutter which to date is unavailable ... The New Sharper Image Nose and Ear Cutter is NOT the same as the ORIGINAL one.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of nose trimmers but the man groomer is the best I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s got a lot of power and trims very close. It&#x27;s easy to clean and lasts a sufficient amount of time. This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned. The first one lasted over two years so I think it was a great value for the cost. I replaced it only because the blade was getting dull.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this product. It gets too warm, pulls at the hairs and in general I just don&#x27;t look forward to using it very often.</li>
    <li> I nose and hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t have enough juice to get the job done. I have regular hair -- not crazy wild think animal hair, just normal nose and ear hair. It seems like my hairs clog the trimmer after a few swipes. Then I have to pound on it to get it going again. Very frustrating. Tends to pull rather than cut.  Just a poorly made trimmer.</li>
    <li> I opened the box right when it came through the mail. Opening the package was slightly difficult, but wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The thing is pretty simple, just put in a AA battery and you&#x27;re good to go. This is the first trimmer I have ever bought so I was a little nervous about sticking this thing in my nose. I don&#x27;t know why I have all this nose hair when i&#x27;m 22 years old but it&#x27;s very annoying because when I run I feel like I can&#x27;t breath through my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I stuck the thing slowly into my nose and I could hear it cutting the hairs, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything at all. Within a few seconds I could feel so much more air coming in through my nose, it was working. I rinsed it off and I was done, easy as that. It even works in between your eyebrows if you&#x27;ve got some hairs over there. I&#x27;m sure this can work anywhere on your body that you&#x27;ve got a few hairs you want to trim down, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love that it&#x27;s a very convenient looking thing, and can be stored away with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot&#x27;s of complaints here about it breaking or something. It&#x27;s only nose hair. I mean it&#x27;s not something you trim every day. Maybe once or twice a month.. If this thing breaks on me i&#x27;ll come back and update this review and let you guys know, but so far so good. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken and I never got to use it. At the cheap price I decided to just toss it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Very similar to one I had in the past, works well, seems a bit cheap but then, it was very cheap. I would recommend this for all nose &amp; ear hairy trim needs.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve had it for almost 18 months now, and it&#x27;s as good as new, even after weekly use. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair. This little thing even handles more heavy duty jobs, like when I try to clean out my hairstyle in between hair cuts. If it stops working, just open the top and rinse the hair out. Battery lasts a good long time. Bought one for my father as well.</li>
    <li> my husband doesn&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> I think it likely works well, but my man may not chose to use it :) oh well what are you going to do</li>
    <li> So far so good but it is still new. Have a Wahl, so far like the Mangroomer works a lot better.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is better than the more expensive Panasonic. I is longer, so that it is more comfortable in my hand, and makes it easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic trimmer I&#x27;d lost the blade to.  That was a mistake.  This product is poorly constructed.  After a couple of months of use the rotation speed slowed to a crawl and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use now because it pulls the hairs rather than cuts them. The motor runs fine without the blade or blade guard attached (I&#x27;ve tested to make sure the issues I&#x27;m experiencing aren&#x27;t related to the battery), but once the blade and blade guard are on, it barely spins, if it manages to spin at all.  Save your cash and buy a trimmer that&#x27;s not going to break down after being used only once every two weeks for two or three months.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer.  It&#x27;s not that cheap plastic type.  This is actually quite sturdy.  It also has a rotating head which is the ONLY kind to get.  The rest are junk.  We love ours!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Compared to the other trimmers I have used, this really works. It has better speed and handle. Priced right as well</li>
    <li> Other similar products typically are junk and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it is worth 50% or double what was paid.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this trimmer, it worked well.  I was pleasantly surprised, as I&#x27;d owned a trimmer (another make) some years ago that was useless.  (For that reason, I was hesitant to buy the Mangroomer.)  The second time I used it, it didn&#x27;t work a damn.  I noticed that it sounded less powerful the second time around, despite the fact that I was using a brand new battery.  WTF??</li>
    <li> First the delivery was slow and when it did arrive the box was beat to hell and wet, the trimmer was safe inside the box along with the multiple damp coupons and advertisements that I will not be using, so I opened the package and installed a new battery turned it on and it ran maybe 20 seconds before dying. Don&#x27;t believe it could be user error since it holds one battery and has one switch.</li>
    <li> faulty product, the razor came without a blade. I dealt with the manufacturer directly and resolved the issue on my own.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the Sharper Image ones that I have always purchased in the past. This is even better than those. It does a great job and feels more durable. The price is great and the product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This groomer does a great job at trimming and does not pull any hairs.  I have tried 5 or 6 other brands before and none of them come close to being as effective as the Mangroomer.</li>
    <li> Trimmer worked great for one week.  Then stoped working completely.  Clean, oiled, just stoped working. Has become a useless paperweight.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- It DOES the job. None of my nose hair shows anymore. I use it every 3-4 weeks, maybe it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve recently only started to trim my nose hairs this year.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a great manual&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean and use&lt;br /&gt;- No Pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t cut close to the skin, but it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;- Lately I have been feeling heat coming from the Nose trimmer, I can smell it and feel it inside my nose.</li>
    <li> I used this mangroomer for a few months and it stopped working.  I tried to contact support several times by email and phone, the reps on the phone say you have to email, no response to any emails.  It&#x27;s still under warranty but is currently functioning as a paperweight and not a mangroomer.</li>
    <li> It does the job without discomfort. However, I have (and prefer&amp;#34; an older Sharper Image unit that runs on C-batteries instead of the AA type used here. The C-battery unit works much faster, and never stalls. However, this one will do the job, and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> It is much better than the older ones I had tried, good battery life, sharp blades, easy to clean out fully.</li>
    <li> I paid a reasonable price, gave it to my husband as a &amp;#34;gift,&amp;#34; and he no longer has revolting hairs hanging out of his nose all covered in boogies. I would do it again.</li>
    <li> Works well esp. for the price. No pulling or PAIN. Cleans easily. Excellent value. A worthy consideration for ur armamentarium.</li>
    <li> Chosen by cost and description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quite well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off/on switch is problematic. Trimmer can run even when turned off if I don&#x27;t use it very lightly.</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of other products for removing nose hair in the past and none of them did a good job. They were shining and looked good but didn&#x27;t  remove the hair. But this MANGROOMER does a good job. My nostrils are completely hair free.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my man to use for his ears and nose...he loved it while it worked the first few times,but then it hurt to use...it no longer removed hair easily...I bought it based on reviews after researching many...too bad too late to return...not sure Consumer Reports reviewed groomer trimmers for men,but will check to see if can find a replacement that lasts...</li>
    <li> Good groomer for the price. Good quality, fast shipping, arrived packaged well. Made a nice gift for Christmas. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It has a great portable, sleek design that&#x27;s easy to pack away. It&#x27;s good at getting those nose hairs. Never had one tugged out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: does not include the AA batteries it uses.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to women as well as men. Stays charged for a very long time. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for more than 2 years now.  I&#x27;ve used it regularly, once every 1 to 2 weeks.  It is extremely reliable, and rugged.  It always been very easy to use, does a great trimming job, and has never caused me any discomfort.  And I am still working from the first set of batteries that I installed when I bought it.  It is very easy to disassemble and clean after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product esp. for the money works as well as any expensive brand. I am impressed with it amd would purchase one again!</li>
    <li> This is my first one of these so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I am quite pleased that it works well and didn&#x27;t pull or yank anything painfully..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did dock a star as the motor on it gets very hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to put it down for a minute to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing does seem solid and well made.</li>
    <li> shove this right up your nose and it&#x27;ll cut every single hair up there.</li>
    <li> I finally did the research on my friend telling me that pulling out nose hairs can kill you - who&#x27;d a thunk - he was right.  It was time to purchase something to keep the air flowing freely, and this was it.  It does trim nose hairs, and it&#x27;s satisifying when they are are trimmed; you&#x27;re able to breath again and you don&#x27;t have those unsightly nose hairs hanging down over your lips and sometimes in your mouth.  It does seem to use up it&#x27;s one AA battery pretty quickly and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve got the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well and battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The metal portion broke loose after using it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Will look into returning this and buying a different one.</li>
    <li> This product as I read a lot of reviews saying it fails after a while. I think otherwise I have had this for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong as the first day I got it! And I am not bothered at all by the 90 degree angle you need to keep to get those nasty hairs trimmed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product and would recommend</li>
    <li> Love using this especially when I am in the car.  Sitting in a parking lot and just going to town in my nose and ears:)</li>
    <li> I wished I had purchased a model higher that had more features, but this one is sufficient for its intended purpose</li>
    <li> All Mangroomer products work great. They all do what you expect them to do. I have had some issues with the batteries holding a charge on a couple of their products, but amazon has excellent customer service if you need to exchange anything.</li>
    <li> This the 3rd one we&#x27;ve purchased, generally it lasts for more than a year ....this last one broke within six months.  Going to try panasonic ...fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> HAVE BOUGHT NORELCO SCHICK AND EVERY THING INBETWEEN  THIS ACTUALLY WORKS DOES NOT PULL HAIR ACTUALLY CUTS IT..SPENT UP TO 100 DOLLARS FOR OTHER BRAND TRIMMERS..THIS 9 DOLLER TRIMMER PUTS THM ALL TO SHAME..WOULD BUY ANOTHER</li>
    <li> Nothing great.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a very hairy person this might work on you. But for a not that hairy guy this item doesn work well.&lt;br /&gt;Daily struggle to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;The material is not good. 3 times used and a piece of plastic on the inside just broke and fell. Still works but not for long.</li>
    <li> Broke in three months, worst product I&#x27;ve ever used it&#x27;s not safe blades grabbed hairs in nose and cut corner of my nose.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is occasionally i have to tap or wiggle batteries to get it to turn on.  Other than that works great!</li>
    <li> Design-wise, the rubbery exterior is perfect.  Makes one think it was designed for wet environments.  (Though I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s underwater resistant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts without pulling...makes the pesky hairs disappear in no time.  Discreet...in fact, it looks like a designer cologne bottle.  From top-bottom view, you discover it is oval-shaped, except for the cutting assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor detail: Only used it once, and in that instance, I noticed it sometimes does not eliminate certain areas...if that cutting assembly was thinner, it could reach.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the trick. I only used it once so far but it seems to work better than any other trimmer I Have used. Since it is so new to me I can&#x27;t verify it&#x27;s durability at this time.</li>
</ol>
