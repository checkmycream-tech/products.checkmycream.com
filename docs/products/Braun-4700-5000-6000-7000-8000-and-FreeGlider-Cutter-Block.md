      <li>Great replacement blades.</li>
      <li>If you just need to replace your cutter, this is great.  </li>
      <li>Great customer service.  </li>
      <li>good price but</li>
      <li>These blades are simply as good as the   originals were.</li>
      <li>I have posted pictures comparing the one ordered to the one it was to replace and also posted a picture of the two Braun razor cutter heads I own to show the similarities...</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly and gives him a  close shave again without the expense of a new razor.</li>
      <li>This was a great value, arrived quickly, and works as designed.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the original blade in my shaver and fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>For under $10 you can keep your razor in top condition.</li>
      <li>It would be better if ordered with the 3 foil piece</li>
      <li>Spend more.............get more.</li>
      <li>How come 2 more words are required?</li>
      <li>These cutter heads are great for my Braun razor, and save me considerable money over the competition.</li>
      <li>This was an easy, efficient transation.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine for my shaver.</li>
      <li>Worked just fine.</li>
      <li>It works just fine in my shaver.  </li>
      <li>This is what I get for trying to go \\&quot; the cheap route\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I tried to fit this into my Series 5000 Braun shaver and it would not stay in place.</li>
      <li>The factory replacements fit as required but these cheap imitations keep falling out once you finish shaving.</li>
      <li>Installed this in my Braun and it promptly cut a hole in the screen, seems like the blade does not quite fit into the razor.  </li>
      <li>I puchased it to replace the original cutter block that came with the shaver I purchased about a year ago.</li>
      <li>These blades work and clean shave.</li>
      <li>Overall good quality.</li>
      <li>The seller issued a full refund.  </li>
      <li>is not a bad deal.  </li>
      <li>on time delivery, good fit, not as sharp, slower shave and not as close.</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, but had to respond on this one.</li>
      <li>my 6 months old originals cut better.</li>
      <li>It is noisy and the shave is not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>It fit on my old razor and my foil fit over it</li>
      <li>These are very inferior to the original.  </li>
      <li>Braun recommends a 2-week &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period for new blades, so I gave them a full 6 months!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;stem\\&quot; is not quite right.</li>
      <li>My guest is that it is the exact same blade which Braun is selling in combination with the foil to make more money.</li>
      <li>Good quality, been using   for few months now.     </li>
      <li>Real junk that fell apart the first time I cleaned the razor.</li>
      <li>Upon examination of the steel pin that holds the cutter in place I found the tip of the pin to not be the proper shaping, which is what caused it not to fit even though the listing here on Amazon says it will work.</li>
      <li>I purchased three of these, thinking they would fit and work properly.  </li>
      <li>all the negatives: noisier and more dull than my original 2-yr old Braun blades!</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S LIKE HAVING  A NEW RAZOR!</li>
      <li>I replaced the blades in my shaver with this one and it&#x27;s like having a new shaver!</li>
      <li>I am really really surprised this product got positive reviews, must have been by people with ties to the company that produces this junk.</li>
      <li>I now need a new foil as well.</li>
      <li>It shaves just like a brand new blade should.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I just want to put my 2 cents out there for those who are thinking about buying a new blade without the foil.</li>
      <li>My new Braun blade just arrived and immediately it quieted the shaver and gave a close shave, even with the 2+ year old screen!</li>
      <li>I do not see this product lasting very long at all and in fact more than likely damaging the foil to the point it needs replacement too.</li>
      <li>Reasonable cost and came in a short time frame.</li>
      <li>will recommend this vs buying the complete assembly set to my friends.</li>
      <li>Immediately upon installation (in a cleaned shaver), the blades sounded like they were grinding against the foil, and I immediately noticed that the shave quality did not improve from my old, worn-out Braun brand cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, when I replaced my old blade with this new one, it did not fit just right.</li>

<li> But the product didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> The new cutter block is dull and cuts so poorly that I went back to the original to get a beter shave.</li>
<li> I would not recommend you buy this product due to the poor quality control and cheap construction.</li>
<li> All other items I found were combos with the screen and much more expensive</li>
<li> I get another one because I know it will not stay too long in the market with that price</li>
<li> , not only did I waste money buying these, but now I actually need to buy the Braun parts to replace the foil on my unit.  </li>
<li> six is a bit smal but still works well per my dad.&lt;br /&gt;Right price for my dad who is on a limited income.</li>
<li> I put my Braun cutter block back in my shaver and it feels brand new again after using this poor excuse of a cutter block.</li>
<li> After only a few shaves, it punctured the shaver foil.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> BEEN WELL OVER A YEAR AND STILL SHARP AS EVER.  </li>
<li> The drawback to the Braun has always been a problem, in that due to the design of he head wearing out every 6-9 months.  </li>
<li> All of the other vendors required me to buy the foil (screen) and the blades for $26, but I didn&#x27;t need the screen.</li>
<li> Not worth the money!</li>
<li> It fits a little looser than the OEM, so when you remove the foil head, the cutter block comes with it rather than staying latched on the grooved shaft.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Now, after 3 weeks of using this cutter daily (despite the poor shaves), there is a hole in one end of one foil, worn or ripped through by these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using it everyday and satisfy with the shaving result.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or endanger your shaver with these.</li>
<li> I was not sure how this aftermarket cutter would perform, but 2 for the price of one</li>
<li> As stated in the title this cutter block is dull and took forever to shave.</li>
<li> The blade gets dull with usage but the foil should not IMHO.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why there are negative reviews for this blade</li>
<li> It lasted about 1 week before starting to pull the whiskers out instead of cutting them off.</li>
<li> They apparently don&#x27;t care if they have a bad product.</li>
<li> The cutter block I purchased is no good.</li>
<li> Product is not good - the cutter pulls on my beard while shaving.</li>
<li> Wish I had read all the negative reviews!!</li>
<li> Not a happy customer!  </li>
<li> I was wrong.  </li>
<li> It is a very uncomfortable experience.</li>
<li> Am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> This product it WORTHLESS!</li>
<li> These replacements are awful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Am extremely disappointed with this product. I puchased it to replace the original cutter block that came with the shaver I purchased about a year ago. The new cutter block is dull and cuts so poorly that I went back to the original to get a beter shave.</li>
    <li> Cutter  for Braun shaver</li>
    <li> Got the blade refill for my razor and it broke almost immediately after using.  Stick with the name brand - NO AFTERMARKET.  Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> The cutter block I purchased is no good. It lasted about 1 week before starting to pull the whiskers out instead of cutting them off. I sent a message to the company but never received a response. They apparently don&#x27;t care if they have a bad product.</li>
    <li> Real junk that fell apart the first time I cleaned the razor. Parts from Bruan are quality, this was a knockoff.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Did not get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is not the OEM part.  After only a few shaves, it punctured the shaver foil.  The seller issued a full refund.  Great customer service.  But the product didn&#x27;t last long.  I now need a new foil as well.</li>
    <li> good price but my 6 months old originals cut better. on time delivery, good fit, not as sharp, slower shave and not as close.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are negative reviews for this blade but it works just fine for my shaver. It looks exactly like the original blade in my shaver and fits perfectly. It shaves just like a brand new blade should. My guest is that it is the exact same blade which Braun is selling in combination with the foil to make more money. The blade gets dull with usage but the foil should not IMHO. Anyway, I just want to put my 2 cents out there for those who are thinking about buying a new blade without the foil.</li>
    <li> I tried to fit this into my Series 5000 Braun shaver and it would not stay in place. Upon examination of the steel pin that holds the cutter in place I found the tip of the pin to not be the proper shaping, which is what caused it not to fit even though the listing here on Amazon says it will work. I have posted pictures comparing the one ordered to the one it was to replace and also posted a picture of the two Braun razor cutter heads I own to show the similarities... hopefully this illustrates the problem. I have replaced the cutter head and foil several times on this razor and never had a problem up until now. This is what I get for trying to go \\&quot; the cheap route\\&quot;. I would not recommend you buy this product due to the poor quality control and cheap construction. I do not see this product lasting very long at all and in fact more than likely damaging the foil to the point it needs replacement too.</li>
    <li> All of the other vendors required me to buy the foil (screen) and the blades for $26, but I didn&#x27;t need the screen. This was a great value, arrived quickly, and works as designed. This was an easy, efficient transation.</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for on this product. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! As stated in the title this cutter block is dull and took forever to shave. I put my Braun cutter block back in my shaver and it feels brand new again after using this poor excuse of a cutter block. I am really really surprised this product got positive reviews, must have been by people with ties to the company that produces this junk.</li>
    <li> These are very inferior to the original.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Results are pitiful.  Remember, you get what U pay for.  These replacements are awful.  DO NOT buy these.  Spend more.............get more.</li>
    <li> My rating was based on cost - this was cost saving! These blades work and clean shave. I like it and I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this vs buying the complete assembly set to my friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased item was delivered as promised.&lt;br /&gt;The six is a bit smal but still works well per my dad.&lt;br /&gt;Right price for my dad who is on a limited income.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But the question is how well will it cut after 6 months. I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
    <li> Works great, best price.</li>
    <li> Product is not good - the cutter pulls on my beard while shaving. It is a very uncomfortable experience. Going to ditch the entire shaver</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these, thinking they would fit and work properly.  I was wrong.  Immediately upon installation (in a cleaned shaver), the blades sounded like they were grinding against the foil, and I immediately noticed that the shave quality did not improve from my old, worn-out Braun brand cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after 3 weeks of using this cutter daily (despite the poor shaves), there is a hole in one end of one foil, worn or ripped through by these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only did I waste money buying these, but now I actually need to buy the Braun parts to replace the foil on my unit.  Not a happy customer!  Don&#x27;t waste your money or endanger your shaver with these.</li>
    <li> These blades are simply as good as the   originals were. Good quality, been using   for few months now.     UPDATE:  BEEN WELL OVER A YEAR AND STILL SHARP AS EVER.  IT&#x27;S LIKE HAVING  A NEW RAZOR!</li>
    <li> Perfect tune up for a Braun razor at a fraction of the cost.  The drawback to the Braun has always been a problem, in that due to the design of he head wearing out every 6-9 months.  For under $10 you can keep your razor in top condition.</li>
    <li> It is noisy and the shave is not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! Wish I had read all the negative reviews!! This product it WORTHLESS! I rarely write reviews, but had to respond on this one. Ditto all the negatives: noisier and more dull than my original 2-yr old Braun blades! Braun recommends a 2-week &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period for new blades, so I gave them a full 6 months! I had to make 4 or 5 passes over my face to get just a &amp;#34;4 o&#x27; clock shadow&amp;#34; quality of shave. My new Braun blade just arrived and immediately it quieted the shaver and gave a close shave, even with the 2+ year old screen!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 in case I could not find the replacements for this shaver. I had a bit of the problem locating replacement blades. They arrived as promised and on time. I had no problem with the vendor in that respect. However, when I replaced my old blade with this new one, it did not fit just right. The factory replacements fit as required but these cheap imitations keep falling out once you finish shaving. The \\&quot;stem\\&quot; is not quite right.</li>
    <li> I replaced the blades in my shaver with this one and it&#x27;s like having a new shaver!</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades. It would be better if ordered with the 3 foil piece</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s razor wasn&#x27;t giving him a close shave. Rather then replacing the razor, I found an affordable Cutter Block on Amazon. It fits perfectly and gives him a  close shave again without the expense of a new razor.</li>
    <li> Installed this in my Braun and it promptly cut a hole in the screen, seems like the blade does not quite fit into the razor.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how this aftermarket cutter would perform, but 2 for the price of one is not a bad deal.  It works just fine in my shaver.  It fits a little looser than the OEM, so when you remove the foil head, the cutter block comes with it rather than staying latched on the grooved shaft.  Other than that, it works and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday and satisfy with the shaving result. I get another one because I know it will not stay too long in the market with that price</li>
    <li> These cutter heads are great for my Braun razor, and save me considerable money over the competition. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came in about 3 days, no shipping cost either! It fit on my old razor and my foil fit over it so I didn&#x27;t have to replace the foil either.</li>
    <li> Item worked quite well for my shaver.</li>
    <li> It fits and works as advertised. Reasonable cost and came in a short time frame. Overall good quality. How come 2 more words are required?</li>
    <li> If you just need to replace your cutter, this is great.  All other items I found were combos with the screen and much more expensive</li>
