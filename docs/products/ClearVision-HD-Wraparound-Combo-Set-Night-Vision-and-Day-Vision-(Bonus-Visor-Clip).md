      <li>They are perfect for overcast days when you get enough sun to cause glare but darker glasses just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit, although my mom likes them to wear over her glasses!</li>
      <li>Husband is pleased with glasses, so I am, too.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend them for those trying to look hip, but they serve the intended purpose as advertised and at a very fair price.</li>
      <li>More importantly they work.  </li>
      <li>They are fine for the price</li>
      <li>a good keeps the glare down and the sunglasses are good as well.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really have much need for the night driving glasses but the wraparounds are great and both pairs of glasses work as advertised.</li>

      <li>Overall a good buy</li>

      <li>They just weren&#x27;t the right fit for me.</li>
      <li>(well not exactly designer but great for the price).</li>
      <li>The sunglasses are great but the night vision glasses do not shield the on coming vehicles as well as other night vision glasses I have used.  </li>
      <li>And the free visor clip makes them very conveniently located on your cars sunvisor!</li>
      <li>I was excited when I came across combo day and night glasses that were reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Price was just right</li>
      <li>Very pleased with booth pairs of glasses, especially the night visions which really do help with my night driving.</li>
      <li>They seem to help with side of road visibility which should be good in active deer areas.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable even though they may not be high fashion.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>not as effective as I expected.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a tad bit futuristic &amp; large</li>
      <li>Fit is awkward but lenses work great.</li>
      <li>Work really well and have held up without any problem</li>
      <li>The day glasses work very well.</li>
      <li>Got them for the night vision, but the color causes me to get a headache; however, I really like the day vision glasses.</li>
      <li>Thanks for having something that works</li>
      <li>Not so much at night.</li>
      <li>Otherwise both pairs are very well made for being so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable and just enough tint to block glare.</li>
      <li>The nighttime pair is more darkly tinted but doesn&#x27;t really cut glare that much.  </li>
      <li>Still, they work and really do make a difference, particularly with night driving.</li>
      <li>love these just big enough to go over my glasses without feeling wierd</li>
      <li>Do a decent job of aiding in glare situations.  </li>
      <li>These are about one tenth the price that he would normally pay</li>
      <li>I think they will work as well as the night vision glasses when the sun normally obliterates one&#x27;s vision.  </li>
      <li>While others complained the daytime glasses weren&#x27;t dark enough, they are perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>The night vision glasses are fantastic with these new headlights that look like the old brights (which were only permitted on lonely roads with no traffic!).  </li>
      <li>No where near what advertisements claim</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>They really are different; cut sunlight quite a bit but don&#x27;t make it so dark</li>

<li> Not sure why two of the same came instead of a night and a day one.  </li>
<li> Super big for my face :-(</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the frames were too large and caused the glasses to slide off my nose.</li>
<li> With a dark lens, I am always lifting my sunglasses to read signs or look at my backup camera.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s dark.</li>
<li> and at night I need them to cut down on the glare from the lights.</li>
<li> Yes they are a little over sized, like 1970s aviator glasses.  </li>
<li> I am too lazy to return.</li>
<li> No more glaring lights but</li>
<li> The clips they give you for overhead are pointless</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with these.</li>
<li> you will not be sorry.  </li>
<li> ibought them for night driving and it made it worse and gave me a headache :(</li>
<li> My husband says they work well, but DAMN they are ugly</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed because they are advertised to take out the glare</li>
<li> terrible!!!</li>

    <li> Super big for my face :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because they are advertised to take out the glare but they don&#x27;t.  And there was no paperwork in the pkg with return information.</li>
    <li> Got them for the night vision, but the color causes me to get a headache; however, I really like the day vision glasses.</li>
    <li> The night vision glasses are fantastic with these new headlights that look like the old brights (which were only permitted on lonely roads with no traffic!).  They do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the day vision glasses traveling west at the beginning of sunset.  I think they will work as well as the night vision glasses when the sun normally obliterates one&#x27;s vision.  If it isn&#x27;t as I believe, I will revise my review.</li>
    <li> My husband has to wear these because of nerve damage and he couldn&#x27;t do without them.</li>
    <li> Work good for price.  No where near what advertisements claim but it does help.  I may buy a second set.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit, although my mom likes them to wear over her glasses!</li>
    <li> Good glasses the night glass a good keeps the glare down and the sunglasses are good as well.  The sunglasses keeps the bright sun glare to a minimum, the both do well.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised</li>
    <li> They do what they say, and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Glasses fit and work great</li>
    <li> My wife loves these glasses. They are comfortable and just enough tint to block glare. Great product</li>
    <li> Not sure why two of the same came instead of a night and a day one.  Both were days... I am too lazy to return.</li>
    <li> Nice and in good condition</li>
    <li> Yes they are a little over sized, like 1970s aviator glasses.  More importantly they work.  I tested the night time glasses and they help with head light glare and eye strain.  They seem to help with side of road visibility which should be good in active deer areas.  It feels strange wearing glasses at night and I kept lifting them to be sure they didn&#x27;t darken my view, which they did not.  The sunglasses also work well and I found myself wearing them into the house and/or stores.  They are comfortable even though they may not be high fashion.  Overall a good buy and I look forward to putting them to the test driving through atlanta traffic or into the setting sun.</li>
    <li> Great fit over glasses.  Work just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed after having eye surgery I have to wear shades when I go out&lt;br /&gt;in the sunlight and at night I need them to cut down on the glare from the lights.</li>
    <li> The glasses  are good for driving except the glass cracked the 1st time I used they are cheap</li>
    <li> While others complained the daytime glasses weren&#x27;t dark enough, they are perfect for me.  With a dark lens, I am always lifting my sunglasses to read signs or look at my backup camera.  They are perfect for overcast days when you get enough sun to cause glare but darker glasses just don&#x27;t work.  They are the perfect size for my glasses and fit well when I wear them by themselves.  I&#x27;ll probably get a set for my dad for his birthday.</li>
    <li> terrible!!! ibought them for night driving and it made it worse and gave me a headache :(</li>
    <li> Perfect for a man&#x27;s face, even with glasses, but a bit big for a woman&#x27;s face. Still, they work and really do make a difference, particularly with night driving.</li>
    <li> I can see a lot better with the day and night glasses!!</li>
    <li> Both pairs of glasses have great functionality. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend them for those trying to look hip, but they serve the intended purpose as advertised and at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with these. The HD vision really does make a difference and the glasses look great (well not exactly designer but great for the price).</li>
    <li> I got 2 glases but they&#x27;re both the same. Not day and night vision. Both are for night.&lt;br /&gt;Helps a lot with night vision. Wish I have the day pair too</li>
    <li> Worked for me..but not my husband</li>
    <li> Can not beat this glasses for the price. Very pleased with booth pairs of glasses, especially the night visions which really do help with my night driving. Otherwise both pairs are very well made for being so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Do a decent job of aiding in glare situations.  The clips they give you for overhead are pointless</li>
    <li> must have a really big face to hold these puppies</li>
    <li> Husband is pleased with glasses, so I am, too.</li>
    <li> not as effective as I expected.</li>
    <li> ...but you will be able to see! I was gonna fork out a bunch of cash for prescription sunglasses! So glad I stumbled across these inexpensive alternatives! Night and Sun for this low price?!?!?! Gotta love it! And the free visor clip makes them very conveniently located on your cars sunvisor! Gets the Mikey seal of approval!</li>
    <li> They really are different; cut sunlight quite a bit but don&#x27;t make it so dark you can&#x27;t read things in the car.  The nighttime pair is more darkly tinted but doesn&#x27;t really cut glare that much.  They are fine for the price and I use them a lot during the day.  Not so much at night.</li>
    <li> I like the daytime ,the nighttime glass they work good.</li>
    <li> Best thing i ever bought. Price was just right and they work wonders. Will recommend these to everyone. Thanks for having something that works</li>
    <li> Fit is awkward but lenses work great.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my father a couple of times now. They work well for him as he has an condition that makes these type of glasses necessary. These are about one tenth the price that he would normally pay and they fit perfectly. They are also durable as he uses them on the farm doing chores. I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Really good and nice I like them</li>
    <li> For the price - it works. I do use them EVERY SINGLE TIME I have to drive at night. No more glaring lights but everything is yellow-tinged. No complaints from me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> The lens make it all very clear, hard to explain.  Anyone needing glasses like this buy them you will not be sorry.  Came packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> love these just big enough to go over my glasses without feeling wierd</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really have much need for the night driving glasses but the wraparounds are great and both pairs of glasses work as advertised. For 15 bucks including shipping for both pairs, I am happy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wear prescription glasses and was looking for yellow tint glasses for night driving. I was excited when I came across combo day and night glasses that were reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the frames were too large and caused the glasses to slide off my nose. I believe the glasses would have worked as described therefore I am giving the product 4 stars. They just weren&#x27;t the right fit for me.</li>
    <li> Work really well and have held up without any problem</li>
    <li> The sunglasses are great but the night vision glasses do not shield the on coming vehicles as well as other night vision glasses I have used.  Too much yellow.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the night vision reduces glare by 25% &amp; the day one works perfect. It has a cool look but it&#x27;s a tad bit futuristic &amp; large but it does fit over your prescription glasses which is great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work. I have an issue with the glare at night and in the rain. I was excited to to get them but sad to say they didn&#x27;t help the glare :/</li>
    <li> My husband says they work well, but DAMN they are ugly</li>
