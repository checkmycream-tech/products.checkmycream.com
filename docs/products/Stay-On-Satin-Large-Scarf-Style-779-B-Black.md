      <li>And yes, I made sure that the matte side of the scarf was against my hair.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this scarf.</li>
      <li>Most mornings I wake up the scarf still on, which is more than I can say for anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this satin scarf</li>
      <li>and it is great for protecting my natural hair.</li>
      <li>This is the one I&#x27;ve had the best luck with in terms of slipping off.</li>
      <li>This works just fine.</li>
      <li>I lost my first one on vacation, so this is a re-purchase :)</li>
      <li>and ive washed it many times and it sill looks like new.  </li>
      <li>It really disrupted my sleep!</li>
      <li>I like Stay On Satin Large Scarf as a nighttime head covering as well as a styling aid.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who suffer from losing their scarf at night!</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It really allows the hair to grow.  </li>
      <li>I bought two of them, and I was really hoping that these scarves would stay on my head throughout the whole night.</li>
      <li>Big enough, wraps around hair nicely.</li>
      <li>Washed in the washing machine a few times &amp; is holding up nicely.</li>
      <li>Frankly I&#x27;m surprised at all of the positive reviews for this product.</li>
      <li>In the past I have had problems keeping scarves and bonnets on my head, but this stays on and is very smooth and gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>So thank god that at least they were super cheap.</li>
      <li>Yes, occasionally it will slip back a little if you don&#x27;t tie it right, but you just have to make sure you&#x27;re using it on the right side and tie it tightly enough.</li>
      <li>But i put this scarf on first and then place on my bigger scarf for added protection.</li>
      <li>The only one I can find that stay put and keeps those edges nice and slick.</li>
      <li>It stays in place even though my 9 year old is a wild sleeper.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this brand for 2 years at my local Walmart where I live along with the satin cap just for extra coverage since I move a lot in my sleep.</li>

<li> Other than that it protects my hair</li>
<li> I prefer the black one which is why I ordered this off Amazon.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find a durable scarf that stays on all night without being tight.</li>
<li> Epic fail!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m bed at least twice, search around in the sheets for it, and re-rye it!</li>
<li> So this product is not for me, SORRY!</li>
<li> How incredibly annoying!</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite scarf. This is the one I&#x27;ve had the best luck with in terms of slipping off. Most mornings I wake up the scarf still on, which is more than I can say for anything else I&#x27;ve used. Yes, occasionally it will slip back a little if you don&#x27;t tie it right, but you just have to make sure you&#x27;re using it on the right side and tie it tightly enough. I lost my first one on vacation, so this is a re-purchase :)</li>
    <li> Terrible. Doesn&#x27;t stay on your head</li>
    <li> Okay. Not very large.</li>
    <li> I love this head wrap! It stays I place at night and it is great for protecting my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This scarf slides right off, this isn&#x27;t the answer for wild sleepers sadly</li>
    <li> As a natural I am big on protecting my hair when I sleep at night since I have thick curly hair. This is the best satin scarf on the market thus far. I have been buying this brand for 2 years at my local Walmart where I live along with the satin cap just for extra coverage since I move a lot in my sleep. I prefer the black one which is why I ordered this off Amazon. Awesome pricing and shipping! I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I find myself waking up in the middle of the night with the scarf off my head, so I have to constantly re-adjust it.</li>
    <li> This satin scarf stays on my head even though it is on the shorter side than my regular scarves. But i put this scarf on first and then place on my bigger scarf for added protection. Really great</li>
    <li> Frankly I&#x27;m surprised at all of the positive reviews for this product. I bought two of them, and I was really hoping that these scarves would stay on my head throughout the whole night. Nope. Every single time I wore one, I had to sit up I&#x27;m bed at least twice, search around in the sheets for it, and re-rye it! How incredibly annoying! It really disrupted my sleep! And yes, I made sure that the matte side of the scarf was against my hair. I think the reason that these scarves slip off is because they&#x27;re so stretchy. If they didn&#x27;t stretch, I think they&#x27;d stay on a bit longer. I can&#x27;t return them because I&#x27;ve already washed and worn both. So thank god that at least they were super cheap. Epic fail! I gave up on head scarves and started sleeping on silk pillowcases.</li>
    <li> I love this scarf. It stays in place even though my 9 year old is a wild sleeper. Also, when she wakes up, her hair maintains it&#x27;s shine now.</li>
    <li> It works like it says</li>
    <li> I love this satin scarf cause it keep my hair moisturise while I&#x27;m sleeping and it does not slide at all like other satin scarf, so ladies if you are on a hair journey like me this is the perfect scarf...</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me... slides off, have tried to wear it on either side and still the same.  So this product is not for me, SORRY!</li>
    <li> I can never find this scarf in any beauty store so I always come and get it offline. I love it. The only one I can find that stay put and keeps those edges nice and slick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a durable scarf that stays on all night without being tight. Finally found one! Perfect for wraps, curly pineapples and so much more.</li>
    <li> This works just fine. Does the job. Washed in the washing machine a few times &amp; is holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> I like Stay On Satin Large Scarf as a nighttime head covering as well as a styling aid. It protects my hair as I sleep and stays on well due to the design.</li>
    <li> It really allows the hair to grow.  It is an awesome product.  It must be used every night for the best results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a satin scarf that does the job. Not sure the importance of the different sides and it stays on just as well as other. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This Satin Scarf does just as it says. It stays on! In the past I have had problems keeping scarves and bonnets on my head, but this stays on and is very smooth and gentle on my hair. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Finally a scarf that doesn&#x27;t come off at night!!!! I love it and I highly recommend it to anyone who suffer from losing their scarf at night!</li>
    <li> Received scarf as promised. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily stay on unless i have a shower cap underneath for overnight deep conditioning.  Other than that it protects my hair and ive washed it many times and it sill looks like new.  Ive had the scarf for 6 months.</li>
    <li> GREAAT ! Big enough, wraps around hair nicely.</li>
    <li> No directions,  what a rip off.</li>
