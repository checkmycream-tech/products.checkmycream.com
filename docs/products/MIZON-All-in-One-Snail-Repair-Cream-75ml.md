      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and does help with scarring and acne, but it&#x27;s not the best thing out there</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was trying to order Cremorlab Smooth Pudding.  I ordered it before and it worked over night.  I asked for Cremorlab and you swiched me to Mizon.  If you do not have the Smooth Pudding, you need it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t have the same effect on my skin like another brand I use on here.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a staple in my skincare routine from now on! I have combination skin (oily T-zone, dry flaky patches in the cheek area, and hormonal breakouts from time to time) that can be relatively sensitive when it comes to new products. I received the snail repair all-in-one cream about a month ago and after using it religiously every night, I noticed a major difference in my complexion. It was definitely more even, less red, firm, plump, and incredibly smooth after every application. It even healed this little paper cut I got from work overnight. This product worked amazingly well for me, but I know that that is not the case for everyone. I still say it is worth a try if you&#x27;re looking to invest in quality skincare products since it only cost about $18, so get a sample if you can!</li>
    <li> I really like it, it has no odor (well you can feel it a little smelling it from near bottle) and it is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes your skin without feel sticky . I love it .</li>
    <li> First day and already loving it. It feels great on the skin. If I keep using this I know for sure my skin will get better.</li>
    <li> I was using the snail cream that was in the pink tube. It worked nicely , but I wanted to try the stronger formula in the jar. It&#x27;s the consistancy of egg whites so beware of it getting drippy when you try to apply it. I have combination acne prone skin and this product has really helped make my skin more bright and even. My hyperpigmentation marks have faded significantly and I have had a lot fewer breakouts. While some hot summer days this is enough moisture for me, I could see needing a little more moisture in winter. Im so hooked on Mizon snail products.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about three weeks and my coworkers have asked about my skincare!  Just think about how I would look if I cleaned my face every night as I should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 and my skin is acne-prone with acne scars (hyperpigmentation).&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product hoping that it will help with my acne and scar issues, and it did in the long run, but it was not as effective as I had wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;Note: this product broke me out the first week I used it, but it didn&#x27;t after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a VERY LIGHT moisturizer and it actually kind of gives a powdery-like finish? I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but I can definitely feel a sheer layer over my face. I use this prior to Mizon&#x27;s Snail Repair Perfect Cream and that covers the moisturizing part. I noticed that it&#x27;s okay or my combination skin and that it did help my skin by slowly diminishing my scars, but it did not help prevent them when I would get pimples. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and does help with scarring and acne, but it&#x27;s not the best thing out there and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m just giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;For those who feel disgusted that it&#x27;s snail slime.. it&#x27;s actually not that bad and it actually doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. It&#x27;s not super gewy and sticky because when it dries, it gives kind of like a powdery-like finish like I have mentioned earlier.</li>
    <li> This cream is ok. However, it does not make miracles as others say.</li>
    <li> Improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> This snail cream is youth in a jar. Seriously. My skin has never looked this good. I do exfoliate with a clarisonic brush and put on a weekly mask, but I&#x27;m totally sold on this product and brand. I just bought the collagen serum--hope that&#x27;s as good as this product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty good and last very long</li>
    <li> Really good moisturizer.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am really impressed with how my skin feels after I use this.  I am unimpressed with the ingredients.  I usually use natural stuff so the ingredients list does freak me out a bit.  Still, I will finish the bottle and see how I like it.  It may be worth deviating from my normal routine.  I use it as a night cream.</li>
    <li> I think this product is just ok. I have dry skin and this one doesn&#x27;t do anything for it. When I apply it, and after a few min later, I still feel like I have to put more on my face. It&#x27;s just not enough... Although it didn&#x27;t give me any problem either and it was delivered at my door right away so I give 3 stars. I should&#x27;ve researched about this product more before I bought it. Not satisfied...</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good product. I have normal to oily skin and Mizon Reapair Cream fits perfectly. Very good Service, received fast with a lovely gift. Thank you very much .</li>
    <li> I really like this. The consistency is a little like snail goo for real and a little goes a looooonng way! I like to use this last at night after I use the Sulwhasoo Timetreasure eye cream and then the Mizon S-Venom cream. The snail cream seems like it&#x27;s going to be sticky, but it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m impressed with this brand. I&#x27;ve been using Skinmedica, but they are pretty much pricing me out of their consumer group.</li>
    <li> would order again; delivered timely; as represented</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago, its good but not really doing anything to my skin. i see a small difference with my dark spots, but since i have different products i use also for my routine I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually was the one to fade away my dark spots. But on the good side, it leaves my skin absolutely soft, all my friends love it when they use it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been breaking out quite as much, but I haven&#x27;t seen any amazing results from this moisturizer either. Overall, I think it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I lke it but  the date of expiration was very near . So the date finished before I used quarter of it !</li>
    <li> The sticky consistency can be somewhat hard to get used to but overall it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, though I wouldn&#x27;t know about the anti-aging effects because I don&#x27;t show signs of aging as of now. I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s preventing it to a certain degree though.(:</li>
    <li> Who would have thought a product made from snail mucin would be so effective!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and helps with my combination skin. My skin a little brighter after a month using this.</li>
    <li> The product reached me open and not in proper seal it seemed it was used.. I throw it in the Carbage.. That was a total loss of money don&#x27;t buy from this shop!</li>
    <li> The medication my daughter is using to treat her acne tends to dry her skin.  My neighbor recommended this cream (it worked well for her son), so I bought one.  At first my daughter was hesitant because of the \\&quot;snail\\&quot; component, but once she got over it and tried it, she loved it!  Now her face doesn&#x27;t look scaly but smooth and moisturized.  The cream was shipped from Korea and it arrived earlier than expected.  We&#x27;re happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Kind of leaves skin dry, but just use with a moisturiezer.</li>
    <li> This does not moisturize my skin, but even though I have dry skin, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry it out in any way despite the formula containing alcohol. I really love this cream though, I just purchased the recovery gel, the eye cream and the ampoule to add to my regiment which will benefit my skin as a whole. I have used this cream for about a week. I know that is not enough time to really judge a product especially if its cream but I really did notice a difference after using it morning and night for 3 days. My pore disappeared and I&#x27;m seeing some fading in some areas where I had minor discoloration. Even my roommate who is male started using it because I wouldn&#x27;t shut up about it said after a few days his scar on his face felt smoother. It probably wont disappear but he liked the fact that even a small amount of time it made a difference. Every person&#x27;s skin is different and needs a special range of treatment but I&#x27;m sold on this cream. I will be purchasing another soon because I know I won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only problem is the price. Upon extensive research of this product and where to purchase and how much, I found that many places sell it for way cheaper so I felt kind of gipped but I have used Amazon so long and Prime members get it so quick and free shipping, I just didn&#x27;t mind it so much.</li>
    <li> This line of products is wonderful.  The &#x27;snail&#x27; was a little difficult to put out of my mind, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  This cream is so light and absorbs quickly and yet it does everything.  Even though I use the eye cream in addition as well as other products in this line.  I have a collection of skin care products.  From the several  hundreds of dollars to Ponds.  And I have to admit that this cream is as good as most of the extremely costly ones.</li>
    <li> great product for a more dry skin type</li>
    <li> The product has a decent consistency but is a little heavy, especially for those who have oily skin. Another concern is that when the product arrived, the inner seal was half opened and some of the product spilled over and congealed onto the sides, so beware of the packaging. Makes we a little weary to use more of it. It seems as though perhaps the product was used or stored in a humid warehouse. This could change the formula of the product and make it expire more quickly I believe.</li>
    <li> My God, this stuff is amazing. My seller was Bizaroo, and I highly recommend them since I can&#x27;t really speak about the other sellers. I have really weird combination/oily skin where it would flake and shine at the same time in certain areas. This stuff keeps my skin incredibly soft, smooth, and matte! It&#x27;s perfectly hydrating for me and does not leave an oily residue like most moisturizers do. It also penetrates my skin very well as it dries within a minute or so, and makeup goes on smoothly - I feel that it can somewhat act like a mild primer because it also shrinks my pores and acts as a smooth base. It&#x27;s balanced my skin out so well in texture, color, and oiliness. My skin has brightened, and my normally sensitive skin isn&#x27;t red or blotchy anymore. I wear this both at night and under make up. Even after 6 hours after I put it on my makeup, my skin does not get shiny and my makeup looks the same as when I first put it on. I usually use this with the Mizon Eye Cream (also from Bizaroo), and my skin&#x27;s been looking great!  My mom tried it, and she liked it so much that she offered to buy me 2 new bottles just so she could keep mine. Hah.  Context: I&#x27;m 23 with sensitive combination skin looking for mild preventative skin treatments. I have -very- minimal acne (I get like 3 pimples a year), and I have no wrinkles or fine lines. I have blackheads with small pores. I can&#x27;t say how &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; this product is, considering that I don&#x27;t have much age to show yet. However, my mom tells me that it helps with her lines, oiliness, and skin firmness. On the other hand, genetically, my family tends to age well in terms of our skin (I am Asian-American).  8/27/15 Edit: Well, I&#x27;ve clearly been using this wrongly. After a few months of using this *just* as a moisturizer, my skin got super dry to the point that my BB cream would flake off on it. It also doesn&#x27;t help that I live in a desert with very little humidity. Star rating will stay the same because it&#x27;s my fault, not the cream&#x27;s. I fixed this using by using a moisturizing emulsion underneath (Etude House) and a moisturizing gel on top (Nature Republic). I really dislike using moisturizer because it tends to get too oily for me with makeup on, but if anyone has any light moisturizers to recommend, it&#x27;d be appreciated ^^ tl;dr: Don&#x27;t use by itself. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.</li>
    <li> Seriously seems to make all my skin troubles disappear. Since I have been using it my skin feels much softer , I havent had a single breakout or blemish since using and I lost the dry patches I was used to having. I do feel as though I need to lock it in with another moisturizer just to keep my moisture barrier in tact but I usually have over dry skin. other then that I love this product. It has helped me get the complexion I always wanted.</li>
    <li> I feel like I got ripped off. When I received the package I was expecting an authentic seal and a general seal with the item. It was messy trying to open it because the seal that keeps the product inside was HALFWAY open. I feel like I got a used piece and like an unvalued customer. What is the definition of new? Definitely not this.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I wanted to return it because of the packaging . That&#x27;s why I am taking of 1 star. The jar was partially opened and the cream was smeared . However, I decided to try it anyway , just to see what the fuss was about and changed my mind about returning it. I apply it nightly and I have noticed some really cool changes in my skin. It feels more moist, looks more glowing . Anyway, I am not returning it. I just hope they learn to check the packaging before item leaves the store because as I can see there were numerous complaints about it.</li>
    <li> It was $30 when I bought it...lol. Anyways, I use this every night and I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the stubborn acne marks on my face are finally clearing up! I only use a little bit when I apply it since the jar is small and expensive ha. A little goes a long way~&lt;br /&gt;I apply it before moisturizing. I experimented with it a little and tried to use it as a moisturizer, but it ended up making my face extremely dry.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old. My skin is slightly oily, specially around the T-zone,  have zero acne problem or wrinkle problem, and I leave in a very humid country. I do get pigmentation patch if I am exposed to sun and easily get sunspot, That is why I am frantic user of sunscreen inside or out. My daily regime consist of many products ( anti wrinkle, antioxident, toner, ultra sonic cleansing brush, monthly glycolic peel, you name I have it on my routine). I am explaining all this just to let you know my skin status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product once a night (occasionally twice) for about six to eight weeks. I always kept the cream in the fridge. As I have very good skin hardly any product can show any noticeable difference. However, after using this cream for 6 weeks I could see the subtle changes, it looked even younger. Probably this is what people are calling dewy. Infact my skin&#x27;s glow was something you have at your teenage years. The elasticity seemed better.My under eye area became much much smoother after I started the skin. I did not see much difference in my one or two sunspots. I  dont think it has much affect on dark spots but it is a supreme quality moisturizer no doubt about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream is slightly different then anything I used before. It is not sticky rather slimy. It does get absorbed in the skin after massaging for a while ( not too long though). I will recommend it to anyone although I am not exactly sure how would it be for extremely oily skin. I am stuck on the snail cream for rest of my life. On top of everything, ts reasonably priced as one bottle goes on for about two months even after lavish use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I dont like that it comes is jar packaging and I have to put my finger in the product every time I use it. Anyway go ahead and bye one, I dont think you would regret it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful cream. It&#x27;s more a gel consistency and slightly sticky but it soaks in quickly. It&#x27;s comes in a glass jar. For everyone saying this is not moisturizing enough: Remember to use an occlusive at night like Aquaphor, Vaseline or lanolin. I have dry skin and this is more than moisturizing enough, especially in the summertime. This gel cream is also meant to be used with the apmuole and the other matching skin care items from this line. I can&#x27;t vouch for any of the healing properties it claims yet, but I will be back in 30 days to edit my review. Also, I would like to know which seller people are ordering this from to receive samples.</li>
    <li> Great cream, will order again!</li>
    <li> I was excited to discover the power of the snail, but was disappointed that this made me get hives on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom as well as the matching eye cream from this brand. This cream is light but very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent which is  nice. My mom really loved this cream as soon as she tired it. Her skin looked amazing even after the first use it was very noticeable, Her skin tone appeared more even and some of the fine lines diminished. I&#x27;ve been running low and on my day/night moisturizer and my mom let me tested this out and i loved it too!!! My skin is on the sensitive side that if my skin doesn&#x27;t like something it will breakout right away, but that did not happen with this cream. My mom&#x27;s skin is on the dry/ combo side and mine is oily/combination with troubled skin. Usually when I wake up my face is so oily but with this stuff it really helped lessen the amount of oil I had and I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts :) I&#x27;m definitely going to order this cream for my self! This was a great buy!! Plus this arrived so quickly, Overall a very happy customer!!!</li>
    <li> Exceptionally fast delivery and the product was exactly what I wanted.Fantastic</li>
    <li> Safety seal 3/4 off with product leakage into lid and sides. Appears used.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference, will not buy again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving neutral feedback but at this time I have to.i&#x27;ve heard a lot about this cream (only good stories) so I decided to order it!Shipping was fast (got it one day before the estimated delivery).But the cream&#x27;s box was opened, so I felt like there is something wrong.The cream smells terrible!!And I checked the bottom and it&#x27;s expired (10/14/2013)it&#x27;s too light, too watery, not like the original gel cream! I tried on my hand and i can tell it has an awful texture and scent!!I&#x27;m soooo disappointed!!! It&#x27;s never happened before, i&#x27;m a frequent costumer on amazon and it was a really bad experience!!! Just wasted money! I feel like i just threw my money out of the window!!! I&#x27;ll NEVER order again from this seller!</li>
    <li> She swears by it 100%. She says it&#x27;s helped her skin clear up and become more supple, youthful (she&#x27;s 30). I think it gives her a pretty glow. I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more for our mothers for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the item.</li>
    <li> So far so good.I have a very sensitive skin and was afraid to try this cream. I am using it for almost a month now and I am very impress with it! It&#x27;s very light that make it observe very quick! So I will be continue to using it.</li>
    <li> Eknight-media delivered. I paid $21.94 for this, and Seller provided first class shipping via USPS though I&#x27;d only requested &#x27;standard&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in perfect condition, factory seal sticker intact, with manufacture (not expiration) date of February 11, 2014 printed on both package box and glass jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--And perhaps most importantly, NOT FAKE.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin in summer time, so it dries it well eliminating excessive oil and tighten the skin. It also irritates skin slightly so it brings more blood that improves the color.  but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this cream for a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your $,you do better to go out into your garden and find a slug.if you have a garden, if not buy an inversion machine.</li>
    <li> Very good cream! My skin feels very soft. Don&#x27;t let the snail putt you off, there is no smell whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product after reading all the reviews- it did make my skin look dewy and hydrated the first few days, but it is now dry as ever. I am peeling everywhere and no amount of moisturizing cream is alleviating the tightness. I know it&#x27;s this cream that did it since this is the only thing I have changed in my skin routine. For reference, I have combination skin with dryness on my cheeks - I also have rosacea. Best of luck to other users!</li>
    <li> I cant live without Mizon!!! Just like that.</li>
    <li> It broke me out. I really want to like it.. but after my first application, I got a whitehead- I thought okay thats fine. but that whitehead emerged to a cyst! Took me weeks to get rid of it :(</li>
    <li> this product i think is ok but i doesnt  like it coz , its open  they doesnt sealed the color&lt;br /&gt;i think they used it or what ?&lt;br /&gt;plus this product is it look really watery</li>
    <li> been using this thing for over 3 months now...didnt do anything for me, its not greasy or sticky it does absorbs nicely but as far as doing what it claim no! dark spots still exist, as for a moiturizer it might be ok but u &#x27;ll still need to use  a SPF on top of this. i dont recommend this product</li>
    <li> Excellent base product to use in my skin-care routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty awesome moisturizer, I have pretty oily skin so I&#x27;m always really skeptical of lotions, moisturizers, and the sort.Mostly because I end up having to wipe them off because they usually just gunk my face up. This product doesn&#x27;t do that, it absorbs into my skin seconds after application and leaves my skin very soft and fresh feeling. Be advised, you don&#x27;t need very much at all when applying, I use at most a fingertips worth. (like a quick little dabs worth)</li>
    <li> Disappointed because it arrived with the seal half open. Makes me think that the product was used beforehand.</li>
    <li> So this has been quite interesting.  I would highly recommend this.  I am 40 and often am told I look young for my age, however, I do have an inherited deep frown line between my eyes. This is pretty much stuck with me.  I do have some fine lines on my forehead as well.  But the horizontal lines on my neck are very noticeable. Just to give you a little background, I have been heavy into skin care and makeup for since I was younger and really into skincare as soon as I turned 28.  Just recently stopped smoking, but I have smoked since I was 15 off and on and then pretty steadily since I was 18. I started using this Mizon about 3 weeks ago and while I haven&#x27;t seen quite as dramatic the results and other women have seen, I have noticed some changes in the texture of my skin.  My pores are pretty large and I have noticed them getting a bit smaller so that my makeup doesn&#x27;t show quite as much.  I did use the 72% tube kind for a couple of weeks so that might be why I haven&#x27;t seen as much change as this jar has 94% of these, well, snail guts or whatever this is.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to heal their skin whether it be rosacea, acne proned or fine lines and wrinkles.  I do have a red light baby quasar laser I plan on using. I&#x27;m not sure how that will do or if it will accelerate the process, but I&#x27;ll be back to check in. 8/24/15 1st post</li>
    <li> The product Made my skin very soft. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky. Great product! Though I&#x27;m not sure the wrinkles are going away I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time. But it seems to be working!</li>
    <li> Best I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> EXcellent.  Really works. Amazing</li>
    <li> It is very good product and works on my skin. It makes the skin smooth and good on reaction of this product</li>
    <li> Good product. But could not give five star because it made my face extra dry. So I need to apply moisturizer lotion on top of this. So I am waiting for hot summer to use this cream.</li>
    <li> Love it. It helped to make pores smaller.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything  yet. Smells like cream though. So not bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister...it worked really well for her that she got one for herself when it finished...</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times.My skin is clear and blemishes have gone.  No pimples and it tightens your skin too.Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two weeks and it made my skin really dry.  I have to stop use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Great price as well</li>
    <li> The white covering is not a seal! It is simply a lid to prevent contents from leaking out. Please don&#x27;t misunderstand that Amazon is ripping you off, they&#x27;re not. I got my cream from G-Market, straight from the company, and the newly packaged cream has an expiration date, white lid, and no sticker. This sounds very sketchy (like REALLY) haha but I&#x27;m 100% sure this is MIZON&#x27;s new packaging :) plus, it works!</li>
    <li> Love this product it got rid of my blemishes and dark circles so fast . It gave me the confidence to go out without makeup</li>
    <li> Love it! And I&#x27;m a guy! Hehehe...</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly and leaves the skin smooth. It is a great base before you apply your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First off - I am done to a very very few products i can use on my face and this is one of them!  Not sure what this stuff is really made of so snail or not I really like it. Its a odd feeling and somewhat slime-ish texture but it goes away in a short time.  Who cares it works nicely! As others have said it doesn&#x27;t moisturize. It just helps even out the skin tone some.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy at all, but super moisturizing. And very gentle, not irritating on my sensitive and mixed skins.</li>
    <li> The cream is smooth, feels good when you apply it, and it is somewhat moisturizing, but it hardly does what it claims. I will not buy it again. I can find really good moisturizers for much, much less, which I can pair with a primer under make up or alone and still pay a fraction of what I paid for this snail cream.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay in comparison to Laniege or some of the other snail creams. It leaves a little film on the skin. Not sure if I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I buy this every month or so. I use it in the morning after I shower under my normal moisturizer and at night before bed. I like how it makes my face feel soft and not greasy. I have no problem rubbing snail-whatever on my face because this stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing properties. While it&#x27;s not quite as heavy as I need for my skin (or what I&#x27;m USED to, I should say), it&#x27;s a great part of my skin routine. There&#x27;s a very slight tackiness to it after I rub it into my skin, but that depends on how much I put on. Less is definitely more.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using it for almost a month now, and she really likes it! I haven&#x27;t seen any significant anti-aging signs yet, but her skin is visibly brighter and smoother. I am positive there will be even better results with continued use. The cream is gel like and has not affected my mother&#x27;s sensitive, oily skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Actually everyone, the reason you think it doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;authentic packaging&amp;#34; is because they have new packaging in 2014. They changed their packaging this year. So you got the real deal:)</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it works. I use it on my face and on a surgery scar. Get it</li>
    <li> I just love this. this make my skin so soft I had acne and doesnt make me break out</li>
    <li> Made my face super dry! Not good face cream. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing holy grail product. I have occasional cystic and embedded white head acne marked by hyperpigmentation and this has started clearing up my acne even after just using it for a few days my skin has dramatically improved.After taking antibiotics and using several other medications prescribed by dermatologists, this work better than all of them. It is literally drying up my pimples and whiteheads and my dark spots are getting lighter, but I do use a skin bleach for the dark spots which is also sold on amazon called Piona but I can tell this helps the product work better. My skin is smoothing out now too.I don&#x27;t know what it is about snails that heals skin but I wish I could have discovered this product a long time ago. I want to try the black snail cream next.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed, the ingredient is 92% snail extract. I think there needs to be a bit more skin living ingredients in tiger. It&#x27;s not bad just not impressive. I like it cosmetics c.f. cream abd the first ingredient in that purify is snail filtrate abd it is great on my oily but maturing skin. This stuff hmm not so much</li>
    <li> i think this product is scam, it doesnt smell like any other snail cream product that i have used in past. stay away!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if its even working. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 week and don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great under moisturizer.  My skin is smoother, softer and generally feels healthier.  Relatively inexpensive and matches or beats  the results other ultra-expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product after hearing about it.  I have combination skin with dry patches on my cheeks.  This cream did not hydrate my skin very much.  If anything I think it made it even more dry.  I stopped using it after a week or so.  But I may give it one more try during the summer months and see how my skin reacts to it.  Overall I do think it&#x27;s an interesting product, just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream!! I moved recently to the southwest desert, and this cream is great for this very dry climate.  Will definitely order again. And vendor sent it very quickly from Korea.</li>
    <li> When I first received the product, I noticed there was cream all over the inside lid and rim despite the plastic cover.  At first I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but then I began to notice the cream wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing and made my skin feel tight.  Upon further research I noticed some of the reviews on amazon questioned the authenticity of the product due to various reasons.  I&#x27;m not sure if my cream was tampered with, but I wanted to write a review so that people were aware.</li>
    <li> I put it on every night before i go to bed and i feel like it has been controlling my oily face and making it much brighter! It has also made my face so much softer and clearer. I&#x27;m loving this so far! The only weird thing is that it might be expired? idk, but on the back it says 05212014 then something written in Korean. I&#x27;m not sure..?</li>
    <li> Keeps acne scars and cuts at bay!!</li>
    <li> The Mizon All in one snail repair cream that I received within 3 business days did not seem authentic. The packaging had no holographic sticker on top and two of the 4 sides were totally different in writing/design when compared to the original one. This made me check my Mizon recovery gel cream that I had ordered a few days back. Since that was my first Mizon product and that packaging did have the holographic sticker, I didnt pay much attention to it at that time. However, when I checked my order, it turns out that that too was from the same seller and the tube looked completely different on its back side than what the original design and text it is supposed to have. Again, I am not sure whether these are fakes or not but there are a lot of pictures online from various bloggers who do have the original items. Amazon was really good about the refund, I appreciate that.  UPDATED on 01/15/15: The mizon website now has the official notice which can be seen at http://www.mizon.co.kr/CsCenter/help_notice.asp?brdn_num&#x3D;168 . They have posted info about the their products now being manufactured without the holographic sticker. I wish the company had taken the time and gone into a little bit more details about when they started doing it and what other changes they have made to the packaging, actual tubes and containers and maybe a list of those products too.   Since then, I have ordered the &#x27;Mizon All in one repair&#x27; cream from another vendor. It had a newer manufacturing date and no sticker. This time I opened the jar and carefully examined the cream and it seemed like a good consistency that I would expect snail mucus to be like, if you were to test a &#x27;line of small single thread&#x27; that forms with your finger and thumb. It doesn&#x27;t have any odor. I have been now using it for over a week, after I let my moisturizer soak in, once in the morning and then before going to bed at night. I am so happy to mention that I have seen an improvement in my skin. I had a few tiny round acne scars that have been there for many months but it is only now that they are noticeably fading. I am thrilled and will continue using this cream. I like this product so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hype is about.  My skin wasn&#x27;t bad before, but I see no difference in it from using it.  I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting - maybe smoother, brighter, plumper looking skin.  It&#x27;s as if I never bought it at all.</li>
    <li> I used this as a moisturizer and it doesnt make my face shine</li>
    <li> Package arrived a month later after ordering it. Little disappointed in the time. But the product itself.  Love it . It has evened out my skin and I have sensitive skin so I was nervous to try at first. Will buy again.. my skin is so much softer and more radiatint. .</li>
    <li> Decided to give it time before I reviewed this item...not what I thought it would. I&#x27;ve used snail creams before but this one has more of a stickier consistency. I didn&#x27;t see how this improved my skin at all, the next day it was still on it was not absorbed into my skin like the other ones. Personally,  I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel fresh. i haven&#x27;t found a face product that i actually love until this. i have a naturally oily face, and this is just amazing. My face feels fresh and oil free for long periods of time! highly recommend it</li>
    <li> actually it&#x27;s too early to tell but, after using it for a few days, I like it.  That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> ¡Excellent! Thank you for your attention</li>
    <li> This cream feels very luxurious and I enjoy using it.  It goes on smooth and leaves no stick reside, so I use it daily and nightly. I will say that at night, I suggest a heavier moisturizer on top such as a sleeping pack. I also put it on my neck. What most impresses me about this cream is that I have started using it three weeks ago, I have not had one single breakout (even my highly unavoidable monthly hormonal breakout). My skin looks clearer, younger, more even toned and more vibrant. Go snails!</li>
    <li> It took over a month to receive the product via shipping. When it was received, it was as pictured, untampered, and with a neutral smell. It goes onto the skin very lightly and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll keep using the product but question if I will re-order.</li>
    <li> I am African, mum had suggested to try snail cream to brighten my face. I always had a face at least 3 shades darker than my body. It is smooth, doesn&#x27;t have a smell to me. I have an oily skin and this product is not too heavy. I noticed my skin is smoother, the pores are getting smaller and my skin is getting brighter. I do use several products at the same time though, koji-San soap at night plus the snail cream. And morning, snail facial cleanser, truskin vitamin C serum plus snail cream and cream SPF 50. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It really moisturize my dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I wish they have a scented one. Definitely gonna buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it looked like it was partially used. The outside of the box was dented and when I opened up the box the lid was scratched up. When I opened the lid the product was slightly oozing from the container because the safety seal was half opened.</li>
    <li> It arrived with the expiration date overdue. I received it in September and the expiration date on it was july.... I wasn&#x27;t impressed whatsoever..</li>
    <li> I bought this product on July 4, 2014; it arrived a few weeks later (from Korea). The product is excellent, I use it with cold pressed coconut oil and get fantastic results. If used 2 x day (AM/PM) you will get 2 months use out of this one container. I paid $15.99 for this product and have noticed that the price goes up and down. You can go online and find it for much less than what Amazon is currently selling it for. I will buy this again; probably in the next week or two, but unless the price comes down I will be buying this elsewhere.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s better than the product I used before!</li>
    <li> at first I am very skeptical to use it coz I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s gonna happen next to my face never in my life that I&#x27;ve heard snail ingredients for face.. then one day I decided to give it a try and i am so happy for the result .  and now I&#x27;m not the only one using it even my daughter and my son using it .. The result for my son&#x27;s pimples it&#x27;s amazing he tried it once and the result was absolutely fantastic .. you know teens now a days has problem with their skin so I told him just give it a try and now his face is getting clearer and pimples are almost gone..</li>
    <li> Love this. I didn&#x27;t have bad skin before, but this makes it feel so much softer! I follow up with my usual regime of moisturizers, but I feel good about having this in my skin care routine. My mother noticed my skin was &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; and I was more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s doing something!</li>
    <li> do not let the name of this product scare you -- it was worked for me.  the product has been a part of my facial regime for almost a year now.  i have very dry skin (i use an oil based moisturizer to keep my skin moisturized) and am getting to that age where you start to notice little lines...  and i&#x27;m a skin care junkie.  although it says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all in one,&amp;#34; due to my dry skin, this product is not moisturizing enough for me.  however, the cream has drastically reduced my pores size, i do not break out as frequently and when i do, the breakouts are not as severe.  the product has a skin tightening effect as well.  the results have been great for me.  i do follow up with my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my young adult daughter tried the product as she really loves it as well.  the bottle lasts about 3 - 4 months so it&#x27;s a great price for the product quality.  i will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Very gentle product. My skin is very sensitive, and did not react to this cream at all. Do not notice too much of a difference, but it seems to balance out my skin. I like to apply it after my toner and serum though. I tried applying it first, but it just seems strange to me as the product is thicker than your toner and serum.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to really know if it&#x27;s working but so far my skin is appears clear and smooth, I douse a moisturizer with it. Yes, I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love korean makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, and it keeps my face well hydrated all day long. It has an unusual, slightly slimy feel, but I enjoy it. My skin is also brighter and clearer. I don&#x27;t really have breakouts, so by &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34; I mean more even skin tone. My somewhat sensitive skin also seems less oily since I began using this cream - fabulous! If you are reading this review - go ahead and buy this cream as you will not regret it!! I also use the MIZON Collagen Power Firming Eye Cream - every product that I have tried from this line is amazing, and well priced. One minor note - I wish these products came in a pump to avoid contamination!</li>
    <li> Loved how I received free samples with my order. Product is concentrated which I liked but seem to have made my skin more oily then it usually is. Overall probably not the best product for me.</li>
    <li> Good product, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes though.</li>
    <li> cant stop using this. it feels so nourishing and it prevents my breakout as well as helps with my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
    <li> To begin, I am a 21 year old light skinned female of Domincan/American decent.  I originally ordered the Mizon Snail Cream because I have been obsessed with Asian skincare and I wanted to get this moisturizing anti aging cream for myself and my mother. She does not use it but I love this product. I have suffered from acne since I was 12. My new skincare routine, including this beauty (plus the clarisonic and the Cure Natural Aqua exfoliate gel), has  drastically reduced my acne, shrunken my pores, and gotten rid of blackheads all together. The snail cream&#x27;s  formula is like a thick gel. I usually dip two fingers in and smooth that amount on my face, neck, and chest. It sinks into your skin in under a minute and is so moisturizing. I do not know if the anti aging claims are true but my skin is smoother, clearer, moisturized, and happy. My only complaint is that it took a while to get here but its coming all the way from Korea so one must understand. All that said, great product!</li>
    <li> It is and does what they say, the research being done suggests the same. Great product and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for normal to dry skin. I have very sensitive to problem skin. This did not work me but it did make my skin soft. I was worried this product would clog my pores.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I love it! This really changed the way of my skin from before.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd jar and no complains here.</li>
    <li> Not as amazing as it was made out to be. I get better results with glycolic acid creams. And vitamin c</li>
    <li> ALL IN ONE CREAM SO REFRESHING AND MOISTURIZING I AM A FAN ALREADY I CAN NOTICE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY FACE AND EVERYBODY ELSE NOTICE IT.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND DEFINITELY WILL CONTINUE BUYING IT FROM THIS SELLER, AMAZING SERVICE THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion or cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought way more expensive serums and lotions for my wedding skin prep a few months ago. But this is by far the best. I should&#x27;ve known this earlier. No residue, no feeling of dryness, In a minute it absorbes in the skin and feeling nothing left, but soft moisturized texture. I want to buy as many as I can and stock it.</li>
    <li> It felt fake so I stopped using it cuz I don&#x27;t wanna take a risk</li>
    <li> I bought this cream 3 times in 2014.  First time was in the first half of the year and the product was thick and moisturizing with the seal.  Second half of the year, I bought one for myself and my friend as a gift.  The product did not have a seal and was SUUUUPER watery!!! Not moisturizing at first.  How can the quality be SO diminished?  It had to be fake.  Beware buyers of beauty products on Amazon!!! Not all distributors are trustworthy.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. I usually wear this in the evening or in the morning--depending on what my skin condition is. If my skin is super dry, this goes on in the morning because I use a sleeping pack in the evening. This has helped even out my skin tone and I think my dark spots are even fading away--albeit very slowly. Whenever I get blemishes and the skin around the area is red, this cream always goes on at night.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent cream; it leaves your skin&#x27;s texture so smooth and soft. I really do love this on my face. I put it on every morning and night to maintain the smooth look.</li>
    <li> Interesting product...feels good on skin...moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift, and it seems great so far. Very smooth consistency, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. Faint neutral scent. Very pleasant to use. I&#x27;ve only tried it the one time, but my fiance swears by it now as part of her regular skincare routine. Compared to other snail goo, this one has the highest goo percent for the money so it seems like a good deal. Also (and this is important for gift purchases) the packaging is attractive and the little jar feels heavy and expensive. First impressions are that this is a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out with cysts. I had my hopes high on this but can&#x27;t use it because very first time I did, woke up to swollen face with about 5 cysts on it, not a good look.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this one for two years and will continue using it. Very good on my skin</li>
    <li> My mom suffers from dry skin and she says that the cream is working well on her.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t exactly seen any difference in my skin yet but it has only been two weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, not working as fast as some people listed. I suffer from acne and it has improved me as 55% in one month. I recommend it for people who have small outbreaks, for those who have acne like mine, (not with two buds and I) recommend that if you want something faster I find another thing, plus I have used several products and I think I have improved so quickly, this is not to say it&#x27;s not good. If it works but very slow or you see is because my acne is a bit more to what they call severe occasional outbreaks, according to my opinion. Another thing for people who have oily skin do not need an additional hidrantante and that if this cream is very thick and provides enough hydration, my skin is very oily and every morning amanesco with super oily skin, so this does not controls nor decreases sebum pores and for people with sensitive skin is very good, because my skin reacts anything and this cream does not happen. Recommendation for people with acne, there are times when you start a treatment seems worse than the acne, but be patient, I began treatment a month ago and the first week it looked like a cactus, but then desinflaman and see how slowly your skin adapts (From the good way)  If you purchase / Este producto es muy bueno, no funciona tan rápido como detallan algunas personas. Yo sufro de acne y me lo a mejorado un 55% en un mes. Lo recomiendo para personas que tienen pequeños brotes, para aquellas que sufren acne como el mio, (no con dos brotes y ya) les recomiendo que si quieren algo mas rapido busquen otra cosa, ademas yo lo he usado con varios productos y por eso creo que me ha mejorado en tan poco tiempo, con esto no quiero decir que no es bueno. Si funciona pero muy lento o tal ves es porque mi acne es un poco mas severo a lo que llaman brotes ocacionales,segun mi opinion . Otra cosa para las personas que tienen piel grasa, no es necesario un hidrantante adicional ya que de por si esta crema es muy espesa y da suficiente hidratacion,mi piel es muy grasosa y cada mañana amanesco con la piel super grasosa, asi que esto no controla sebo ni tampoco disminuye los poros y para las personas con piel sensible es muy bueno, ya que mi piel por cualquier cosa reacciona y esta crema no sucede. Recomendación para personas con acne, hay veces que cuando uno inicia un tratamiento parece que el acne empeora, pero tengan paciencia, yo comence el tratamiento hace un mes y a la primera semana parecia un cactus, pero luego se desinflaman y ves como poco a poco tu piel se va adaptando (De la buena manera) / Si lo volveria a comprar</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and this has taken a few lines out.  It&#x27;s smooth and smells great!  The container lasts a long time too.  I will order again and again and again....</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  It completely broke my face out.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! This skin care product is awesome!  It smooths the skin, closes your pores and my skin looks radiant. You can even use it on your neck and chest area where women most women over 50 show their age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product forever! I highly recommend it If you are over 50 you will only need to use this at night and then moisturize after you let it soak in for 15 minutes. If you use it more than that without moisturizing your skin will get too dry. Of course if you are under 50 you may be able to get away with using it morning and night but may still need to moisture after.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m in love.  Very smooth texture, been using it for about two weeks and have numerous compliments on how my skin is glowing, no one has ever said this to me.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my skin and you really don&#x27;t have to use a ton of product to get the job done. First attempt at Korean beauty products and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m a 20 something caucasian woman with combination skin that is just now showing tiny lines, not particularly aged yet, but I want to keep my skin glowing and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave this a gander, and I&#x27;d say overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It dries up my oily spots on my T-zone which makes it easier for my skin to stay matte during the day.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s actually helped to decrease the distinctness of the lines going from my nose to my mouth!! (Seriously!!)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s creamy, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Works pretty well for my sensitive acne prone skin.. I have not had any breakouts or additional redness, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it decreased my acne either.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way, and you get a TON of it for what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Certain areas on my skin do end up a little *too* dry, thus I would not recommend this product if you have dry skin or if you want to use it by itself. I would recommend moisturizing afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;- You have to dip your finger into the pan to get the product out, which could be a con for people who are a little apprehensive about that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying the product again, definitely!</li>
    <li> Will reorder.  Noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> Love it ! My skin is smoother!</li>
    <li> I was a little wary of putting a snail based product on my face, but was too intrigued to not try it. I am so happy with it. It glides on super easily and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin feeling moisturized but tight. It feels like a thin protective barrier on my skin. I purchased this because my skin which is typically on the drier side and very clear began breaking out in spots. I&#x27;ve seen an amazing improvement in just over a week of using the All-in-one cream. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Good transaction.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It made my pores smaller and my skin smooth.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a cream, it&#x27;s very light and watery feeling but after using this for a couple of weeks I am liking my skin.  My skin looks great, but if your looking for a moisturizer.. this won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Have not seen my skin repair yet, but it does great on keeping my skin moisten, I like that&amp;it has no perfumes in it liked that too!oh &amp; it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all !</li>
    <li> so great i really LOVE IT ♥</li>
    <li> So far, this is really, really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, shipping: I had no issues with the packaging or shipping of this item. I ordered it as a 2-pack with the black snail cream and they were both nestled happily in their boxes. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between this one and the black snail but since the price is good, i went with both. I think I will use this one for day and the other for night as the black snail cream gel goop is a touch thicker/more opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one I used right away this morning (after my shower, face wash, rosewater and rosehip seed oil, of course.) The jar is heavy, high-quality and looks really nice sitting on my bathroom counter. As for the gel...cream...stuff (it&#x27;s a funky hybrid of all of these descriptors, really.) it&#x27;s FAB. So far. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne-prone skin and many things can go wrong when using a new product. Usually, I can tell something might not be good for me right away but this seemed light and spread really nice while soaking in to a barely-sticky, satin finish. I don&#x27;t feel like a snail crawled over my face, though when tapping it out of the jar it did feel kinda sticky and weird in a fun way. It&#x27;s really easy to use too much. You just need to barely tap your (CLEAAAAN) finger into the stuff and then tap it around your face, then massage it in. Or you can use a beauty spatula or whatever to avoid touching the stuff in the jar but I&#x27;m not too finicky and I keep my hands pretty clean when doing my face up. I put on my makeup and stuff per usual and my makeup doesn&#x27;t feel weird or like its sliding around. it feels better than normal, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally have issues with surface dryness/scaliness so I will love to see how this stuff holds up to that but for my oily skin, its doing pretty well. Who know snail slime could be so cool? If it breaks me out like crazy or I turn into a giant snail, I will update at a later time!</li>
    <li> My skin not easily allergy, but this product does made my skin feels itch and  uncomfortable, also turns red and has mealas at face.  even i let my boyfriend tried. he felt the same way. if i can give 0 star i would! i dont know why so many people gives 5 stars.. thats is  unbelievable.</li>
    <li> First off, let me tell you that I NEVER write reviews for items I buy on Amazon. I simply buy what I need thar I&#x27;ve already got before and be on my way. Well, I recently bought this item on the hutch. I read a professional makeup artist opinion on this product online and I thought it would work for my patchy, tired looking, skin. My skin has looked like this most of my life, especially in the mornings and I thought it was normal. So I always strived to use makeup that made my skin look naturally healthy. But after using this product I can tell you my whole beauty regimen has changed. In just a week this amazing product made my skin look so healthy, even in color, and gave it a wonderful glow. My face is so nicely moisturized and soft. Now I hardly use NEARLY as much makeup as I used to before! I&#x27;m saving so much money on my expensive make up by this inexpensive product. Everyone has been complementing my complexion and saying I look so much younger. I highly recommend this to everyone!! Don&#x27;t second-guess this it&#x27;ll be one of the smartest purchases you will ever make. I wish I had a before and after picture from using this product but I didn&#x27;t think it would work this well.</li>
    <li> 4 stars for the product --- non-greasy, no fragrance and great percentage of snail mucin.  This was honestly my first foray into Korean skincare and now I&#x27;m hooked.  I only wish this product did not (1) contain vegetable oil; and (2) contain alcohol.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of snail mucin items (including Mizon recovery gel and Missha Snail cream) and I keep returning to this gel cream.  It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough by itself, but I saw improvements in wrinkle and clarity in my skin so it&#x27;s great if you layer a serum underneath or a light night cream over it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses now only creams that firm. Very pleased. Especially with this cream.</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy because of all the great reviews it has on here but once I tried it, I wanted to return immediately. The first few minutes, it made my face smooth but five minutes later, it made my face a little bit itchy at some spots. Because I was worried, I researched more about the product online. Most of the reviewers say that it didn&#x27;t have any positive or negative effects on their face. I researched more about the ingredients the products has and found out that it contains cetearyl alcohol that ranks 4/5 as a potential acne trigger and 3/5 as a potential irritant. It also contains Hydrogenated vegetable oil (3/5 as a potential acne trigger) and Triethanol amine that can also trigger acne.&lt;br /&gt;Im someone that has sensitive, combo, acne prone skin. This product is not for me and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who is the same. If you are interested in buying this product, do some research to make sure that the product you are buying is authentic as there are some products out there that are trying to pass of as the real thing.</li>
    <li> Results were clearly visible after two months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month with no noticable results</li>
    <li> In my opinion the product dries up my skin and it&#x27;s too expensive for such a small bottle.    Update: I just noticed the this product EXPIRED on 2013 and I bought it this year (2014) like June or something. Anyways, it&#x27;s expired; it says so at the bottom of the bottle. I would give 0 stars if I could. Do not BUY!</li>
    <li> It made me break out...and my skin felt dry.  I guess its just me because my mother uses it and she likes it.</li>
    <li> My skin is better! Perfect</li>
    <li> Amazing cream makes skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I love it :) Lasted for 3 months even though I used it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely you do see results in 10 days time. Skin tone looks soother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have bought the MIZON Black Snail All in One... yet to start using.</li>
    <li> WOW! After trying other brands such as Chanel (Hydra beauty - too much perfume and made me break out), Peonia (break out), Lancome (benefait multivital - made me break out occasionally - less than the other ones).&lt;br /&gt;MIZON is amazing. I have dry skin and sometimes it flakes but it also ends up breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it it dries on the skin, so don&#x27;t expect it to feel hydrated afterwards, it just leaves a protective kind-of film.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My skin seems to look better and more radiant since I started using this cream. No complaints here and it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Best Product ever used, this is a must-have in anybody&#x27;s routine!</li>
