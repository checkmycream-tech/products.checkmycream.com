<li> Used it for a few months, didnt help regrow any hair but that might work for someone else.  </li>
<li> I wash my hair daily and because it is so thin, the conditioner needs to stop it from looking oily.</li>
<li> Plus it will take shine away and make hair dull.</li>
<li> YOUR HAIR ISN&#x27;T AS THICK.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product.</li>
<li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
<li> Less than 10!!!!!</li>
<li> But this product was just disappointing.</li>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product I told my sisters about it .</li>
    <li> Do not use this out the shampoo on blonde hair! It will change your color to resemble a henna. Plus it will take shine away and make hair dull.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product. It has WAY too much fragrance, it smells good there is just way too much of it. Furthermore the second ingredient is alcohol this is horrifically drying to your hair. There are other alcohols in it too further down in the ingredients. This weighed my hair down and made it flat and dry with flyaways. Conditioner with multiple chlorides, alcohols, heavy fragrances and cones are exactly the opposite of what you want in a conditioner. I don&#x27;t know how this would help anyones hair. I&#x27;m not happy with this product. I also have reviewed the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#x27;re worried about hair loss vitamin E and biotin should be looked into or eat foods high in those vitamins. There are some fantastic beach sprays that &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair up too. But this product was just disappointing.</li>
    <li> Delivery is very good, thank you</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair shines after I use it, it&#x27;s too early to tell if it is actually helping my thinning hair to grow.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE GETTING OLDER AND YOUR HAIR ISN&#x27;T AS THICK.  I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE A GREAT HAIR PRODUCT FOR ME.  IT DOES HELP.</li>
    <li> Still using this product, results are positive so far.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep oil from hair. I wash my hair daily and because it is so thin, the conditioner needs to stop it from looking oily.</li>
    <li> Works well for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I already had the shampoo which I purchased at a grocery store as the last one in stock and on sale.  The shampoo worked so well that I decided to order the conditioner from Amazon.  The delivery was on time and the conditioner is as good as the shampoo.  My hair feels really good to touch&lt;br /&gt;and it already looks fuller.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product - hair is detangled but not weighed down.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does not do much for my hair.  Both the BIOTA shampoo &amp; Conditioner didn&#x27;t anything for my thinning hair, it is still as thin and shedding more than it was before.  I have used religiously now for 3wks.</li>
    <li> I heard about Biota Botanicals on my local radio news station. Great stuff! I am an African American woman who had been having a long standing problem (years) with my hair falling out and getting incredibly thin, so I figured what did I have to loose?  After years of expensive Dermatology visits and prescription shampoos and topical creams and ointments, and thinking that maybe it was just heredity, I found that after only 3 days of using Biota Botanicals products, my hair literally stopped shedding!!!!! I could actually count the hairs that fell out! Less than 10!!!!!! I was ecstatically impressed!!!!! I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
    <li> Used it for a few months, didnt help regrow any hair but that might work for someone else.  I didnt like it as a conditioner at all though, I think there are superior products out there.</li>
    <li> I am very please with this product and will continue buying it along with the biota serum</li>
    <li> this is a good one (it makes the hair ticker, better and smells good), but my hair sticks together and i loose hair while brushing it after the wash.</li>
    <li> Gentle conditioner with pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Softens hair without weighing it down.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog the pores on scalp</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shampoo ever</li>
    <li> Works for me , I just love it.</li>
    <li> My second order for this.  Love it and it is working for me.</li>
    <li> It is a good product to help your hair getting healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product smells great and actually works, my hair is thicker then it ever was.... I recommend Biota Conditioner</li>
