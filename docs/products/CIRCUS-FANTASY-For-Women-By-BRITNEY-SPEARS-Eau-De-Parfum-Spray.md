      <li>I am a huge B. S. perfume fan and this one is as great as the others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked all the Fantasy perfumes, but I&#x27;ve never seen Circus Fantasy in any store, therefore, I&#x27;ve never smelled it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something a bit more fruity, but that&#x27;s okay because this is a great scent.</li>
      <li>It smells nice.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot</li>
      <li>She had this perfume many years ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>Highly reccommend, definetely the best scent out of all of her perfumes made.</li>
      <li>it has a really great sweet smell to it and</li>
      <li>I purchased this scent because I have always loved the original fantasy scent.</li>
      <li>this will be very important come this summer.</li>
      <li>I love the bottle and will hold it for decorations.  </li>
      <li>the presentation of the bottle is lovely.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be okay</li>
      <li>I love foral and lavenders and roses (things like that)</li>
      <li>I love the sweetness that seemingly isn&#x27;t to overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Fantasy if you&#x27;re looking for something fruity as this is more floral</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and used it until it was gone.  </li>
      <li>I thought the spritzer was just stuck, so I bought a perfume bottle and pried off the top to pour the contents.</li>
      <li>I love all of Brittney Spears fragrances.</li>
      <li>so many compliments from everywhere</li>
      <li>Love this perfume .got</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume.  </li>
      <li>More than any perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Give it a try :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t LOVE it by any means.</li>
      <li>so if you want something fruity this is more of a sexy scent.</li>
      <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>I THINK I LOVE ALL PERFUME THAT SMELL</li>
      <li>And more of a day time or afternoon scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would love to purchase from PerfumeNet again</li>
      <li>I know she will love it</li>
      <li>Bought as a gift and was delighted that it was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>There is something about it that makes it more grown up than it sounds, it&#x27;s got an almost clean feel to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda sweet but way more citrus than anything else.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this on Amazon for such a great price.</li>
      <li>Scent and smell are pretty subjective, so for what it&#x27;s worth, I think it smells nice</li>
      <li>I ordered this one without smelling it first because I love Britneys Radiance perfume.</li>
      <li>Perfume original tal cual la descripción, sumamente conforme</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to everyone to give as a gift to that special lady in his or her life.</li>
      <li>Hard to get so was very happy.</li>
      <li>This perfume smells amazing on pretty much anyone, it&#x27;s not over baring or gaudy in anyway.</li>
      <li>SWEET</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love Circus Fantasy.  </li>
      <li>so this perfume, is sweet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet</li>
      <li>BECAUSE I SEEM TO ALWAYS BUY SWEET SMELLING STUFF</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about buying a perfume without smelling it first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so crisp and light.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant while choosing a perfume, but I chose it, and it was sweet, fresh, and everyone gives me compliments when I wear it.</li>
      <li>It is a good middle ground for someone who&#x27;s trying to get away from sweet scents but isn&#x27;t quite ready!</li>
      <li>The original and Hidden Fantasy are two of my favorite perfumes, Island and Midnight are both pretty great as well, so I guess I had high hopes for Circus.  </li>
      <li>but actually I just love Britney Spears perfumes period!</li>
      <li>but, honestly I wanted something that would last on my skin</li>
      <li>The best thing is that the price is really far for the size, as other stores over charge for the large bottle.</li>
      <li>This actually reminds me a lot of Amor Amor by Cacharel, but with a more fun and fruity feel.</li>
      <li>the buy yo *)</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 fragrances from Britney and they only make me want more</li>
      <li>I even used it when I got married.</li>
      <li>It came perfectly, nothing wrong with it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t sure about which perfume to buy or someone who wants a new scent.</li>
      <li>I remembered an old roommate of mine that wore B.Spear&#x27;s Original Fantasy</li>
      <li>A few sprays isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong, and it seems to last a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>Another good thing about it was that not many people our age wanted to wear it.</li>
      <li>I am very particular about what I smell like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Say or think what you want about Britney, she knows a good scent! This is one of my signature scents. Love it! Timely shipping too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.. Great price for amount</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever! Smells like a little peice of heaven ♡&lt;br /&gt;  I get so many compliments on this perfume.  More than any perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn.  Strangers at the grocery store stop and tell me how good I smell.  It&#x27;s crazy....lol.</li>
    <li> I had been searching and searching for something that myself and my husband likes. I love foral and lavenders and roses (things like that) he HATES them! He likes fruit, sweets and things that remind him of food. Of course, he is a man lol So I looked ALL OVER and took a good week reading reviews of purfumes that women liked. I was going to go with Philosophy&#x27;s Cinnamon Roll 3 in 1 product but, honestly I wanted something that would last on my skin and I didn&#x27;t wanna smell like a bakery all darn day! I remembered an old roommate of mine that wore B.Spear&#x27;s Original Fantasy and she always smelt so alluring and noticable. It WAS HER scent! Another good thing about it was that not many people our age wanted to wear it. So after reading the major notes in all the different varieties of B.Spears purfumes I settled on Circus Fantasy. I AM SO SO HAPPY I DID! I love the sweetness that seemingly isn&#x27;t to overpowering at all. It also doesn&#x27;t go sour on my skin or in the heat and for living in Illinois this will be very important come this summer. 1-2 sprits and I am good all day! My husband loves it. He says I smell like his favorite blood orange sorbert (slightly bitter undertones in the citrus and the sweetness of honey) I am very satified to say, I have finally found my scent! AND I love surprising people when they compliment me (which they do quite often!) that I&#x27;m wearing a Britney Spear purfume. PROPS!!</li>
    <li> I THINK I LOVE ALL PERFUME THAT SMELL SWEET AND I THINK I LIKE THEM AND ALOT BECAUSE I SEEM TO ALWAYS BUY SWEET SMELLING STUFF AND THIS FITS THE BILL SO IF YOU LIKE CANDY LIKE SMELLS IT&#x27;S FOR YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Spells really good. Like candy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent because I have always loved the original fantasy scent. This is very different. It is a scent that you will have to get used to. Tolerable.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife and she loves it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this perfume for years now and I finally had the opertunity to buy it. Unfortunately when I started wearing it my nose and throat started burning, sneezing like crazy and my head feels really light . I&#x27;ll be sadly returning it as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about buying a perfume without smelling it first but I will surely be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> Bummer.  I really wanted to love Circus Fantasy.  The original and Hidden Fantasy are two of my favorite perfumes, Island and Midnight are both pretty great as well, so I guess I had high hopes for Circus.  Once I received the perfume, my hopes crashed and burned. Smelled rather average to me, like a billion other floral perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled in my lifetime. And I&#x27;m not a floral perfume lover. I was hoping to smell the &amp;#34;sugar-coated raspberry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;violet candy&amp;#34;, but instead I only smell flowers and just a hint of citrus in the background (which is the only thing still making this a wearable perfume for me). Oh well, guess I can&#x27;t love &#x27;em all!</li>
    <li> Great perfume @ a awesome price but actually I just love Britney Spears perfumes period!</li>
    <li> I got this back in 2009 for a birthday present and instantly fell in love with it! It is a good middle ground for someone who&#x27;s trying to get away from sweet scents but isn&#x27;t quite ready! The scent is a little sweet, sexy &amp; very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Britney Spears perfumes and this one differentiates itself by not have an overbearing sweet scent that makes me want to eat baked goods. The scent also lasts for a long time which is a huge plus. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and I must say this is a great perfume!</li>
    <li> Smells grewt doesnt last long</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes and it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to find it anywhere in stores anymore. It&#x27;s so crisp and light. It&#x27;s especially beautiful during the warmer months because it smells so fresh. I get tons of compliments on this and it lasts forever. I was so excited to find this on Amazon for such a great price. I will definitely repurchase when I run out again.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;m very happy that I ordered it! Thank you so much,</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Its a must have for all ladies. I would recommend this to everyone to give as a gift to that special lady in his or her life.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good I get compliments all the time. It&#x27;s not too sweet so if you want something fruity this is more of a sexy scent.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant while choosing a perfume, but I chose it, and it was sweet, fresh, and everyone gives me compliments when I wear it. The seller was great too. It came perfectly, nothing wrong with it. I would love to purchase from PerfumeNet again</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say whether I like this or not since I bought it for my former step daughter.  I know she will love it so that&#x27;s all that matters to me!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it is one of the few I have finished a bottle of and repurchased and definitely the only celebrity fragrance that I&#x27;ve liked this much. On me this is sweet raspberry and fluffy cotton candy with a bit of citrus. There is something about it that makes it more grown up than it sounds, it&#x27;s got an almost clean feel to it. This actually reminds me a lot of Amor Amor by Cacharel, but with a more fun and fruity feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for either her birthday or Christmas.  She had this perfume many years ago and loved it.</li>
    <li> Read my previous review for Britney Spears Midnight Fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the same exact way for this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one if you&#x27;re a fan of Britney.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon reviewers please let me know if Island Fantasy is good. Been wanting to buy that one.</li>
    <li> Last&#x27;s about 4-6 hours!! Great, light scent! Highly reccommend, definetely the best scent out of all of her perfumes made.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume .got so many compliments from everywhere I wore this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked all the Fantasy perfumes, but I&#x27;ve never seen Circus Fantasy in any store, therefore, I&#x27;ve never smelled it. $20 for the 3.3 oz bottle seemed like such a good deal (considering a bottle like that can usually cost double in stores), I figured I&#x27;d just order it. Scent and smell are pretty subjective, so for what it&#x27;s worth, I think it smells nice (I wouldn&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell in any technical sense). A few sprays isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong, and it seems to last a good amount of time. If you&#x27;re a fan of the Fantasy line, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent a lot- not too much or too little. I was hoping for something a bit more fruity, but that&#x27;s okay because this is a great scent. I would recommend Fantasy if you&#x27;re looking for something fruity as this is more floral</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie I tried the regular Fantasy Britney Spears only because I was a die hard Britney Fan. Loved it though. I even used it when I got married. I&#x27;ve tried almost all the other Britney perfumes but the Circus Fantasy is my favorite. It&#x27;s my Husbands too. I haven&#x27;t used a different one in years!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiancee, and she loves it. It smells nice.</li>
    <li> This was the worst waste of money I&#x27;ve ever spent. It smells terrible. I ordered jugding by the reviews &amp; since the pink one I had I thought this would be okay but it is HORRIBLE!!!!! Nasty smell that you cannot burn off. Ughhhhh.</li>
    <li> one of my favorites because the scent is so different from everything else. the presentation of the bottle is lovely.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and was delighted that it was exactly as advertised.  Hard to get so was very happy.</li>
    <li> Excelente calidad, se les recomienda 100%, llego en perfectas condiciones el pedido. Perfume original tal cual la descripción, sumamente conforme</li>
    <li> so this perfume, is sweet. But it&#x27;s got a bunch of different notes, so each one kinda comes up at it&#x27;s own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely like her perfumes before you get this. It&#x27;s not for everyone, i&#x27;d say under age 35. And more of a day time or afternoon scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bottle too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 fragrances from Britney and they only make me want more</li>
    <li> but i am not sure it is genuine because it doesn&#x27;t last long. the other britney perfumes I have had last all day. Maybe it was diluted or something?</li>
    <li> I think the roller has a bit different smell but I like it, the roller is a little more musky</li>
    <li> I ordered this one without smelling it first because I love Britneys Radiance perfume. I like this one but I don&#x27;t LOVE it by any means. It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s kinda sweet but way more citrus than anything else. Was hoping for something sweeter. Lasting power is alright.</li>
    <li> i love it! its a medium sized bottle that will last along time! hehehe thanks 4 the buy yo *)</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing! I am a huge B. S. perfume fan and this one is as great as the others. The best thing is that the price is really far for the size, as other stores over charge for the large bottle.</li>
    <li> Box was sealed, but the bottle inside was empty. Like…..EMPTY. I thought the spritzer was just stuck, so I bought a perfume bottle and pried off the top to pour the contents. There was nothing to pour. :(</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend and she says she likes a lot. I liked it a lot so I got the roller.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume it has a really great sweet smell to it and the price is really great for the size.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT ARRIVED IN THE ESTIMATED TIME AND WELL PACKED SO I RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and used it until it was gone.  I love the bottle and will hold it for decorations.  Lovely scent for the summer or for day all year round!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s hard to find, so I always order her another bottle whenever her birthday or Christmas is coming up.</li>
    <li> All her perfumes are wonderful.always get alit of compliments</li>
    <li> I am very particular about what I smell like. This perfume smells amazing on pretty much anyone, it&#x27;s not over baring or gaudy in anyway. It works for everyday or an evening out. I highly recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t sure about which perfume to buy or someone who wants a new scent. This in my go to perfume, the bottle is really sturdy and doesn&#x27;t leak in my purse. Give it a try :)</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and i am 43 and love it!!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Love this perfume!</li>
    <li> You are selling a great product that I will continue to buy.  I love all of Brittney Spears fragrances.</li>
