    <li> This is wonderful cleanser and the cheapest place to purchase</li>
    <li> Pervonia products are the best - Gentle cleanser is great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 15 years and I love it.  I use it in combination with the toner spray and the cream.. I have very few wrinkles for 62 and attribute much of that to this product.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for my skin. I love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Really helps my rosacea when I use with the other Pevonia products for rosacea.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the face cream, toner &amp; lotion by  Pevonia.  This rosacea product line is the only one I&#x27;ve found that gives me any kind of relief.  It really helps to tone down the redness &amp; the itching.  This helps me feel good about my skin!</li>
    <li> Great product for the control of  Rosacea.  Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.</li>
    <li> beautiful product for sensitive skin - clears face and smells beautiful. highly recommended I use the other products (enzyme &amp; moisturizer)</li>
    <li> Pevonia skin care system in the R2 line is good for Rosacea.  I have used it for years and is does help with the redness that accompanies the skin condition.  This item is one of a three part system that I use daily.  I can tell the difference in the texture of my skin also when I stop using it.  It is a costly system so the products are not easily available locally so I have had to come to Amazon to find the products often at a less expensive price than I would have paid retail locally when the shops still carried it.  It is getting harder to find.  I don&#x27;t know if that is because of the cost or product contents.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the product because it isn&#x27;t the item I actually wanted to buy... I meant to purchase the Pevonia RS2 Lotion ( I don&#x27;t use the cleanse) but your company won&#x27;t let me return &amp; exchange it for the correct one.</li>
    <li> While I do not have rosacea, I do have very sensitive skin and this cleanser works perfectly for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too overpriced, the cleanser works, but again the price is way too high.</li>
    <li> smelled funny.  i have used this product for years, and this smelled GROSS.  i will not purchase off line again</li>
    <li> Nothing harsh about this product.  I use the moisturizer as well and my sensitive skin feels better than it has in a lomg time.</li>
    <li> I chose this product as it had a good review for helping skin with rosacea&lt;br /&gt;and my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> This product is great for Roscea. I have tried other expensive products recommended by my doctor but I keep going bacck to Pevonia.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, nice feel, nice lathering on the skin, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> great item.  fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,Value and Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Very gentle and wonderful product.  I use it almost daily and never have any problems with my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Have desperately trying to find something to use with my extremely sensitive rosacea. Everything I&#x27;ve tried either were too harsh, or felt like I was washing my face using Vaseline. This is perfect. Cleans gently and rinses off without over-drying.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this cleanser has improved my rosacea, but it cleanses well and feels calming on the skin. I can&#x27;t use most skin products at all, so it&#x27;s nice to find something that feels this nice. The care cream in this line is also very nice.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my face. I have tried a lot of products and this one is the best.Great .Great product!!</li>
    <li> Been using Pevonia products for 20 years. Any time a try something else, for say savings or convenience, I regret it and return to the best match for my skin. Natural ingredients makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Try other products, but always go back to Prevonia.&lt;br /&gt;Am a Senior with dry skin and it keeps my skin fresh looking.</li>
    <li> Love it. Has kept my really bad rosetia on my face under control, I have not had to use mirvaso anymore.... I strongly recommend it. Love it</li>
    <li> It has a great although I do prefer the exfoliating cleaners</li>
    <li> This is the best there is.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a gentle cleanser that leaves your&lt;br /&gt;face feeling smooth and non oily, tho is it.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps it from getting dry in winter too.</li>
