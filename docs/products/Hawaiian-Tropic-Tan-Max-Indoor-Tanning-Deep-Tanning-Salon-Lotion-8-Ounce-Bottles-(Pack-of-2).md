      <li>Nonetheless, I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
      <li>You can get something better.</li>
      <li>love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff actually works great!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used an indoor tanning lotion before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>It gave my fair skin a golden tan</li>
      <li>Scent is just ok.</li>
      <li>This is just ok, I would look for something better.</li>
      <li>Try it what can it hurt! :)</li>
      <li>Excellent product for a low price.</li>
      <li>love it for indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about as helpful as tanning out in the sun with baby oil on, except it is of course indoor safe.</li>
      <li>This lotion is a bit thicker and needs to be rubbed in more</li>
      <li>The smell is okay, not as tropical or fragrant as their outdoor lotions</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I can tan in the sun for a couple of afternoons and get more brown than this.</li>
      <li>30 minutes with this did more than those 2 weeks without it.</li>
      <li>but wasn&#x60;t sure what to do about it</li>
      <li>I have always been able to tell the difference from tanning without the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Using this lotion for about 4 sessions of 10 minutes each, it gave me nice light brown tan I wanted.</li>
      <li>I Have been using it for years  and am quite pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and glad that I found something that is cheap to purchase and works well for</li>
      <li>I was becoming more and more dissatisfied with my ashie brown tanning bed color</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t tan that easy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how many good reviews this product has.</li>
      <li>this one is NOT a bronzer, simply good stuff for your skin &amp; all the right ingredients to increase your own skins rate of producing a natural tan, just like the designer brands for &amp;</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it would work well or not for those who have extremely light skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
      <li>however, it glides on with little effort, leaves no residue, smells wonderful,</li>
      <li>I have gotten many compliments on my tan and the golden glow in my face when I use it.</li>
      <li>though I would stay away from cheap bronzing tanners (notorious for dorito  orange, not to mention staining clothes &amp; furniture)</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it smells like cheap body lotion.</li>
      <li>I was showing that rich golden reddish tan I loved so much.</li>
      <li>It was more watery feeling and absorbed quickly on my skin.  </li>
      <li>give me a great color that lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>- you barely smell it which is good.  </li>
      <li>Hawaiian Tropic is still my favorite ;)</li>
      <li>I, Like it becomes it gives me a great golden tan that last a while</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and sensitive and have ALWAYS purchased high quality, top of the line salon products.</li>
      <li>My skin is tanning more evenly thanks to this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have searched and searched for a good \\&quot;non bronzer\\&quot; indoor tanning lotion and finally found it when I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
      <li>You know how most lotions or moisturizers if you coat too much</li>
      <li>but will go back to a better lotion that cost more.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, but tropical to encourage you to use it every time you tan.  </li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hands.  </li>
      <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Hawaiian Tropic tan max goes on quickly and evenly without any oily feel.  </li>
      <li>All in all this product works but is no comparison to the higher end lotions that are available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say its a good product to prevent dry skin from tanning and for the price worth looking into if you&#x27;re in the market for a non-bronzing lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great.  went on good and a .&lt;br /&gt;little.goes along way.  I would recomend this product to anyone using an indoor tanning booth</li>
    <li> I have used the Hawaiian Tropic Tan Max Indoor Tanning lotion for over three years.  I have always been able to tell the difference from tanning without the lotion.  It is lightweight and easy to apply.  The scent is mild, but tropical to encourage you to use it every time you tan.  I have gotten many compliments on my tan and the golden glow in my face when I use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and feels good on my skin.  It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hands.  My skin is tanning more evenly thanks to this lotion.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works good. I can tell a difference when tanning with or without this lotion. Scent is just ok. It does go on white and takes a bit of rubbing in, but for the price I would probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and sensitive and have ALWAYS purchased high quality, top of the line salon products. Getting tan has been a challenge for me. I ordered designer Skin Luminary online because of all the great things I have heard about it. I picked up a bottle of this to tide me over until my order arrived... AMAZING RESULTS!!!! Best ever! The real proof though is in the ingredients. It contains all of the essential ingredients needed in an indoor tanning lotion and ingredients that are contained in the higher end products. Key ingredients are Tyrosine, Riboflavin, Aloe, cocoa butter, Vit A,E, Collagen, phospolipids.The ingredients are what get you tan. Beyond that, most companies work really hard to make a fancy bottle and it&#x27;s all about the marketing. This product is in a rather ugly bottle but that is probably how they can afford to sell it so cheap!!! In addition I usually dry out in the tanning bed and my husband has commented on how soft and velvety my skin feels. This lotion is a bit thicker and needs to be rubbed in more but I also think that makes it go further. Salon owners do not want you to know about this stuff or they will lose money!!! Try it what can it hurt! :)</li>
    <li> good for a cheap end tan lotion</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for a good \\&quot;non bronzer\\&quot; indoor tanning lotion and finally found it when I stumbled upon this product.  While I love the color a good bronzer gives...I found it just didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like and that it would come off on my clothing leaving an uneven tan.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I apply it before leaving for the salon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the outcome.  Yes, as other reviews stated, it isn&#x27;t as thick as some lotions and oils however, it glides on with little effort, leaves no residue, smells wonderful, is economical and gets the job done by leaving a more natural color/tone versus those products with bronzers.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how well this indoor lotion works, considering it is MUCH cheaper than most of the lotions on the market and could be purchased at a local drug store. I have a medium skin tone and have only tanned for 4 sessions and am already noticing similar results to 4 sessions with a premium brand of lotion. No difference whatsoever. The lotion is sort of watery, though, but I&#x27;m not complaining because this means that a little goes a long way and it applies very easily. No streaking. No orange, Doritos looking tan. And no shimmer/glittery mess that turns the skin a weird color. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and glad that I found something that is cheap to purchase and works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this has any bronzing agents in it (i.e. - 25x, 50x bronzer) so I don&#x27;t know if it would work well or not for those who have extremely light skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily. I tan in less than a week, so this review may be a little biased. Nonetheless, I love it. Works great. Smells great. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion and used it for my base tan in a tanning bed and I gotta tell you - this one does the job. I am white girl and I don&#x27;t tan that easy, it usually starts with burn haha. Using this lotion for about 4 sessions of 10 minutes each, it gave me nice light brown tan I wanted. I never burned and lotion goes on skin very smoothly.   I like this lotion cause it is thin, so it is very easy to apply and it is NOT OILY, NOT GREASY, it applies so easy!     You know how most lotions or moisturizers if you coat too much you get lots of it on skin and lotion just doesn&#x27;t absorbs, it stays as a white coat, you cant rub it in, you know. Well this lotion ABSORBS SO QUICKLY and melon scent is very nice and very light - you barely smell it which is good.  If you don&#x27;t want or simply can&#x27;t afford crazy expensive Tanning salon lotions, but you need one cause you HAVE to stay MOISTURIZED in a tanning bed - you might like this one.  It worked for me (:    P.S.: tanning salon workers may tell you that this lotion would damage their acrylic beds because it has mineral oil. But it says on the bottle \\&quot;TANNING BED PROVEN, CONTAINS NO MINERAL OIL\\&quot;. They still might not let you using it. Of course they want you to spend 80$ on lotion they sell. Just keep it to yourself and good luck!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is runny and I saw no results after using it for a week. You can get something better.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Doesn&#x27;t  stain hands.  Pleasant  smell.</li>
    <li> HT used to make a indoor/outdoor tanning spray in a blue bottle that was 100% better than this stuff. It gave my fair skin a golden tan and it smelled wonderful. This is just ok, I would look for something better.</li>
    <li> This is great for out door tanning, I used in tanning bed with little to no results</li>
    <li> Honestly, for one, I don&#x27;t even know why this stuff is almost ten bucks on amazon! I bought a bottle at the grocery store a month ago for nine dollars and some change, didn&#x27;t have to worry about shipping and handling or anything. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for you. It&#x27;s about as helpful as tanning out in the sun with baby oil on, except it is of course indoor safe. I used it in a low pressure bed. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it smells like cheap body lotion. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you are not looking to get a deep tan. It does help achieve a light base tan however.</li>
    <li> Hawaiian Tropic tan max goes on quickly and evenly without any oily feel.  Only thing if left in the car in colder climates it can freeze up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many indoor tanning lotions from $10 to $60 per bottle and this one is by fat the best one I&#x27;ve tried. It has a pleasant smell (doesn&#x27;t stink or make me feel nauseous), I can see great results in just a couple of tanning sessions and I have never looked even the slightest bit orange while using it. I have olive skin and just 2-3 sessions with this give me a great color that lasts a long time. My feet usually tend to tan a lot slower, so after I finish my session I do another 15 minutes with just my legs in the tanning bed and the color afterwards is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a year now and for as long as I can buy it, I will not use anything else. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Got the product in great time.  So far I have had absolutely no problem with the product.  It is not greasy or oily and it has allowed me to tan faster than other lotions. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because of the price.  It is a good size but I really did not see any results after using it.  The smell was kind of strange to me and I did not like smelling it for the whole time I was in the bed.  Since I already had my base color, maybe it would work better for someone who was just starting to tan.  It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome!  Great price, and I have never tanned so well!  I am so tan now, some of my friends are jealous!</li>
    <li> Good quality indoor tanning lotion.  Good smell, not too \\&quot;tanning lotion-y.\\&quot;  Works fairly quickly without skin getting red or orange.  I would recommend this for people who are new to indoor tanning.  Excellent product for a low price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably used 80 different tanning lotions. I bought this from a drug store hoping it would help me tan. I have fair skin and used this every time before I went into a tanning bed. I&#x27;m surprised at how many good reviews this product has. I had absolutely no results.</li>
    <li> It stinks and I don&#x27;t think it works well.</li>
    <li> Works great. I would buy it again. I bought two bottles of it. Gets you nice and dark with out making you dry.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It helped me get a very nice tan. I have no complaints about this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smell is a little strange when putting on, but smell is gone before you are out of tanning bed.notable color first time.not dark but you will know it worked.</li>
    <li> Price was great i bought a 2 pack i believe and used under tanning bed at gym, has a lil smell to it  just barely notice it myself , but on the light side.  I tan with stuff nothing extreme either so it&#x27;s working as intended would recomend. it goes on nice too  not greasy or anything.</li>
    <li> Great smell, economical but doesn&#x27;t bring a deep dark tan as I would of liked.</li>
    <li> As most of the indoor tanning lotions are a) outrageously expensive and b) contain a bronzer, it was refreshing to find one on Amazon which met neither of those criteria. I&#x27;ve used T2 Max now on four different occasions, and while I do think it provides a nice moisturizing element I&#x27;ve not noticed much by way of incremental tanning / darkening relative to not using any lotion at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say its a good product to prevent dry skin from tanning and for the price worth looking into if you&#x27;re in the market for a non-bronzing lotion.</li>
    <li> I had a base tan but wasn&#x27;t getting any more brown. I bought this hoping for results. After nearly 6 tan sessions using this product, I don&#x27;t notice any change. I can tan in the sun for a couple of afternoons and get more brown than this. Unfortunately I live in the NW and it&#x27;s winter now.</li>
    <li> I Have been using it for years  and am quite pleased with the product. It work well and is not available everywhere.</li>
    <li> Lotion did not smell like typical Hawaiin Tropic. Fragrance was not appealing.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff since it was a cheap, tan intensifying lotion, &amp; didn&#x27;t have bronzer (good for base tans &amp; ensures no orange look. Bronzers are what cause orange). So knowing that it SHOULD help prep my skin for tanning faster &amp; my natural skin color would darken, not orange, I felt it was a safe bet for the price. IT WAS! It does exactly what it is supposed to, smells good, gives good color, helps keep my skin from drying out. I tanned outside for prom, &amp; after 2 weeks of nothing I was looking for an indoor tanner lotion to use outside to help speed things up safely (without laying out to burn for a couple hours). 30 minutes with this did more than those 2 weeks without it. I got a great tan!&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people say salons won&#x27;t allow it b/c it&#x27;s hard to clean off beds. It does have just a bit of lanolin (natural moisturizer from sheep wool), which would be hard to clean if you used too much &amp; were very sweaty in the bed. If you don&#x27;t use too much &amp; don&#x27;t sweat your brains out then they will probably be OK with it (except for the part where they can&#x27;t make any money selling you other lotions!) Although I haven&#x27;t tanned in salons.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I would stay away from cheap bronzing tanners (notorious for dorito  orange, not to mention staining clothes &amp; furniture) this one is NOT a bronzer, simply good stuff for your skin &amp; all the right ingredients to increase your own skins rate of producing a natural tan, just like the designer brands for &amp;50-$100. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now october, I have tanned all year. Even having purchased some other lotions, I still use this one the most in my rotation of lotions. It just gives me better, natural color. I only use my bronzer lotion if I want to add a gold hue to the nice deep brown this one gives. Hawaiian Tropic is still my favorite ;)</li>
    <li> T-max works well -&lt;br /&gt;I can develop a very deep, bronze tan in no time.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback? Slightly greasy-like lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this! It was inexpensive and I have good experiences with the outdoor tanning lotions from Hawaiian tropic so I thought I&#x27;d try this! I went in the bed today! I got a really nice tan from it and I&#x27;ve only used it once so ill see what the progress brings me! The smell is okay, not as tropical or fragrant as their outdoor lotions but it didn&#x27;t leave an after smell of anything on me after I tanned! Woot woot</li>
    <li> love it for indoor and outdoor tanning. non greasy and smells really good, like your on the beach. I recommend</li>
    <li> Not the best texture , it stays white on your skin and you have to rub it over and over again to be absorbed. I don&#x27;t like the smell either!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking i was going to get the product pictured but received the older brand of it.  It smelled nasty...has a musky old gross smell to it! I wish i would have received the product that was pictured to me it was false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I have used Hawaiian Tan Max indoor Tanning, for a long time, and to me it is as good as those expensive lotions they sell at the Tanning Salon&#x27;s.  So, please try it before you put out the high prices,for the lotions, they sell at the Salon&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an indoor tanning lotion before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I went tanning every day for a month and used about half the bottle, so I feel it&#x27;s a good value in that I&#x27;m not using a TON of lotion and running out quickly. I would apply the lotion about an hour prior to getting into the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit greasier than I like when applying to my skin, leaving a residue that I could feel for hours after I&#x27;d gone tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really get as dark as I&#x27;d thought I would but it definitely kept my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a little overwhelming when you first apply it but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works but is rather thick and comes off when you use the bed from sweating. Good price but will go back to a better lotion that cost more. All in all this product works but is no comparison to the higher end lotions that are available.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I have been tanning for almost 3 months now and wanted tccget a darker deeper tan soci thought i would give this a try. Well first off it is SO hard to rub in, secondly the smell smells like dirty wet wormy rain and thirdly it makes you bright orange. Again DO NOT buy this !!!!</li>
    <li> Product is non greasy (a plus), but takes a while to be absorbed in the skin (a minus). It does the job of enhancing your tan (a plus) and it has a pleasant odor (also a plus), but I&#x27;m not so sure that it is the best product out there to do the job (a minus). However, for the price, it is definitely adequate!! Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again, but I&#x27;m not planning to return what I bought. I will continue to use it until I finish it.</li>
    <li> It is a good value compared to the ridiculously overpriced options at the salon. Just wanted to get some color before I went to Florida and it seemed to do the job, however I think the benefits of these lotions are a bit overstated.</li>
    <li> Indoor tanning is dangerous and toxic. People should not go tanning in tanning beds nor should they use this awful product.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but thats about it. It&#x27;s not a very good moisturizer in my opinion.  It was more watery feeling and absorbed quickly on my skin.  I did see some improvement in my base tan but i am not sure how much this product really helped. I have had better results with other lotions.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works great!  Better than the $100 lotions sold at tanning salons and doesn&#x27;t turn you into an oompa loompa.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> bought this not knowing if it would work,but it gave me a deep hawaiian tropic tan that i have always like.can&#x27;t wait to use it out at the pool this summer.good value cause i got two bottles for the price of one,shipped fast to!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery. My son and daughter use this in a tanning bed and loves it! I use it outside and it really accelerates my tan. Fresh scent, not oily, and I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I tan outdoors I get a beautiful golden reddish tan. I was using expensive well known indoor tanning lotions with heavy bronzers. I had tried several different ones. I was becoming more and more dissatisfied with my ashie brown tanning bed color but wasn&#x60;t sure what to do about it Recently I ran out of my last tanning lotion and because I was briefly low on funds I bought this inexpensive product to use for a few days until I could buy something better. What a surprise when I discovered after the first tanning session I was showing that rich golden reddish tan I loved so much. I&#x60;ve continued to use this product and just bought a second bottle. It&#x60;s what I plan to use evermore. My only critisim is I wish the lotion were just a little bit thicker because it&#x60;s very water and spills out of your hand onto the floor while you&#x60;re applying and the product is a little bit difficult to find. But otherwise I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this product! you can&#x60;t beet the price or the results. It&#x60;s definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a tanning solution but is actually just a mediocre hand lotion.  A waste of money</li>
    <li> I dont know what is in this, but Iam usually pasty white and I have been using this lotion before I lay in the tanning bed, once a month, and it is maintaining my base tan.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I, Like it becomes it gives me a great golden tan that last a while and i like Hawaiin Tropic products anyway.</li>
