<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just got this, but i have used this brand before. It is a very good conditioner and isn&#x27;t greatly expensive, either.</li>
    <li> Works good ,fast shipping</li>
    <li> I placed an order for the dual conditioner set. I received Dove two shampoos, which is obviously wrong. This is an error on their part, the description clearly says conditioner. The disclaimer &amp;#34;packaging may vary&amp;#34; should not apply to completely incorrect order fulfillment.  Please provide details on the return/exchange process.</li>
    <li> great product for the price. you can find a larger bottle at sams club for just a few dollard  more</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling good and stays cleaner longer</li>
    <li> Smells great but leaves  scalp dry</li>
    <li> I got this one for my younger sister, as her experience, this was really nice product and best conditioner. She continuously used more than 3 months and for me price for this item is more worthy. Only Amazon provide cheapest Rate !</li>
    <li> Perfect just poor packaging top was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair smell!  I usually have the hardest time combing through my wet hair but after only using this conditioner once I was able to comb through my hair much easier.</li>
    <li> I have terrible dry hair, but this stuff is a godsend. It works great and after rinsing, I mix a little with water to massage through my hair as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the baby powder like smell</li>
    <li> Perfect! It makes my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, leaves my hair sooooo very soft!</li>
    <li> Love the company &amp; the products. The advertising is spot on. For this reason alone I tried the products. I am pleased I have a great product to stand by.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner and great price</li>
    <li> Even though I received this at a discount for my honest review, I would definitely pay full price and will purchase this again. It smells amazing and is very moisturizing on my hair :)</li>
    <li> Great condiitoner. Lightweight and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo really helps with out weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Nothing too special but it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m allergic to Dove. I didn&#x27;t know this until recently. So maybe my review isn&#x27;t fair, but just figure out if you&#x27;re allergic before buying. The price was good for $2-$3 a bottle on sale.</li>
    <li> great amount for price</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than buying in the store, I buy these bottles 5 at a time so I always have a stockpile and never run out mid-shower. It&#x27;s about half the cost of buying in-store, and with Prime free shipping, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been exclusively using Dove shampoo and conditioner for about 3 years, and I would not switch to another brand. The results are amazing and my hair is smoother, shinier, and easier to style since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Be sure to check out the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner very much, and replaced my old conditioner with this.. it leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable and if you blow dry your hair is so nice and fluffy. I color my hair and often just rely on the little tube of conditioner that comes with the hair color, but I like this conditioner much more and have switched to using this.. when I go to rinse it out of my hair, I love the soft feeling of my hair as I rinse it out.. it does its job!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner! Leaves my hair very soft. I have started using Dove more often because the other products have not provided enough moisture for my hair. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Dove products, and this is great also. It leaves my curly, frizzy hair nice and soft. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great moisture for dry hair</li>
    <li> by far the best product line I have used.  I have used many different shampoos and conditioners mostly expensive and I can tell you this is my absolute fav.  I have very long hair and I constantly get compliments on my hair at how healthy and shiny it looks for as long as it is.  I tell them  about this product!  Please please please Dove, never stop making this!</li>
    <li> For an easy to find  conditioner that will not leave your hair feeling  oily or greasy look no further.&lt;br /&gt;  Yes there are better conditioners out there - but for the price you cant beat the value.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has always worked great for me. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great for fine, thick hair. I can easily comb through my damp hair. Works well with its sister shampoo.</li>
    <li> Dove hair conditioning therapy my second best conditioner it gives my hair so much softness and lightness, i really think its a go ahead to all the ladies out there</li>
    <li> The best scalp moisturizer I have found</li>
    <li> I use this to shave with, it works better than creams.  I have bought it at least 5 times so it must be doing something right.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel silky soft! And for the cheap price I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for two years. It moisturizes quickly without leaving hair greasy or heavy. My stylist always compliments my hair and it&#x27;s so healthy I only get it cut once a year. I love that I can get it on subscribe and save on schedule, and it even works well as a shave cream.</li>
    <li> Having thick &amp; coarse hair all my life (slightly damaged as well from bleaching &amp; dyeing), I am always searching for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; conditioner to tame my mane. And no matter what other name brands I&#x27;ve tried in my journey to find that perfect conditioner, I always find myself going back to Dove Daily Moisture Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells heavenly! Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue after wash, and lastly and most importantly, my hair feels so soft and manageable after every wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Works well, does what it says, quick shipping and another good buy from amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to use anti- dandruff conditioner and that worked perfect. With this product i started having dandruff and itching</li>
    <li> Best product out there. Tried the expensive stuff and they don&#x27;t work half as well. My hair feels so soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Dove leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, the smell is amazing and for the price &#x3D; score!!</li>
    <li> Hate to give a Dove product a one star, because I&#x27;ve used some of their other soaps, shampoos and conditioners as well as their deodorant, and love them all. But this conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much to condition my hair. I have hair that&#x27;s curly/wavy mix and medium thickness, so it&#x27;s prone to a *little* frizz. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t detangle well (ouch!) and my hair has never been frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the reason for the one star is the horrible scales, flakes and sores that broke out all over my hairline from it. I actually forgot this happened, and used it again twice a few months later when I ran out of my regular conditioner, same result. I use LOTS of different shampoos and conditioners and both me and my roommate had this issue. Sorry Dove, but the embarrassment of a red flaky hairline makes this one a NO.</li>
    <li> My hair always looked so dry,dull and dead until I started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner and now my hair looks so much more shinier,not dead and just looks so healthy!</li>
    <li> been using dove for yrs has a fresh feeling to it i look for this one thing when i buy conditionart im looking to be able to run my hands through my hair with out washinfg iot with only the conditionar if my hair doesnt snag it is good and this is the one prodict thsat has never set me wrong</li>
    <li> Works well and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I just love this conditioner does not dry hair out and leaves your hair hydrated and super shinny.</li>
    <li> This will always be my favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> Really good price for the conditioning it provides. Leaves hair smooth and silky, hydrated and good smelling. This is my go to conditioner and with S&amp;S its like half the price it is in the stores.</li>
    <li> Dove has long been a name I could trust for a quality product, and the price on Subscribe and Save was a good deal for the size product. I&#x27;ve ordered it again for next month and will continue to use it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t take a sudden hike.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t danage the hair and dies the job efficiently. Taking off ine star since there are other shampoo and conditioner much better but more expensive of course.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on my hair when I use dove. It makes it soft and smells really nice.</li>
    <li> great for tangles on a 9 year old with long hair! we no longer have any issues combing thru her hair after bath :)</li>
    <li> smells great and works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells awful, like cheap perfume. I don&#x27;t care if it works, I am throwing it out. I can&#x27;t take the odor.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky and easy to comb out wet. Good conditioner, on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love Dove products.  The conditioner is thick and conditions my very long, thick hair very well.  I don&#x27;t even have a hard time brushing through the tangles when it&#x27;s wet.  And it smells awesome!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great price for this great product</li>
    <li> This conditioner works amazing. It leaves my hair so soft and touchable. I love it and will definitely be ordering it again</li>
    <li> The bottle busted open spilling all the contents</li>
    <li> Wonderfully happy with this product</li>
    <li> Pros: I have really long hair, and needed a conditioner that would make my hair feel wonderful. Being that my hair is thick and is prone to frizziness, I need something that would help with that as well. After each use, I feel like my hair is just absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only con, and it&#x27;s not even much of a con.. is that it is way too thick of a conditioner. I suppose I can ground the thickness, due to the fact that it helps my hair so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that does help your hair, pick this one up!</li>
    <li> Very good price and good shipping and good packaging!  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair feeling so smooth. I don&#x27;t have anything else to say, but there&#x27;s a minimum word requirement on these reviews!</li>
    <li> works good.  like the smell also.</li>
    <li> great price. i can use it daily and does not make my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I use conditioner for shaving cream, and this has worked the best!</li>
    <li> It feels a bit oily. Luckily I am not very demanding on this.</li>
    <li> I have have African American hair texture so my hair gets very dry. I use this for my cowashes and I love this stuff. Hair fills so soft and moisturized after plus it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> its great just like the picture!</li>
    <li> Since I started using this, I constantly get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  I love it to bits and pieces and it smells great.  Even my boyfriend started using it because it helps tame his crazy hair.</li>
    <li> Love Dove products they work great on my thin hair. I don&#x27;t have to use as much conditioner as I do with other brands. I love that Amazon ships the Dove products in a bag so that it were to break open (which I have never had happen with Amazon) it will not get all over my other purchases.</li>
    <li> I received a combo shampoo and conditioner bottle. I didn&#x27;t order a two in one. Do not buy! Smaller size too.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner for my over processed dry hair. Works very well. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved  this product it worked great with both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair texture. I would definitely recommend this to a friend  :)</li>
    <li> Works wonders when used with the same shampoo</li>
    <li> Hair is so soft with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am really digging Dove products.  They knocked it out the park with this one.</li>
    <li> Good price great product</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best I have ever used. It makes my hair incredibly soft. I will keep buying because it is that amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, especially for every day use. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and even doubles well in place of shaving cream when out of that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this diluted as fabric softener and it works very well. I had some sheets that weren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d hoped and this softened them right up. I know it&#x27;s not what this is for, but conditioner is far cheaper than softener and works just as well or better. It smells wonderful and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it irritating my skin since it is meant to be used on the scalp. As conditioner it is typical. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> product as described--</li>
    <li> Came with in 2 days and so cheap</li>
    <li> I love the way Dove&#x27;s hair products make my hair feel lightweight and soft, while never looking oily like some similar product lines. I get comments on how my hair looks super healthy, even my split ends. Dove obviously can&#x27;t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; them, but now people don&#x27;t even notice them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could find better if you went salon level and wanted to drop a lot more money, but as far as drugstore brands go, Dove will always be my go-to for hair care.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, did not provide any hydration. Do not buy this if you have thick curly or wavy hair</li>
    <li> I like Dove products and am happy to find them on Amazon. This is a good price, and the quality of the product is excellent.Your hair will enjoy being treated by Dove!</li>
    <li> Works great in keeping my hair sot and scalp moisturized. Have bought this many times now and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse wavy hair and my daughters have fine very wavy hair. All thick. I will use this and the conditioner on days I straight style my hair, since I can&#x27;t define my waves when I use it. My daughters have a tighter curl than me and theirs was still lovely waves, and soooo soft! I like the smell and it does seem to help with frizz and makes my hair soft too, which is a challenge. If you have super thin hair I could see how it might make it greasy, but as with all product you have to use the right amount. I would say it is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Great price.  My son used to have horrible eczema and was told to use Dove products by the doctor that healed his skin.  All other shampoos and conditioners always made my son&#x27;s face turn red but Dove products don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am not very demanding or picky on conditioners, so I first picked this one basically because of it&#x27;s price and because I always love Dove body wash. And this product is (also) great! Smells cheerfully, and I did see a difference between using this conditioner and not. I have already ordered this several times and will definitely order more in the future. It is THE conditioner of our home!</li>
    <li> Nice and thick conditioner that coats the hair really well. This along with the shampoo is fantastic and gives you gorgeous hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair really looked horrible before these products; it was damaged, fly away and full of split ends. Now my hair looks and feels spectacular.</li>
