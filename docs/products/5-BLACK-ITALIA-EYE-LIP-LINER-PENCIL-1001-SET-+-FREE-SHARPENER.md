<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love them so much! It goes on wonderfully and does not smudge. If you do for whatever have issues with it going on smoothly, try heating up the liner lil bit and that works wonders (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the sharpener is cute. Which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most definitely purchase again next year. Once this batch of 5 are gone. hahahaha</li>
    <li> Satisfactory eyeliner pencils are very hard to find.  Either they&#x27;re too dry to go on evenly and drag too much, or they&#x27;re too gooey and migrate or simply vanish.  These are some the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  The liner goes on smoothly and it stays put.  It seems to be the perfect blend of pigment and medium.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> The order arrived quickly so I was very pleased. Although the do tend to smudge at times and in love that they are actually really dark. But my order did not receive free earrings ;( lol</li>
    <li> These are very nice and make it easy to create a clean line.</li>
    <li> The eye liner are good n really dark black which I love it... but i didn&#x27;t get the ear ring tat supposed to come with it which im not happy about it... love the sharpener by the way...</li>
    <li> What a great price on these smooth pencils.  I gave extras away to my friends!</li>
    <li> Love them love them soft perfect colors covers yes, will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the quality. It&#x27;s very soft and runny. I was promised earing with this purchase that I never received</li>
    <li> It glides on so well!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed was that it smudges easily.&lt;br /&gt;But then again it adds to my look ;P</li>
    <li> The liner is very easy to apply, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to smear and smudge very easy. It seems to kind of melt while wearing it. The sharpener is great but does seem to be getting a tiny bit dull after just slight use.</li>
    <li> The pencils were fine, but seller did not include the earrings as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these before but these r for my daughter and she loves them too thx alot</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eyeliners. They don&#x27;t run even when I put in eye drops. But it will smear, if you leave it on overnight you&#x27;ll have &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; lol&lt;br /&gt;Just bought some for my mom, she likes them too</li>
    <li> Just as good as the colored ones! I recommend this product to anybody who needs a good set of eyeliners that are highly pigmented matte + dark + lock in place. It also came with a dark blue sharpener that works awesome! If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product do do it!</li>
    <li> Goes on well but can&#x27;t mess with your eyes or it will smudge</li>
    <li> These eyeliners are amazing, cheap and stay all day. I like these better than the UD eyeliners I used to wear!</li>
    <li> Good if you want PANDA style in 5 minutes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can write a review without raating. This product does&#x27;t deserve any stars.</li>
    <li> Good color pay off but if you have mono lids I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Over all it was good :)</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! This stuff smudges!!!! All day long I had to clean around my eye or else I&#x27;d look like a raccoon. It&#x27;s disappointing because the color is awesome.</li>
    <li> I really dont get why people are complaining about this product. I passed these out to my sisters and their friends ..who now ONLY want these. The color is excellent. I get that it gets melty but guess what? if your going to leave it in the sun or somewhere the temp rises quickly etc..its going to get melty. I have really oily lids(gross) and i really had no issues with it at all. The price is right and I cant wait to try the other colors!</li>
    <li> Came back for more as a gift 🎁.I think it will last her a couple of yrs.  She used mine and fell in love ❤, couldn&#x27;t believe I paid so little for such a great quality.</li>
    <li> You wont be disappointed here.  Now, everyone needs their primer first but these glide on like urban decay gel liner, except they are 1/3 the cost!  Invest in a good primer and these will take you a long way.</li>
    <li> IAM not impressed with these eyeliners, they are always smugin. I always have black under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these pencils, they are so dark black,  The shipment was earlier than expected send I received and extra present, and the best I don&#x27;t get my eyes irritated When I wear my sofr contacts,thank you!</li>
    <li> VERY SMOOT WHAT I WANTED</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. packaged well in a clear sealed package so they don&#x27;t smack around during shipping. They all come pre filed down and ready to use.Safe for highly sensitive skin. I also love the free double sharpener and free stud earrings. The pencils are substantial, solid and are dep, rich true to black . They glide on smoothly, no chalkiness or breakage on. easy to smudge for a deeper darker look. highly recommend these liners not only for the price, but for the true color and rich feel.</li>
    <li> Love the eyeliner. :) it makes my eyes stand out perfectly. And it also stays on all day. The problem is that it keeps making a little smudge. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect ^.^</li>
    <li> They are the worst. They do not last not even for a few minutes and they spread all over my eyes. I do not like them and I dont recommend any one to purchase them.</li>
    <li> Minimal smudging.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had. Great price and goes on so smooth. I own about every color in the line</li>
    <li> I got em today and used em. They smudged right away giving me panda eyes. Didn&#x27;t come with earrings when it said it did. But I do love the double sided sharpener. It was sharpened already when I opened it, ready to be used.</li>
    <li> I did not received free earring</li>
    <li> I love products from this company! The quality is amazing and their eyeliners just glide on without any issues.</li>
    <li> Now , my favorite eyeliner. Havent found one i actually liked in years</li>
    <li> These eyeliner pencils made me feel as though I ordered the liquid eyeliners. They run a lot. So be careful with purchasing this. It gets really messy on the face. I do like how dark they are though.</li>
    <li> go on smooth I liked these, I have already given half of them away to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love it, this is my third time purchasing this eyeliner brand and its great. It stays very well, a few hours on the waterline and pretty much all day on you lid or lash line. It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t run out quickly, don&#x27;t need to sharpen but every other day, and it last a long time. I use eyeliner everyday and its lasted me a good 3 or 4 months.</li>
    <li> A must have they color so well and you don&#x27;t have to keep applying them over and over to get the color to come on the eye</li>
    <li> These are great and go on smoothly but a little dark so me carful</li>
    <li> Did not come with the earrings like it stated.</li>
    <li> Great value! These are department store quality at a great price. I have used black liner for years to line the outside of my eyes, top and bottom. This is one of the best black eye liners I have bought. It goes on smooth and it easy to blend or smudge slightly with an eyeshadow brush. It stays on all day and requires soap or makeup remover to remove. I highly recommend. This set will last me at least a year, but I will definitely purchase again. Check out their lip liner set! I purchased it ... equally pleased.</li>
    <li> Very good eyeliner pencil very dark and creamy I love these so I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again the sharpener works great!! : )</li>
    <li> I like the pencils but the advertising was false... Before I purchased the ad said with free sharper and free earring and after I submitted my purchase it stated no earring... I don&#x27;t like when these companies make Amazon look back.i wish I was buying only Amazon products it would be less stress.</li>
    <li> The eyeliners are great and I love how it came with a free sharpener and pair of flower earrings. :) thank you!</li>
    <li> I will be ordering some more of this product,this  is the best  way to order in pairs and set and receive a free sharpener. I think  this will be my way  to stop shopping in the side stores spending more for less, when amazon has good sells, thank you</li>
    <li> Eyeliners are cheap an melt away. I had to sharpen 4-5 times just to try to do One Brow.What a waste! Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Would never recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got the pencils and pencil sharpener but no the earrings that it said it comes with it...</li>
    <li> Amazing color and so easy to apply, best eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
    <li> I received everything and they are really good products, except the earrings. They weren&#x27;t in the package.</li>
    <li> Grease, come off easily with just a touch of the area poor quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It arrived on time and I&#x27;m completely in love with the.black eye liner it looks amazing on everyone and the fact it comes with a sharpener is great  Update:This is my second time buying this eyeliner and it still amazing. The exact kind of black I love. It came with 5 just like it said it word. AMAZING PRICE, IT&#x27;S A GREAT DEAL and you NEED to get this :)</li>
    <li> I like the color and it goes on easily, but it also smudges easily.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Easy to glide on. I love it. Can be used for eyes or lips. I wanted to be different so I started wearing lip liner.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth, vibrant color, and the best black eyeliner I&#x27;ve used in over a decade. I will be buying this product in the future and recommend it to anyone that loves black eyeliner even half as much as me!</li>
    <li> Constantly under my eye</li>
    <li> Best value for the price. Plus, free earrings!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the high ratings review. I can see why people liked it so we&#x27;ll...it glided on amazing. I thought I was going to love it, but it smudged and runned very bad. It was all over my fingers when I touch my eye. It melted past my eye. It was messy! I&#x27;m a big eyeliner girl but I don&#x27;t want to wear this again. It just doesn&#x27;t last long. It reminds me of a melting candle.</li>
    <li> I like how dark and easy it applies, but i have oily eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;So it ends up being a big mess. just like my life</li>
    <li> Fast and great quality!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Having been repeatedly disappointed by my old eyeliner brands, I&#x27;d decided to try something new &amp; started looking on Amazon.com.  I found the 5-pack by Italia and decided that, for the price, it was worth a try. When it arrived shortly after I ordered it, I tried it out &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how smooth &amp; even it went on, not cakey at all. After a few hours of wear I checked my eyes for the dreaded \\&quot;raccoon eye\\&quot;, &amp; all was well there too! This is great eyeliner, and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Also included were a sharpener &amp; a very cute pair of earrings as a free gift! I need look no further!</li>
    <li> This product, used as an eye liner, goes on creamy and smooth.  I love it.  The only down fall, is if you use it on your upper lid, and go to put on mascara, it might leave a duplicate mark up by your brow.  An effect caused by opening your eyes wide.  I found that if I put some loose powder over it, that helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used these eyeliners for years.  They do tend to smudge a bit easily, but they are also a beautiful and rich color.  For the cost, I have been very happy with these liners and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I previously bought the multiple color set and found all but the black to be too light for my taste.  I fell in love with the black tho, and when I wore it down to a nub I bought these. The application is very smooth and last a long time.  Plus they come with an awesome sharpener.</li>
    <li> It smudges easily so don&#x27;t cry. It stays during a hot sweaty day for me and it darkens magnificently. These five pencils will last me for more than a year!</li>
    <li> pigment is great and sticks just fine.  Lasts a while but depending on what you do, no promises.  they are awesome</li>
    <li> Did not come with free earrings as advertised.</li>
    <li> Such a great bargain with sharpener included.  The eyeliner goes on easy and stays on ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> pencils bad, bad quality, are sharpened hardly, scattered, and very badly washed away from skin, I am dissatisfied, any more I won&#x27;t buy production of this company</li>
    <li> Mascara runs. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I love this product the best eyeliner ever</li>
    <li> Free earrings is not true no earrings came with  my purchase .. But eyeliner is a real dark black perfect .. Once i wear all day i will write a review if it last  :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. It applies easily, very smooth. I can actually do my whole waterline and even if its sharpened enough, a wing! Also its a bit hard to wash off, which is i guess what is supposed to happen. it doesn&#x27;t smudge when i rub my eyes later in the day, and it lasts very long. I love it.</li>
    <li> Only got a few hours ago, but I applied and it went on smooth and easy and looks good. The sharpener works fine. Nice to have five for backup, I always lose my liners. I didn&#x27;t get any earrings with this :( Booo!! Received what is pictured.</li>
