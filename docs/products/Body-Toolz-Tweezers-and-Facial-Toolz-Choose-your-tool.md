      <li>my face looks so much better when i use this and not my fingers.</li>
      <li>and i love how you can unscrew the two sides and flip them around</li>

      <li>(I love this site).</li>
      <li>Great high quality product.</li>

      <li>Pros: easy to disassemble to remove harmful parts</li>

      <li>This produce is extremely cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The good: The middle curled pattern was better than I</li>
      <li>The product has a good weight and seems like it would do a good job except the lancet is completely dull!</li>

      <li>the hole for the blackhead extractions is small but the lancet works good for whiteheads.</li>
      <li>The lancet could be much sharper and the extractor doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>Lancet had rough edges that were easily filed down with an emery board, but good quality overall</li>
      <li>It is a decent item.</li>
      <li>I bought this tool expecting the high quality as described by body toolz.  </li>
      <li>The attachments get wobbly in their settings, which makes it more difficult to be precise with extractions.</li>
      <li>Please, please, please do not waste your money!  </li>
      <li>This is the only thing that really works!</li>
      <li>Body Toolz Professional Lancet and Extractor Skin Care Tool.....</li>
      <li>Suvorna Professional Blackhead Cleaner / Remover &amp; Comedone Extractor Kit (8 Pieces)</li>
      <li>you find a professional one, please let me know.</li>
      <li>tip of the lancet is not as sharp as expected and I will not be able to use on clients.</li>
      <li>They sent a second one to replace the first and same thing.  </li>
      <li>It seems like the right thing to do because the one edge is so sharp but that is something they should explain somewhere.  </li>
      <li>Rusty and not sharp at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously a low cost version of a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sharp end for lancing wasn&#x27;t very sharp at all, I could just as easily use a needle.</li>
      <li>It is not sharp enough to do so.  </li>
      <li>The pointy end was not sharp enough for me.  </li>

<li> were terrible, the threads were really loose, and they had a noticeable amount of imperfections in the threads making screwing each end piece on a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;The hole in the blackhead removing end seems a bit too small for best</li>
<li> I steam my face with a facial steamer, and then press the circle randomly on my nose over the large pores</li>
<li> total waste of money</li>
<li> Still missing the same parts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The piercing end isnt as sharp as I would like it to be</li>
<li> Works just as I expected!</li>
<li> You just have to be very careful using it.</li>
<li> Bought several hard to find item....</li>
<li> The other end did little to nothing to remove what it was meant to.</li>
<li> Very sharp.</li>
<li> the pointy ends inside itself because I travel and would like to have this in my dopp kit, but it&#x27;s not good enough to make the trip.&lt;br</li>
<li> I suppose I would give a higher rating knowing this now but still frustrated over the time I spent on this.</li>
<li> I had to exchange the item since it was missing end parts.</li>
<li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
<li> The pointy tip as well as the circular extractor is missing.</li>
<li> received with tips of tool missing.</li>
<li> The opening was too small.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the tool came with only a handle again, no parts.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed when I opened it today and saw the ultra fine tip was bent.  </li>
<li> results.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thread issue did not result in this having a new product feel to it, it almost seemed like a used ragged out tool.</li>
<li> Although I haven&#x27;t used it,,, I think it will due well as a questionable adornment to my bathroom.</li>
<li> /&gt;The bad: The threads that screw both ends onto the middle</li>
<li> SO, item not worth the money to me!!!!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a random defective tool</li>
<li> Doubtful that I can straighten but nothing to lose by trying since I won&#x27;t bother with sending it back.</li>
<li> The quality seems questionable.</li>
<li> This product is made in Pakistan and is of very poor quality.  </li>
<li> and you can put it in your bag or purse without having to worry about it getting dirty of stabbing things!</li>
<li> Frankly, this really disappointed me.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: came filthy with dirt and grime embedded into the parts (like it was used in gardening).</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works greats..the hole for the blackhead extractions is small but the lancet works good for whiteheads. Easy to use, easy to clean, wish it came with more attachments..</li>
    <li> No parts! I had to exchange the item since it was missing end parts. Guess what? Still missing the same parts.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a refund this time.</li>
    <li> It showed signs of rust after 1 use and only having used alcohol on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically for the lancet. When the product arrived, the lancet and scoop are actually inside the handle and you need to screw the ends on. The product has a good weight and seems like it would do a good job except the lancet is completely dull! I couldn&#x27;t use it on my skin.</li>
    <li> The best blemish...tool ever!.....Body Toolz Professional Lancet and Extractor Skin Care Tool.....Bought several hard to find item....Amazon has everything you name it it&#x27;s here....</li>
    <li> Extractor works ok. The piercing end isnt as sharp as I would like it to be but it works ok.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with trying to get rid of whiteheads for a long time. This is the only thing that really works! You just have to be very careful using it. Also, I love how it can be unscrewed and can go into the handles.</li>
    <li> Great high quality product. Will buy BODY TOOLZ products again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item specifically for the 3-sided lancet.  Very disappointed when I opened it today and saw the ultra fine tip was bent.  Since each tool stores inside the handle, I checked to see if ends touched inside, they don&#x27;t. Doubtful that I can straighten but nothing to lose by trying since I won&#x27;t bother with sending it back.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace one that I had lost of another brand, this one was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, Amazon had some sort of promotion I wasn&#x27;t even aware of and I got it free (I love this site). I steam my face with a facial steamer, and then press the circle randomly on my nose over the large pores - it&#x27;s amazing what comes out.    UPDATE: While it squeezes stuff out well, parts of it are going rusty. Ew.</li>
    <li> The extractor did not have any extraction pieces attached to the wand. The pointy tip as well as the circular extractor is missing.</li>
    <li> Works just as I expected!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Keep out of reach of children though.Very sharp.</li>
    <li> The knife is not sharp enough to even penetrate the skin, therefore the tool is pointless.</li>
    <li> Always comes unscrewed when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> Please, please, please do not waste your money!  This produce is extremely cheaply made. It does not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this tool expecting the high quality as described by body toolz.  This product is made in Pakistan and is of very poor quality.  The scoop end of the tool used to remove blackheads was nicked, had I not seen this and used it, I would have damaged my skin.  in addition to this, the opposite end of the stem where the head screws in, the steel was actually peeling up.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received a random defective tool but I will look to order a lancet made in europe and pay more.</li>
    <li> Got this to help remove blackheads - works great for that. The Lancet is not easy to use and I don&#x27;t use it due to that - doesn&#x27;t seem super sharp.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations. The sharp end for lancing wasn&#x27;t very sharp at all, I could just as easily use a needle. The other end did little to nothing to remove what it was meant to. Actually, I think it just irritated the skin more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It helps me get rid of pimples, blackheads &amp; whiteheads without scaring my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered the item on December 31, 2013.  I was supposed to have been shipped on January 4,2014.  It is February 9,2014 and I have not seen hide nor hair of this item, a phone number to contact, a place to research what happened.  SO, item not worth the money to me!!!!  Bye Bye dollars.</li>
    <li> Rusty and not sharp at all.  You get what you pay for.  I bought this instead and am much happier!  Suvorna Professional Blackhead Cleaner / Remover &amp; Comedone Extractor Kit (8 Pieces)</li>
    <li> be prepared to sharpen the lancet it has no tip on it, the scoop does work well for its intended purpose. fair warning: if you are buying this for the lancet: dont.</li>
    <li> Great design for such a sharpy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool and received only a handle, the tools that are pictured on either end were not attached or in the package.  I called and was shipped out another one with an apology and without any hassle (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars).  Unfortunately, the tool came with only a handle again, no parts.  I have two metal sticks for my money.  What a waste of time and money.  UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:  Upon further investigation, I have found that the \\&quot;parts\\&quot; were actually screwed in the handle.  You have to unscrew them and turn them around.  It seems like the right thing to do because the one edge is so sharp but that is something they should explain somewhere.  I suppose I would give a higher rating knowing this now but still frustrated over the time I spent on this.</li>
    <li> The good: The middle curled pattern was better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The threads that screw both ends onto the middle were terrible, the threads were really loose, and they had a noticeable amount of imperfections in the threads making screwing each end piece on a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;The hole in the blackhead removing end seems a bit too small for best results.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thread issue did not result in this having a new product feel to it, it almost seemed like a used ragged out tool.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use as a lance to pierce boils or pimples.  It is not sharp enough to do so.  Very disappointed.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The attachments get wobbly in their settings, which makes it more difficult to be precise with extractions.</li>
    <li> Pros: easy to disassemble to remove harmful parts&lt;br /&gt;Cons: came filthy with dirt and grime embedded into the parts (like it was used in gardening). The coating material is coming off, the head of the extractor is so tiny that it is not useful. The lance is too bulky except for the tip.</li>
    <li> The lancet could be much sharper and the extractor doesn&#x27;t work. I wish I&#x27;d saved my money. So it goes.</li>
    <li> All I got was a steel bar - no lancet, no extractor.  They sent a second one to replace the first and same thing.  Looks like the lancet and extractor are supposed to screw on, but they didn&#x27;t send them.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The lancet works great. Good item to have!!!</li>
    <li> It is a decent item. Matched the description and arrived on time. Although I haven&#x27;t used it,,, I think it will due well as a questionable adornment to my bathroom. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I got this just because I wanted something pointier and sharper than sewing needles, but this one is not ponty at all!!&lt;br /&gt;It can not pierce anything!!  I even put the tip on my palm and turn it, it didn&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s useless for breaking the skin to treat whiteheads.  Regular sewing needles are still better than this.</li>
    <li> Lancet had rough edges that were easily filed down with an emery board, but good quality overall</li>
    <li> Frankly, this really disappointed me.  It&#x27;s obviously a low cost version of a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it stores the pointy ends inside itself because I travel and would like to have this in my dopp kit, but it&#x27;s not good enough to make the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably headed to the bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find a professional one, please let me know.</li>
    <li> The product is as described and works well for home use.&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the lancet is not as sharp as expected and I will not be able to use on clients.</li>
    <li> just what we were looking for</li>
    <li> received with tips of tool missing. a pain for me to return. total waste of money</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. The opening was too small. The quality seems questionable.</li>
    <li> great for me. my face looks so much better when i use this and not my fingers. and i love how you can unscrew the two sides and flip them around and you can put it in your bag or purse without having to worry about it getting dirty of stabbing things! great tool for the price recommend to many</li>
    <li> The pointy end was not sharp enough for me.  I wanted to get my Milia, but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
