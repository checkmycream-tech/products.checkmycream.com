      <li>Good afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You have to make time to use this machine if you want to get good results.</li>
      <li>I have been using the machine for a couple weeks now and am very pleased with how it works.</li>
      <li>all I feel is a warm to the touch.</li>
      <li>and everythink is ok on this device.</li>
      <li>and I thought this would be better than going to some clinic.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it because it has made a difference.</li>
      <li>Also this is not going to work as a replacement for a healthy diet and exercise...</li>
      <li>I need to use it more though</li>
      <li>Ok so, I just got this thing</li>
      <li>Lymphatic drainage massage and drinking water are necessary for the best results.  </li>
      <li>However, most clinics the practice cavitation are not doing this anyway.</li>
      <li>I would love a class on how to use this machine or any information you are able to send.</li>
      <li>Would love a class from JC on ultrasound on these machines.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you:)</li>
      <li>how many amber should i use if it was 10 amber in USA with 110 voltage??</li>
      <li>Everything right, good quality, on time.</li>
      <li>Happy so far...</li>
      <li>this  machine is idea for people how are 10-15lbs from their ideal weight and, are just trying to get rid stubborn fat pockets ( stomach, inner and outer thighs).</li>
      <li>good very responsable</li>
      <li>It came very quickly after ordered (a week).</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Looked up info so fine there.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you so very much!  :-)</li>
      <li>So far If used correctly it will give an awesome result, just remember to hydrate prior to cavitation and after for better result..</li>
      <li>The studies also confirmed that you need a minimum of 3MHZ of frequency for it to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Ultra Sound clinics for fat loss are popping up everywhere</li>
      <li>I bought a cheap machine thinking it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I recommend you buy the ultra sound gel in the gallon, because it is cheaper, and you will go through a lot if you use it on a schedule like you should for optimal results.</li>
      <li>I would very much appreciate more instruction with this machine.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased a groupon deal for $150.00 for 9 sessions  and after the 6 sessions I noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>but, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is exactly what I wanted for an excellent price, now I can work on a couple other areas besides my abdominals.</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s make my skin nice and soft and the shipment was very fast than I</li>
      <li>I put a whole egg yolk in a glass dish and added some water to cover it an inch over the yolk&#x27;s top.  </li>
      <li>Works like spected, just the power suplly mus to be full range for all country.</li>
      <li>to lose fat and shrink skin try cool sculpting machines.</li>
      <li>There is an instruction manual that comes with it which isn&#x27;t super helpful, but you can get the idea if you play around with the machine and try operating yourself.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The key is drink plenty of water and do a good workout right after treatment to flush the fat away.</li>
      <li>I figured i&#x27;d try the cheap way first.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll have to do some home work on your own (Googling/ YouTubing) to learn how to properly use this product.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>You can download the manuel on there sight -Mychway and look for your model, manuel will be on right side of page.</li>
      <li>Yes you still need to workout and eat right but,&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything was absolutely painless and I could not feel anything, except some hi-pitch buzzing sound in my ears (later I have learned from my friend Radiologist, that this sound  is produced by ultrasound waves reflecting off the skeleton bones and resonating all way up to the scull -so</li>
      <li>but, after my first child I could not get rid of my cellulite.</li>
      <li>Really grateful for your time and effort!</li>
      <li>also researched the cavitation devices offered on Amazon and saw that many of them have the same description and/or instruction pamphlet in the information area.</li>
      <li>I am a licensed diagnostic medical ultrasonographer and know how to use this machine safely.</li>
      <li>;-)  </li>
      <li>I am willing to continue using it</li>
      <li>add to this review after several more weeks.</li>
      <li>I can feel that it work but need more time to see the final result as I want.</li>
      <li>That was my first time...</li>
      <li>So far well worth the cost!</li>
      <li>When using the large ultrasound head at its highest intensity the machine gets so hot it could burn you.</li>
      <li>The machine I have sounds exactly the same and gets warm exactly the same as the one they were using on me in the office, I think it works, I will follow up with my results</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any results like I did with the large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I lost almost 2 lbs from 2 consecutive treatments with the large head (2 x 15 min).</li>
      <li>Certainly there are &amp;#34;real models&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>THRU HELL PURE HELL</li>
      <li>Very helpful, It is greatly appreciated</li>
      <li>The instructions don&#x27;t really make sense.</li>
      <li>It arrived within 10 days packed really well.</li>
      <li>the machine does really work.</li>
      <li>This machine is too intense for me.</li>
      <li>Although it may seem like a better deal to just get the more expensive one, since they aren&#x27;t that much more costly, you&#x27;re taking a bigger risk monetarily if the machine happens to be dysfunctional</li>
      <li>The seller is very misleading in the description and also the naming of this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much of an effect.</li>
      <li>However, the device does perform ultrasound cavitation and does it very well.</li>
      <li>The product arrived much faster than the estimated arrival.</li>
      <li>Before trying it on myself (and to make sure this machine really works) I first started with a little experiment, that I have seen on YouTube.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered my new spa system and would like for Miss JC to contact me for classes, thank you, I am looking forward to your assistance!</li>
      <li>This machine works but you need to have realistic expectation.</li>
      <li>this is absolutely normal when using 40kHz cavitation head.</li>
      <li>The manual is not very explanatory, and you really need to know more about the settings in specific areas.</li>
      <li>The other two heads are working fine.</li>
      <li>Vacuum+ Golden Pulse Beauty 24K Bar.&lt;br /&gt;Model</li>
      <li>If so,  how do I order a new one?</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I workout regularly Ballet, Hot yoga, running etc.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still using the most cost-effective parts to make a complex machine.&lt;br /&gt;The more advanced models also have quite a few bad reviews, whole the good reviews are idiomatic and obviously fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There are clearly reviewed by people who have never even purchased for tried this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
      <li>I have only been using it a month now, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet...</li>
      <li>So Please do not waste your money on this</li>
      <li>My 24yr old daughter is using the 40k on her thighs and buttock area.</li>
      <li>WOW it does.</li>
      <li>However, the only peer-reviewed studies show that the system works when the area in question is treated with a solution injected first, such a saline or or distilled water, followed by ultrasound on that area.</li>
      <li>First time I tried it, I lost about a pound over the course of three tries.</li>

    <li> This trash no Good please don&#x27;t buy it this trash</li>
    <li> I am 2 weeks into using this machine. I use it once a day. I do not see any difference in body shape. I am willing to continue using it&lt;br /&gt;and  add to this review after several more weeks.</li>
    <li> Miss JC, instructions please ☺ pureromance.sara@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Good afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;I bought a &amp;#34; Sanven Desktop Type Vacuum Cavitation System Machine for home use&amp;#34; on 26 November 2014 , according to purchase order No. 114-1328310-2101867 . The unit arrived within the estimated time and put it to work for 15 days and then stopped working. How do I claim warranty ?. The team looks great but I have the problem that stopped working. I hope to answer as soon as possible . Thank You.</li>
    <li> Ok so, I just got this thing so I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see results yet but, that being said I have had this done in an office, it was kind of expensive but, it works! The machine I have sounds exactly the same and gets warm exactly the same as the one they were using on me in the office, I think it works, I will follow up with my results but, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is exactly what I wanted for an excellent price, now I can work on a couple other areas besides my abdominals.</li>
    <li> I am really not sure about this machine. I don&#x27;t see much of an effect. The manual is not very explanatory, and you really need to know more about the settings in specific areas. I have only been using it a month now, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet...</li>
    <li> Hi .. I bought this machine on January 2015 &amp; i used it about 50 times but i can&#x27;t see any benefit until now , i&#x27;m not sure may be because our voltage in united arab emirates is higher than the voltage in usa? The voltage her is 220/240&lt;br /&gt;So how many amber should i use if it was 10 amber in USA with 110 voltage??</li>
    <li> I have ordered my new spa system and would like for Miss JC to contact me for classes, thank you, I am looking forward to your assistance! email:  noella_blake@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> This product have no FDA document&#x27;s, then it is not suitable to be used in United states, and if it is enter then it won&#x27;t be exported, I take this device but not delivered to me yet, because it has no approved documents, and it is a big fail to loss my money for nothing</li>
    <li> Thank you for helping with my situation I was out of town and could not get back to you. Very helpful, It is greatly appreciated</li>
    <li> WENT TO RETURN AND IM GOIN THRU HELL PURE HELL</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim to see if it would help with some of the unsightly fat bulges I am developing.  Ultra Sound clinics for fat loss are popping up everywhere and I thought this would be better than going to some clinic.  Well I have used this repetitively almost every day on certain areas of my body. I have it set for the highest setting and have tried all sorts of wand movement. I think I have used it for at least two months now and I have seen Zero results. So Please do not waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Machine arrived, but does not work.  Waiting to find out how I get my money back and return it to the shipper, with no fee.</li>
    <li> I like this machine but the Medium Ultrasonic head for facial works sometimes and sometimes NOT, I complained before to the company, they did reply back to me, if I can get it fix my self. Well I did, I spent money on that and still that particular part is not working well, I believe that is factory defect. Is not even a year that I bought it, and I have been having this problem from the beginning. Would you please help me, maybe they can send another one to replace this damage head. As your costumer I believe you are going to help me to solve this problem, thanking you in advance. The other two heads are working fine.</li>
    <li> Hi Miss JC I would love a class on how to use this machine or any information you are able to send. My email is christinalandryxo@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much!  :-)</li>
    <li> You will not see results instantly. You must work out and do CARDIO for at least 30 minutes everyday for 2 weeks at LEAST. You must also change your DIET and decrease the amount of sugar/fats you consume. Avoid alcohol, carbonated beverages besides sparkling water and you will see a result. You have to drink 2 liters of water prior to using this machine, during and after. Basically drink a lot of water because in order to get rid of the fat, it travels through your lymphatic system and you pee it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not see any results if you&lt;br /&gt;1) don&#x27;t exercise for at least 30 minutes (cardio) *walking for an hour or doing light exercise will do barely anything because you need to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;2) continue to eat unhealthy food (fast-food, sodas, pig etc.) *you can eat carbohydrates such as double fiber whole grain bread but not white bread&lt;br /&gt;3) don&#x27;t drink a lot of water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend buying ultrasonic gel (which does not come with this) because otherwise your skin will burn from the intensity of the laser and it hurts a lot and it will leave bruises. Be careful when going over the hip area or any boney area in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these basic steps you will see results. Also it is not hard to use the machine if you use logic and reasoning/critical thinking or have a basic ground of common sense. There is an instruction manual that comes with it which isn&#x27;t super helpful, but you can get the idea if you play around with the machine and try operating yourself.</li>
    <li> Would love a class from JC on ultrasound on these machines. Can you please contact me at jmqs5&amp;hotmail.com. Really grateful for your time and effort!</li>
    <li> I bought the -Cavitation Lipo Laser Sextupole Bipolar RF Vacuum+ Golden Pulse Beauty 24K Bar.&lt;br /&gt;Model: WLUU551-BB24K off of e-bay. It arrived within 10 days packed really well. No instructions on how to use the machine. You can download the manuel on there sight -Mychway and look for your model, manuel will be on right side of page. I am 46yrs, have had 3 children so my tummy area is pouchy. I used the 40k cavitation on 30% for 15 minutes once and notice a change. Its amazing! This weekend I will use the RF six polar on my tummy, thighs, arms and saddle bag area. So far well worth the cost! My 24yr old daughter is using the 40k on her thighs and buttock area. She has noticed smoother thighs and size reduction. Go to youtube to watch how to use the wands. Do ot use without glycerine or a ultrasound gel. You WILL burn yourself!</li>
    <li> After 4 children, I thought I would treat myself to this expensive device to try to tighten up the stubborn tummy area, that exercise has not helped. Unfortunately , I received a plastic box that did absolutely nothing. Would not even turn on. Contacted seller immediately who insisted I pay to ship it back across country - $30+ and they would then provide a replacement. If you could actually see this item in a store, you would never even consider purchasing. Let alone, for this price. It is a nothing, lightweight, scammy piece of junk! Certainly there are &amp;#34;real models&amp;#34; out there - but THIS is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Please take a moment and look how all the glowing reviews are NOT VERIFIED sales. I am a verified sale. Plus the reviews describe completely different experiences on how this thing works, i.e. some say heat, some say not, some say quiet, some say loud vibrations. There are clearly reviewed by people who have never even purchased for tried this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy this and go through all the aggravation and trouble that I have. This return has been upgraded to an A-Z amazon claim, and I am 2 months now without my return after an insured return receipt.&lt;br /&gt;The company Shangwen Industrial Co. LTD is unethical and dishonest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And somehow the SELLER: Shangwen Industrial Co. LTD was able to have my verified negative Seller review removed?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done extensive research of cavitation, and the science behind it works. However, the only peer-reviewed studies show that the system works when the area in question is treated with a solution injected first, such a saline or or distilled water, followed by ultrasound on that area. However, most clinics the practice cavitation are not doing this anyway. The studies also confirmed that you need a minimum of 3MHZ of frequency for it to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I also researched the cavitation devices offered on Amazon and saw that many of them have the same description and/or instruction pamphlet in the information area. It seems that they are posting the general science behind cavitation, along with basic hardware and additional capabilities requiring accessories that are only offered on the more high-tech, costlier models. There are models that offer the vacuum and radio frequency (RF), but this isn&#x27;t one of them. Although it may seem like a better deal to just get the more expensive one, since they aren&#x27;t that much more costly, you&#x27;re taking a bigger risk monetarily if the machine happens to be dysfunctional and you&#x27;re buying something that at clinical level cost thousands, so though it&#x27;s cheaper because it&#x27;s non-FDA it&#x27;s still using the most cost-effective parts to make a complex machine.&lt;br /&gt;The more advanced models also have quite a few bad reviews, whole the good reviews are idiomatic and obviously fake.&lt;br /&gt;I, for one, am starting with this basic machine and going from there.</li>
    <li> Just received in the mail,  with no manual.  Looked up info so fine there.  My questone is. ..why doesn&#x27;t time go down and why don&#x27;t  I feel the large head unit vibrating?  Small one does.  Do I have a defective piece?  If so,  how do I order a new one?</li>
    <li> I have  used it 4 time  and &#x60;I see a slight improvement.  I have research about cavitation and I think is going takes 12 to 14 treatment to see actual improvement and then twice a month for maintenance. It&#x27;s going to take a long time to see the result.  That&#x27;s my humble opinion after all my research.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I think this has been working to remove cellulite and trim up my thighs. It has reduced my saddlebags. However, the instructions are poorly written and so I am not sure what level I am at or what I am supposed to be using...It is not returnable so beware...It came very quickly after ordered (a week). I think it is well built. It is heavy and the attachments are sturdy. I am glad I bought it because it has made a difference. I need to use it more though and then I can write again.</li>
    <li> The machine did not do anything for me.  I don&#x27;t have a ton on cellulite or fat, but the machine would not warm up...I contacted the company but we just went back and forth and their English was very bad so it was very few words.......Basically as others stated they wanted a video to ensure you were plugging the machine in correctly............JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRODUCT DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE IF YOU SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT...</li>
    <li> This machine is too intense for me. When using the large ultrasound head at its highest intensity the machine gets so hot it could burn you. When using it at its lower intensity levels I do not believe I was getting optimal results.</li>
    <li> The seller shipped quickly. I have been using the machine for a couple weeks now and am very pleased with how it works.</li>
    <li> Works like spected, just the power suplly mus to be full range for all country. and everythink is ok on this device.</li>
    <li> I am trying to ascertain if it has a vacuum and radio frequency output.  According to the image, that is a &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;, but they are describing the product as &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;radio frequency&amp;#34;.  If I am not satisified with why their description and the image differ so greatly, I&#x27;ll report them to Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Miss JC. I would very much appreciate more instruction with this machine. My contact it kerih77@hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This machine works but you need to have realistic expectation. I workout regularly Ballet, Hot yoga, running etc. but, after my first child I could not get rid of my cellulite. I originally purchased a groupon deal for $150.00 for 9 sessions  and after the 6 sessions I noticed a difference.But to have the other areas treated would cost $600.00 because you can only use the group on deal once. So... I wrote down the machines name and googled it and, this is the same machine my doctor uses. Im using it twice a week and I have noticed great results. But have realistic expectation if you are looking to loose weight this is not a machine for you...this  machine is idea for people how are 10-15lbs from their ideal weight and, are just trying to get rid stubborn fat pockets ( stomach, inner and outer thighs). Yes you still need to workout and eat right but,&lt;br /&gt;this machine is for smoothing and contouring not wight loss. the machine does really work.</li>
    <li> Have been comparing the different machine.Will be ordering one of these machines and would like  Miss JC to contact me at darcwbk@gmail.com</li>
    <li> The product arrived much faster than the estimated arrival. I received it in 9 days over Christmas break. Good product! The description is inaccurate, this product does not have radiofrequency probes, only ultrasound, no RF, no vacuum.  The instructions in the product description is also inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite those errors in the description, the product works great. It has a one year warranty, although I do not see a return address for service. Can I have the service address just in case of future problems?  I also do not see a manufacturer name. It is not an FDA approved model which is why it is affordable. However, the device does perform ultrasound cavitation and does it very well. I am a licensed diagnostic medical ultrasonographer and know how to use this machine safely. I use diagnostic ultrasound on sick patients in a hospital and I teach ultrasound so I know ultrasound physics.  I am using it on myself and in 2 sessions, I have lost 4.5&amp;#34; (3&amp;#34; off stomach and 1&amp;#34; off thighs, 1/2&amp;#34; off arms in 1 session). It is very effective if used correctly. The instructional manual is written in poor english but the instructions are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Please note that on different parts of the body, the intensity should be adjusted to avoid burns etc. I can use intensity of 5 on my abs (with continuous wave) but it hurts so I adjust the intensity to 3-4 on my chunky thighs (with continuous wave) and 2-3 intensity with pulsed wave on my arms.  Try those settings and drink at least 3L of water before and after the procedure for 2-3 days. I have not tried the eye/face probe.  I have tried the 1MHz probe because I thought it was RF but it is just 1MHz ultrasound.  It should be used once every 3 days (72 hours) so that the lymphatic system does not get overloaded. Lymphatic drainage massage and drinking water are necessary for the best results.  Side effects can be none or naseau, burns, redness. If naseau occurs, drink water immediately and candied ginger helps.  Redness will disappear after the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like ultrasound training for this device, send me a comment with your contact info.inger helps.  Redness will disappear after the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like ultrasound training for this device, send me a comment with your contact info.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my results. I waited to write a review until I had used it for several months. My skin is smoother, I have lost 1.5 inches off each thigh and 3 inches from my stomach. You have to make time to use this machine if you want to get good results. it is somewhat awkward to use on yourself. It does cause a &amp;#34;ringing&amp;#34; in the ears while in use but only lasts during cavi usage. I recommend you buy the ultra sound gel in the gallon, because it is cheaper, and you will go through a lot if you use it on a schedule like you should for optimal results. Also this is not going to work as a replacement for a healthy diet and exercise...it is a tool not a miracle.</li>
    <li> good very responsable</li>
    <li> at my heaviest 284. down to 198 and still loosing thanks to diet pills. This machine works well to shrink pizza dough type skin and wrinkly skin as well. I bought a cheap machine thinking it won&#x27;t work. WOW it does. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s so quiet until I put it close to my ear. all I feel is a warm to the touch. The key is drink plenty of water and do a good workout right after treatment to flush the fat away. BIG TIP try milk thistle to clear the liver. Fat build up in the liver can prevent weight loss. got off Dr.OZ. I&#x27;ve done my research on these machines. to lose fat and shrink skin try cool sculpting machines. have not bought one yet very expensive. I figured i&#x27;d try the cheap way first. no regret&#x27;s. LUV N THIS!!!</li>
    <li> Everything right, good quality, on time. I can recommend this product to buy trough internet whoever need it for :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this product appx 5 days ago. It came in well-packaged and looked like it&#x27;s been re-tested here in US, once received from China. The user&#x27;s manual is kind-of short and written in poor language, although the major points are well articulated.  I think you&#x27;ll have to do some home work on your own (Googling/ YouTubing) to learn how to properly use this product.  Before trying it on myself (and to make sure this machine really works) I first started with a little experiment, that I have seen on YouTube.  I put a whole egg yolk in a glass dish and added some water to cover it an inch over the yolk&#x27;s top.  Then I put 40kHz cavitation head (at power setting #5) slightly into the water and turned the device on. The yolk got dissolved in water in less than 4min!!! Wow! That worked... Then I decided to use the same 40kHz head on my belly for 15 min at power setting #3. I put a lot of UltraSonic gel and started the procedure as I have seen on YouTube, continuous, circular motion with speed of ½ inch a second. Everything was absolutely painless and I could not feel anything, except some hi-pitch buzzing sound in my ears (later I have learned from my friend Radiologist, that this sound  is produced by ultrasound waves reflecting off the skeleton bones and resonating all way up to the scull -so this is absolutely normal when using 40kHz cavitation head. He told me that ultrasound treatment procedure for kidney stone patients causes the same buzzing effect). After 15 mins when procedure was over, I felt my belly was slightly heated and I immediately  felt a LOT of energy. So, I washed off the gel and hit the gym to let it all out. I felt so energized - you can&#x27;t believe! That was my first time... Two days later I found that I am half inch thinner  ;-)  So, this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Easy to use.  I can feel that it work but need more time to see the final result as I want.</li>
    <li> I used this machine 30 minutes a day for two months&lt;br /&gt;with absolutely No change.</li>
    <li> Half and half on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;The product actually does help you lose weight. First time I tried it, I lost about a pound over the course of three tries. After a few months, I gained some weight and then used the cavitation machine again and quite a bit of fat came out when I went to the bathroom. The bathroom visits went on for several hours but it all eventually came out. I lost almost 2 lbs from 2 consecutive treatments with the large head (2 x 15 min). It took about 3 days for my skin to un-stretch and come back after the lost fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;This machine is only a cavitation machine. There is no RF and there is no vacuum system. The seller is very misleading in the description and also the naming of this product. It will not help you with tightening skin or acne scars. I was hoping to use this for my acne scars for my face. The little pointed one didn&#x27;t really do much for my acne scars. They haven&#x27;t lightened or softened.Not sure if the smaller medium probe actually helps with fat reduction on your face. I tried it and I didn&#x27;t see any results like I did with the large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s like someone just loosely translated the chinese instructions without checking which definition of each character should be used, and put them on paper. The instructions don&#x27;t really make sense. There are no good instructions on how to use the product either. I had to look up videos and watch cavitations on youtube to see how to do it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally plug the machine into 220V outlet  and it burnt the fuse so I have to pay 50 Singapore Dollars to fix it and purchase an AC converter but it&#x27;s worth it. It took me a while to figure out how to use the machine.. So far If used correctly it will give an awesome result, just remember to hydrate prior to cavitation and after for better result..</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s make my skin nice and soft and the shipment was very fast than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you:)</li>
    <li> 300 $ thrown away, this machine is a piece of crap I can&#x27;t believe I bought this. I have contacted the seller and they told me just to send them a video to see if I&#x27;m doing it correctly.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up or shake I&#x27;m extremely upset that I spent my money on a broken machine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and avoid aggravation.</li>
    <li> I just got the ultrasonic machine. I used it once, and it worked like the ultrasonic machine the spa had used! Happy so far...</li>
    <li> Mine broke down after about a month. NO customer service, zero!</li>
