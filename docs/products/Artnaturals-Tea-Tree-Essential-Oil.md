<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We use tea tree oil for may things in our daily hygiene routines. The glass dropper arrived broken. We ordered some plastic ones to replace it.</li>
    <li> We have a pool, so we have plenty of friends and kids that come hang out, swim, walk around the house barefoot, and use our guest bathroom. Tea Tree Oil is such a powerful antibacterial agent that it&#x27;s been proven effective even against antibiotic resistant bacteria like MRSA, so I make an all purpose spray cleaner that contains tea tree oil, vinegar, water, and lemon essential oil to clean door handles, toilet seats, and sinks, and I also put the same combo in my steam mop to use when cleaning the tile throughout the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art Naturals Tea Tree Oil is advertised as 100% pure and natural with no additives or fillers, and it comes in a big 4oz size dark glass bottle with a glass dropper which makes it easy to dispense the right number of drops I want without wasting any when I&#x27;m using it. It has a fairly strong medicinal kind of smell, but the scent does dissipate fairly rapidly when its used.  This size should last me a good while, but to keep yours fresh longer you should store it someplace cool and dark, preferably at around 68 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided at no cost for evaluation purposes.m very pleased with the quality and value of this nice 4oz bottle from Art Naturals and will definitely buy it again when I run low!</li>
    <li> This is a good size bottle for the price. Tea tree is a must have in all households it has so many uses. It has a good smell, and came quickly, the dropper got broken in the mail. But the are quite thin and fragile.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Tea Tree Essential Oils and have tried a few different brands and this Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil is definitely just as good as the ones I already own. The smell is literally the exact same and the texture is the same as well. I love using this tea tree oil in my diffusers around my house because I really enjoy the nice tea tree oil scent and with the 3-5 drops that I use it&#x27;s not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy using tea tree oil in my shampoo and conditioner. When I add it to my conditioner it actually gives my scalp a cooling feeling which I really enjoy because I know that it&#x27;s helping my scalp. The smell does go away fairly quickly once it&#x27;s dry but there is still a lingering scent which I personally really like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil comes in a big 4oz bottle that will definitely last for a long time as you really don&#x27;t need a lot of it at once. It also comes with a glass dropper so you can easily get the right amount of drops without wasting any. I would definitely recommend this Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I love natural oils. This one is really nice one!</li>
    <li> Good variety of purposes and nice amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know yet, special effects,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i relieved why no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good oil. Clears skin pretty quickly</li>
    <li> Smells like pine sol.  Very strong smell.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is a great essential oil to have. We use it to make homemade arm deodorant. You can use it for many things we tend to have a bottle around all the time. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  This was on sale and with the &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; shipping it was a GREAT deal!</li>
    <li> love it  nice huge bottle too</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Product as advertised!  Very happy with purchase. Would order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> ☺ - Strong oil, large bottle, glass dropper included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil is a nice amber color, with a fairly strong lemon/pine scent.  The list of uses for Tea Tree Oil is insanely long, so I won&#x27;t go into it here.  I&#x27;m using it currently, mixed with castor oil, to see if it will wipe out a bit of athlete&#x27;s foot I&#x27;ve been wrasslin&#x27; with.  The included glass dropper makes it very easy to mix, without spilling it all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product, allowing me to share my honest opinion with you</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Tea Tree Oil for a great price and large size. My daughter uses it on bug bites. The bugs love her. I use it on blemishes and sometimes add a drop to my face cleanser. I have even mixed it with emu oil for skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I needed mine for a few scratches on my hand.  It helped me with that.  I noticed that a little went a long way which also made me think this will personally last me a while.  This is the possibly the strongest Tea Tree Oil I have smelled.  I liked that it is 100% Natural and to me that is worth the not so pleasant scent.  I received product for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Essential oils such as tea tree oil has many uses.It can be used for hair and skin treatment or for burns. It does have a strange odor to it but I just assume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural and nothing has been added. got this at discounted price.</li>
    <li> wonderful quality using it to tea scalp psoriasis and seems to be helping so far only been treating less then one week I apply small amount to each sore.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product, will keep reordering</li>
    <li> Good product for many uses.</li>
    <li> It worked like the doctor said it would. My son was very happy with this product ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of natural alternatives and a distributor for a top brand of essential oils. Money being tight and the sudden need for Tee Tree (Melaluca Alternifolia) oil brought me to Amazon for a source that was pure. It&#x27;s not easy since so many brands don&#x27;t process the sources properly, dilute them with carrier oils or use heat which destroys the properties. This bottle of Tea Tree smells like it should and looks like it should. I&#x27;m not 100% convinced it&#x27;s as good as YL but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch. I can say that it did the job it was purchased for - eliminating head lice in one treatment. Add a few droppers into a bit of shampoo, add to the laundry and spray around the bedding. Once that was taken care of I added some to our hand soap dispenser for healthier softer hands. Tee Tree is a great antiseptic, anti-viral and anti-bacterial. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll use it come flu season to avoid that virus again.</li>
    <li> Have used it on my skin tags and works great....can find numerous reasons that I will buy again....paid $10 and is now $13....will wait until it returns to my original price to buy again....GREAT VALUE FOR ALL IT DOES!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this stuff...has so many great uses. Was excited to recieve this so fast... Great quality &amp; price thanks to a great seller. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about two weeks now. I purchased it to help with acne, and honestly, I am very happy ! I had to find my way with it. I made the mistake to use it pure, and got redness all over my face. Then, I added 4-5 drops to a little water bottle, and used a make up remover pad to apply it to my face and cleavage twice a day, or anytime I see zits coming. I can see my face getting clearer and clearer , I have less blacks pots.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean my piercings too, and also add some to my nail polishes and a few drops to my toner.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;My husband hate the smell, tho. It is very strong?</li>
    <li> Good size bottle.  Feels great mixed w my shampoo</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil so far is the best product I have used on my face to get rid of a few acne spots. Of course I don&#x27;t recommend applying it directly on your skin or else it could leave a dry spot. Instead, dilute the tea tree oil with a little bit of water to lessen the strength and apply a few drops on the spot you want it on. Definitely will buy once I run out!</li>
    <li> The smell is delicious, and is 100% natural.  There are so many uses for tea tree oil.  I shared some with my mother as the bottle is pretty big and will last me a couple of months.  I add tea tree oil to every other shampoo bottle I buy during the school year. It repels and kills lice since there is a breakout of lice in schools.  I received a discount to try out this product.</li>
    <li> I had a horrible blister and tried many different things. This finally did the trick!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been wanting to try tea tree oil for the last few years. I could never find it at a reasonable price though. I am so happy I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with conducting a skin test to verify that I would not have an allergic reaction to the product. (Due to I heard that it was possible to be allergic to some essential oils)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to test it out on a pimple that had been bugging me for a few days. After a few days of applying a drop twice a day I did notice an improvement.  I then found out from some ladies that I should never apply essential oils directly to my skin. I plan to look further into this, due to it says on the bottle that you can apply a small amount to pimples. But, since they told me this I decided I would just mix a drop in with my Divine Daily Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with this product and can tell that a bottle will last me a long while, due to you do not have to use that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a convenient glass dropped that can be screwed onto the bottle a a top. I really like this because I hate having to use disposable droppers. This also helps to keep from crossing droppers between oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I purchased and used this for poison ivyrash. It worked great and was a great sized bottle. It smells like varnous, but it worked for my purpose. Would get thus again. I received a discount firmyreview.</li>
    <li> Good smell. I don&#x27;t know yet its effect. I will update review later.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and it was packaged very well with no leaking. It also came with a dropper so the oil could be measured out without wasting the oil. This seems to be a good quality oil.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for all kinds of things, and have for years.  I have tried many brands, and am am more than pleased with this one.  I will definitly be buying this again!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best, using this to repel ticks this summer.</li>
    <li> Great product,  as others have stated very strong scent. But works really well. I did receive product at discounted for my review.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for daily use on husband dandruff...&amp; smell great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Art Natural Tea Tree Oil to add to my home made bath bombs and sea salt scrubs. This product is amazing and I love the dropped. I will definitely repurchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at discount for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll take me a little bit to get used to the strong odor but I&#x27;m hopeful !</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil and products with tea tree oil in it for a very long time, so I am well aware of the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very taken aback by another review that cautioned on the use of this brand because of the smell. When I opened my bottle I didn&#x27;t find that it smelled any different from any of the other tea tree oils I have purchased. I even did a sniff comparison with this bottle and some I bought from Whole Foods - they smelled the same to me. This one is just a better value for the dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is not organic though. Other than that, I see no problem using this tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> This formula works like magic - it helps with rashes, ringworm, dandruff, acne, sunburns, and any skin&#x27;s unusual conditions. Most recently it was used to treat a bad sunburn I had and it actually was less red the day after use.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to review and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised! I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well, because I didn&#x27;t realize I would be getting such a large bottle! I love that it is 100% pure as some oils these days are mixed with others and labeled pure. I have thick, coarse, 4C natural hair that is also very fragile. The tea tree oil works great on the scalp to help relieve dandruff and itchiness. I also apply it to my skin after a mosquito bite. It seems to help sooth the itch as well. I also apply it to tooth aches. I haven&#x27;t tried it on acne yet, but heard it works wonders for that too! Tea tree oils is definitely a staple in my medicine cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: The views expressed are my own and do not reflect that of Art Naturals or Amazon.com*</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to get rid of mildew in the shower. I had mixed 15 drops in a cup of warm water and sprayed down the rubber strip on the bottom of the shower, let it sit for about 5 min and then wiped it off, get it very dry for it to actually keep mildew from forming. I also use it to disinfect kitchen counters and wipe down toilets. Same thing mix about 10 drops with water and spray and wipe off, make sure to always shake the bottle because it is oil and does not mix with water! It is also super for getting rid of funky washing machine smell! There are more uses on the bottle, especially for beauty rituals. I give this tee tree oil 5 stars, it smells strong and does the job of disinfecting very well!</li>
    <li> I use this a lot to fight dandruff and lice.  I add it to mine and my kids&#x27; shampoos.  My kids who are in daycare of public school have not had a lice outbreak in years, and I find that my dandruff is near gone while I use the tea tree oil and I am itch free.  The smell is very strong, so you only need to use a small amount to see results.</li>
    <li> Not oily feeling and smells great. Nice size bottle!</li>
    <li> This has a better antiseptic/herbal smell to it than the other brands I have used in the past. It was carefully packaged to ensure no spill/breakage whatsoever during shipping. I love that it came with a dropper for easy dispensing, that is definitely a plus. I used it last night for my scalp and I love the tingly feeling it gives after washing my hair, it smells really clean and no strong pungent smell, just clean herbaly smell.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was chosen to test this product and provide my unbiased product review. I purchased this product to use on my daughter&#x27;s arms, as she gets dry rashes that really irritate her. It has really helped the itching and seems to be healing her arm quickly. I definitely&lt;br /&gt; recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of tree oil. So very refreshing. I have used it in my mud mask, put it a DIY spray bottle toput it on my dog it is keeping the mosquito&#x27;s away and I have not seen any fleas in him in a while. There are so many uses for Tree Oil I will be using as many of them as possible. Putting it in my dish soap, shampoo, body wash and cleaning supplies. I love the smell and how well it works on everything. This is my unbiased honest opinion and received this product free for my opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this at a reduced price because I wanted to give my honest opinion about it. I rub this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels magnificent. A great product</li>
    <li> My wife and I have put this in the shampoo we already use and it works great!  No more expensive Paul Mitchell tea tree oil shampoo!</li>
    <li> I love to use this as a blemish control and also to keep my hair moisturized. A new thing that I&#x27;ve learned with this is that you can put it in shampoo and it&#x27;ll keep the lice away. Which is perfect because my daughter just started 1st grade.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil. We use it in our lotions and creams for sore and aching muscles. Great to use if you have joint pain as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and size.  This will last awhile.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my blackhead prone areas after facial cleansing and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in just 5 days.  Skin is clearing up, and it isn&#x27;t dry or flakey.</li>
    <li> A great buy for me. Thank you very much. Hope to do business with you again.</li>
    <li> At first, i want to let you know i purchased this with FULL PRICE on my own desire, NOT the discounted price or exchange for honest review. I&#x27;m skeptical to read some reviews which they got the free product or discounted price or exchange it for &amp;#34;so called honest&amp;#34; review.&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil is amazing, i used the tea tree oil to blend with water for house cleaning (especially cabinets, the T3 oil leave the fresh scent in it). You won&#x27;t believe it, i also dropped few drops of T3 oil on every corner of my kitchen top, the ants and the bugs changed their mind and moved to next door probably. Alright, the awesome second testimonial is coming, i burned my arm from the oven heat, left a burnt mark immediately and guess what?! I applied T3 oil on my arm (the burned area) continuously 3 times a day, and my arm healed like magic! Attached the pictures of my 7-Days skin healed results.</li>
    <li> Good product! The jar was bigger than I expected!</li>
    <li> I love this product! This can be used for so many things but I personally use it to help with my acne. I&#x27;m 32 and I suffer from acne and I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist and tried numerous products over the years since this problem started at a young age well nothing has helped me as much as this tea tree oil! I started using it as soon as I got it I dabbed some on a cotton ball and applied a light coat in the morning and night only on the blemishes once it got better I would use at night only to not over dry your face this method is also the fastest way to heal a blemish. I higjly recommend this product as it can be used for so many things!</li>
    <li> Can use it for so many things. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells bad. does not smell like the other tea tree oil I got from KIS OILS or even Calily.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Product is great but dropper sucks.</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree Oil and this stuff is amazing! And it is such a great deal!</li>
    <li> Product good price and quality but the dropper came broken.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother because he has dandruff issues. Wow what a difference this has made. I read online about different items that help dandruff. This honestly works like a charm for him. He has been using it at night before bed. He and I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to resolve any scalp issues! I luckily purchased this a discount and would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Super concentrated High grade oil..</li>
    <li> Great price for size.  Love that it has the dropper! I use this on everything! Face, minor cuts and scrapes, burns, dry scalp, and just because!</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is one that everyone should keep in there home. Tea Tree helps with everything from hair &amp; scalp to nails &amp; body. The smell is great and the oil rubs in easily. I treat my hair with it every other week but use it in the place of lotions most days and nights. I like using oils to heal and moisturize my skin over lotions because I feel that my skin absorbs them faster and easier. I did receive this bottle at a promotional cost in exchange of my 100% Honest and Unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> A gigantic bottle of wonderfulness. I add a few drops of it in my toner and it&#x27;s been working wonders. My acne is getting better and my face isn&#x27;t as oily. I also mix this with body lotion and put it on after shaving. This is probably the cheapest and best tea tree oil there is!</li>
    <li> I love tree oil&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;It really helping my pimles and acnes.&lt;br /&gt;pure tea tree oil makes my skin clearer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the good product.&lt;br /&gt;recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Please know my review below is totally heartfelt due to my actual recent experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought many, MANY bottles of 100% tea tree essential oil over the the past 15 or 20 years from several different manufacturers as well as from various sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequently I know how 100% quality tea tree oil smells.  It is nothing like how artnaturals (this brand) smells; this one threw me completely for a loop when I smelled it.  The smell of this one smells NOTHING like tea tree oil. Smelling this has given me a huge headache and I am absolutely sending it back a.s.a.p..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is SERIOUSLY the first time the smell of &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; (based on this experience I really believe I should put those three words in quotes) does not in any way smell like tea tree oil...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping my experience is unusual, that possibly my bottles were from an unusual yet bad batch. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this two stars instead of one because of the low price. I suppose that should have tipped me off. I was just hopeful.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil has so many amazing uses! With kids going back to school you will want to stock up on this stuff. Why? Because it can keep headlice away! I use it to put a few drops in our shampoos. It is also great for cuts bruises and fungus. This product did not disappoint. The bottle is a nice large size and the dropper is a must have! Glad they added it with the product. Tea tree oil has a strange smell to me its not my favorite smell in oils by far but it is a solid must have in your medicine cabinet. I am very pleased with this product. I was sent this product free to review and it does not effect my ratings. I am a firm believer and user of oils. I compared this with my other bottles of tea tree I have purchased in the past and see no difference other than the price here is much cheaper than what I paid on others! Great product many uses be sure to google all different things you can do with tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Really like this oil.  Love that it came with a dropper.  I use it in a diffuser in my office.  Very nice,</li>
    <li> Love this oil used this on my husband he has very dry skin. It has worked for him</li>
    <li> I love love love this tea tree oil. There are so many uses for oil that I had never heard of until I received home. I love adding to water to wipe down the bathroom. Leaves everything smelling so clean. I will order again!!</li>
    <li> Dropper came shattered.</li>
    <li> The Tea Tree Oil is truly amazing, I use it everyday but the dropper was broken upon arrival. Is there any way I could get a replacement?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet but the customer service of art naturals was great.  They replaced the broken dropper promptly .  Thank you</li>
    <li> The Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Pure Oil is totally amazing.  I never thought one product had so many uses.  I added a couple of drops in with my face mask, what a difference and nice aroma.  Also I put a couple drops in my husbands shampoo to help with slight dandruff.  This is a product that you can literally use from head to toe.  I am still learning uses for the Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil.  I would highly recommend the Tea Tree Oil to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt;I have received the Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Pure Oil without any compensation in exchange to use and provide my honest opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> Some of the best oil I have used thus far...hands down.! I can put this stuff in my hair, on my skin, in my shampoo/conditioner, body wash, even my moisturizer.... And it smells great.!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN RETURN FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> my initial review of the tea tree oil is that it is a good product . I have been using it daily and have found that it will keep the mosquitos from bothering me when I go outside. I will keep using it to see if it helps me to strengthen my nails ( a suggestion on the bottle) Thank you again for this essential oil.</li>
    <li> I received the Art Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil for a small fee, for review. I have just started using essential oils and I was amazed at how many uses there are for this oil. The perfect natural antiseptic to have in any household. Use it to help treat or cure a variety of skin conditions/hair &amp; scalp conditions. So far I have used it mixed with a carrier oil and put it on my scalp, I have mixed it with water for a cleaner for the bathroom, I have put it in my carpet cleaner water when shampooing the carpets. I have also put it in an electric diffuser for aromatherapy benefits. This Tea Tree Oil is high quality and this bottle will last me a long time, especially since you only need a few drops at a time.</li>
    <li> Being without Tea Tree oil in my house is not good since I have found so many uses for it. For the price that I paid on Amazon, I bought 2 bottles...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I do not think this is tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve used it before and it smells way different than this. This smells piney and leaves a different feel on your  skin. I&#x27;m afraid to use this product.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product, and I love it I&#x27;m using it for different porpoises, like for headlice and skin.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, very good price compared to my local retail outlet, and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s just as pure. Will be checking out some of their other oils and supplements as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell. Its strong, but also not too strong. Its my first time using tea tree oil and so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face and put some on a cotton ball and placed it in the house. I&#x27;m liking it so far. The only bad thing that happened is that the dropper fell and it cracked and I stepped on it and cut my feet a little. So the glass dropper is nice, but DONT DROP IT, it will crack.</li>
    <li> Bought to protect my girls hair from lice however finding so many more uses for it.</li>
    <li> love this tea tree oil, I use it for various things around the house, and for personal use.  I have three kids so I use it on anything from scratches to bug bites.  *I received this at a deep discount for review purposes*</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little Skeptical at first when I was told to use this tea tree oil to treat my daughters lice but IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM! She comes home from school every year with lice and it is so annoying but this tea tree oil has saved us! I also added some to my shampoo and my hair feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and low cost on a quality product&lt;br /&gt;Fyi comes with dropper pictured</li>
    <li> Very strong smell. Mixed feeling on this</li>
    <li> If you use tea tree oil and appreciate its capabilities - this is what you want to buy!  For $5 more than what I paid for 1 oz at the health food store - I got 4 times the oil! That over a 50% discount and the quality and purity is spot on.</li>
    <li> I am a member of Elite Deal Club so I get to try awesome products at a really great price. Tee tree oil is awesome. You can put it in your shampoo or conditioner or use as essential oils. I recommend anyone to try this product</li>
    <li> This oil is so strong that all you need is a few drops. I use it on my hair and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> great value!! Love, love Tea tree oil would love to get directions on different ways to use oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TEA TREE OIL, I USE IT ON BLEMISHES, BUG BITES, RASHES ANY REAL SKIN AILMENT. I BELIEVE IT WORKS GREAT ON SAID AILMENTS. THIS OIL IS JUST AS GREAT AS OTHER OILS I HAVE TRIED. THE FRAGRANCE IS STRONG AND FRESH SMELLING. I MYSELF ENJOY THE SMELL OF TEA TREE OIL WHERE OTHERS TEND TO NOT. I RECEIVED MINE AT A DISCOUNT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Smell is too strong like a pinesol. I guess it is helping to dry my acne  and probably the reason why my facial brush cracked as I mixed drop of it into my facial wash.</li>
    <li> great oil.. very pure stuff</li>
    <li> This stuff is working great on my toenail fungus!</li>
    <li> I tend to be picky about my essential oils, I like to know how it was extracted especially if we are going to use it typically or inhale it. When I looked at purchasing art natural tea tree oil, I didn&#x27;t see that information and so I decided to try it for my home made cleaning solutions.  I bust through those tiny, super expensive bottles, and I hope 4ozs will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this oil seems to perform just as my other tea tree oil from the health food store does, I used it all this week in my diy shower cleaner and mold and mildew are no more present them before. Additionally, my husband added it to his shaving soap mix and is happy with its performance there, saying it&#x27;s helping his skin heal any nicks and preventing blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received a discount on this product so I could try it and offer my honest opinion on it.</li>
    <li> Love the dropper. Largest amount for lowest price.</li>
    <li> Love tea tree oil. This is a huge bottle. Seller was awesome will definitely order from them again .</li>
    <li> Great tea tree oil! Big bottle comes packaged nicely wrapped in cardboard. Also comes with dropper. Works great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help prevent my child from getting head lice in public school. So far it&#x27;s been working! I will purchase this again once my bottle is finished. This bottle has a lot in it. It should last me for a while!</li>
    <li> I am new to making my own cleaners.  This was my first essential oil.  I do like the smell.  Similar to pine but slightly medicinal.  Reminds me of Pin Sol.  The price is good and will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I just got this item today. I purchase this at discounted price and i&#x27;m happy about it is its 4 oz compare to my old one that is 2 oz but a little bit priecey. What i like about this tea tree oil is good for sting, blemishes and mosquito bites. Especially when you have itchy skin because of insect bites, this is a life saving oil.This is good for pimples and stretch marks too. I would buy again another for my mom.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this I could tell that it is good quality tea tree oil.  The only mishap was that the dropper that they shipped was shattered when I received it so I am going to have to improvise and figure out another way to get it out  I emailed the seller but no response yet.....We use tea tree for everything around the house from antibacterial on skin to cleaning the house, BUT the main thing is bug repellent for my family and my garden!!!</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil from art naturals is a great product. So happy I got this. Because recently my daughter bleach her hair and chemically burn her scalp . This product helped her soothe her skin. It also her her scalp from the peeling. Yikes careful when bleaching hair! Scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has many uses. Skin, acne and many other uses. Smells really good. It is natural, non toxin. This can be used on hair and scalp like I did. It can be use on the body, nails, face and mostly all skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate. No pain. No burning no nothing just soothing. Helps heal fast at least for my daughters scalp it did. I recommend it so much if you chemically burn your scalp. Give it a try. I swear u will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample and review for you. With my honest opinion&lt;br /&gt;I hope you try it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item was very excited to use it but when I open the package the glass dropper was broken :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil to treat my scalp for dry skin an dandruff. I mix a bit in with my shampoo. I&#x27;ve never liked the smell of tea tree oil but it works. Ive been using it for a few days and already there is a lot less flaking. The price is good too. I ve used other brands that were higher priced but work the  same. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again. However, I did recieve it free this time for sharing my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> used as recommended on a blemish and has dried up today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclaimer discounted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this purchase, I have always heard about adding tea tree oil to natural cleaners but never bought because i couldn&#x27;t afford it. I was given a deep discount to buy this product and I am so happy. I have used this oil with a natural cleaner and the result is the same as most cleaners. Amazing! Very happy I will be able to use this over and over and over again!</li>
    <li> This seems to be genuine tea tree oil; it smells like it and gives that &amp;#34;tea tree tingle&amp;#34; if you touch it to your lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reservation:  It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong to me as the tea tree oil I&#x27;m used to buying at Trader Joes, and smells slightly different too, so I did a paper blot test on it. Basically you put a drop of oil on an index card. Most essential oils are highly volatile and will evaporate completely, leaving no oil stain on the paper. If it leaves an oil stain, it&#x27;s probably artificial fragrance oil or has been diluted with carrier oil. This oil evaporated at the same rate of the Trader Joe&#x27;s oil. It&#x27;s quite possible this is simply a different source from what I&#x27;m used to smelling, because I don&#x27;t see any indications that it&#x27;s a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This oil has many great uses. Great packaging and convenient dropper for mixing.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is perfect. Package and bottling is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for applying to wounds, adding a couple drops to my dishwasher for cleaning, and even putting it into my defuser for when I have a cough and it helps to clear it up. This is a nice big bottle of pure oil and it comes with a nice dropper so that you don&#x27;t over pour when you need just a small amount because honestly a small amount goes a long ways!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for my head skin&lt;br /&gt;It relief my skin trouble a lot&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for the people who have a trouble in your skin</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say the smell is really strong. For the essential oil diffuser, I can only add 1-2 drops at most. Otherwise, it is really hard to stand the smell. I have also tried to use it with my face wash, add a few drops to bath my feet, and mix it with my body wash, I think it is pretty good when it comes to the skin therapy. The main reason I use it is because I have a dandruff problem. I tried to massage a few drops into my moisturized hair. I do not feel any improvement though. Maybe should give another few tries. On the other hand, the smell it left on your hair may be annoying. I guess the feedback is most for tea tree essential oil instead of this particular brand or product.</li>
    <li> This bottle is much stronger than one that I have.  Not just the smell but the effects.  I get a rash under my arms since we moved up to the desert and nothing fully gets rid of it.  I also get abscesses that run in the family.  It&#x27;s getting rid of one and the rash was gone the next day!  I also got a small cold sore from winds and that was gone in two days.  Very impressed with quality.  Now if your company would start selling a lavender oil, I could purchase that too!</li>
    <li> I used it in my diffuser, on my face, and to wash my hair.  My hair felt cleaner, my pores shrunk, and it made my skin glow.  I am still new at it and I will keep experimenting with this tea tree oil.  It is very strong so don&#x27;t let the oil go into your eyes; it will sting for awhile. My hands never felt so soft since I have been using it.  I very much recommend this product especially for it&#x27;s antibacterial quality.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ve used it in my shampoo, oil infuser and as an antiseptic.  It also has antibiotic properties, so I like to keep it on hand.  I had no issue or complaints about this brand and will keep using it.  Received for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I purhased this product at a disounted rate to review and give an honest opionion.  I received this purchase in two days and it came wrapped very secure with no breakage or leaking. I have used this on my dog to deter fleas and bugs and it has been working great!  I have also used it in my cleaning supplies. The odor is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave that normal &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; smell. My husband is using this on his toenails and it really seems to be helping with his toenail funus. I would recomend this product to a friend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> good products and shipping on time</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil is awesome and great for so many things. This is really great oil at a great price.</li>
    <li> This oil smells amazing..I used it on my dogs ears to prevent infections..He loves it..</li>
    <li> I use this product in all of my homemade personal care.  It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  It&#x27;s works for cold sores and inflamed gums instantly.  I use it in the bath for a refreshing feeling too.  Just go easy on the drops.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected, large bottle for price.</li>
    <li> We love to add tea tree oil to our hair products! Not only does it help our scalps, but it smells amazing! Tea tree has so many great benefits , and it is wonderful if you are dealing with skin bacteria. The dropper makes it so easy to get the perfect amount every time!</li>
    <li> This is god for so may things looked it up n line and wil be using for all sorts of home remedy&amp;#34;s.&lt;br /&gt;Received this for a review.</li>
    <li> Smells great, work beautifully for my seborrheic dermatitis, alot less scalp shedding.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for so many things, Great Price also, add to your shampoos and conditioner for a great hair product!</li>
    <li> This product works really well if you have a cut or scrape. It will heal it much faster than traditional antibiotic ointment plus it is all natural. I used it on my son for his eexema and it seemed to help it heal faster.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle of quality product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Used it for some soap making and the scent is perfect! Plus the good health traits it gives the soap. Prolly gonna buy some more of it</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m shocked how many things I use this oil for and this praticar brand is of excellent quality</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is a must have in everyone&#x27;s home.  Why use man made chemicals when you can use something 100% natural and therapeutic grade,  like this one from Art Naturals.  There is no better antiseptic than the ones that nature provides and it&#x27;s been used for centuries for treatment and healing of many things.  It&#x27;s great for acne.  For that purpose ,  I mix a few drops with a carrier oil such as coconut or almond ,  and apply to face at night.  It really fights the bacteria well.  Do not use it directly on skin because it&#x27;s VERY concentrated and can cause irritation on a lot of ppl.  Use it in your diffuser to knock out the bacterial in the air.  I use it on my dogs when they get scratches...which is a lot.  lol.  The smell is very strong,  so I feel confident that it&#x27;s not been mixed with anything prior to receiving it.  There are some brands of oils that mix theirs and you are not getting all of the benefits.  This is a mainstay in my home,  and should be yours too...especially if you have children and animals around.&lt;br /&gt;I reveived this oil free for my unbiased opinion.  I am very happy with the quality of this brand.</li>
    <li> I initially received this with a broken dropper.  I let seller know &amp; I got a new one a few days later!  I love the glass dropper - it makes it so easy to control the amount you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil has so many uses.  It is one of the best antibacterial oils out there &amp; I use it often in household cleaners.  I saw a few people mention the strong scent.  Tea Tree is pretty strong but I don&#x27;t find this brand any stronger than other ones I have used.  It is not an unpleasant scent at all, just a bit &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;.  This is a very generous bottle size - it will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this comes with suggested uses right on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Ive heard for quite some time about australians have used tea tree in it natural form as well as oils as remedy for EVERYTHING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Its now here in the us and its definitely gotten very big among the natural healing community. The possibilities are endless!! You can literally use this for the common cold right to athletes foot!!&lt;br /&gt;  The night I first recieved this I eecieved an email from my daughters canp saying there was a lice problem. In the past I would spray lots of hairspray as well as tie her hair back tight!! But she swims at camp, and has short hair now!! So what i did was added this to her shampoo, and detangler spray(which she uses after pool daily), and she never got lice!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I suffer from severe calluses on my feet from being on my feet all day. I made a concoction of the tea trea oil and baking soda and warm water and soaked my feet for a while. After my calluses were softer and less achy!!&lt;br /&gt;  The possibilities are endless with tea tree oil!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this tea tree oil at discount for my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking this so far. My daughter has acne and dandruff, we have been using all types of over the counter meds and has been going to a dermatologist. A friend of ours told us to try Tea Tree oil, I don&#x27;t know why I would want to put oil and my daughter&#x27;s already oily skin but I read a lot online and people have had some great results. I really lie how this bottle comes with some instructions on the back. They provide you with ideas on how to use this bottle of oil. You can massage it in your hair while washing, add a few drops to your nail polish to promote growth, treat fungus, or to increase the strength of your nails. You can also add a few drops to your face wash to help inflamed blemishes. I decided to add a few drops along with water into a mini plastic spray bottle. After my daughter showers I spray her scalp  and gently massage, I don&#x27;t want to go overboard since we are still testing it. I also spray her back and face. I found it better to do this light spray right after a shower while the skin is still damp so her skin will absorb the oil better. Her scalp is getting much better, not so itchy and flakey, her face is also not as red as usual so hopefully this Tree oil is helping a bit. I received this oil for free to test and give my honest opinion. I can&#x27;t afford to keep taking her to the dermatologist so hopefully this will help. I will update my review if there is a huge turn around.</li>
    <li> this is a great value the quality of this tea tree oil is quite impressive I would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Works well.  Good price.  Recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Very intense smell! I only use one drop in my lotion at night because my hubby says I smell like a pine tree! But, I love it! Also, if your sensitive to smell then you will probably not like this stuff, very piney smell.</li>
    <li> Have been wanting to try tea tree for my dandruff. Have only used it twice and already noticed a huge difference! It even made my hair feel so much softer! Worked better then what I had expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my scalp for scaly dandruff type stuff I have been dealing with for a few years now. While it did take a couple of weeks to see improvement, I will say that it has helped tremendously and I feel confident that if I stick to my treatment plan (3X Weekly) I will totally eliminate the issue within the month.</li>
    <li> Smells great. High quality grade oil. Much bigger bottle than most and more than I expected. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> love my oils this one is great now that school is back in because it helps keep lice away</li>
    <li> helps with my skin. i have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> wonderful product, helps with so many types of skin problems</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but VERY strong...as it should be.</li>
    <li> Was sent to review!!! Nice size bottle, but the dropper came broken. Other than that great product</li>
    <li> Great smelling oil and Just as described and also come with a glass dropper.  😁</li>
    <li> I received my Tea Tree Oil today. Was notified when it would ship and also when it would arrive..No problem..It does have a strong odor but most Tea Tree oils have their own smell to it. I really enjoy the glass dropper that was also included. Much easier to leave in the bottle when you need to use it instead  of having to unscrew the cap.  I put just a little in my rinse water for my hair and it seems to really help...Thank You...</li>
    <li> I got Tea Tree essential for making soap. It is called Cold Soap. and the pure oil is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil also used for my body.&lt;br /&gt;Dropped a little bit of this oil during shower, I feel like I am in the forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil is much better than any perfume. And I also use having a rest on my couch.</li>
    <li> It helps us with so many difffrent things with the skin. ordering more!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and work rather well in a diffuser. But when i recieved it the glass dropper was shattered in the box and was not usable and im really not happy about that it should be packaged better and not in a plastic bad in a box with the big bottle! Other than that it really is an amazing product. It also works well in shampoo. Would recommened</li>
    <li> I have used this product for exactly a week on my scalp and I no longer have dandruff.  Love this oil!!!</li>
    <li> For a sample deal price I was able to test this awesome pure tea tree oil.  I use this tea tree oil from making my own deodorant, healing wounds, added to my shampoo and laundry detergent.  This is a huge bottle and even  at retail price it&#x27;s a  great bargain.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying tea tree oil. I love the Earthy smell. This is a large bottle that will last quite awhile. I used it on my face blemishes, in my laundry, and in my nail polish so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Used it almost every night in my shampoo and conditioner! Makes your scalp feel so clean that it feels cool. Definitely a product I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair by adding few drops to my&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and conditioner, since I was loosing so much hair after my thyroid removal.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the scent is very strong, it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;bother me anymore, as long as is efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; ve  heard it works very well on nail fungus, and&lt;br /&gt;on athlet&#x27; foot, if someone needs.</li>
    <li> nice product  , strong smell but works</li>
    <li> Great product. The best tea tree oil ever.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil, for anyone that does not know, is one of those oils that has many more uses that people just don&#x27;t know about. I recently had gotten an industrial piercing in my ear, and had read that TTO was great for drying it out and promoting healing of the &amp;#34;wound.&amp;#34; My piercing had gotten a little bit irritated so I had hoped that it would help, and it did! You can apply it a few times a day to any specified area that you choose, but be careful because it really will get the job done, too much TTO will cause irritation. This specific bottle states that you can use it for nail fungus, beauty, for hair/scalp issues like dandruff. I have not tried it for those things, but I would definitely recommend this TTO for those purposes! I&#x27;m sure you can find many more uses for it as well. Just be advised, the smell is strong, but it is always going to be strong for a TTO that is therapeutic grade, and not watered down. Also a plus, it comes with a dropper, so no worries on it spilling when you add to shampoo or apply to your nails etc.</li>
    <li> Purchased it to try as a lice deterrent.</li>
    <li> I just received my tea tree oil today, and so far I am very happy with it. The smell is nice and strong, which I love. I have already added some to my conditioner! It also was a lot more than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for years. I was excited about this product cuz it was such a great deal with good reviews. It works well but leaves an undesirable smell after use that doesn&#x27;t smell like tea tree. :(&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed because it got so many great reviews. The smell bothers me so much that I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; works well! Nice packaging &amp; quality dropper included.</li>
