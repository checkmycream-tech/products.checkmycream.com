### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfect...</li>
      <li>Braun makes the BEST shavers, period.  </li>
      <li>Series 190 was about as close to a perfect shaver that was ever made.</li>
      <li>still the best shaving electric razor.</li>
      <li>very good products</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s cleaned and oiled, run the razor for about 20-30 seconds to spread lubricant - then you&#x27;re good for another 2 or 3 shaves!</li>
      <li>Good luck figuring out the warranty BS!</li>
      <li>I would say that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money!</li>
      <li>They are good razors and the best for value.  </li>
      <li>They both work great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Gives a great shave</li>
      <li>Just arrived, works great.</li>
      <li>works great</li>
      <li>Shaver works great and as shown in the literature on-line.</li>
      <li>When I saw the price on this shaver I thought I was getting a great bargain.</li>
      <li>The Series 150 shaver is remarkably inferior to the Series 190.</li>
      <li>This was a replacement purchase as I&#x27;ve used this Braun model for a decade or more and find it to be the best value for money product in its field.</li>
      <li>I have owned an excellent Braun Series 2000 for many years which still runs but can no longer purchase replacement shaver foils that won&#x27;t pull hairs while shaving.</li>
      <li>; had Braun Shaver before which lasted a long time; the styling and design are impressive and feel good in your hand; performance is flawless..  totally happy!</li>
      <li>good shave.</li>
      <li>All in all a good replacement, even if the idea of buying instead of repairing goes against the grain.</li>
      <li>but I buy what I can afford and for the price its definitely a good buy.</li>
      <li>It gives you a good shave.</li>
      <li>It comes with a protective plastic cover for the surface that rubs against skin (which is good because I keep the shaver in my car for touch ups in evenings for that &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; when I am going somewhere after work).</li>
      <li>Good close shave and portable.</li>
      <li>BUT DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
      <li>Good value for the cost.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive, and with good reason.  </li>
      <li>Just bought this razor - good price &amp; value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shaver has a good battery life, gives me a close shave, and doesn&#x27;t leave me with razer burn.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve already dropped mine, scratched but still works good).</li>
      <li>Bottom line, though, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job shaving my beard.</li>
      <li>good razor.  </li>
      <li>This works great and very comfortably fits my hand.</li>
      <li>and My husband gets his own.</li>
      <li>This is a replacement for an older shaver which had seen its best days.&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver works wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Like a cheap television, it works, but it doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what more to expect out of an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Works great, easy to clean, and built with quality that you hope to get from Braun.</li>
      <li>and this has been a nice easy close shave.</li>
      <li>Electric razors don&#x27;t make my shave better,  </li>
      <li>It fact, it cut more hair from the place I d already shaved with the Braun:-</li>
      <li>I hope I could change a better one even pay some more.</li>
      <li>I think Braun could do a better job on it.</li>
      <li>And the battery is so much better at holding a charge for many shaves.</li>
      <li>For the price I doubt if I could have done better.</li>
      <li>I had Braun shavers for many years.</li>
      <li>You know better.</li>
      <li>I would say save up your money and buy a better Braun.</li>
      <li>We are glad we got it.</li>
      <li>I have used braun razors for 30 years or more.  </li>
      <li>I have had a Braun Shaver for many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun electric razors for more than 20 years and they&#x27;ve always been high-quality products.</li>
      <li>Superb product for a low price.</li>
      <li>Hopefully this one will also give many years of use.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, for the grown men out there, save your money on this one and go for something more substantial with a stronger motor and better foil.</li>
      <li>sure</li>
      <li>In fact, it is better then what I had found in the stores.</li>
      <li>Better to buy a couple bags of disposable razors than the Braun Series 1 150s-1.</li>
      <li>My husband was looking for a razor that was not over the top...</li>
      <li>Nice clean shave with no stubble or razor burn.</li>
      <li>was my original intention!</li>
      <li>Every other Braun Razor that I&#x27;ve owned has been excellent, often shaving as well as a safety razor and sometimes even better.</li>
      <li>very good for the low cost.  </li>
      <li>Thus, the metal cover over the heads tends to damage easily.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;power\\&quot; light than a charging light).</li>
      <li>It has a better designed foil that helps give a cleaner shave and easier to clean.</li>
      <li>This one lacks build quality - the foil comes off easily (flimsy plastic clutches/locking system).</li>
      <li>so I strongly recommend you look elsewhere for your needs.</li>
      <li>Not as effective as higher end models.</li>
      <li>The design looks fine.  </li>
      <li>The long hair trimmer is especially easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so it is compact and light.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, clean and charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it last 2 years, I&#x27;ll be happy (and it looks and runs</li>
      <li>It was a cheap move I think.  </li>
      <li>It is cheaply made and Braun should be ashamed to have its name on it.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, the shaver vibrates noisily in your hand and has a cheap plastic feel to it, which i suppose is understandable at this price</li>
      <li>enjoy the feature that it can be rinsed with water.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>He said it is comfortable when you use it.</li>
      <li>Husband had a stroke and this razor is iight weight, easy to hold in his hand by it&#x27;s design while giving a clean shave.</li>
      <li>If your looking for a cheap electric shaver that is reliable then pick this one up.</li>
      <li>- don&#x27;t wait for the light (LED) to go out when fully charged,</li>
      <li>This one fit the bill...</li>
      <li>This shaver is very comfortable and provides a reasonable, quick shave for a weekday, but it needs more cleaning than a quick rinse to maintain performance.</li>
      <li>Braun along with the rest of the world keeps trying to force the more is better idea and offering 2 and 3 heads that actually don&#x27;t shave you any closer but do become more cumbersome.</li>
      <li>It was originally boght to replace a model 1</li>
      <li>Braun no longer provide original foils for this shaver.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money, buy it!</li>
      <li>He uses it at night time when we are going out or during the day at work if he needs to look clean shaven.</li>
      <li>I wear a well trimmed beard as opposed to clean shaven</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really clean that well under running water as recommended.</li>
      <li>I had an earlier version of the same model for many years and found it very handy, effective and economical.  </li>
      <li>The only GOOD thing, is when it is in full charge, it DOES cut close, and feel smooth.</li>
      <li>Supplied cleaning brush could be more substantial, but works with a little more effort (supplied power cord is nice).</li>
      <li>This shaver could be better, but can&#x27;t complain to much.</li>
      <li>just a basic good razor...</li>
      <li>I REALLY wanted to love this razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a replacement for an older shaver which had seen its best days.&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver works wonderful.  The Braun give me a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the feature that it can be rinsed with water.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is above my expectations.</li>
    <li> Just arrived, works great. Had previous model--liked it fine. New model, contrary to several reviews, is just as good if not better. The screen on the newer model is an improvement. I bought a new shaver because the purchase price was only a few dollars higher than the price of a replacement screen and blade. Worth buying a new unit every two years if necessary--cheap enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun electric razors for more than 20 years and they&#x27;ve always been high-quality products. So I was really surprised when the first 1-150S showed up and right out of the box it didn&#x27;t work at all, even when plugged in to the mains socket. So much for Braun&#x27;s quality control. So I sent it back to Amazon, using their excellent returns system, and received a replacement within a few days. The replacement worked so long as it was plugged into the mains socket but the battery would not charge. Not even to provide a few seconds of independent operation. So it went back as well. Zero out of two is a strong indication that all is not well with the manufacturing and quality assurance processes for this particular razor so I strongly recommend you look elsewhere for your needs. After two duds in a row I gave up and decided to buy a different razor altogether.</li>
    <li> The razor works but does not live up to the Braun name. Every other Braun Razor that I&#x27;ve owned has been excellent, often shaving as well as a safety razor and sometimes even better. The Braun 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver doesn&#x27;t even come close to that quality.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd attempt to use this razor. Finally had to purchase a 3 series for more $because this one is such crap. Spend the extra money to get something nicer. Super Bummed</li>
    <li> Have used Braun shavers before. This one lacks build quality - the foil comes off easily (flimsy plastic clutches/locking system). Users need to be careful as it can injure/cut if it happens in the middle of shaving. Unfortunately i used it twice and its unfair to return + i threw away the packing.&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious as you can nick/cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Purchase as a Christmas gift last year, and it gets used every day.  Works great, easy to clean, and built with quality that you hope to get from Braun.</li>
    <li> Purchased 11 months ago, have used it heavily for about 7 months. Do not dispute negative findings of other reviewer, as I have owned many Braun shavers with varying issues, but I have had good luck with this one. As with rotary design electrics, replacement parts are not inexpensive. In general,foil lifetime and wear durability can be unpredictable, this unit nothing special, but is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun Shaver for many years. Every 2 years or so, I need a new shaving head as the the cover wears out. Braun recommends replacing it every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the replacement cost is close to the price of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;So for a few dollars more I buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to buy three slightly used Braun shavers?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for his first shaver. He likes it and it works well for him. We are glad we got it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver together with a foil and cutter replacement pack. The web site shows these two items as \\&quot;frequently bought together\\&quot;, so this is what I ordered. But beware: the cutter replacement pack is of the 10B type, which does not fit on the shaver: instead the 11B type is needed!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst electric razor I have ever had.  It is cheaply made and Braun should be ashamed to have its name on it.  I can shave with it for fifteen minutes, and I leave the house with stubble and irritated skin.  I would rate the electric razors I have picked up at the drug store when traveling higher than this one, and they only cost ten dollars.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor.</li>
    <li> Owned this product exactly 60 days before the on/off power switch stopped working.  KAPUT!  Too late for a return to Amazon.  I have thrown away box, so I&#x27;m out of luck.  Had expected better from Braun and will avoid their products in the future.</li>
    <li> I think the razor could use some improvement. The head comes apart sometime when shaving, also the cord come unplugged while shaving. I think Braun could do a better job on it.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who has to use a man&#x27;s razor on my legs, and the whole head of this razor keeps coming off while shaving.  Also, I can&#x27;t use the cord with it, only with the charge, and it doesn&#x27;t keep enough charge to shave both my legs.  Also, I don&#x27;t need the sideburn cutter, but it keeps interfering with the shaving.  It won&#x27;t lock into place.  The only GOOD thing, is when it is in full charge, it DOES cut close, and feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Not really much to say about it. It has the clipper and the main shaver. They both work great. To get a close shave, using shaving cream and even water works well. comes with a standard wall charger and a brush and some cleaner, as well as a cover. Well worth the money, buy it!</li>
    <li> I had two previous Braun razors (don&#x27;t remember the model). When my last one was ready to replace (I opted to do it when the blades/foil needed replacement), I bought this Braun model. The other two had an trimmer next to the blades. This would catch the longer whiskers that the foil didn&#x27;t get. I&#x27;m not talking about the extension trimmer for sideburns, etc. Occasionally you miss a few hairs when you&#x27;re shaving (or go a few days without shaving) and then pick them up the next day. But this model doesn&#x27;t have the longer hair trimmer- only the foil. If I miss a hair it stays missed. After a few days I notice I have quite a few longer hairs there begging to be cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering the [[ASIN:B004UQ6NP6 Braun 3Series 320S-4 Shaver]] and giving that a try. Looks like it has the trimmer gimmick for longer hairs. Claims to handle a 3 day growth.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave with no stubble or razor burn. Good value for the cost. It charges quickly and is compact enough to throw in an overnight bag without taking up much room.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older version of the same Braun Series 1 which is several years old and getting tired.  The new shaver is disappointing.  The design looks fine.  The handle is a little more comfortable.  But the motor is weak.  Even new and and fully charged overnight, it&#x27;s noticeably weaker than my old one. I don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard, but this thing was stalling on me.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Shaver works great and as shown in the literature on-line. The manual describes operation and maintenance and cleaning very well.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement purchase as I&#x27;ve used this Braun model for a decade or more and find it to be the best value for money product in its field.</li>
    <li> Based on the low cost I was somewhat concerned when ordering this shaver, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it works. It&#x27;s easy to clean and make very little noise. I find it comfortable to hold and never feel a pinch or burn as I did on the rotatory head shaver that I recently returned. I would say that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money!</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for a razor that was not over the top...just a basic good razor...This one fit the bill...Works perfect...just what he wanted...</li>
    <li> This works great and very comfortably fits my hand. It does well at cutting my beard in short order. It comes with a protective plastic cover for the surface that rubs against skin (which is good because I keep the shaver in my car for touch ups in evenings for that &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; when I am going somewhere after work). Thus, the metal cover over the heads tends to damage easily. Learned that lesson the hard way with my first one.</li>
    <li> Good close shave and portable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. In fact, it is better then what I had found in the stores. The reason is in the foil. It has a better designed foil that helps give a cleaner shave and easier to clean. I also feel it will last longer due to the design of the foil is stronger as well. I has used this same model or one like it for over ten years. I had bought them at Target of Walmart. But they discontinued this model. To my surprise, Amazon had it! I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for the car and one for home.  While the basic shaver is built like a lcoomotive, the  screen is easily damaged and the blade must be replaced often  Alas, such is the case with Electric Razors...</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother for Christmas and he said it didn&#x27;t get a really close shave under his jaw area.</li>
    <li> Tedious, long shaving process.  Misses longer whiskers altogether.  Must repeat shaving until all missed whiskers are cut.  Going back to blades.</li>
    <li> good shave. have owned several braun shavers. bought 1 for my dad and also for my brother in law as gifts</li>
    <li> I use it for ear lobe hair ...works great...holds a charge for a long time and it is very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun 1-150 for several years and liked it so well that I bought an exact replacement after the foil on it wore out.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several brands of electric razors over the years and I find this one is easy to use, does a very good job, and is one of the least expensive.  I would buy the Braun 1-150 again.</li>
    <li> If I new this shaver would last less than 3 months I never would have bought it.  Good luck figuring out the warranty BS!</li>
    <li> Shaver does not perform well in spite the numerous passes over the same area. I only wish it could be as good as it looks. I have owned an excellent Braun Series 2000 for many years which still runs but can no longer purchase replacement shaver foils that won&#x27;t pull hairs while shaving. Braun no longer provide original foils for this shaver.</li>
    <li> We always buy the cheapest Braun and we use it for shaving, cutting hair, dog grooming.  Superb product for a low price.</li>
    <li> Did not know when I purchased this item that it was a rechargeable shaver only.  I used it for the first time July 19th. To my amazement when I plugged it in it did not work.  I found out by calling Braun customer service that it had to be charged up before I could use it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always had better luck with Braun shavers than any other brand.  They handle well, and they last at least several years.</li>
    <li> i have always had braun and i went astray from it but i came back to try this and this has been a nice easy close shave. it has the power of more expensive models. the twin heads gives you a close shave w/o  irritation and i have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;would recoommend highly..one little oddity , when you are holding the shaver to shave the thumb has tendency to turn off the shaver but that would stop me from getting another if i had to.</li>
    <li> I have tried different brands of razors and Braun seems to be the brand for me. The razor that I had before purchasing this one is a Braun and I have had it for about 8 years. This one seems to be working really good too and if it last as long as my old one then I have bought another good razor. I know there are more expensive razors but I buy what I can afford and for the price its definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> For the price I doubt if I could have done better. It gives me a good shave-as good as the more expensive Norelco-which it replaced. They reccomend replacing heads etc after eighteen months but I think it would be just as efficient to just replace the shaver. The only complaint I have is that it gives you no warning when the battery has run down-just quits-sometimes when I don&#x27;t have the 8 hours required for rechar&lt;br /&gt;ing.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old, worn out cheap braun shaver, which wasn&#x27;t too bad of a shaver. . It is a very poor razor.It leaves hairs uncut so I have to go over them every few days with the sideburn trimmer to cut them. The batteries don&#x27;t last very long before needing charging and if they die while shaving you can&#x27;t finish the shave by plugging in the cord. It will only run after recharging so you better have a backup available to finish the shave.</li>
    <li> I stopped using electric razors.  Electric razors don&#x27;t make my shave better,  I have very tough large diameter whiskers</li>
    <li> I had the previous generation of this razor ad the motor in that model seemed considerably more powerful than this one. This shaver struggles with even a day&#x27;s growth, and leaves a lot of random hairs behind after many passes. It also is not durable, and mine broke in less than a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is just now starting to shave. It takes him forever to shave with it and it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. He&#x27;s pretty fed up with this shaver and is about ready to trash it and by a better shaver. I would say save up your money and buy a better Braun. I have nothing against Braun as that&#x27;s all I ever use but this particular model is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 15, so I don&#x27;t really need some $200 electric shaver when I only need to shave about once or twice a week anyway. I&#x27;ve gone through two [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310]] shavers because for some reason my dog finds them rather tasty. So, I bought this product at a large drug store chain for about $50. It&#x27;s shoddily made, it&#x27;s loud, and it irritates the skin. Like a cheap television, it works, but it doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job. As bad as this product is, I&#x27;ve realized that I prefer a foil shaver to a rotary shaver. Still, if Braun didn&#x27;t have a 60-day money back guarantee, I&#x27;d probably remove the razor and give the plastic to my dog to gnaw on.</li>
    <li> I like a foil shaver, it&#x27;s a close shave and doesn&#x27;t chew my face up like a rotary shaver does. This shaver has a good battery life, gives me a close shave, and doesn&#x27;t leave me with razer burn.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th Braun 150 razor I have owned. I&#x27;ve replaced them about every two years, always looking forward to the crisp shave that each new razor has provided. This razor looks the same as the previous four, but the shave quality is horrendous. I tried using it for a few days in a row, and not only would I have to run it over and over the same spot, it simply wouldn&#x27;t cut certain stubble, causing single hairs to grow out over the three day period. I finally pulled the two year old model out of the drawer, and not only did it shave much better and much quicker, but it shaved the hairs that had been left by the new model for three days running.&lt;br /&gt;Either the model being sold by Amazon is a fake, or Braun has allowed the Chinese manufacturer to cheapen this razor out to the point that it is worthless for shaving. Couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed unless it had simply shredded my face.</li>
    <li> The Braun 1 Series 150 replaced the no longer made Braun Series 190. The Series 150 shaver is remarkably inferior to the Series 190. The Series 150 has a narrower and slipperier body that is harder to grip than the Series 190. The trimmer and head cover are both flimsier in the Series 150 than in Series 190. The closeness of the shaves are comparable between the 150 and the 190.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 190 was about as close to a perfect shaver that was ever made. It was a perfect fit for the average American hand, a precise trimmer and a close shave. It is hard to understand why Braun would replace the Series 190 with a notably inferior Series 150 whose sole advantage appears to be that you may immerse the head in running water.</li>
    <li> Be forewarned and do not buy this shaver if you have facial hair growth beyond that of a 13-year old boy. It might suffice as a backup travel shaver, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has a very low-powered motor and will struggle to mow through anything beyond a day&#x27;s or less worth of adult man-whiskers. Additionally, the shaver vibrates noisily in your hand and has a cheap plastic feel to it, which i suppose is understandable at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the grown men out there, save your money on this one and go for something more substantial with a stronger motor and better foil. You will thank me, and your wallet and face will thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the third or fourth time I have bought a Braun 1 Series 150 electric razor.  So, obviously, I am satisfied with the quality and endurance of this particular electric razor.  The blade/cutting mechanism lasts almost 2 years before getting dull.  A new razor costs about the same as a replacement blade/cutting mechanism.  Which is, of course, insane.  However, I continue buying a new one every couple of years and likely will continue to do so in the future.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as higher end models. There is a reason this is the lowest price Braun. Better as a stand by than a daily shaver.</li>
    <li> bought this because we lost the charger to or other one(it was a better value just to get the whole shaver) but at least this way I get my own and My husband gets his own.</li>
    <li> It was originally boght to replace a model 1 but did&#x27;nt hold a charge so it was worthless to travel with which was my original intention! [ p.s. the model 1 still works well after 4 years</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this razor. It has a blade cover that also covers the power switch, so it can&#x27;t be turned on accidentally in your baggage. VERY clever! Bottom line, though, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job shaving my beard. Final draw was a few days ago when the battery died in the middle of a shave.I finished up with a cheap AA cell razor that was 2 years old. The old tired razor did a better job than the brand new Braun. It fact, it cut more hair from the place I d already shaved with the Braun:-(</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, and he loves it. Its a quick fix for a hurry up shave, when he doesn&#x27;t want to take time to use the blade.</li>
    <li> PROS: High Efficiency Shaver&lt;br /&gt;CONS: NONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACTS AND FEATURES: I had to replace my other electric shaver;it was also a Braun. I had it almost 20 years. You had to keep it plugged in to use it,and did not have any of the features this one has.&lt;br /&gt;Braun 1 Series-1 Cordless Shaver is so different in it&#x27;s capacity of &amp;#34;POWER&amp;#34; You charge it for an 8 hour period of time, today I am using it for the 4th time before I recharge it. It comes with a brush to clean the blade(s), but I use an old toothbrush to clean mine.This shaver also comes with a small bottle of lubricant. Very little of this lubricant is needed for the blade before each and every use.This shaver actually has two(2) shaving blades, one on the back that you push forward to cut longer hair, then pull it back and it engages the stubble blade.&amp;#34;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GREAT SHAVER, WHETHER IT BE YOUR 1ST OR A REPLACEMENT&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARISON TO OTHER SHAVERS: I used a Norrelco Shaver before and this Braun knocks Norrelco &amp;#34;OUT OF THE WATERS&amp;#34;, so to speak.</li>
    <li> I have had a single head Braun for eight years or so--changed the head once and the screen twice.  It was good--ample to handle my beard, the battery was long lasting.  Alas, the trimmer fell off (little plastic piece broke from age I guess), so I decided it was time to replace it.  I looked at all the double and triple head monsters available, but came back to this single head model.  I use it for travel--so it is compact and light.  Thus far it gives a good shave--maybe closer than the previous one, but the screen seems thinner--so may damage more easily.  The battery is fine--8 shaves so far on the initial charge.  It does not have any bells or whistles, but for the price ($29) it is a capable machine.  At least so far.</li>
    <li> They should put two batteries in it for longer usage before charging. It doesn&#x27;t seem anyi better at cutting than my older one</li>
    <li> Husband had a stroke and this razor is iight weight, easy to hold in his hand by it&#x27;s design while giving a clean shave.</li>
    <li> fast and easy to use, for the money you spend. I would advised anyone to purchase this item, if your on the go.It gives you a good shave.</li>
    <li> Braun makes the BEST shavers, period.  Nobody comes close.  Maybe Norelco if you like rotary shavers.  This Series of Braun&#x27;s lets you trim a mustache with ease, only this type of Brauns, period.</li>
    <li> SHAVER RUNS VERY SLOW BUT DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
    <li> This shaver is very comfortable and provides a reasonable, quick shave for a weekday, but it needs more cleaning than a quick rinse to maintain performance.</li>
    <li> Been using this shaver for years now. Doesn&#x27;t last forever but works really well. I highly recommend it. Gives a great shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Braun electric razors and have always been satisfied. However, this Series 1 fails at it&#x27;s primary job and that is to give a good shave. It is simply a failed design.</li>
    <li> good razor.  very good for the low cost.  much cheaper than walmart. i ii i i i i i i</li>
    <li> When I saw the price on this shaver I thought I was getting a great bargain. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> very good products; had Braun Shaver before which lasted a long time; the styling and design are impressive and feel good in your hand; performance is flawless..  totally happy!</li>
    <li> I have used braun razors for 30 years or more.  They are good razors and the best for value.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun Series 1 shavers for about 10 years now.  This is the third that I have purchased in that time.  I have a fairly thick beard, but these simple designs have always been able to cut through it and leave my sensitive skin unblemished.  Since I&#x27;ve had such a good run, I was hesitant to upgrade to the new model, but, so far, it shaves both more quickly and closely than my old model.  Additionally, the trimmer slides back farther and stays out of my way better than on the old Series 1.  There are also now both on and off switches, rather than one on/off switch; hopefully, this will extend the lifetime of the device since it was this switch that stopped working on my old model.  I like to stick with what works, and this line of shavers simply work.  I&#x27;m guessing that some of the other, negative reviews probably came from some inexperienced shavers who don&#x27;t understand how to shave their own faces (first with the grain, then back against it).  I honestly don&#x27;t know what more to expect out of an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted</li>
    <li> This replaces a 150 model that has lasted for about 8 years and still works. I needed to replace the grill and cutter which was about as expensive as replacing the whole unit so I bought the whole unit. I have a pretty light beard and this works well for me. No skin irritation. The trimmer works well also. Very durable except the grill on this one seems kinda flimsy. Overall satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> It is only good for a second time shaving on the same day after shaving with a much more expensive electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver not a big electric shaver fan, but gets the job done. If your looking for a cheap electric shaver that is reliable then pick this one up. This shaver could be better, but can&#x27;t complain to much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few razors.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on special automated cleaning systems.  Just take the head off and wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single foil is actually better then then double foil system for me because its more manuverable on my face.  I&#x27;ve gotten a very close shave with this.  I&#x27;ve had 4 differnt shavers in the past.  2 foil and one rotory.  This simple model does the job very well.  I don&#x27;t know anything about the longevity of the product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that when you plug it in and use it, it still only uses the battery and doesn&#x27;t take power from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t see how a more expensive model is worth it.  You can only get so close with an electric razor anyway.  Unless they come out with a space age paper thin foil so the cutters can get closer, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> So good for the price that I just ordered a second one and awaiting delivery. Current one is 15 months old and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Replacing a ~7 year old similiar Braun which had cracked head screen.  Better balance, better shave too, nearly as close as razor and handles whiskers (neck) which grow out in different directions.</li>
    <li> It was the worst shaver I have ever used!  Bought it for a three week vacation trip; and just couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;shave as close as my mother shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  William F. Duggan</li>
    <li> garbage!&lt;br /&gt;Weak motor so it takes 30 minutes to get a not good shave, and breaks completely in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt; P&amp;G is the manufacturer and warranty is for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is they send you a new one that is no good., no cash refund.&lt;br /&gt;When Braun was the mfg. the quality was great.&lt;br /&gt;Shaved and lasted for years.&lt;br /&gt;I have another broken and one new replacement. A complete loss.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately P&amp;G wants cheap cost so they get what they pay China for it.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as my old Braun, which somehow died after a few years.  But the performance of this one has been decent and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This one has to be the worst I have ever used !&lt;br /&gt;Im sure that&#x27;s the reason you can buy a new one for the same or less than a BLADE replacement&lt;br /&gt;Battery wont last for a one morning use&lt;br /&gt;I charged my last razor ONCE A WEEK &amp; replacement blades are no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;I requested a replacement on this razor from AMAZON &amp; I noted an equal or better item as replacement is ok&lt;br /&gt;SAME ITEM UNACCEPTABLE ....&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it looks like they are going to SEND THE SAME THING AGAIN .....&lt;br /&gt;obviously nobody even read the details of my issue  ....</li>
    <li> I had used the Braun Series 1 for several years, and loved it. Decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to Series 3. It took me twice as long to get the same close shave as I did before. So I&#x27;m back to Series 1 - in fact, bought two of them in case Braun discontinues the model.</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this razor, but it just flat doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but I cant see that this razor does anything when I use it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.  Better to buy a couple bags of disposable razors than the Braun Series 1 150s-1.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my ten year-old Braun which needed a new foil, new cutter and new battery. This razor ended up costing a good bit less than the parts that needed replacing and is an improvement in several areas, namely the ability to wash the cutter and foil assembly and the new type of trim blade on the back side which picks up long hairs without pulling or nicking. All in all a good replacement, even if the idea of buying instead of repairing goes against the grain.</li>
    <li> I had Braun shavers for many years. But this one really disappointed me. The products they made getting worse. Unbelievable! I hope I could change a better one even pay some more.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a long time, but the battery died out quickly. I got a Panasonic and so far it lasts much longer</li>
    <li> even this machine is brand new has a lot of vibrations and does not shave as I expected.This issue frustrated me.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Braun with the same model number, but this unit has a MUCH harder time with my beard.</li>
    <li> I usually shave with razors and use an electric only supplementary, so I chose this least expensive Braun. It does the job for me, but one disappointing thing is it does not run corded, so if you let the battery run out, you have to wait at least several hours before you can shave again. My previous Braun ran both cordless and corded, even though I believe it was a little more expensive model. Also the charging cable makes high frequency noise when plugged in. If it is left in a separate room you won&#x27;t notice, but it is still a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you pay is what you get, it does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive models, and it does feel plasticky and a little cheap. $30 I paid feels about right, it is definitely not $50-stuff as MSRP suggests, or at which it is actually sold at my local stores.</li>
    <li> This shaver is similar to the previous one I purchased five years ago.  It is simple to use and works very well.  The long hair trimmer is especially easy to use.  My only complaint is that the battery discharges even if I use the cord when I shave.  That did not happen with my previous Braun shaver.  Not a major inconvenience.  I just have to remember to charge it every 5-6 days.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for me the husband, and I really like it. Light weight, fast cutting, good price. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I usually shave using a regular, not electric, razor.  I bought this when the Braun 549 that i bought for Saturday and touch up use wore out.  Sadly with limited use it did not last.  Although these Brauns typically have a shorter battery life as time goes on, this one just died completely one day.  It is set up so that you can&#x27;t open it to see the battery.  I have had many Brauns lately and they don&#x27;t seem to hold up too well.  I decided to go for a Panasonic this time.</li>
    <li> I did not like the color.  The foil kept on commiing of the razor while I was shaving.  I have since returned for a full refund.</li>
    <li> Just bought this razor - good price &amp; value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life much better than expected. Doesn&#x27;t really clean that well under running water as recommended. Still have to brush cutter and cap assembly (cutter gets caked regardless - even just after one shave, running water just helps to possibly \\&quot;cake\\&quot; even more) but anyone who&#x27;s used an electric should be accustom to that routine. I would rather use forceful running water on the foil head assembly itself... after it&#x27;s off, then clean the cutter assembly using the supplied brush after about every second or third shave (that&#x27;s also a good time to fully charge it) and oil very lightly the inside of the foil carefully, and not to much (apply just a very small drop/dot on your fingertip, then evenly rub it onto the inside surface of the foil CAREFULLY). When it&#x27;s cleaned and oiled, run the razor for about 20-30 seconds to spread lubricant - then you&#x27;re good for another 2 or 3 shaves! I can go at least three (3) full 15 minute shaves without a new charge. Razor is very lightweight and a little slippery to hold, so keep your grip good (I&#x27;ve already dropped mine, scratched but still works good). Sideburn trimmer seams to work well. Charges when plugged-in with cord but razor \\&quot;LED\\&quot; lamp stays on even when fully charged... so you&#x27;ll have to make sure it&#x27;s been charged long enough according to the manual - don&#x27;t wait for the light (LED) to go out when fully charged, because it doesn&#x27;t, the LED stays on as long as it&#x27;s plugged-in using the supplied cord (it&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;power\\&quot; light than a charging light). Smartfoil is very thin and appears a little cheap but seems to work okay. Be careful not to damage the foil due to it&#x27;s thinness (I would recommend avoiding it as much as possible). Supplied cleaning brush could be more substantial, but works with a little more effort (supplied power cord is nice). So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase. If it last 2 years, I&#x27;ll be happy (and it looks and runs/works like it probably will). When you can get a Braun that&#x27;s at least decent, for $30 bucks with no tax or shipping - you have to go for it, even if it is China and not Germany!  3-1/2 Stars (and I&#x27;m tough to please!).</li>
    <li> I  was going to just replace the cutter head on my old Braun,but the price of the new one was only $5.00 more than the new one. the new one works about the same as the old one.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver as a gift to replace my 8 year old Braun shaver when it&#x27;s trimmer finally died (worked great with periodic replacements of the foil head).  Inexpensive, and with good reason.  Not nearly as good as my 8 year old model.  Sending it back immediately.  I can only hope the other Braun shavers are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only recommended for teens with peach fuzz.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Braun over other makers for their overall quality and efficiency.  They just plain shave closer. I was so glad to find this model as it has been getting harder and harder to find a single head configuration. Braun along with the rest of the world keeps trying to force the more is better idea and offering 2 and 3 heads that actually don&#x27;t shave you any closer but do become more cumbersome. I wear a well trimmed beard as opposed to clean shaven and I have to have the single head because it is more nimble at styling. So while this newer, sexier style of single head from Braun  is a little less effective than my old deceased one, it is still the best for my needs. And the battery is so much better at holding a charge for many shaves. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because like so many companies they have taken to cutting back on the extra little things that come together for a great buying experience. What I am referring to is Bruan shavers always came with a zippered case for traveling and a brush for cleaning the cutting block properly(rinsing  it under the faucet is NOT the same). It was very disappointing to open an over sized box only to find just the razor for this price. Shame on you Braun. You know better. Thank goodness I saved my old brushes and a travel case. It was a cheap move I think.  But again....still the best shaving electric razor.</li>
    <li> I gave this razer to my husband for his birthday. He wanted to try it when he saw it in a flyer. He said it is comfortable when you use it. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. He uses it at night time when we are going out or during the day at work if he needs to look clean shaven. He told me he would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Compared with other brand and models this is fast and easy to maintain We will wait to see how oftenthe cutter and foil need replacment</li>
    <li> Easy to use, clean and charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price. But the replacement parts are almost as much as the shaver.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of the same model for many years and found it very handy, effective and economical.  Finally the pop-up trimmer portion died, though I have no complaints about its longevity.  The new one is lighter and has a new hole pattern to the foil that seems even more effective at capturing whiskers so that they can be mowed off.  Hopefully this one will also give many years of use.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, but not as fine as the previous models it replaced.  Fortunately, my old one also works.</li>
