      <li>This is the most fantastic product !</li>

      <li>Very rich cream, soothing to winter skin.</li>
      <li>it is important to care for it with love.</li>
      <li>I love how light it is</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, the ingredients are all healthy and good for you (no petrochemicals!), the company stands behind their product 100%.</li>
      <li>This is combined with smooth moisturizing creams that apply easily with no hint of that stickiness.  </li>
      <li>Smells pleasant, natural, not perfumed at all.  </li>
      <li>By the third Email I realized these were not just automatizing sent to me, but a manager named Philip asking me if I was happy with their product.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, and I will consider purchasing it again</li>

      <li>And it has a nice light natural scent.</li>
      <li>So far I am really pleased though!</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice non greasy soft feel on my face.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this it stopped the itch and my skin is healing very quickly.  </li>
      <li>but this is the first time I have found one that actually works for me without any kind of allergic reaction!  </li>
      <li>absorbs quickly and no grease or oily feel.</li>
      <li>It is non greasy and has no unpleasant odor.  </li>
      <li>It is very rich, all natural and very effective on my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m going to be able to use this cream, and I would recommend it to others with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>100% complete turn around! : )</li>
      <li>I like how it soaks in fast and feels smooth.</li>
      <li>what is amazing about this product is how it reduce the appearance of age or sun spot on the back of my hands.</li>
      <li>I really love that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>This cream smells good and sinks right in.  </li>
      <li>So I explained the situation and Philip offered to send another jar out to me right away.</li>
      <li>As well I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone increased as well and it looks better in general.</li>
      <li>It helped to sooth it and the blister went away very fast.</li>
      <li>2yr old son has a huge case of eczema (or what he has been diagnosed with)</li>
      <li>This cream is not oily, I am starting to love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using one week--long enough, in most cases, for irritation to take over.  </li>
      <li>Today marked a week and everything is so smooth.</li>
      <li>At first I was putting it on 3x a day.</li>
      <li>When I first order this, they send me a defected one.</li>
      <li>In just a week, I&#x27;ve seen the rosacea go from bright red in patches on my face to light pink.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I already see a difference in their skin. It is more moisturizied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of facial products &amp; this is the one. It feels so nice on my skin &amp; I don&#x27;t get any bad reactions after using it. It&#x27;s simply wonderful. I love it! It&#x27;s kinda pricey though, but it&#x27;s gonna last me a while, so it&#x27;s not too bad. I got 2 day shipping so it came the next day! I love this cream! If you put it in the fridge for a few hours, it feels even more soothing to the skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rare for me to give anything 5 stars but this is the best thing that has ever touched my face (after my wife of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annnnnd its cruelty free!!!</li>
    <li> excellent product thank you much fast delivery also</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly and no grease or oily feel. what is amazing about this product is how it reduce the appearance of age or sun spot on the back of my hands. I rub just a little on the back of my hand daily. The reason I gave a 4 star is my skin still dries out a bit if I don&#x27;t but some more on in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff, and I wish I could give it 5 stars, 6 even. I&#x27;m currently working in one of the world&#x27;s harshest climates: northern Alaska. It&#x27;s an arctic dessert, and incredibly tough on the body, especially the skin. My skin is dry and gets itchy after I shower. I&#x27;ve tried a few different moisturizers, even when I&#x27;m in other - less stressful - environments, but none has ever worked as well as a moisturizer as this. My skin does not itch at all when I put this on after I shower, and it feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when my jar of manuka honey moisturizer arrived it had an awful smell to it. I added my own essential oil to it and the bad smell was undetectable. So I planned to just use it like that until it was gone and find another product. I had received a couple of emails from wild naturals before but just ignored them. By the third Email I realized these were not just automatizing sent to me, but a manager named Philip asking me if I was happy with their product. So I explained the situation and Philip offered to send another jar out to me right away. This time it did not smell quite so bad, but (at least to me) still not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, the ingredients are all healthy and good for you (no petrochemicals!), the company stands behind their product 100%. This stuff is not cheap and at least for me only lasts a few weeks (I don&#x27;t know how some people get months or of it), and some jars might smell better than others, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of it.</li>
    <li> When I first order this, they send me a defected one. But then when I contacted amzon.com, I got a refund. Plus the actual company also contacted me and send me a small version of this product as to apologize what had happened. So I can tell that this company is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for oily face. I apply this thing on and I do not have so much oil compare to other product such as cetaphil. However, you might find it smell. I don&#x27;t really like the smell personally.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many of these creams for embarrassing itchy dry skin over the years but this is the first time I have found one that actually works for me without any kind of allergic reaction!  Even though it may seem expensive; it is worth every penny. You don&#x27;t need to use of lot of it for instant relief without using any potentially harmful ingredients like most of the creams you would normally buy or have prescribed by your physician.&lt;br /&gt;I purposely waited a few days before writing this review and can say that I am absolutely and totally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts and this does not make me break out! It smooths my skin and makes it feel so soft! I ended up ordering a jar for my mom and she loves it too! I noticed after she used it for only about 4 days her skin looked smoother and fresher...I use this stuff from head to toe! Then the company sent me a 20% off coupon and I bought another jar! I know my first jar will last at least a couple months(maybe more, but since I use it everywhere it might not last as long for someone who is only using it for their face) but the price is still unbeatable compared to all the expensive brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past and a little goes a long way! I don&#x27;t want to be without it so at least I have my second back up jjar waiting for me! It&#x27;s truly amazing! I hope they send me another discount coupon!!!!!!:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not what I was expecting.  Like the one I have always used better so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Is not greasy and helps soothe my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream smells good and sinks right in.  My skin likes it and so do I!  I am glad I discovered it.</li>
    <li> I used this cream for a burn I got on my hand while using a curling wand. The wand gave me a small blister on my finger and a few on burns on the top of my hand. It helped to sooth it and the blister went away very fast.</li>
    <li> I only received this a few days ago, but already the redness of my skin has lessened considerably. The cream is also effective for the whole day, and I am not waking up during the middle of the night due to itchiness. The seller was very considerate is always letting me know the status of my order, and when to expect it. I would highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> I first tried this cream earlier this year when I product I had been using for years for my psoriasis stopped being made. I loved the description of the ingredients in the product and that it would support my skin to heal itself. I feel like this cream is food for my skin, it has soothed the psoriasis and the symptoms have decreased. Since our skin is our largest organ in our body it is important to care for it with love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different skin creams claiming to be mild for sensitive skin and even claiming to help calm rosacea.  I&#x27;ve paid for moisturizing creams that in most cases, irritated my skin and even provoked rosacea outbreaks.  This cream, so far anyway, seems to be what I&#x27;m looking for...it soothes.  I&#x27;ve been using one week--long enough, in most cases, for irritation to take over.  I think I&#x27;m going to be able to use this cream, and I would recommend it to others with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!! It leaves a nice non greasy soft feel on my face. Best part is its natural and not scented. I have very sensitivie skin so I am careful what i use. I will order again ..but its a good size tub of it so it should last a while!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the product. I does not stay greasy and keeps the skins nice and smooth. Perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a face cream.  I have sensitive skin and eyes. This cream does not irritate my eyes and does not cause breakouts.  It seems to heal.  It moisturizes very well but is not at all greasy and leaves a matte finish. I have ordered more and one for my daughter.  Have used it about 1 month.  Kind of expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Got this cream about a week ago. I really love that it is made from natural ingredients. The scent is so nice and you really only use a tiny bit to go a long way. I only gave it four stars because I just started using it so I don&#x27;t have much to say about the results yet but have every reason to believe it will help since I usually have reactions immediately if my skin doesn&#x27;t like it.  So far I am really pleased though! One of the biggest pluses is that the company is so attentive and the best I have ever worked with on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am just starting to use this cream so haven&#x27;t seen results in the first few days but the feel of the cream is great.  Hoping that it will clear my eczema soon!</li>
    <li> The cream is very great and I will buy it again. It&#x27;s non irritating and absorbs quickly which is something I wanted. The company is excellent, very efficient, product came in good condition.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Manuka honey is famous for its healing properties but is very hard to use directly, or in another formulation I have tried, as honey is very sticky.  This is combined with smooth moisturizing creams that apply easily with no hint of that stickiness.  My brief experience is very positive in that it turned an outbreak of dermatitis around very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a week now. I have eczema and acne, but also dry and oily spots on my face. Normally I apply it two times a day, but sometimes three. I have already noticed a reduction in swelling regarding my cystic acne and my dry skin is not flaking under my makeup. I live how quickly it absorbs into my skin too. I will keep using it because so far it us working for me. And it has a nice light natural scent.</li>
    <li> This cream arrived on time and it is better than I hoped for! It is very rich, all natural and very effective on my very dry skin. When I need lighter coverage, I spray my face with a little water and put the cream on top of it. This is my new face cream. I recommend this seller and this cream!</li>
    <li> This is the most fantastic product ! Throw out all other products and stop wasting your money ! This is the one !! I am 62 and my skin feels incredible  !!  Worth every penny !!!</li>
    <li> Its the same as resqorganics in my opinion, in the same jar too. Very rich cream, soothing to winter skin. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I received my jar of Manuka Honey skin cream very quickly and started using it over the last week.  I&#x27;ve been handling rosacea on my face for about 6mths now internally with my nutritionist.  The vitamins are working, but with the changes in the weather, I needed something that would help externally.  I love how light it is, I apply it before my makeup and unlike other creams I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t make my mineral powder makeup separate.  It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.  In just a week, I&#x27;ve seen the rosacea go from bright red in patches on my face to light pink.  I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer after an associate saw fantastic results in healing a severe burn in just 3 days. I have severe eczema and have tried all the usual lotions out there - non worked. I&#x27;ve even made my own with little to no success in treating the itchiness and rash that comes with this condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild Naturals has not healed my eczema, but it definitely soothes the itch and tames the redness. It&#x27;s thicker than a lotion but not thick enough to be called a cream, so it goes on lightly yet stays put. It also doesn&#x27;t separate or get watery with use. The price seemed a high for such a small amount, but a little truly goes a long way. I can see this jar lasting 5-6 months, whereas the same amount of a cheaper product might last half that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled to find some top notch ingredients such as Manuka Honey, Hemp oil, and aloe vera in this moisturizer. I am a little concerned that some of the ingredients at the end of the list don&#x27;t appear as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d like, but overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to someone suffering from dry skin, eczema, or burns.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered several times. Love the non-greasy cream</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cream. I like how it soaks in fast and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say it worked for us but it didn&#x27;t, I bought it bc everyone rated it 5 stars.  My daughter has severe eczema and this did nothing for her so we are back to eucerin.  Now I do think this product is good for someone like me that has no skin issues but it was bought with intent to help my daughter and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on my 90 year old mother&#x27;s legs. She has very poor circulation related to Diabetes and PVD. This product has cleared up her dry flaky skin and has also helped her to feel better about herself.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I have terrible dry itching skin, to the point where I scratch open wounds on myself (during sleep).  Nothing helped. The first time I used this it stopped the itch and my skin is healing very quickly.  I apply twice a day and haven&#x27;t scratched since! I will use this product exclusively for my skin care needs.  Price is a little high, but a little goes a long way and is still cheaper than trying everything under the sun to help my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Living in the dry AZ climate with eczema moisturizing is essential twice a day.  I love the face moisturizer so I decided to try the body cream. Three days of use and I am IN LOVE with this cream.  12-24 hours after I put this on my skin is still luxuriously soft and moisturized. Using once a day all over and twice a day on excessively dry areas is working great. Not Greasy!  Smells pleasant, natural, not perfumed at all.  Calms my eczema,  does not irritate my skin.  I have even used it on my acne prone face.  NO PROBLEMS TO REPORT.  So far I just love the Wild Naturals line and the natural, good for my skin ingredients has me hooked!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! My once severely dry skin is now extremely soft...100% complete turn around! : )...no joke.</li>
    <li> Seller contacted me to be sure it had arrived.  I find this cream unusual in that it is not greasy while still lubricating the skin.  It feels wonderful and seems to be filling in some wrinkles! -- Or, is that too much wishful thinking?</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis on my left elbow for years. YEARS! Wild Natural Manuka Honey has knocked it back to almost nothing. I continue to use it because there is still a small patch of red and it itches occasionally. But my skin has improved by over 80%. I&#x27;ve also used it on mosquito bites and when my face feels dry. A little goes a L-O-N-G way. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It smells like medicine. Every whiff makes me feel like I stepped into a hospital. Yick...</li>
    <li> Product was just ok. Bought it for my eczema prone kids and it was not what I was hoping for, in fact one of my kids said it burned a little when we applied it to his eczema. I would say if this were 1/2 the price I may order again but at $40 not a chance. It did moisturize my skin well and was non greasy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for over a month and have had good results.  The texture of my skin has improved and is so much clearer now.</li>
    <li> It has only been a week. At first I was putting it on 3x a day. But after the 2nd day...wow. this is some amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2yr old son has a huge case of eczema (or what he has been diagnosed with) we have tried every steroid cream/lotion/medicine given to us by the pediatrician and dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When nothing would even put a dent in his rash, I looked to the internet. I did three bleach baths for 10 minutes 3 days apart. Then I tried this cream. Put it on and it totally made the palms of my hands amazingly smooth and soft. Cleared up the outbreak on his torso and started slowly clearing up his legs. His knee areas started looking like psoriasis and peeling and flaking. Today marked a week and everything is so smooth. Only one spot he itches on his wrist ( I think out of habit). The back of his knees are still red but smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont put it on as light as they recommend,  I have about 2/3 left out of an 8oz. Tub. Will def. Be buying more and telling my friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the amazing cream!</li>
    <li> This is the only body moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that is as effective as the expensive German one my husband and I used for many years. It&#x27;s a great product with safe ingredients and I&#x27;m happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying I&#x27;ve have had dry skin since birth and some how the ingredients in this product have fully eliminated my dry skin. And I don&#x27;t have to deal with that greasy nasty feeling most lotions have. As well I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone increased as well and it looks better in general. As well I got rid of acne with it and it helped my dad&#x27;s athletes foot which I didn&#x27;t think was possible.</li>
    <li> This cream is not oily, I am starting to love it. Glad it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, irritates my eyes ;-)</li>
    <li> I thought to try this product for testing purpose but now I am loving it. I read all the comments given by other customers I couldn&#x27;t believe this product can do such big difference. I would recommend to try this product at least once you can see the difference on your skin. It took almost 2 weeks to see the difference , i guess it depends on the skin also and I was using a soap which contains sodium lauryl sulfate which was diminishing the effect of this cream. Overall I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Makes my skin feel and look fabulous! I will definitely continue using Wild Naturals!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find a natural product with honey in it. After trying this, I love it. A tiny bit goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or residue feel after applying. My skin feels soft, moisturized and fresh. I will definitely be reordering but this jar will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea, along with very dry skin. I try new (or new to me) products fairly regularly to help with the dry patches on my face. This cream isn&#x27;t greasy (a nice surprise for a cream), doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and helps with the dryness on my face. It also works very well as a general all over moisturizer. It arrived quickly, as most orders from Amazon do. My only complaint is that the seller continued to pester me for a review, even after I explained that I have to test products for a while to make sure that they don&#x27;t upset my sensitive facial skin. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, and I will consider purchasing it again (the large jar will last a long time).</li>
    <li> Did not work at all, waste of good money.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this product.  It is non greasy and has no unpleasant odor.  It is doing a wonderful job of clearing up the skin condition of my legs.  I apply it twice daily.</li>
