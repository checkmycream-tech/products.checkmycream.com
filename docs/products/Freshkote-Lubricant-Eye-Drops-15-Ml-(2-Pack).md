      <li>great to relieve eye dryness for hours; worth the money.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Interestingly, our pharmacy requires a prescription for FreshKote</li>
      <li>With the price of these drops I was expecting something a lot more.</li>
      <li>FreshKote does just as well or better and does not sting like the prescription product.  </li>
      <li>I am on day 5 now and my eyes look and feel so much better.  </li>
      <li>It is refreshing as well.</li>

      <li>Very good for dry eyes.</li>
      <li>I think they work fine</li>
      <li>I no longer need to use ointments at night, which is a huge benefit.</li>
      <li>but the product is available at Amazon without a prescription.</li>
      <li>I get relief immediately, and rarely need more than one drop once a day, even when using the computer for hours.&lt;br</li>
      <li>like I do, you will pay as much as you can afford for any kind of relief.  </li>
      <li>My Mother has to use these, she has a very rare eye disease, and the doctor prescribe these drops for her, we cannot find them anywhere anymore except here.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>great for my dry eyes</li>
      <li>If you have severe dry eye you won&#x27;t believe how great the product</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it available!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and is a nice, clear drop.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately I have not been able to find it in any pharmacy so was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 2&#x3D;bottle offer, and I will order again, when the first bottle runs out, so that I will always have one on hand!</li>
      <li>They are actually more comfortable to use than the Muro 128 drops, which &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; little when first introduced.</li>
      <li>It stings a bit which actually feels good because my eyes actually water again</li>
      <li>Now that the drops are no longer prescription, I hope Focus Laboratories will come up with more appropriate pricing for the over-the-counter consumer...especially low or fixed-income consumers suffering from chronic dry eye!</li>
      <li>I spent alot of time using other eye drops to make my eyes more comfortable but these are the first that last for most of the day!</li>
      <li>This product keeps your eyes lubricated for  several hours and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>and I was started to get very depressed.  </li>
      <li>For me they have been an absolute God-send.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t just wet your eyes - they seem to help the eye to produce more tears over time.  </li>
      <li>I have Corneal Dystrophy and these drops work very well to keep it under control.  </li>
      <li>long before it was available over-the-counter.  </li>
      <li>Your better off using Systane eye drops for a lot less in price.</li>
      <li>This was highly recommended by our Ophthalmologist, over any other type available over the counter.</li>
      <li>I still use regular eye drops during the day if my eyes feel dry, but these FreshKote drops keep my eyes healthy.</li>
      <li>I use FreshKote 3 or 4 times a day and my dry eye is pretty much cured!</li>
      <li>He retired and my new optometrist asked me to try FreshKote.</li>
      <li>I still use them but only twice a day (first thing in the morning, and after I take out my contacts at night).  </li>
      <li>I even purchased eye pads you heat and have to apply frequently.</li>
      <li>Yes, there is a minor inconvenience due to some residue around my eyes when I have to use them repeatedly due to extremely low humidity (i.e. full AC in very hot summers) but this is well worth the benefits.</li>
      <li>They sting a tiny bit initially and leave a slight sandy residue afterwards which I simply clean off gently.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these as prescription drops from my eye doctor for the past year and a half and find they work great for combatting my dry eye symptoms.  </li>
      <li>I have severe dry eye and this product works very well to lubricate my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have pretty severe chronic dry eyes, and these eyedrops are a big help for someone who stares at a computer screen all day.  </li>
      <li>And, product was very fresh, with expiration dates in late 2016.</li>

    <li> This product keeps your eyes lubricated for  several hours and is easy to use.  It is the best that i have been able to find on rhe market.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry eyes.</li>
    <li> These are the only drops that have helped give lasting relief for extremely dry eyes. AND at half the price as from a pharmacy! Thanks for making it available!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dr. Really feel great. I have allergies and this soothed my red dry eyes. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have basement membrane dystrophy - irregularity in the front membrane of the cornea. My previous optometrist had me use Muro 128 by Bausch and Lomb. He retired and my new optometrist asked me to try FreshKote. I was unable to find them locally. It was great to find them online at Amazon and to have them delivered so promptly. They are actually more comfortable to use than the Muro 128 drops, which &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; little when first introduced. However, the FreshKote drops also tend to leave a residue. There would be &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; remaining on my eyelashes and a dried film on the skin beneath my eyes where the drops overflowed. I think they work fine and most people would probably be satisfied with them - for me my vision was slightly clearer with the Muro 128 drops and they don&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling &amp;#34;gunky.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a really great eye care products.  I have been using for a long time... long before it was available over-the-counter.  has really helped y eyes !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I was told that FreshKote penetrates 3 layers of tissue.  One drop in each eye works.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye and I could not spend $280. monthly for Restasis.  On a recommendation from a friend I tried your product and I am very satisfied with the results.  It has taken away the redness, itching, etc. I will continue to use your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Donna Ryan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my severe dry eye syndrome. Even though I am using the prescription dry eye medication, Restasis, I still suffer. My optometrist recommended FreshKote. My eyes feel so much better after using these drops.</li>
    <li> great to relieve eye dryness for hours; worth the money.&lt;br /&gt; the downside: it leaves white streaks on the cheeks after application; also, has &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> Use to be a prescription.  I&#x27;ve used it for at least 5 years, 4 x&#x27;s a day and it works well.</li>
    <li> I have pretty severe chronic dry eyes, and these eyedrops are a big help for someone who stares at a computer screen all day.  They are soothing like Celluvisc eyedrops, but you can still see unlike the Celluvisc eyedrops.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Used along with Restasis it is incredible. If you have severe dry eye you won&#x27;t believe how great the product FreshKote  is. It leaves a coating on the eye that relieves allergies as well. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I use this for dry eyes, recommended by my doctor.  It is refreshing as well.</li>
    <li> This beats regular saline solution for my needs.</li>
    <li> The eye drops work well, but they feel a little sticky when they dry on the skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Make your eyes feel good.</li>
    <li> These FreshKote eye drops  were recommended by my eye doctor  and  they work well to lubricate dry eyes.  I  use them several times each day.</li>
    <li> I spent alot of time using other eye drops to make my eyes more comfortable but these are the first that last for most of the day!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 6 years due to severe dry eye. They are the only product that brings me relief. I searched for years for an answer to my problem and then an ophthalmologist recommended these when they were still prescription only drops. I no longer need to use ointments at night, which is a huge benefit. I have used these ever since.  Yes, there is a minor inconvenience due to some residue around my eyes when I have to use them repeatedly due to extremely low humidity (i.e. full AC in very hot summers) but this is well worth the benefits.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> With the price of these drops I was expecting something a lot more. Your better off using Systane eye drops for a lot less in price. My eye Dr. recommended these drops. Now I know she was just trying to make a sale.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> The best eye drops I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have extremely dry eyes which caused may problems and although expensive, FreshKote has reduced my trips to the optomologist to once a year rather than four or five visits annually.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by our Ophthalmologist, over any other type available over the counter.</li>
    <li> This product works great for my eye problem.  It doesn&#x27;t sting and is a nice, clear drop.  I use it once a day in the morning and have no problems throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry eye, from Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and I have tried numerous artificial tears.  They gave some relief, but not like the relief I get from FreshKote.  My opthamologist recommended it to me, and told me to use it 4 times daily, in addition to my Restasis.  I ordered it.  It is a bit pricy; I do admit that.  However, if you suffer from dry eye like I do, you will pay as much as you can afford for any kind of relief.  I will order it again.  I recommend this to anyone else who suffers from severe dry eye or even mild to moderate dry eye.  It came from Amazon, through another source (pharmacy), and it arrived at my home in less than a week.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I ordered the 2&#x3D;bottle offer, and I will order again, when the first bottle runs out, so that I will always have one on hand!</li>
    <li> My Mother has to use these, she has a very rare eye disease, and the doctor prescribe these drops for her, we cannot find them anywhere anymore except here.  Good price, great product they work great and great customer service, quick shipping and delivery.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are the best eyedrops, Rx or non-Rx. They work better than anything over the counter or otherwise available in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about 5 years - they used to be prescription only.  I had so much trouble with dry eyes that I could not wear my contact lenses.  After using these for several months (5 years ago) my eyes improved to the point that I could start wearing contacts again.  These don&#x27;t just wet your eyes - they seem to help the eye to produce more tears over time.  I still use them but only twice a day (first thing in the morning, and after I take out my contacts at night).  I still use regular eye drops during the day if my eyes feel dry, but these FreshKote drops keep my eyes healthy.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended this eye drop for my dry eyes. They are pretty expensive and when you buy them at the drugstore you can&#x27;t find them on the shelves, they are&#x27;nt prescription but for some reason they are behind the pharmacy counter and you have to ask for them. But before finding these, I wasted so much money on every over-the-counter eye drop promise and nothing worked.  I looked into the prescription drugs and they have side effects that I didn&#x27;t like. I even purchased eye pads you heat and have to apply frequently. I use FreshKote 3 or 4 times a day and my dry eye is pretty much cured! My Dr. told me to still use the thick Vaseline type at bedtime, then upon weakening I use FreshKote. It stings a bit which actually feels good because my eyes actually water again and I&#x27;m good to go. Thankful for recommendation and once again thankful Amazon carries them.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have severe dry eye and this product works very well to lubricate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been so very desperate for help with my eyes and I had dried virtually everything to help with severe dry eye syndrome and MGD.  After doing a ton of research, I happened upon this product.  Sure they are pricey but they are worth it many times over for the health (and appearance) of my eyes.  For me they have been an absolute God-send.  They sting a tiny bit initially and leave a slight sandy residue afterwards which I simply clean off gently.  Currently, I am using these drops four times a day but I truly believe I will be able to decrease this soon.  These drops began working on the second or third day.  I am on day 5 now and my eyes look and feel so much better.  If in doubt, try them!  I had failed Restasis, punctual plugs, fish oil, and all the other typical drops and ointments until now and I was started to get very depressed.  I am so grateful to have found something that finally helps me!</li>
    <li> My wife uses these for dry-eye condition. She had been using prescription Restasis which is pretty expensive and not available as generic.  FreshKote does just as well or better and does not sting like the prescription product.  A bit pricy but definitely cheaper than the prescription.  Interestingly, our pharmacy requires a prescription for FreshKote but the product is available at Amazon without a prescription.</li>
    <li> Delicious.... they taste just like real eyes....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it works, and lasts longer than other drops. I get relief immediately, and rarely need more than one drop once a day, even when using the computer for hours.&lt;br /&gt; My wife, on the other hand, can&#x27;t use them. She says they sting.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a 15 mL container of FreshKote eye drops via Amazon, and when it arrived, the bottle was unsealed. I am afraid to put these in my eyes, not knowing really what is in the container, and whether it is even sterile.  I urge caution to anyone ordering such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a follow-up to the message above, I want to request a return of my money, or please send another 15mL container of FreshKote Eye drops.  Please respond.</li>
    <li> My wife depends on this product.</li>
    <li> These drops have truly been a game-changer for my battle with dry eye!  This is great that I can purchase them in a 2 pack also.  I like to keep an extra bottle on hand because I cannot sleep without them.  I have been using them for two years and am glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We bought the double pack but received only one. Had some trouble disputing but in the end they did send us our second bottle with an apology. Product is good for the value.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH THE RIDICULOUS PRICE.  Buy the Systane Ultra dry eye drops instead.</li>
    <li> great for my dry eyes</li>
    <li> FreshKote is an excellent product to help dry eyes make tears. Product was delivered before the promised date.  And, product was very fresh, with expiration dates in late 2016.</li>
    <li> Freshkote was recommended by my eye doctor.  I have Corneal Dystrophy and these drops work very well to keep it under control.  The best I have found.  Unfortunately I have not been able to find it in any pharmacy so was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using these as prescription drops from my eye doctor for the past year and a half and find they work great for combatting my dry eye symptoms.  I would have given a 5-star rating for the quality/effectiveness of the drops but lowered it to only 3 stars because of how expensive they are!  I was very unhappy to learn this past month that FreshKote eye drops had recently been re-classified as OTC and I now have to pay full-price for these drops.  A 15 ml bottle was $49 at my local pharmacy.  The lowest price I could find was this 2-pack from Pharmapacks through Amazon at $65 with $3 shipping for the 2 bottles, so $34 each...still rediculously expensive!  Now that the drops are no longer prescription, I hope Focus Laboratories will come up with more appropriate pricing for the over-the-counter consumer...especially low or fixed-income consumers suffering from chronic dry eye!</li>
