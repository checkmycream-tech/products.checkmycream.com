      <li>Color great and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing to find avon products on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Thanks from all the blonds for a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>and I find this Avon one to be every bit as good or better.  </li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair and when I apply this, it blends with my natural brows so perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I love these.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Glad they&#x27;re still making it</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>you just roll up the pencil when you want more.  </li>
      <li>A firmer consistency and finer line make for a much more natural-looking brow.</li>
      <li>I am always running out of these - much better than via the Avon site.  </li>
      <li>I wish there was more product for the money.  </li>
      <li>Perfect color - the only one I buy.</li>
      <li>I love the pencils and the 4 stars</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find Glimmersticks in blonde color in an automatic pencil.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love this.  </li>
      <li>I have used may different brow liners, some of them costing quite a bit more than this one, but Avon makes the best!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love the color and the consistency stays put.</li>
      <li>I love this eye brow pencil.  </li>
      <li>As an &#x27;ash-blonde&#x27; I find most eyebrow sticks are too brownish, the powders too reddish.  </li>
      <li>NYX is also pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair and the blonde is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I then use a light eyebrow powder and it looks better than either product used alone.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy, stays light and doesn&#x27;t seem to smear at all.</li>
      <li>Both work fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and glides on.  </li>
      <li>They glide on smoothly and I never have a problem with there breaking while using them.</li>
      <li>It blended OK, but for a fair blonde, I think it would be too dark.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(it is more of a light taupe than a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>So Avon, I am now your loyal customer.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was a smidge lighter for my brows, but overall, the best blonde brow pencil I have bought!</li>
      <li>I love that it has no red tint to it at all like so many others.</li>
      <li>I actually got this to get to the $25 minimum with the add-on program, but I&#x27;m so very glad that I did:</li>
      <li>Very pliable without coming off easily.</li>
      <li>The color is great for blonds because it is not red like many other pencils.</li>
      <li>and it is the right color for me.</li>
      <li>I have dark blonde eyebrows and this pencil matches perfectly.</li>
      <li>Super-easy to use because the liner is soft like putty and easy to brush on.  </li>
      <li>I love Avon&#x27;s glimmersticks and only buy them when they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a redhead, but the blonde pencils usually work best to give my brows a fuller look.</li>
      <li>This glides on extremely well and fills in my brows so nicely.</li>
      <li>Light color compliments blonde hair, soft and easy to blend.</li>
      <li>It provides a nice, natural shade for blonde eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I am blonde and fair, and this is way to red for me.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly &amp; last all day, at the end of the day it removes easily.  </li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t set very quickly, so you have a little wiggle room if you need to make corrections.</li>
      <li>I have finally found a new favorite, Physicians Formula.  </li>
      <li>Bought as dupe for Anastasia brow wiz--it&#x27;s close, but much thicker</li>
      <li>Works better than expected.</li>
      <li>Works very well - and lasts longer than the Clinique stuff.</li>
      <li>Perhaps, though, if you like the whole &amp;#34;bold brow&amp;#34; trend and want to look like that, you might like this.</li>
      <li>This pencil sharpens automatically and is a light brownish-blonde color that blends naturally into the natural eyebrow, and slides on smoothly--easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Shipping cost seemed high for such light weight items.</li>
      <li>It seemed that most of the eyebrow pencils had to be sharpened and the browns were too dark.</li>
      <li>I have not been able for several years to find similar eyebrow pencils in the drug stores where I always purchased them before.</li>
      <li>red toned like others and blends in super.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Only lasted less than one week they can get kind of too creamy to use on your eyebrows</li>
      <li>I was able to continue using it, but only after being verrrry careful not to tip the pencil</li>
      <li>It looks very natural on and wears well.</li>
      <li>It is very natural looking, not</li>
      <li>It looks very natural and stays on all day.  </li>
      <li>Same exact item -</li>
      <li>Excellent mechanical, crayon-like brow pencil - I was using Mary Kay brand, but this one is much less expensive and works just as well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> have used this for years.  Glad they&#x27;re still making it</li>
    <li> I have purchased so may eye brow pencils without ever finding a color that worked for me.  This is perfect!  I have medium brown hair and when I apply this, it blends with my natural brows so perfectly.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pencil in blonde and received it in tawny. Too inexpensive (good thing!) to return. It is not gooey at all. I &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; it up by putting a few strokes on my hand. I then use a light eyebrow powder and it looks better than either product used alone.</li>
    <li> This is the brow pencil I have been using for almost 20 years and this is the most I have ever paid for them, I will never buy from Amazon again for this as the shipping was far too expensive.  I love the pencils and the 4 stars are for the product but I would give pricing and shipping 1 star.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye brow pencil I can use that won&#x27;t make my eyebrows too dark or too red. I love that it has no red tint to it at all like so many others. It&#x27;s the only eyebrow pencil I use.</li>
    <li> Perfect color.  Very pliable without coming off easily.</li>
    <li> I have used Avon Glimmersticks Brow Definer for several years. Excellent product. Stays on all day, no smudging or smearing. Good choice of colors.</li>
    <li> Excellent for fair haired people. I had bought  before and knew what I was getting.</li>
    <li> Yeah!  Great color for blondes, and glides on with ease-reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on with the least bit of a touch on your brow.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair but the dark brown Glimmerstick was too dark for me. This &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; color is just right, especially if you just need to fill in a few sparse areas of your brows.</li>
    <li> I wish there was more product for the money.  I like the product and it is the right color for me.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!! Will never buy again</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I like that you do not have to sharpen anything.  Stays on well and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I would be so upset if they stopped making these. There is no comparable in any department store.</li>
    <li> I love this eye brow pencil.  It is very natural looking, not red toned like others and blends in super.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this Avon product for years and I love it.  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and glides on.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.  Shipping cost seemed high for such light weight items.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find Glimmersticks in blonde color in an automatic pencil. I have not been able for several years to find similar eyebrow pencils in the drug stores where I always purchased them before. It seemed that most of the eyebrow pencils had to be sharpened and the browns were too dark. This pencil sharpens automatically and is a light brownish-blonde color that blends naturally into the natural eyebrow, and slides on smoothly--easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit dark for being &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Blonde eyebrows are really a problem.  It&#x27;s either too taupe, too red, or too dark.  This color was ok but not great.  Ease of application is about average.  I&#x27;ve been through many brands of pencils lately because they stopped making my previous pencil.  I have finally found a new favorite, Physicians Formula.  NYX is also pretty good.</li>
    <li> Long lasting pencil. You don&#x27;t have to sharpen so that&#x27;s a plus. I have the blonde pencil and the next shade darker. Both work fantastic. My brows are a bit on the darker side but this pencil is perfect. Can&#x27;t beat the price for a good quality brow pencil. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great pencil!&lt;br /&gt;Good natural color&lt;br /&gt;Good staying power</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice pencil with the twist up base. I love the color and the consistency stays put.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  As an &#x27;ash-blonde&#x27; I find most eyebrow sticks are too brownish, the powders too reddish.  It goes on smoothly &amp; last all day, at the end of the day it removes easily.  The only other brow stick that compares is Mary Kay&#x27;s, unfortunately they no longer make this product in stick form, just powder.  So Avon, I am now your loyal customer.  Thanks from all the blonds for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil. No sharpening, no wood scraping your brow.  Perfect color - the only one I buy.</li>
    <li> This is truly a blonde eyebrow pencil.  I have dark blonde eyebrows and this pencil matches perfectly. No hint of red or dark brown like a lot of those other pencils. I&#x27;ve been using this pencil for I would bet over 10 yrs now. I wanted this pencil shade but I didn&#x27;t want the Avon lady. Ordering it through Amazon was a win, win situation.</li>
    <li> I am always running out of these - much better than via the Avon site.  Same exact item -</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to make brows that don&#x27;t look clownish. A firmer consistency and finer line make for a much more natural-looking brow. This is a fail and the positive reviews confuse me.</li>
    <li> I actually got this to get to the $25 minimum with the add-on program, but I&#x27;m so very glad that I did: this thing rocks.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of those brow kits with all the tools and gizmos and whatnot, cost pretty much a fortune, especially compared to this little pencil.&lt;br /&gt;This is all I need to use. No need for setting wax or what not, no need for craziness. It&#x27;s perfect for my blonde hair and brows, creates a natural look without looking weird or fake. I love it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The pencil is too &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t like the way it goes on my eyebrows and it makes the hairs stick together all weird. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Used these for years &amp; happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love Avon&#x27;s glimmersticks and only buy them when they&#x27;re on sale. They glide on smoothly and I never have a problem with there breaking while using them. I use this eyebrown pencil, eyeliner and lip liner ones too.</li>
    <li> when it came the eye pencil was completely busted. there was no ink in it and the whole thing is in 5 different pieces</li>
    <li> Seems to be a pretty decent eyebrow pencil; my only possible complaint is, I suspect it may not last long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to find avon products on Amazon.  This is a truly great brow pencil and it&#x27;s nice to find it here.</li>
    <li> I wish it was a smidge lighter for my brows, but overall, the best blonde brow pencil I have bought!</li>
    <li> Way too dark on my blonde eyebrows, way to thick a tip, hard to remove. It made my eyebrows looks very fake, and I don&#x27;t use it at all. Perhaps, though, if you like the whole &amp;#34;bold brow&amp;#34; trend and want to look like that, you might like this.</li>
    <li> Light color compliments blonde hair, soft and easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Excellent mechanical, crayon-like brow pencil - I was using Mary Kay brand, but this one is much less expensive and works just as well</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite eyebrow pencil. I have light brown hair and this color matches perfect and lasts almost all day.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this pencil. The color is great for blonds because it is not red like many other pencils. It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t set very quickly, so you have a little wiggle room if you need to make corrections. Once it&#x27;s set though, it has great staying power. I will definitely re-purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love this.  It goes on easy, stays light and doesn&#x27;t seem to smear at all. I have tried Bobbie Brown&#x27;s eye brow powder, but came back to AVON.  I ordered a half dozen just in case AVON decides to discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, but the blonde pencils usually work best to give my brows a fuller look. This one was a lot browner than what I usually find. It blended OK, but for a fair blonde, I think it would be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the design wasn&#x27;t great. The pencil came loose and fell out after a couple uses. I was able to continue using it, but only after being verrrry careful not to tip the pencil down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t order this again. I&#x27;m on the hunt for a great brow pencil that is drugstore priced and doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened. For now, the hunt continues.</li>
    <li> This type of self-sharpening brow liner is impossible to find in stores!  They used to make one by Maybelline but it&#x27;s been discontinued and I find this Avon one to be every bit as good or better.  Super-easy to use because the liner is soft like putty and easy to brush on.  The color is a little darker than I&#x27;d like for a blonde, but it&#x27;s still ok.</li>
    <li> another awesome product by Avon. i use it for my eyebrows and its perfect. no sharpening just twists up as you need it</li>
    <li> Works very well - and lasts longer than the Clinique stuff.</li>
    <li> I am blonde and fair, and this is way to red for me.</li>
    <li> Bought as dupe for Anastasia brow wiz--it&#x27;s close, but much thicker</li>
    <li> I have used may different brow liners, some of them costing quite a bit more than this one, but Avon makes the best!  It glides on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge off, and the color is perfect on me (it is more of a light taupe than a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;).  It looks very natural and stays on all day.  Conveniently, it doesn&#x27;t require sharpening - you just roll up the pencil when you want more.  I hope Avon does not discontinue this!</li>
    <li> Used this for years and was happy to find this on Amazon.  Don&#x27;t order much Avon products and was tired of trying to find an Avon rep when I needed something.</li>
    <li> This glides on extremely well and fills in my brows so nicely. It doesn&#x27;t clump like other liners. It provides a nice, natural shade for blonde eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about six years as it great for the price. I used it for everyday makeup. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected. Hasn&#x27;t broke or crumbled</li>
    <li> Only lasted less than one week they can get kind of too creamy to use on your eyebrows</li>
    <li> This is a great brow pencil. I got this in blonde and use it every morning. It looks very natural on and wears well. For the price, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have light brown hair and the blonde is perfect.  It stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Best eye brow pencil....Avon GLIMMERSTICKS Eye Brow Blonde.....great color and I have used these for years moist not dry and I love these.</li>
    <li> Perfect brow pencil. Color great and easy to use. No sharpening required.</li>
