### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>These are great brushes.  </li>
      <li>So happy I found these replacements and would recommend them to others.</li>
      <li>Probably the best price from a reputable company.</li>
      <li>They fit my Sonic and perform great!</li>
      <li>Anything that keeps plague at arms length is good in my book any day of the week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using one for about  4 weeks and it is a perfect replacement for the original.  </li>
      <li>So happy I was able to find these for my Oral-B Sonic tooth brush.....</li>
      <li>Shame on a good company lie Oral-B for not making the replacement heads anymore after so many people bought their Sonic Vitality brush.</li>
      <li>Somewhat Leary about the fit and quality before ordering but the price was good</li>
      <li>As with the original ones, these do a good job getting rid of plaque.  </li>
      <li>I have an older Oral B Vitality Sonic and these fit it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Braun doesn&#x27;t make the replacement heads any more</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never found off brands that would fit it--until now!  </li>
      <li>I just see no point in spending 10x for something that is barely 2x better.</li>
      <li>Great buy and absolutely cannot tell the difference from BRAUN original brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;Saves money and time searching!</li>
      <li>The product works fine</li>
      <li>and I have now come to the conclusion that the &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34; are just fine.  </li>
      <li>Fit well on the Oral-B Sonic</li>
      <li>I have an Oral B Vitality Sonic and they fit well.</li>
      <li>These heads appear to be of reasonable quality even if they are not quite as good as the originals, they are good enough.</li>
      <li>the original brushes and the nylon bristles do not fall out.  </li>
      <li>These brushes look and brush the teeth just like the original ones.</li>
      <li>spite of this, they all will install on the handle and they do clean the teeth.</li>
      <li>good price for a generic product.</li>
      <li>Not a bad deal.  </li>
      <li>They fit exactly like</li>
      <li>These toothbrush heads fit our Sonic very well.</li>
      <li>;  Yes, you read that right --</li>
      <li>The cost to purchase the original brush heads is extremely high when they even can be found.</li>
      <li>They are good quality and do the job for much less than name brand.</li>
      <li>However, they vary considerably in the way they fit the handle.</li>
      <li>fits Oral-B brush pretty well.  </li>
      <li>right now i am happy, but i imagine the future will tell the story on how long it will last</li>
      <li>When you factor in the very inexpensive cost, they are a home run.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m very</li>
      <li>As advertised &amp; fast shipping</li>
      <li>And really, I have bought both kinds over the years</li>
      <li>For these generic replacements, they were eight for $8 with free Prime shipping.  </li>
      <li>This may be the reason the price is so reasonable, quality control was not what it should have</li>
      <li>I will put up with the frustration of an incorrect fit for the low price!</li>
      <li>They wear down much too quickly and the sound is not the same as when I used my original brush.</li>
      <li>The last time we bought original Oral B heads, I seem to recall they were over $10 for a quantity of two at CVS.</li>
      <li>I have purchased Oral-B products many times but will definitely think twice about it next time!</li>
      <li>Little noisier than the OEM brush, but most people would never notice.</li>
      <li>and they work pretty much the same.  </li>
      <li>Oh well, time to invest in a new electric tooth brush.</li>
      <li>Very pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>The blue bristles are just dyed blue, and they never fade like those of the original where they indicate when the brush is worn out and needs to be replaced.  </li>
      <li>Work and fit like the originals at MUCH less cost.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t last as long as the original.  </li>
      <li>Was trying to continue using my old Oral B Sonic</li>
      <li>Seems to work well in my Oral-B Sonic Complete Toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Works just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
      <li>So these are not perfect but they are darn good.  </li>
      <li>Some fit pretty well, others are quite loose or quite tight.</li>
      <li>The bristles are just a little softer than those of the original.  </li>
      <li>Still, if this is the kind you need, as far as I&#x27;m concerned they are the only game in town.  </li>
      <li>My ONLY complaint is that (and I suspect this is because they are &amp;#34;after market&amp;#34;) they seem to get loose on the mounting fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes the fit of the brush onto the metal post is not perfect but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.  </li>

<li> Yes, I experience occassional loss of bristles, as noted by other reviewers, but I can put up with this, given the fantastically low price compared to the original brushes (which are increasigly hard to find, anyway).</li>
<li> The originals last only about two times as long</li>
<li> So either way they are imported and just plastic cheap things to brush teeth so this pack of 8 will probably last a year for a person, even if don&#x27;t hold up like the oral b expensive ones</li>
<li> The generics, though, appear to go one very positive and healthful step further -- the package says that they &amp;#34;...effectively remove plague without irritating gums...</li>
<li> The toothbrush head seem a little hard to fit at first, but I pushed down a little harder and it snapped into place.</li>
<li> Great price, hard to get off  and on the base</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t stop them from doing a fantastic job, but it does set up extra vibration that is a bit annoying.  </li>
<li> these remove PLAGUE, that scourge of the Dark Ages in Europe and England.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Others have mentioned they may not be the quality of the brand name, but even if I only get a month or two out of each brush, I&#x27;m ahead of the game, as I didn&#x27;t want to replace the unit yet.</li>
<li> Did not fit on my Oral B Sonic</li>
<li> but the bristles are a bit stiff</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a very slight gap at the bottom but is of no consequence.</li>
<li> I ordered for someone else not sure</li>
<li> The ones that are too tight are difficult to install and remove.</li>
<li> The brushes are not great quality.  </li>
<li> Those that are too loose result in a annoying buzz while cleaning the teeth.</li>
<li> These appear made in Germany the expensive ones probably made in China anyways!</li>
<li> but the heads became very expensive when this model was discontinued.</li>
<li> The Oral-B brushes that are still out there for sale are atrociously priced!</li>

    <li> Work and fit like the originals at MUCH less cost. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Irritated my gums after using a couple of days. Was trying to continue using my old Oral B Sonic but the heads became very expensive when this model was discontinued. Oh well, time to invest in a new electric tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Fits the Oral B Vitality Sonic.  These seem to be well made.  Bristles are still sturdy after a month.  Probably the best price from a reputable company.</li>
    <li> The cost to purchase the original brush heads is extremely high when they even can be found. These heads appear to be of reasonable quality even if they are not quite as good as the originals, they are good enough. When you factor in the very inexpensive cost, they are a home run. I have an Oral B Vitality Sonic and they fit well.</li>
    <li> Great price, hard to get off  and on the base but I have never changed the head before this</li>
    <li> good price for a generic product. fits Oral-B brush pretty well.  Little noisier than the OEM brush, but most people would never notice.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads fit our Sonic very well. There&#x27;s a very slight gap at the bottom but is of no consequence. They are good quality and do the job for much less than name brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have an older Oral B Vitality Sonic and these fit it perfectly.  Braun doesn&#x27;t make the replacement heads any more and I&#x27;ve never found off brands that would fit it--until now!  So, I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned they may not be the quality of the brand name, but even if I only get a month or two out of each brush, I&#x27;m ahead of the game, as I didn&#x27;t want to replace the unit yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered for someone else not sure but I guess it was what she wanted</li>
    <li> Did not fit on my Oral B Sonic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for about  4 weeks and it is a perfect replacement for the original.  Thus far, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine how long it will last.  So happy I found these replacements and would recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Terrific and inexpensive way to change out your toothbrush head without a big expense.  Fit well on the Oral-B Sonic</li>
    <li> As advertised &amp; fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the expensive ones. These appear made in Germany the expensive ones probably made in China anyways!

    <li> They are as advertised.  They were delivered on time.  My ONLY complaint is that (and I suspect this is because they are &amp;#34;after market&amp;#34;) they seem to get loose on the mounting fairly quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t stop them from doing a fantastic job, but it does set up extra vibration that is a bit annoying.

    <li> These are great brushes.  These are my second set of brushes that I&#x27;ve bought for my Oral B electric toothbrush.  They fit exactly like the original brushes and the nylon bristles do not fall out.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> right now i am happy, but i imagine the future will tell the story on how long it will last</li>

    <li> well, these replacement brushes cost 10% of what the OEM brushes cost.  They don&#x27;t last as long as the original.  The bristles are just a little softer than those of the original.  Sometimes the fit of the brush onto the metal post is not perfect but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.  The blue bristles are just dyed blue, and they never fade like those of the original where they indicate when the brush is worn out and needs to be replaced.  So these are not perfect but they are darn good.  And really, I have bought both kinds over the years and I have now come to the conclusion that the &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34; are just fine.  Think about it.  The originals last only about two times as long and they work pretty much the same.  I just see no point in spending 10x for something that is barely 2x better.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not great quality.  They wear down much too quickly and the sound is not the same as when I used my original brush.</li>
    <li> The product works fine but the bristles are a bit stiff and I wished it were possible to get softer bristles.</li>
    <li> So happy I was able to find these for my Oral-B Sonic tooth brush.....</li>
    <li> Seems to work well in my Oral-B Sonic Complete Toothbrush.  Yes, I experience occassional loss of bristles, as noted by other reviewers, but I can put up with this, given the fantastically low price compared to the original brushes (which are increasigly hard to find, anyway).</li>
    <li> they scare me being from china in all god knows what is in them. They work but I am going to rethink buying them.</li>
    <li> These brushes look and brush the teeth just like the original ones. However, they vary considerably in the way they fit the handle. Some fit pretty well, others are quite loose or quite tight. Those that are too loose result in a annoying buzz while cleaning the teeth. The ones that are too tight are difficult to install and remove. This may be the reason the price is so reasonable, quality control was not what it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of this, they all will install on the handle and they do clean the teeth. I will put up with the frustration of an incorrect fit for the low price!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  The last time we bought original Oral B heads, I seem to recall they were over $10 for a quantity of two at CVS. For these generic replacements, they were eight for $8 with free Prime shipping.  Not a bad deal.  As with the original ones, these do a good job getting rid of plaque.  The generics, though, appear to go one very positive and healthful step further -- the package says that they &amp;#34;...effectively remove plague without irritating gums...&amp;#34;  Yes, you read that right -- these remove PLAGUE, that scourge of the Dark Ages in Europe and England.
