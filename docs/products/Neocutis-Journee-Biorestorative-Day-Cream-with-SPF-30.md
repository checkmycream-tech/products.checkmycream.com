<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love Neocutis products, best products for your face..</li>
    <li> This has been an awesome product!! I prefer to wear this over make-up, though its not full coverage it stills give your face a glow!!</li>
    <li> My medical esthetician thinks this is the absolute best product for your skin.  She couldn&#x27;t carry it any more because the company made her buy too large of a minimum order.  I looked on Amazon, and it&#x27;s a great price here.  It&#x27;s not that I use it and see a big difference.  It&#x27;s supposed to have benefits that help your skin in the future.  I don&#x27;t think you can ever measure this.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! This is my new favorite moisterizer/sunscreen. Product was in excellent condition and received in expected time.</li>
    <li> I can say this product is very good, but I think that if it adds some powder merge this product, it wll be perfect, because when using it, people doesn&#x27;t need to use powder again, just like &amp;#34;Journee day cream&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it came so quickly.</li>
    <li> very slightly, light tint that fades till you just see skin...really nice moisturizer with good sunscreen...no burning</li>
    <li> I love this cream and have been using for 2 yrs</li>
    <li> I was unable to use it due to it&#x27;s defective nozzle.  I received a replacement and it also had a defective nozzle!!!!  Very disappointing.  This is their renewed bottle.  New design.  I liked their older bottle better which never had any problem with nozzles.</li>
    <li> could not use the product due to a defective nozzle.  had to return it.  disappointing as this is the second cosmetic product I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon with a faulty nozzle.  maybe that&#x27;s why the price is so low.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this smooth skin cream.  The product comes out in one pump for the exact amount you need for face and neck.  Preasant to use.  I think it&#x27;s helping my skin look smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Neocutis products, and for the first time ever I love my skin. Received this product promptly and in good condition</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is sold in my dermatologist&#x27;s office at $120.00.  Being able to purchase it for 65.00 is great!</li>
    <li> Light weight, has sunscreen and good coverage.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a good moisturizer and my dermatologist recommend this one to me, its the same one he uses and I have to say I love it! Ive been using it for over one year and its been great. It lasts for me about 6-8 weeks depending if I use one full pump but over all well worth it. I tend to have sensitive/oily skin and I get no break outs with this one. Also I use their eye cream and its amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years. It is a great sunscreen with a creamy taupe tint with a slight sheen. The sheen is professional. Very light weight as well as has light coverage.</li>
    <li> Pump did not work.  Returned product.  Called the Neocutis manufacturer for a list of authorized dealers and ordered from one of the.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YBP1D8 Neocutis Journee Bio-restorative Day Cream with PSP and SPF 30+, 1-Ounce]]Journee is the best!  It has moisturizer and sunscreen in one product that does not clog pores or feel heavy on the skin like some sunscreens do.  It is lightly tinted but disappears upon application.  I have been using it for a couple years and my skin has never looked better.  It cost $120 where I was buying it before I found it on Amazon.  Wow.. what a savings!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have just purchased this product &amp; have been using it for a week now. I have normal to oily skin and I am also acne prone, my skin is also VERY sensitive so it is very difficult to find a moisturizer &amp; SPF in one that will not cause breakouts. Well I have to say that since I have been using this product this week I have found significant results with the fading of my pigmented acne scars, it seems like it is also healing my skin in areas that are affected by acne and dry skin. I also do not get oily with this product which is rare when I am using an SPF. Would highly recommend to anyone with normal/sensitive skin or suffering from acne, I say this because I feel like it has sped up the healing process in my problem areas.</li>
    <li> FOR ME IT IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT. I AM ALLERGIC TO ALMOST EVERYTHING.  NOTHING WRONG W/MY SKIN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT THIS WAY. I ASKED MY DERMATOLOGIST TO RECOMMEND AN EXCEPTIONAL CREAME &amp; THIS WAS IT.  THE EYE CREAME IS GREAT AS WELL.    I PURCHASED FROM THIS COMPANY...THEY DELIVERED BEFORE I COULD BLINK! PRICE WAS GOOD. I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE,    5 THUMBS UP GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!    REGARDS,  SM</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thin coverage that doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.  Also, restores your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than others that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using Journee a long time and love that it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it in the new packaging.  I preferred the old packaging.  This bottle is larger (same amount of cream though).  You can no longer see how much is in the bottle, so you won&#x27;t know how close you are to running out.  I use it daily, but now when I dispense it, I get a little hardened glob of cream with the first dispense of the morning.  The old bottle didn&#x27;t do that.  So, love the cream, and miss the old packaging.</li>
    <li> When I put this on it looked and felt just fine for a minute or two, and didn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  But afterward, anything that touched my face made the cream roll into little balls of dark stuff, so all the sunscreen benefit was gone.  Other reviews don&#x27;t say this, so maybe it was some combination of products I used or just my skin (which is pretty normal), but I&#x27;ve never experienced this with other tinted sunscreens or with make-up.</li>
    <li> love this day cream, I have fair sensitive skin. my dermatologist recommended this, its amazing.  Goes on light and smooth, gives just enough coverage and plenty of sun protection.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s a moisturizer and a sunscreen in one. Journee gives your skin a nice glow. It doesn&#x27;t  offer a lot of coverage, but it can be used as a primer, too. Worth the money. It is a great product to add to any skin-care regimen.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product line and well priced on Amazon.  My facialist suggested it and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> Good skincare &amp; sunscreen in one product.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is used in conjunction with the Bio-Restorative Cream and the eye cream. This offers the SPF feature used during day time.  I think it is a little overpriced for the sunscreen but will continue to use it since the Neocutis line is the best I have experience for results.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the habit of buying product before I run out, this bottle I ordered three months ago, just today opened the package and am completely unable to pump anything out of the bottle.  The pumps are defective apparently, I note that many others have had the same problem, and there is no recourse with either Amazon or the seller, SkinSolutions. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to try smashing the bottle with a hammer to get at this very expensive day cream.  It&#x27;s a good product however, if you do purchase, make sure you test out the pumping mechanism as soon as you receive it so that it can be returned according to the 30 day Amazon policy.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Was very drying and made me break out. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Neocutis has a wonderful beauty product for my morning daily routine which moisturizers my skin and protects it from sun damage as the sunscreen protection has been incorporated into this Swiss technologically advanced product.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. I am very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Would have given a five rating to this great product that I have used for several years but last order came in wasteful new packaging, no extra product just larger size. It does not close well, is less convenient for travel, old size fit conveniently in purse and product was lumpy. It has been an excellent moisturizer/sunscreen and good for decreasing redness from rosacea. Please go back to former packaging.</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with different products and when i received it I didn&#x27;t think much of it.....sorry! But I used it and rest is history. It a fantastic product! I&#x27;m not going anywhere without it. I usually use spf 50 and this is spf 30 that&#x27;s my only snag but I can live with it :)</li>
    <li> No other words.  love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neocutis Journee for several years and haven&#x27;t found another product as effective. Many people comment on the quality of my skin and I believe this product has kept me relatively freckle-free with minimal wrinkling.....we do all get older so I do have a few minor lines, but enjoy growing older gracefully with a little help in a bottle. The new packaging was a surprise, but my guess is that it protects the contents from light exposure. Looking at the contents under the bottom allows me to see how much is left. I will buy again</li>
    <li> My dermotologist recommended this product but it was very expensive in her office.  Purchased the same item on Amazon for much less.  This is a lightweight non-greasy moisturizer with SPF.</li>
    <li> A great product-just the right amount of tint to give your skin a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in January and just now tried to use the product, when the prior container was empty. I don&#x27;t like to run out. Bad surprise - when the dispenser is pressed nothing at all comes out!  The pump is clearly defective.  It&#x27;s past the return date and apparently there is no recourse with Amazon.  I recommend buying it from the manufacturer if possible, they will care more about the usefulness of the product.</li>
    <li> As always great price its brand new and much cheaper than other sellers. I am a repeat buyer since I am very happy with the product and know the seller is great.</li>
    <li> This went on with a bit of color then turned pastry.  Not sure if anyone else has had this issue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  The texture of my skin is excellent.  My problem is the new packaging.  The bottle is very large for one ounce of product.  I travel for a living and this bottle takes up too much of my quart bag of liquids I am allowed.  That is the only reason for 3 stars.</li>
    <li> My experience was excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to get a real feel for the product as yet.  However, does seem to do a good job.  Sorry for the not too enlightening review.</li>
    <li> It works fine but I would have liked it better without the tint, and still have the SPF 30. Perhaps there will be one available in the future, also the price was great at Amazon, way cheaper than at the stores.</li>
    <li> I like the product fine, but not worth the money. I don&#x27;t really like it any better than my drugstore creams.</li>
    <li> I love my Neocutis products!</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this product, recommended by my dermatologist, and honestly, because it is so expensive. But it flakes after drying on my face and if it hadn&#x27;t cost so much, would already be in the trash. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I read the description and bought this w/o much knowledge.  However, in the few days I started using it,the quality of my skin has improved.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the hint of tint is not so bad...goes on smooth and gives you an even look.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product at a medi spa as recommended by my dermatologist.  I checked on Amazon when it was time to repurchase and it was much less expensive!!  I was a bit worried if the product was genuine but it seems to be the same and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Adds a great glow to your face. Has just enough of a tint but isn&#x27;t over bearing. A big plus is the sunscreen protection that comes with it. Not heavy feeling at all.</li>
    <li> good deal, good price, good product</li>
    <li> I think this cream is lovely. Seems to make my skin glow and pores appear smaller. A bit expensive but overall very satisfied. I wish it was available in Australia.</li>
    <li> Neocutis Journee Day Cream is a fabulous anti-aging day cream. I have tried many and this is by far the best. My skin improves with regular use. It is expensive but well worth it. What I do not like is the new packaging. The new pump puts out a small but annoying speck of dried product each pump. You can not see the amount of product remaining in the container with the new design.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with a non irritating SPF. I use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years.  It seems reasonably good although I have no idea what my skin would look like if I had used another cream.  My biggest complaint is that they have changed the packaging.  The day cream now forms a clump at the end of the nozzle every time you use it, so the next time you pump some out, the first thing that comes out is a clump of the stuff that is unusable--a waste of expensive cream.  This didn&#x27;t used to happen with the old packing.  Also the new packaging is opaque so you can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the container.  Why they changed from something that was excellent to something that is far less satisfactory is puzzling to me.  Others have complained about these aspects of the product, but I guess the company either doesn&#x27;t read the reviews or doesn&#x27;t care what the customers think.  I plan to find a different product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a year.  Non greasy, non irritating.  The product I received from Amazon is the same as I got from my doctor but I had a lot of trouble getting the bottle and pump to work.  Makes me think it is old stock...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me.  I have dry skin and this is a great product for me.  I have used it for quite a while now.</li>
    <li> Love Love the new bottle style... No more dried up product in between uses.</li>
    <li> I just started use this Cream.I think that after a few month  I will be able to  tell if this cream really works .</li>
    <li> This Journee Day Cream is a pleasure to use.  Feels great on my skin, and protects it from the sun at the same time.  This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Great product and well worth the high price! Love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful to my skin; it is gentle, helps moisturize and provides some sun protection. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I live this! I have to use a stronger moisturizer first but then I use this over it to reduce wrinkles. It has helped. Six months later, wrinkles around my eyes are less prominent.</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.</li>
    <li> Not enough hydration. Left skin very dry.</li>
    <li> It is heavily tinted, so if this is not something you like in a lotion- do not get it.  The texture is good though.</li>
    <li> This ultra light, very slightly tinted cream is the best I&#x27;ve every used.  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed, making my skin tone look more even.  It feels wonderful and is not greasy.  Bonus -- a sun screen too!  I have Rosacea, and since using this cream I believe the redness has diminished by about fifty percent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, at a reasonable price, fast ship, great seller</li>
    <li> Lovely day cream. Great for sensitive skin. 3rd bottle and no desire to return to Skin Medica day cream which I used for years. Great under makeup</li>
    <li> I love it I have used this product for many years. It&#x27;s a lil pricey but its the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i previously purchased this item from my dermatologist. what i received from amazon is not the same color or consistency as the same product purchased from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I started using Neocutis day and night in January 2012.  Today, 5-months after using the product I think my skin looks 10-years younger, and I know there is great improvement because I receive compliments about my skin all the time. Let me qualify this claim by saying I have struggled wtih adult cystic acne and skin discolorations for 25-years and Neocutis face creams have greatly improved the texture and health of my skin.  I am thankful to my Dr. for suggesting the product and really pleased to find quality sellers in Amazon with great prices.</li>
    <li> I would give this product five stars with the exception of the dispenser design. The product itself is wonderful. My dermatologist recommended that I use it every morning under my foundation. It is a wonderful sunscreen with a light tint and it goes on smoothly, evening out my complexion. I loved this product in its former packaging. In the new blue and silver container, however, the product tends to form a dried glob at the opening, which is annoying to remove and also wastes this expensive product. This never happened with the former container. It has become so annoying that I may not purchase the cream again and will look for another similar product.</li>
    <li> I have used, and loved this for 4 years! Now they have squalene in it! It gives me an itchy torso rash, which goes away after I stop using it on my face, chest, and hands. Now I need to find a new day cream:(</li>
    <li> Very good spf day cream.</li>
    <li> This Cream is outstanding.  It is not greasy, and has a light tint that covers a few imperfections.  I often wear it without any foundation.  I also can&#x27;t believe it is SPF 30!!!  There is NO casper the ghost appearance after rubbing it in.  I am not sure if it will be emollient enough for my dry, aging skin for the winter.  We shall see! Expensive, but i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> No problems with my order.</li>
    <li> I have used Journee for over a year now, and I love it. It&#x27;s got spf, plus all of the things you need in a day cream. It&#x27;s tinted (bonus), and it&#x27;s very light. A little retinol at night, and you&#x27;re all set!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for awhile and love it. The price is much better than what I pay at my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> Glorified sun block, thats all!&lt;br /&gt;It does not moisturize a bit. Decent sun protection though.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as all in one product. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this because it isn&#x27;t thick and the price is so much better than dept. stores or at my dermo!</li>
    <li> It really has helped my skin.  I have ordered  two more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my skin sun protection great for dry skin</li>
    <li> love this daily moisturizer, very light silky, slight tint...results - skin feels softer and definitely more moist.&lt;br /&gt;downside - $$$ 75 for 1 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I cant recommend this product highly enough!! NEOCUTIS is the best beauty regime I have ever used!! Buy it and use it!</li>
    <li> Better than make-up. I don&#x27;t know if it reduces wrinkles but it makes your skin look naturally beautiful with an even tone. And it provides sun protection.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the most amazing day cream ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. One pump covers my entire face and neck and leaves my skin looking luminous. It absorbs well and my mineral make-up goes over top easily. I love that it has spf 30 and last summer I didn&#x27;t get burned once at the many baseball games I sat through. I absolutely LOVE this cream!</li>
    <li> Excellent  all around</li>
    <li> Cream was brown with wierd smell. Love the eye cream so I thought I would try this one.</li>
    <li> Love it! Seller was a pleasure to work with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several products including skinmedica and obagi.  Neocutis is by far the best.  This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I loved this when I first put it on, but my skin started tingling and my eyes started watering with 30 minutes or so.  I tried it a couple of times, but I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.  Wish I could return it because it is useless for me!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it! I will continue to buy it and well as purchase from this buyer!</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice feel.Not greasy or sticky. I use it every day under make up instead of the very expensive Sisley product that I&#x27;ve been using for years. This is better as a sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> I called neocutis  directly to inquire about the product code and exp. date.  They said the number did not match any of their records and that it might be a fake.  I did not use it as I had no idea what was actually in it.  I would never purchase from this merchant on amazon again.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very good cream, and a little goes a long way, which justifies the cost. Be aware though that is has a medium skin tone tint. I was worried I would look as if I were wearing foundation makeup, but I doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love the product - don&#x27;t like the new packaging.  Can&#x27;t see how much is in the bottle and it hardens on the end of the pump.  Get lots of compliments on my skin and I credit some of that to Journee.  I&#x27;m 69.</li>
    <li> My skin doc suggested this product. I was using 4-5 cosmetic product from a dept store. He suggested this for all of the benefits in one product, ples a SPF of 30 and a tined moisturizer! Everything in one! Very pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It works better for me than any other that I have used. I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I wish I had started using this cream on my face years ago! I am 37 years old and starting to get some fine wrinkles, however after I put this on my face... my skin feels like it is new again! I also love that it has a little bit of a skin colored tint to it, which brightens up my skin as well. I wear makeup over it and the makeup glides on flawlessly! Plus, it includes a sunscreen, which is a must. I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I mix two squirts of this in my palm with my liquid foundation.  This way, I get moisturizer and the coverage I like for the day, plus SPF.</li>
    <li> I have dry flaky skin. This lotion works great :-)</li>
    <li> My first from a Derm was fine.  This one does not seal well after full dispensing and snapping cap on.  Every time there is a hard piece that cannot be used.  As I use this product everyday and truly like the product, I hate the waste I see every morning.  I have documented the amt that is wasted on several occasions.  Do not understand what is different from the first one from a Derm!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will reorder ❤️</li>
    <li> Everything you need, or even want, to keep your face healthy and protected. Just wash your fave (I use a Mia) put it on, and you are good to go.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look great for daytime!</li>
    <li> The problem with Neocutis packaging is amply documented in customer reviews for the best products. You can&#x27;t see what is left and if you pull the pump apart, you will find more product that you can use (but is not available via pump). The other issue I discovered is that even when I (religiously) replace the cap, 2 days later, I lose some product due to hardening in pump&#x27;s pour mechanism. In both of these issues, small amounts are involved but this is not a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, being advised to reapply after 2 hours concerns me for its longevity in protecting the skin. I have protected my skin for my life, have very little photo-damage. But unless I am exercising, I really don&#x27;t want to re-app every 2 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, I am a true believer in the PSP formulations of Neocutis and their products are very helpful to the aging process.</li>
    <li> Went to have a skin proceedure done. Dr. suggested I get a face cream that had an SPF in it.  Bought this at her practice.  Get home and find out that she&#x27;s marked it up 50%!!!!  And that&#x27;s off of what I would pay for it!  Anyway, the product is good.  It doesn&#x27;t have a perfumy smell, does it&#x27;s job relative to SPF factor.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am on my 5th bottle. FYI - they changed the packing on this product. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but since it&#x27;s my only high end indulgence, I will continue to buy this until I can find an equal less expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Does not make your face look ghostly with the added sunscreen.  Leaves skin feeling moisturized without being greasy</li>
    <li> My daughter, plastic surgeon, brought me back a sample of this  from a conference. I love it. In just days I could see the difference.  She told me I would only be able to buy it from her office. She was wrong. I found it on amazon. It is smooth and light has all those great ingredients the plastic surgeons love and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion itself, however it upon delivery it felt like there wasn&#x27;t much in the container. It also clumps and I constantly removing dried lotion before I can pump out any fresh lotion. It also never seems to pump successfully on the first try... Kind of bummed.</li>
    <li> It is moisturizing but I do not like the scent.  It smells awful.</li>
    <li> Not enuf moisturiser - my dr recommended. Since I have found the Neocutis face BALM which is PERFECT as day cream. I wanted to use this cream up- but it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me- I used for 3 months. I felt no Benifit. -  I&#x27;m 57</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily moisturizer for several years now and it is wonderful!  I love that it has SPS-30 so once I put it on, I am not adding layers to get sun protection.</li>
    <li> Great product !!!I I have very sensitive skin,and,I&#x27;m not braking out from it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen ever. It makes my skin glowy and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, and the best part is, it works! I put it to the test when I was in direct midday sun for several hours and I did not burn or tan at all. I don&#x27;t think this would be great for oily skin as it is very creamy and moisturizing. But it&#x27;s perfect for dry skin! It is tinted and does not cause any whitening. The tint level is about NC20, it blends in really well and you can&#x27;t see it at all. I am NC15 but this blends like a dream. Love it and just wish it weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  I have tried them all- with and without zinc oxide.  Neocutis Journee glides on like a dream and soothes as it protects.  No visible hint of the zinc in pores.  AND, as I only wash my face as needed (I know, eww), there are many nights the sunscreen stays on. My skin remains clear and clean and FLAWLESS. THERE&#x27;S MORE; since it is used sparingly, it is economical!  Good grief...</li>
    <li> not worth the money, not satisfied with this neocutis product, haveused others that were great. this one has color and comes off onmy towels and when i sweat it runs,was told it would dry clear. not happening.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product.  I have used other Neocutis products before and liked them.  but this product is not good.  after applying it, the brown tint &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; up on the skin.  so, there are specks of brown or tinted product all over the face that looks like dirt.  the product is also very heavy.  I will not purchase this product again and will return it.</li>
    <li> This is the best day moisturizer/primer I have ever used.  It makes my skin look so smooth and yet it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or oiliness.  I have combo skin and it seems like everything breaks me out, but this doesn&#x27;t!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, but it&#x27;s way too expensive and it goes fast</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and being in Louisiana my dermatologist sales this product! It is amazing, trust me, but this price is even better!  It is the best, and I have tried them all! I also use the eye cream , and it totally has saved the bags and wrinkles that are very common in my family!</li>
    <li> Great product but quite expensive this brand name .</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the Neocutis serum I purchased that I loved and was so disappointed with this product. It goes on smooth but leaves a tacky film on my face I couldn&#x27;t get past.  It also left my face looking very wrinkley once I used foundation with it.  If you are looking for a high quality day cream with spf 30, try the Prevage day cream with spf 30.  It is a better value for your money that moisturizes beautifully and works well with foundation.</li>
    <li> great product for women that want sunscreen with a tint of color!  highly recommend yhis product for all women who want to&lt;br /&gt;take care of there skin.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, but you get a hard piece every day at the end of the pump, even if you totally clean it off every time you use it. I assume we are wasting a lot with that clump every day.  The hard clump will not spread on your skin no matter what you do.  The old bottle was a lot better, no clumps, and you could see when to order more.</li>
    <li> I apply this over the day cream sold by this same company.  If I don&#x27;t, it feels sticky!  I think it is an expensive way to have to use this product.  I gave it 4 stars because it does work great!  I was in the sun at a B-B-Q a couple weeks ago and was really surprised to see I didn&#x27;t get burned!  I had a small area by my hairline that didn&#x27;t get this on it and it was quite burnt and red.  It really does stay on all day too, even when hot and sweaty.  It is an amazing product as far as sunscreen goes.  I wish it had a bit more coverage, and I wish I could apply it on bare skin.  This product line is the absolute best quality I have ever used and my skin is thanking me for it!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  probably won&#x27;t buy again  Had been rx by a dermatologist as one of the better products on the market.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer with SPF of 30. Have noticed a slight improvement in skin texture for the good. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream so much.  My dermatologist office turned me onto it a few years ago and then I continued to purchase it for cheaper wherever I could!  I have fair, sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin or my under eye area. If it was half the price I could give it 5 stars, but I really can&#x27;t handle the price and as much as I love it-I am searching for a cheaper replacement. (because I cannot give up my expensive favorite nighttime cream-Aveda Tourmaline!)[[ASIN:B000H74KFW Aveda Tourmaline Charged Hydrating Cream 1.7oz./50ml]]</li>
    <li> I use Retin-A, and it took awhile to find a product that I can use by day without upsetting my skin.  The combination of Retin-A by night &amp; Neocutis Journee etc with SPF 30 by day has my skin looking great.  I haven&#x27;t had any charming old-age cystic acne breakouts since I started using it, and I get nothing but compliments on my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t ball up under make-up, so there&#x27;s another plus.  I recently went to Australia for their summer and it fully protected my face - no sun got through.  Phew!  I can&#x27;t ask for anything more than what this winning combo does for my skin. Neocutis Journee etc provides moisture, protection, smoothing, and a little bit of a luminous effect to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s different (I have dryish, light olive skin); I hope this was somehow helpful and it works out as well for you as it does for me. I feel like I&#x27;ve found my skincare system and I don&#x27;t have to try a bunch of other stuff; the number of choices out there can be totally overwhelming!</li>
    <li> Journee was recommended to my by my skincare professional. They sell this in the doctors office with a huge markup, so I was excited to find this through Amazon. I get compliments on my skin all the time now and I can definitely tell a difference. You get what you pay for sometimes with products ... Just the matter of finding which ones are actually worth the money. This is definitely a great find!</li>
    <li> It does help with sun protection, have to wait a little before applying foundation, and it helps skin look better after wearing it over night.</li>
    <li> Love this non-greasy cream that flows on easily and adds a glow to my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for several years and it truly has made a difference in my skins appearance.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. This will be my go-to source from now forward. Shipped quickly and received safely.</li>
    <li> I started to used this product for the past 6 months because I have severe acne and it has help me healed my acne scars..</li>
    <li> Neocutis Journee was recommended by my Dermatologist. Her office sells it, but at a much higher price. Great sunscreen, nice tint, and younger looking skin since I started using these products. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this day cream. Provides great sunscreen and treats my skin at the same time. Non oily and is a good base under makeup. Does not cause me to shine up during the day. My skin is softer since I started to use this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of facial products and the Neocutis is by far the best product on the market</li>
    <li> Not sure yet how I like it. I may just stick with the non-tinted ones. Never-the-less, the quality is good and the shipping fast.</li>
    <li> For those of you who are pro life this product contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It may look like a tinted moisturizer but it leaves no color what so ever on my face.....don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer but personally I&#x27;d recommend you purchase the same one w/o the &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; that&#x27;s $13 less a bottle. If it helps w/seeing if the color may show up on you my skin tone is light in the winter.....so perhaps if you&#x27;re fair colored it may give you some coloring? My hubby has been using it as well (he&#x27;s medium) &amp; he just thought it looked tinted as it didn&#x27;t desposit any color on his face. As far as the anti-aging aspect of this cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now &amp; not noticed any difference from when I was using Obagi. One thing I like about this product it that it is in a clear pump dispenser so you can tell when the product is getting low/needs to be replaced (unlike their eye cream pump dispenser (see my other review) which is in a solid white tube). I did just order &amp; start using Bioderma Photoderm MAX Tinted Cream SPF 50+ /UVA 38 two weeks ago &amp; have to tell you that I LOVE IT! It is truly a moisturizer w/an SPF &amp; is tinted! As I mentioned I&#x27;m light in the winter &amp; more light-to-medium in the summer &amp; I think this lotion will make the cross over just fine. I&#x27;ve developed adult acne over the years &amp; this past year my forhead is an oil slick a few after washing &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m not as oily w/this product (Bioderma) &amp; I have that nice shear tint to boot!</li>
    <li> This and BioCream were recommended by my doctor for a number of reasons. Other than being very expensive, I&#x27;ve had no problems with either one.</li>
    <li> Great day cream.  I have been using this product now for over 2 years and my face looks great.  I get compliments often and I attribute it to this product, primarily.</li>
