<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not like at all.  All bulbs do not light at same time...lit bulbs change according to lighting options i.e. night, daylight, indoor, etc. There is no on or off button....every time the mirror is used you must turn the knob that indicates the light settings to turn the mirror on and off.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter. She uses it every day!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stand straight enough (leans back) so I had to rig a different way to get it to be up straight enough to use comfortably.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t flourescent lighting. Also, I was replacing my 40 + year makeup mirror which tllted instead of spun.  It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I could have my old mirror. Bulb finally blew and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.</li>
    <li> The settings on this mirror are OFF, EVENING, HOME, OFFICE, and DAY. You would think that DAY would be really bright; but it&#x27;s not. I would rename them OFF, CANDLELIT DINNER, HOME IF YOUR HOUSE IS LIGHTED WITH A SINGLE KEROSENE LANTERN, OFFICE IF THERE&#x27;S A POWER OUTAGE, and finally, DAY AFTER A MAJOR VOLCANIC ERUPTION. Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that real daylight is full spectrum, meaning, it has yellows, blues, etc. -- all the colors, but these bulbs are only in the yellow range. This matters because when you are putting on make-up it&#x27;s best to put it on in the harshest light possible because well, you can only look better in more forgiving light. This mirror doesn&#x27;t allow you to do that because it only casts you in the most forgiving light (warm tones).</li>
    <li> Loved the magnification ...much better then my remmington. Only problem is it gets hot if you if you use it too long.</li>
    <li> This mirror was perfect for my make-up space in our bathroom, it has really helped in our small bathroom to have a mirror of my own!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the lighting.  Its not true.&lt;br /&gt;why should I write more when I don&#x27;t really like the way it projects.</li>
    <li> had one for over 15 years and when it went the lights were not accessible so I couldn&#x27;t replace them but guess what these are easy access which is great love it</li>
    <li> I have had this piece of JUNK appox. one month,it is a total piece of junk,waste of money.Can not see anything as it has a  yellow  appearing light,the wings are a waste.If I could have given it zero stars I would have.Wish I had not wasted $26.99.Do  not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> As far as the different types of lighting and the three panel mirrors, these are great.  The problem I have with this mirror, is that on my vanity table the back adjustment will not put the mirror&#x27;s height high enough for me to see my face.  I have had to put books under the mirror.  I would have preferred the movement of the main mirror to move up and down as apposed to side to side.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It really is a good product and for anyone wanting to use a make-up mirror this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I ordered this make up mirror thinking it would be similar to the one I had. I travel some with my job and the mirror cracked in my luggage on a flight. I have used a make up mirror for many years, since I was in highschool and I am 53 now. The lighting on this mirror was terrible. You could almost see better before you turned it on...really do not waste your money. I sent it back. The exchange was easy. I was thankful for that. I did find and old model \\&quot;clairol\\&quot; lighted make up mirror...works GREAT and I saw Remmington lighted mirrors also...I used to have one of those too.</li>
    <li> I love my new mirror. The lighting is perfect with different settings,it folds for storage and it is electric (no more searching for batteries). Conair did a great job incorporating everything into one mirror! Price is perfect!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I had a great Amazon experience - they shipped and then returned this mirror for no charge, which is much appreciated.  I returned it because the lighting is not only too weak - and i do  not have very high standards for the lighting, believe me, but also the way the bulbs are positioned is ridiculous.  They have brighter bulbs on the top half and dimmer ones on the bottom half, so you&#x27;re either top lit or bottom lit.  When i read the complaints about lighting, i never saw this mentioned, and i figured somewhat weak lighting wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Again, i&#x27;m not a professional that needs super high wattage or anything, but the way this is designed is flawed - it makes it difficutl to see clearly and put makeup on.</li>
    <li> This mirror has adjustable lighting for indoor, daylight,etc. It is easy to set up and to use. One disadvantage is that you have to turn past all settings to get to the most useful one. All but the brightest settings seem too dark to effectively apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these back when I was in high school.  Recently, I got tired of standing in my bathroom, in the poor lighting, to put on makeup so I set up a vanity in my bedroom and bought myself this mirror.  Love the 4 settings although I always start out with the Daytime setting, its the best.</li>
    <li> I owned this mirror 20 yrs ago and I loved it so much I wanted another. It is even better now.  I find the round makeup mirror with lights all around reflects in my pupil and makes it difficut to see.  Also my face looks strange.  I the clairol mirror you get a better reflection of yourself and can change the lighting  according to home, office daylight, etc.  When I am going out for the evening the lighting is so different from office lighting, that I need to use different eye makup and coverup.  Try it, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Leans back a but too far for my liking ..but still mice</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers before me, I was looking to replace a Clairol/Remington Mirror with flourescent bulbs.  This mirror does not come close in comparison.  Even at the brightest setting (daytime), it&#x27;s like putting on makeup by candlelight.  Not at all what I was looking for!  I am now on an ebay quest for the real thing!  Save your money and DON\\&quot;T buy this mirror!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought it anyway. It&#x27;s not enough to know the measurements of the mirror. You also have to understand that the mirror&#x27;s back brace sticks out substantially. From front to back, it takes up 9.5 inches of counter space. As well, if the angle is not quite right, the main mirror doesn&#x27;t swivel up to meet your face, it swivels side to side! I also understand reviewers who say the mirror is not bright enough. This would be true if the mirror were your main source of light. I have rearranged the whole bathroom to accomodate for its size, but now there are other issues we have to solve. May have to return it.</li>
    <li> very good mirror,good lighting</li>
    <li> I had another mirror that did not have the sides and I really preferred it.  There is something about the sides that distort your image in the mirror and the lights.  I like this style though as opposed to the new models.</li>
    <li> Although this mirror had some bad reviews I can&#x27;t say I agree.  The product was as advertised.  I am happy I bought it, it servers my purpose quite well.</li>
    <li> Good product and good company to order from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile.  All in all I like the mirror, but wish the brightest setting was much brighter.  After I finish applyng my makeup I always double check it in the sunlight and usually have to adjust my blush.  If the light was more like natural light I wouldn&#x27;t have to do this.</li>
    <li> very good product, i can see to do my makeup without my glasses, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the greatest for making up your face.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror....there is not much to say about this mirror only that the different light setting is very nice and useful. I use it at night to remove make up and apply my beauty products.</li>
    <li> When a similar make-up mirrow that I had had for years finally died on me last year, I went out searching for a replacement. I tried the new style oval ones. They were just awful. The mirror was too small and the lighting was depressing. Then I found this one. It&#x27;s wonderful. You get a decent sized front mirror and two side mirrors that are especially helpful to someone like me who is very myopic. The lighting somehow manages to be extremely flattering (which helps you feel better about yourself) while at the same time shows everything you need to see and possibly alter a bit.     I&#x27;m sorry about the reviewer who had a problem with the lights, but that was probably just something that went wrong with one mirror. Mine is a treasure and infinitely superior to the newer style ones out there today.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a total of maybe four times and the light bulbs are already going out. Other then that however great product</li>
    <li> Like the fold out side panels, great for eyebrow tweezing.  Four stage lighting is very nice.  Would definitely recommend product.</li>
    <li> I have one, my granddaughter has one, and now my other granddaughter wants one for Christmas. Mine has lasted for years and it&#x27;s a great light for any occasion.</li>
    <li> This thing..is definitely not worth the money. The light barely even reaches your face on any setting. It&#x27;s like a cheap play house vanity..only overpriced.</li>
    <li> for my wife.  she loves it and used it every day</li>
    <li> TURNS SIDE TO SIDE NOT UP AND DOWN WHICH MAKES YOU HAVE TO SIT RIGH ON TOP OF THE MIRROR</li>
    <li> Many women have great function for this set, so i thought best as gift to give them the best, Conair.</li>
    <li> This is the second one from Amazon.  The first was returned due to a distorted mirror image.  This one, the second, was lights out the second time I turned it on.  Conair quality control has gone down the tubes. I do not think anyone should buy this mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent gift for daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> This mirror is acceptable.  I was looking for a mirror with bright light for make-up application.  Even on its brightest setting it isn&#x27;t quite bright enough for my purposes.  I&#x27;ll probably end up buying another mirror and letting my daughter have this one.</li>
    <li> Not enough light in this mirror and the side panels do not stay in place without wedging.  Only reason I bought this item is because I couldn&#x27;t find a better one, like the old Clairol 3-way lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> Great Product purchased for the grandgirls. Super Customer Service and FAST Shipping. Would Buy Again and Recommend to all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like this make-up mirror.  It&#x27;s great for people that wear glasses.  The three panels and different lighting options are superior to the oval lighted mirrors.</li>
    <li> GAVE TO GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE SAID IT WAS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I sent this product back...I have owned make-up mirrors all my life and this one did not have light bulbs the full  length of the mirror.. it has two bulbs top and bottom. This makes for a blind spot and does not give enough light for you to see what you are doing....would not purchase this product ever again..thanks for letting me return it the next day...</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mirror with lighting b/c my bedroom, where I usually apply my make up is quite dark. Unfortunately this mirror is not what I searched for. It&#x27;s all the negative reviews sadly. The light is barely there. I have to keep overhead lighting, lamp, open window etc just to be able to see! I essentially wasted $25! I wanted to return this but they were not going to give me a full refund and were going to charge me for return shipping so I&#x27;m eating the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly recommend that you save your money and purchase a more expensive mirror. I&#x27;m thinking of buying one to attach to the wall of my bathroom like the ones I&#x27;ve seen in luxury hotels in Vegas.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Just returned this make-up mirror.  Unlike other reviewers I did not mind the lighting...seemed sufficient to me,however we do have alot of light in our bathroom already so maybe that helped.  I sent it back because of how easily or loosely it swiveled...the air from the blow dryer...a slight bump...sometimes for now apparent reason the mirror would just swivel and it always landed on the magnified side...can&#x27;t tell you how frustrating that was! Trying a diffferent kind now...hope it&#x27;s better than this one was!</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror is Awesome!  I ordered a different brand (J) and had to send it back because the mirror was very distorted. This is a winner!  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK The older ones were better but you can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> This mirror is Amazing! It is just perfect, because it gets all of the right angles for your makeup, to anyting else! I would highly recomenned this mirror!</li>
    <li> Very small - not as presented</li>
    <li> This mirror is very useful. I am able to put on my makeup and do my hair and my husband is able to shave and groom his beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> Good but wished it was a little more brighter.</li>
    <li> After years with my similar style Remington and Clairol mirrors, I assumed this mirror would be the same.  I expected the same fluorescent long bulbs that the others had but, instead, this comes with little bulbs that give off very little light.  Who ever made the decision to use these bulbs instead of the florescent strip type bulbs should be FIRED.  This shouldn&#x27;t even get one star.  I returned this for a refund immediately.</li>
    <li> My old Clairol make up mirror stopped working after fifteen years of faithful service.  This product&#x27;s mirror is much smaller, has a back lean when opened that forces you to hold mirror with one hand as you apply make-up with the other.  The lighting settings are all dark, as if you are applying make-up by candle light.  I went to ebay to purchase a Clairol &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; mirror, donated Conair to charity.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00066YC5W Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light Settings]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror was the bomb when I had it back in the day of my teens - I loved it. I just purchased it and am sadly disappointed by the lighting quality as even though it has several settings it&#x27;s missing the one you can truly get a nice bright view to put on your makeup. I don&#x27;t remember the lighting being so dark :( so now I&#x27;m shopping for something better without having to redo the lighting in my room. The quality of the product is sturdy and may do better in a highly lit room but not everyone lives in a department store setting lol. Anyway good luck if you choose this product but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for a real style light ie like you have in your bathrooms or if you would like to have bright light. It really is odd lighting colors.</li>
    <li> Everything asked expected. Great product/ great seller</li>
    <li> I bought one for my niece and had to have one for myself.  The lighting is outstanding and I particularly like the three panel feature since it reflects the light more evenly.  Careful, it gets hot- wouldn&#x27;t leave it on unattended.  I shopped around for this mirror and found it cheapest on Amazon, especially with free shipping.</li>
    <li> Foolishly kept it, even though it doesn&#x27;t provide enough light or ability to view back of hairstyle. Disappointing purchase for me.</li>
    <li> The lighting on this mirror is insufficient even on the brightest setting. It has four small light bulbs, two blue and two white. The older lighted makeup mirrors used two elongated fluorescent bulbs which provided much brighter light. I thought it was a bargain at 21.99, but then I had to buy a desk lamp to place next to it to supplement the lighting, so it turned out to be no bargain after all. The style, the mirrors, and the magnification are good... but I consider the lighting the most important feature of a lighted make up mirror.  So to me, it is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> The lighting is very disappointing and dim, compared to the previous lighted makeup mirror that I had, but I did not have time to return it before taking it on a trip.  I would definitely have returned it.  The lighting is very dim.</li>
    <li> I had one of these mirrors when I was in high school. I was shocked to find out they still made them... I got this as a temporary replacement to my vanity. It worked just fine, when I replace the mirror I put it in the attic... Will be a good gift for a niece or other young girl.  I never really counted on the different light settings as they are never even close- I just like having the light that close.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the one I had over 40 years ago during high school. Now my daughter in laws are enjoying theirs</li>
    <li> product was shipped really fast and accurate,..the mirror is great I just bought brighter bulbs than the ones included and it is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Will replace with this same item if it ever breaks.</li>
    <li> Received quickly,  brand new in box,  not damaged.  technically this should be 5 star  but  the light was not as bright as I hoped however, i love the mirror due to a cover over the mirror  section for protection.</li>
    <li> Light is awful! Its price is not worth.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Love that i can put on makeup without my glasses on and can see what i&#x27;m doing.  Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product,we found it to be as advertised.The clarity and lighting of the mirror is superb much nicer than i have purchased before.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the absolute worst mirror on the market.  30 years ago I purchased a Clairol brand, which in my opinion, set the bar so high no one has been able to match it. I had that mirror for years, used it every day, replaced the bulbs only twice in all those years before it gave out.  This Conair mirror has FOUR TINY EXTRA HOT  useless bulbs that no matter what setting you have it on, are so dim why bother using it. These bulbs make you look yellow. You have to be 4 inches from the mirror to even get light on your face.  The middle mirror does not hold the position but automatically returns to center.  You have to hold it in place, and its a cheap mirror with distortion  The Jerdon that I had lasted  ONLY ONE YEAR, had much  better light  than the Conair, but was a disposable $40.00 mirror.  It was labeled, &amp;#34;No Bulb Replacement&amp;#34;. There was no way to get it open without destroying it. Another poorly made product. More of my money thrown in the trash. I&#x27;m returning this Conair mirror.</li>
    <li> I have owned lighted makeup mirrors by Conair.  Here are the problems I encountered with this product.    1) After using for a short time the product gets hot.    2) It is difficult to open the panels that encase the mirror.      3) The lighting options offered are quite dim and definitely do not provide adequate light for applying makeup.     4) The cord is too short.</li>
    <li> My old lighted make up mirro broke right before Christmas and I was very surprised how quickly my order arrived.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the new mirror</li>
    <li> Thanks.... I love it. It is very well made and I was having a hard time trying find one in the stores. I really love it!!! All I can say is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> This is just what my wife wanted. I was going to surprise her with a much more expensive unit, then thought I should ask her first. I am glad I did. She was touched that I would spend the money, but all she wanted was this one. She is very pleased, and I have more money in my pocket.  Guys, let the ladies decide what they really like.</li>
    <li> Personallythe light is too yellow and not bright enough.  If there is someway to brighten the lights other than the buttons on the front, I&#x27;d like to know.</li>
    <li> Applying my make up.  Perfect size.  Lights are good.  Love being able to close the mirror.  With this mirror I can correctly apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror; love the different light settings.  I ironically got two of these exact mirrors for Christmas so I took one to the office and keep the other at home.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Jerdon three panel mirror that had pooped out after less than a year. To be fair, I had my previous Jerdon mirror for about three years, so maybe I just got a dud. Anyway, I decided to try this mirror, and was very disappointed. The lighting is harsh, and none of the settings looks at all natural. The middle mirror swivels from side to side;I prefer the up and down swivel of the Jerdon. I ended up giving this to my daughter and ordering another Jerdon. I would not re-order this product.</li>
    <li> My old make-up mirror broke, so I needed to replace it.  After seeing the description of this one, I was impressed with the magnification, because not all make up mirrors have this amount of magnification and the three panels is just another bonus.  The lighting is terrific.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just as advertised.  It is made well, and functions well also.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because the electrical cord needs to be longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a replacement gift for a similar product that was nearing the end of its useful life (20 plus years). The old unit had fluorescent tubes as a light source.  The new unit had four very small incandescent bulbs.     Use of the new unit was straight forward. However selecting any light mode other than \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; turned on only two of the four bulbs which in addition to producing a very dim light, produced shadows on the face as makeup was being applied.  Also, this unit did not have an electrical outlet on the front panel that was very convenient on the old product.  There are better products out there, especially those with fluorescent tubes as the light source.</li>
    <li> I get more light from my e-cig... seriously. I&#x27;m returning this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I, don&#x27;t think I could make it without my Conair mirror, use the mirror every day. I, have owned mine for years, the lights blew out one time, just order some replacement lights and used it until I, just wore it completely out. I, just order another to take its place. LOVE,LOVE&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this light.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me this mirror as a gift, and I can&#x27;t tell if my friend was caring about me or jerking me around for giving it to me ( no really if was a kind jester)&lt;br /&gt;Now about this mirror. It has good points such as:&lt;br /&gt;1. Having 3 panels of mirror but you have create a funhouse mirror effect to see the sides of your face in the side mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;2. The replacement bulbs are a headache&lt;br /&gt;  A. Very hard to find&lt;br /&gt;  B. Must order by phone with Conair and they are not cheap&lt;br /&gt;  C. The bulbs are described as 20 watts bulbs however the warning label inside the bulb&#x27;s housing states to only replace with 10 watts bulbs&lt;br /&gt;  ( I looked all over the web, the closest bulb to a 10 watt 120 volt bulb are Christmas/ night- light bulbs and they are 7 watts max)&lt;br /&gt;3. the light bulbs gets hot very fast once it is turned on, there is no safety backing behind these bulbs to stop the plastic area behind the bulb from melting or burning.&lt;br /&gt;4. also the small vented area behind bulbs does not have a great  ventilating design. It would take a small fan behind the mirror to force air inside to cool it down.&lt;br /&gt;Now how is the bomb...&lt;br /&gt;The lights are dim, you will need another light source to get the a descent lighting need for your personal applications with this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Just  to think our lighting future is changing all over U.S., incandescent bulbs will be phased out by 2016, I guess Conair knew about when making this mirror because the \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; part in not well made...&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/14&lt;br /&gt;I removed the 2 white bulbs that came with this mirror and replaced them with the...[[ASIN:B0072COEDI Zadro 20 Watt Replacement Light Bulb for Zadro Vanity Mirrors Model No. FB20RTP]]  after removing the blue paint from the bulbs as suggested by customers here on Amazon. This made the lighting much brighter. Also I removed 1/2 of the air vent panel to each bulbs, they broke off very easily with care, now the mirror area where the bulbs are 50% cooler. I love the mirror now. I would upgrade the rating to 4 stars if I could...ror now. I would upgrade the rating to 4 stars if I could...</li>
    <li> On time and works very well. Gave it to my mom for a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  YES!  The  [[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon makeup mirror]] is perfect!  Follow the link to buy that mirror instead of this awful Conair one.  For those needing a lighted makeup mirror with mirrored side panels, this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.  I bought mine at a local big beauty store thinking it was the same as the one I was replacing.  Nope.  Shorter: Though I really needed a makeup mirror for lighting, etc., I ended up using my bathroom mirror [ugh!] over using this Conair mirror because the light was better.  Really.  Unfortunately, at every type of local store selling any kind of beauty stuff, the only brand they carry now is this awful Conair model.  So here I am at Amazon, ordering the [[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification, White Finish]]  and hoping it is similar to my old mirror.  *Fingers Crossed*  Longer:  First off, the center mirror does not lean back and forth (North-South) when you spin it. This Conair mirror spins from side to side (East-West), a huge flaw in design.  On my old mirror one could lean the mirror to get better angles; Forward to do eyeliner, and back to do foundation around the jawline without getting closer to the lights. If this is not a dealbreaker for you, point number two might be:  Second: The lights are TERRIBLE!!!!  Let me say that again T E R R I B L E!  In the different modes the lights are only on at the top, then only the bottom, then, eventually, all of them are on, but with both blue and yellow tint at the same time. Blue at the top of your face, yellow at the bottom.  Whaaat??  Exactly.  The COLOR of the light, and the AMOUNT OF ILLUMINATION is AWFUL!  The lights were so bad it was returned within two days.  Third:  The mirror doors did not stay in place.  They were loose on the hinges, maing you can&#x27;t get a good angle to look at the sides of your face and hair.  I couldn&#x27;t use the Conair mirror and ended up doing my makeup in the bathroom [ugh] where the light wassomewhat better.</li>
    <li> Simply put, it is an incredible item for one to have, and takes the burden off of make-up and plucking, and electrolysis needs.</li>
    <li> Just look at yourself in just the right light!!!!I love it!!Change the light to just the right look you want!!</li>
    <li> THE VALUE OF THE MAKE-UP MIRROR IS OUTSTANDING, BUT IT MORE THAN MET MY EXPECTATIONS.  I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT HAS DIFFERENT LIGHT SETTINGS AND THE 3-WAY IS HELPFUL WHEN APPLYING MAKEUP.</li>
    <li> The center mirror is to small for me.  I would rather have a wider mirror with no side mirrors.  I will know better when I need&lt;br /&gt;to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter both have this product, bought a second one to stop the fighting over the first one. That leads me to believe it works well.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the type of mirror I was looking for and I really do enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Had it for 2 weeks and the 2 clear light bulbs have already burned out. Replaced the same brand my wife had for 15 years. Never had a bulb problem with her old one! Now I get to order some replacement bulbs.....UPDATE...contacted Amazon, they shipped a new unit at no charge, just had to return the first one with burned out bulbs!</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could see to put makeup on. well even on the brightest setting its almost like being in candle light. The bulbs seem yellow no matter what setting you use sorry to say but this is going back :(</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my 13 yr old.  She wants to be a make up artist and has been practicing on herself and her sisters... This mirror helps her see the make up in different light and its great for her portfolio... Love it.</li>
    <li> Older models of this light were made with very bright fluorescent lights and a deflector to create different lighting options.  This model has a couple bulbs on each side which turned on singly or together to create the different lighting selections.  Unfortunately, the distribution and the brightness of the new light does not come close to the older model.  It cast shadows everywhere - so what&#x27;s the point.</li>
    <li> I have the Jerdon Tri-Fold mirror at home and am very happy with it, but I ordered this Conair mirror to keep at my friend&#x27;s house so I wouldn&#x27;t have to lug my Jerdon along every time I visited.  I ordered it in a hurry and neglected to read the customer reviews.  It looked about the same as the Jerdon, it was a few bucks cheaper, and I remembered my Conair from the 1980s being excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, I was colosally disappointed!  Every light setting is just a slightly different murkiness of orange, and none of them is anywhere near bright enough.  (I prefer the brightest blue-tinted \\&quot;Day\\&quot; setting on my Jerdon.)  I returned the Conair and had to eat $5 in shipping costs.  I&#x27;m ordering the Jerdon instead.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I slightly prefer the left-to-right spin on the center mirror as compared to the top-to-bottom spin on the Jerdon.</li>
    <li> I initially bought a more expensive conair makeup mirror for $60, because I liked the attractive metal finish, but the light it provided was minimal at best - like putting makeup on by candlelight. So I bought this mirror. I had owned one years ago, and when I went to buy one this time around I figured that if this mirror worked great at $20, then the $60 one would be amazing. Wrong! I&#x27;m sticking with this less expensive mirror - the plastic may not look as nice as the metal ones, but the light it provides is much better!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because my Mom had one like it when I was a kid.  She used it whenever she put on make-up and now I do the same.  It comes with 4 settings: evening, home, office, and home.  I have had it for about 5 years, without any problems.  It&#x27;s a good product at a good price!</li>
    <li> If you apply your makeup in a dim room, this lighted mirror will probably not solve your problem. However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting an ultra-bright light and what the mirror offers with the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting option suits my needs. Plus, the view is much larger than a lot of other mirrors - now I can actually see from the top of my head to my neck! Also, the middle mirror section can be flipped for normal or magnified reflections. You can not get a better makeup mirror for the money - I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Perfect! It came just as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror is perfect. Pefect size and lights are bright. I recommend this item to anyone that wants a good light!</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror is a good product for the value.&lt;br /&gt;  It could be brighter, but it it still worth the value.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter is a freshman in college. She really loves this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see a thing in this \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; mirror--all of the settings, including Daylight, are so dim as to be virtually useless. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> This came quickly - thank you!  It&#x27;s exactly what was ordered.  Good quality, great price.  My daughter loves this product.  Thank you again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror but the only thing I wish it was tilt. Obviously you can tilt the entire piece but I wish the mirror itself would tilt. A little annoying that it doesn&#x27;t - hence my 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> Good product. I just wish the lighting was brighter but other than that I love the mirror.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my 94 year old mother and it is exactly what she wanted to help her \\&quot;put on her face\\&quot;.  She has not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for years.  Recently my daughters friend saw it, used it and wanted one for herself.  My daughter bought it for her for Christmas and now we can both love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my daughter after purchasing the same make at a big box retailer and discovered that Amazon had it for $11.00 cheaper!  Needless to say, the more expensive one was returned ASAP!!  It is a great mirror with side panels and 4 light settings.  I find myself sneaking into her room to use it every once in awhile!</li>
    <li> this was for my 15 yr old daughter.  she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;she wears glasses so the magnify is a great feature.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous review that this mirror has bad lighting. I returned it for a refund. I then found the Jilbere mirror in the same style which does have real bright lighting and I am happy with it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Conair.</li>
    <li> Great way to put on make-up in any light.</li>
    <li> Not much magnification &amp; can&#x27;t tilt forward</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter in her college dorm room.  It could not stand up to the girls.</li>
    <li> The quality is good, but the lighting is not as bright as the old one, this one looks like an incandescent light bulb, and the old one was more of a florescent light, which was brighter. other than that, I like the mirror alot.</li>
    <li> OK. The light wasn&#x27;t as bright as I Thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a Clairol True-to-Light make up mirror with this one. This Conair one is uesless. You might as well just buy a regular mirror with no lights. The bulbs are dim to say the least. Don&#x27;t waste your time.  Unfortunately the Clairol one is no longer made, but I would suggest looking for something similar that contains two 6w or higher flourescent bulbs. This Conair one has two tiny bulbs that are about as bright as a christmas bulb.</li>
    <li> The light is very poor on this mirror. I would not recommend it. The mirror itself is nice but I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they tested it for lighting. Even the \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; setting is more like lighting in a nightclub.</li>
    <li> My very first make-up mirror decades ago was a Conair.  Through the years, I&#x27;ve probably had more than a half-dozen different types and brands.  And here I am, back with Conair.  This manufacturer consistently makes good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just one problem with the makeup mirror--and it&#x27;s not the fault of the company.  As I get older, I need a more powerful magnification.  A 10x would be perfect for me.  Alas, after days of searching both online and by foot, I found that what I want (tri-fold, moveable, with various light settings) does not exist.  (Conair, are you reading this and taking note?)  The mirror has two sides.  One is a regular one with no magnification and the reverse side is 5x magnification.  Since the mirror is large enough, I placed a small, round 10x mirror with suction cups onto it.  It&#x27;s not ideal but, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of light settings allows me to apply the correct amount of makeup for a particular place.  For example, in a work environment, the greenish (florescent) lighting is accurate.  There&#x27;s also &#x27;Home&#x27;, &#x27;Day&#x27;, and &#x27;Evening&#x27;, too.  The knob in the front of the mirror lets you dial the correct light.  The light emanates from the full-length  panels alongside the mirror.  If the knob were a button, it would be easier to change the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror can be adjusted to many positions, from upright to tilting backwards.  (Think of shifting the back of a chaise lounge into place.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Conair would only make a small and lightweight travel version, I&#x27;d buy it!</li>
    <li> Had this very brand for 20 years until I dropped it. I am sure this new one will take me into the next phase of my life where I can no longer apply makeup ... some 20 years from now. Replacement bulbs easy and cheap to obtain from Conair. Super-fast delivery.</li>
    <li> lighted make up mirrors are hugely helpful but it seems all the mirrors are kind of small. I do like this Conair very much and its one of the few out there that was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror.  Since I wear glasses and cannot see without them, putting on makeup was a challenge.  This Conair makeup mirror solved the problem. &lt;br /&gt;I especially like the different light settings.  I would buy it again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my mother for Christmas to replace an older version.  She complainted that it had yellow lightbulbs in it and there were less lightbulbs than her previous mirror.  She was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Lighting was ok , but not great. Decided to keep it anyhow. After 2 months of using it for 15 minutes a day , a bulb already burned out. I figured not a big deal , so I called Conair Customer Service. They were not helpful at all, I thought they were kind of rude. Their solution was for me to purchase new bulbs. It wasn&#x27;t the cost, but the principal of the thing. They wanted to charge me for the bulbs. Which I found unacceptable. A 2 month old item should still work properly. I am buying another brand today!</li>
    <li> After approx 15+ years I had to replace the old one. Hope I get as many years on this one!!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000PU70CG Conair TM7L Illumina Collection Two Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror - White]]    This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was really reasonable.  I love the different lighting feature so you can see your makeup in just the right light.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mirror and I love it too, it got her out of my bathroom and now she can use this to apply her makeup for school!  It is a great product, the different settings are perfect.  Definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I find this product to be perfect for me.  I previously purchased one double the price and absolutely hated it.  Returned and order the Conair.  This one did the trick.  Also, happy with the 3 panel function.  A perfect fit all in all!!</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter loves this mirror! This is the perfect gift for any young woman. It&#x27;s a great product that folds away nicely. - Not that she does..... :)</li>
    <li> All good except the side doors aren&#x27;t tight enough. They won&#x27;t stay where I place them, they fall all the way open</li>
    <li> All the lighting styles work perfectly and it&#x27;s a perfect addition to the vanity I have hidden in my linen closet in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Really bad mirror, ?I need  today more but it&#x27;s awkward  the angle ...it tips side to side&amp; has a clumsy notched contraption to get the correct angle.  It&#x27;s nice looking as far as counter decoration goes. Just not as well engineered as the one I was replacing</li>
    <li> The lights on this or way to gym I thought they were LED lights and they are not they are yellow lights which do not light up I have to go outside to put my makeup on now until I either want to return this item or to get another one. Because my other makeup mirror lights went out in broke and I thought that this one had the bright lights and it does not. Very very very dim and it also gets very very very hot after using it for like 1 minute. It takes a lot longer than one minute to put your makeup on. Lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s looks great. Nice and sturdy. Big enough. The five times magnifying mirror is almost to much. But, the lights are very small wattage and are dim. Other than needing a separate light source this is a great mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my two grandaughters 12 &amp; 13, they just love it.  They love the lights and the side mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;And I loved the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t have much light when applying make up so when my husband came up with this mirror as a solution I was all for it. This mirror is awesome.</li>
    <li> I got this same exact mirror about 5 years ago and when I moved I somehow lost it. I&#x27;d been wanting to replace it for about a year but never got around to it. :( so I went to Walmart to buy another one and the ones that they had in stock did not have the folding doors like this one and my old one did. So I ordered it here. I love this mirror, it worked great several years ago and it works great now! at walmart the one without the doors was $28 and here it was only a dollar more with free shipping, so I feel that I got a great deal! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re much improved since I was a teenager! Helps this old woman be able to see how to put her make-up on! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you seller!&lt;br /&gt;Can always depend on Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, the illumination is great with different settings. The middle mirror flips around for an magnified view. Great product</li>
    <li> This mirror was for my budding teenage daughter.  She is very happy with it and loves the different lights.  It looks very at home among the hair straightener and curling iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my wife and she said she loves it. I give this a three kiss and two hug award!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this mirror I sent it back. It was difficult to open to start with. No on/off switch just the lighting dial which was difficult to operate. Did not like the way the mirror swiveled.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mirror.  I wish it could set up a bit straighter, but the lighting selections are good and the mirrors are clear and nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my granddaughters birthday. I am now the world&#x27;s greatest grandmother. She loves it. At 17 she spends a lot of time in front of her Ilumina.</li>
    <li> Makeup mirror had very poor lighting. All four settings were to dark and did not distinguish from one setting to the next.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this item. It was exactly what I wanted. I use it every day. I especially like the lights that can be changed from office to evening make. I would order this item again.</li>
    <li> My mom couldn&#x27;t find this style makeup mirror at any retail store so she was very happy that I found one just like she wanted for less than $30. Five star product and a five star price.</li>
    <li> The light bulbs keep shorting out</li>
    <li> Great product, very helpful when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for quite some time now. I was really busy back then, so never got a chance to write a review. Within a week after buying this, one of the 4 lights went out. I was extremely disappointed, because this was a replacement for my older Conair mirror, which had served me strong and well for over 10 years, and I was heartbroken when it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of expectations for this one, and it fell flat. I never had a chance then to look into warranties, etc back then, so I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s my fault.  I will just assume that they would&#x27;ve provided good customer service had I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the fact that that light went out so fast really bothers me. I still use it now, a couple years later [haven&#x27;t gotten around to replacing it], and the other lights have not given me any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could very well be that I just had a defected one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have the money for a better one, then this one will work just fine. If you can afford $10 more, just spend the money. Conair IS a good brand, and like I said, I had another Conair mirror given to me for my 13th birthday that lasted until I was 24.</li>
    <li> Great Make-up mirror. !!!!</li>
    <li> Great cosmetic mirror. Love tweezing my brows with this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace one that I had for years. I like that you can change the light settings to be easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li> The mirror only swivels side to side instead of up and down, so trying to do mascara is ridiculous. Don&#x27;t buy this mirror.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to look like a clown, buy this mirror to let you put make up on properly. I had one a few years ago and it lasted for a long time. I decided to replace it because the old one was dropped. This mirror is a must for any lady out there who wears make up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She can now put her make-up on in her bedroom and no more waiting for the bathroom mirror. She said the lights are very nice and the size is perfect.</li>
    <li> i like the mirror and lighting is wonderful too, price makes this an excellent product to purchase and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have owned make-up mirrors forever, some lasted 10 or so more years but I guess those days are gone.  I purchased a Jerrdon Best Seller make-up mirror from Amazon a couple of years ago and it works very well, I found that the plastic part of the stand was very fragile and it broke while the mirror was still fairly new and had to use duct tape to hold the plastic stand to the mirror, now I noticed that the mirror has a foggy look to it already so I decided it was time for a new one, ordered the Conair but was worried about the lighting from the reviews that I read but figured I would see for myself.  Well, received the mirror, plugged it in and the left side light didn&#x27;t work at all and when I switched to different settings there was either no lights at all or one light at the top of the right side.  Obviously, it is defective and I am returning it to Amazon.  Just ordered from what I perceive as the lesser of two evils the Jerrdon make-up mirror, I guess the days of the 10 plus year old make-up mirror are over.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my mother in law. she says she loves it and it is great for doing your hair and makeup with.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted. I purchased this for my wife and it is exactly what she was looking for. Great product.</li>
    <li> Weak lighting, I could not see what I was doing so I had to return it.  Others complained of the same thing.  Otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> The lighting is good but the view from the mirror is terrible. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this mirror so much that I purchased a backup.  There are 4 mirrors - the back showing the highest magnification.  The different light settings are great for applying makeup for day and night.  Nice illumniation.  Sturdy build.  Great design. Love the 2 mirrors on the side to view the profile after doing my hair.</li>
    <li> The adjustable settings are great for doing my makeup. So glad I ordered this product! Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully packaged, arrived quickly  Lighting seems more than adequated and it is easy to set up and use.  I would recommend this product to anyone else who needed a nice make up mirror.</li>
    <li> love it. couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
    <li> the illumina two-sided mirror with with 3 panels is great,bought ot for my granddaughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> I got this for a present, but the product came fast and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and does exactly what we needed it to do.  For us the lights weren&#x27;t essential, just an added bonus so we don&#x27;t use them all that much.  My daughter uses this mirror to put in and take out her contacts so it works great for that.  It&#x27;s clearly not a $200 item judging from the materials and I don&#x27;t know for how long the lights will work but so far so good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap feeling, light weight, has a magnification side which is distorted but the non-magnified side is not distorted.  The lighting is not the worst I&#x27;ve seen but barely passable.  I haven&#x27;t decided if i&#x27;m going to return it or not.</li>
    <li> this is the one i love, i never thought i would find the same one i have, it lasts for years and years, the one i have is exactly the same one and the door broke off, thats all and i thought ok its time, and shocked as i was is how happy i am.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t do. It was too tall for my vanity. It was awkward and cheap plastic-y. Too bulky on my counter. The lighting wasn&#x27;t great. Just eh. I ended up buying a round mirror.</li>
    <li> You would have thought I handed my twin 15 year olf beauty guru daughters winning lottery tickets!  They both loved their mirrors, it really gives great lighting options and magnification as well as side views.  No more morning fights in our bathroom - mission accomplished!</li>
    <li> We got this mirror for our daughter for Christmas!  She absolutely loves it, says she can do her makeup to perfection now because she can see everything so well.  It folds up neatly and looks great on her desk.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to purchase a lighted mirror similar to the ones that were popular in the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s. This looks like those, but the lighting is different. In order to achieve the various light settings the light bulbs are on/off to create a darker or lighter look. So sometimes the top ones aren&#x27;t on, sometimes the bottom ones aren&#x27;t on, etc. This creates a really shadowed effect except for the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; setting which has all of the bulbs lit. I preferred the old version.</li>
    <li> My first mirror and I love it. Lighting is good for all types of places. A very good buy for me.</li>
    <li> Why don&#x27;t Conair and Jerdon get together and design the perfect lighted makeup mirror?  Jerdon has the light quality you want and the winged side mirrors stay put while Conair has the better magnifier mirror that doesn&#x27;t distort your face and the light bulbs are replaceable even if they are yellow-cast.  Jerdon bulbs are fixed but lifetime guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They love them.  They use them daily.  With having a stand on the back it works great and stands up good while sitting on the bed.</li>
    <li> One included light bulb didn&#x27;t work.  Replacement bulbs are difficult to insert.  Very poor lighting even with 4 bulbs.  I returned the item</li>
    <li> I thought this was the same as the original with the sliding pink/blue/green/clear choices over white bulbs. Why on earth ruin a perfect product? These incandescent bulbs cast a gold candle-ish kind of light. Honestly, it&#x27;s like doing makeup using the oven light for \\&quot;Evening\\&quot;, a naked 40 watt lamp on the floor without a shade for \\&quot;Home\\&quot;, a vehicle&#x27;s passenger vanity mirror with light for \\&quot;Office\\&quot; and the refrigerator light for \\&quot;Day\\&quot;... Anyone who does makeup has NONE of those light sources listed as favorites to do our makeup by except when there is absolutely nothing else! lol! I hope I can find the original version- the competitor&#x27;s company is pretty good, but their mirror spins up &amp; down, rather than left to right- which helps you get closer to the lights and the enlarging mirror doesn&#x27;t distort. What a shame about this inferior \\&quot;new\\&quot; model. Hopefully, the Original will make a return!</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed.  Best make-up mirror ever. I have had another mirror that was not as good.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used this when I was in high school, now at the age of 40 I use it again, and love it. I like it because for work I can use the lighting and know that I&#x27;m not wearing too much make up, yet change the lighting when I go out and know I&#x27;m set and look good.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  And at a very reasonable price, too.</li>
    <li> The lights aren&#x27;t as bright as I would have prefered, but there is one setting that will pass as bright enough.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Where I am I get very little sun light do this is prefect for me. It already showed me that the foundation I was using was way  too yellow for my face so I am happy</li>
    <li> I was tired of my makeup looking great in the bathroom, but seeing streaks when I double checked before walking into work. I use the day setting, &amp; it really does the trick.</li>
    <li> It works for what I need it to, it&#x27;s nothing special but it does it&#x27;s job. The lighting isn&#x27;t the best so I put a lamp behind it and use the lighting from both.</li>
    <li> Im a 40 year old mom and my daughter loves doing makeup so I thought a good Christmas present would be a makeup light, and I was right she loves it and, it has so many lighting shades so you can see if the makeup is pink/spoty or what not but love it!!!1</li>
    <li> My wife talked about getting a make-up mirror for a year and never did. So I seen this on sale on amazon and bought it. The wife just loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Even though there were several comments about the dim light, I bought it anyway, and it is very disappointing.  Lights too dim on all settings.</li>
    <li> Wife had one of these awhile back was given to her she loved it but hers broke. Thanks all works great she was glad to get another fast service have a G-Day.</li>
    <li> Good for putting on make-up!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it, she even thinks it&#x27;s better than her old one. She lives to do get make up and hair! This thing is obviously sturdy cause it took a good spill the other day and still looks and works like new</li>
    <li> The bulbs provided poor lighting.  The illumination was too localized within the side panels to give even lighting.  I could not see myself well in this mirror at all.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. Great value and is really bright.</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the one I bought back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s!  Perfect!  Not sure why people think it doesn&#x27;t have enough light. It basically hasn&#x27;t changed from the old Conair mirrors...which is great!</li>
    <li> My eyesight is for the birds. Unless I crawl up this close to the bathroom mirror, no way am I seeing anything...and in all honesty...even then I&#x27;m challenged. The magnification and illumination on this mirror is OUT OF THIS WORLD!</li>
    <li> Ok,,I love the 3 mirrors, I love that the mirror has lights, I love the size of the mirror., I love the settings (night, day, evening, etc) , I love that I can close it when not in use........The only thing I absolutely hate is that they made this mirror , when in the closest position on the back, it lays way too far back......I wish they had of put more notches on the back, so it could set in more positions....I am in a neck brace right now ( will be for about 16 more weeks), and even in the closest position, it is too layed back....I have to hold it with my hand or prop it up, or set upon blankets on my chair.........The only way this would work is for me to set upon a bar stool and look down into the mirror......It should have been made to stand up straighter.....Other than that (which is a big deal, I cannot see my face) I love it.....</li>
    <li> I am very please with this mirror ... my original one broke 29+ years ago and have been trying to get along without one ... this one was perfect for me ... very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My old one bit the dust and this is a great replacement</li>
    <li> Works well according to the boss (wife)</li>
    <li> Excellent... Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is something every vanity should have. Nice product. Not top of the line vanity lighting, but very useful for what it is.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected.  Poor lighting.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love my makeup mirror. There is several different types out there in the market but I really enjoy this one, since it has the extra mirrors on the side. I have had a Conair three panel makeup mirror for 30 years and in all that time only had to buy 3, and that is because I have taken them with me on trips and then dropped them by accident.  They really last and the different light settings really help you put on the right amount of makeup for day, night, or working in the office.  Love you Conair</li>
    <li> My first review.  Too bad it&#x27;s a bad one.  I had read all the reviews, looked at similar products and felt this one was the best one for my household.  Unfortunately the lights on one side did not work properly.  It was smaller than I thought, even though I was warned in the reviews about the size.  I still thought it sufficient, but with the lights not working I felt it was time to return it and start my search over again.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. Had a broken bulb unpon arriveal. Happy that I didn&#x27;t pay $90 for it.  I wish I could remember the name of the one I used 25 years ago. It  was awesom.</li>
    <li> it is a terrible deal.  The cord shorted out.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother- in-law she loved it!!</li>
    <li> This is a well-constructed make-up mirror, and silent (unlike the Jilbere model with a loud hum). I love the fact that the center mirror swivels left to right, instead up &amp; down - it&#x27;s reminiscent of the old Clairol make-up mirror that many of us grew up using. The other reviewers were correct in their assessment however -- the lights are too dim. There&#x27;s one bulb at the top and another at the bottom, with nothing in between. It&#x27;s like romantic mood lighting, even on the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; setting. Sadly, I had to return it.</li>
    <li> i was hesitant to buy this one or the other top rated brand but i have used conair for a lot of things for a long time so i&#x27;d give this a try. overall, i like it. the price is very reasonable too. it has 3 mirrors and the middle one rotates 360 to get a closer view of your face. what i didnt like is that there is no way to keep the middle mirror in place. lighting is ok but very yellow. rather have white light than the yellow. good buy overall.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. I have found that Amazon   has the best prices for what I shop for.[[ASIN:B00066YC5W Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light Settings]]I&#x27;m sure  my granddaughter will be very pleased with this gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The magnifying side of make up mirror is perfect for me because I need glasses to see up close now. Good quality product and price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife and she really loves it. the different light settings are really a great feature. i highly recommend this mirror. Also I received it in about 3 days, which was amazing, considering the holiday season.</li>
    <li> Lights were not bright enough for me.  The flip mirror flips from top to bottom and made the angle of the mirror unsteady to stay in position.  Sent unit back and replaced with Jerdon make up mirror which is 100% better.</li>
    <li> Make up mirror from Amazon.  My eyesight is not very good  and I feel this makeup mirror  does not have lighting  in right spots to create  light at the correct places to see what you want.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after a Jerdon tri-fold one that I had less than a year quit.  But I am not happy with the Conair.  The lighting is terrible, very yellow and dim in all settings.  The mirror swivels horizontially, not vertically, making adustments not an option.  The Jerdon swivels vertically, which makes it easy to adjust while using - tilt it for whatever you are doing. To turn the Conair on and off, the contrlo must be turned.  If you use anything but the nearest setting, this is annoying.  The Jerdon has an on/off switch, and the setting is a separate control.  I seldom change my setting, so for me this is more convenient.  Jerdon did immediately replace my mirror when I contacted them, and that is what I am now using.  I have always liked Conair products.  Don&#x27;t know what they were thinking with this one.</li>
    <li> Item purchased as present for my daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my husband and he sure has great taste as it is so easy to put on make-up now and with all the different settings I can use it anywhere there is a place to plug it in. I am handicapped and I can use it sitting down instead of trying to stand up and put on make-up or fix my hair.  Great Product.  We have never been disappointed with anything we get from Amazon and their customer service is the best in our book.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror for my wife to replace a different,  but similar unit from another manufacturer.  As the saying goes, \\&quot;A happy wife, makes for a happy life\\&quot;...  she is happy.  Units like these generally use two F6/T5-cw bulbs.  They are not a consumer replaceable item. These bulbs are available at Home Depot at $9.67 each or as I bought 2 at $1.50 each plus $4.95 S&amp;H from an Internet source.  Drilling out the 4 screw plugs and careful dis-assembly and it can be done by a mechanic. I replaced the bulbs because I found it offensive to trash the unit for blown out bulbs... in one year. Now my wife has two.  As long as you are not too Environmentally Green and don&#x27;t mind trashing these at one year because you can not replace the bulbs,  there is little question that these deliver value well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> G&#x27;daughter loved it!  If she has pimples, I would not be saying this, LOL!</li>
    <li> I always try to weigh the pros and cons when reading reviews.  The &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; reviews were spot on when discussing the lack of light.  Believe the reviews when it says that it wasn&#x27;t bright enough.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> one side of the mirror did not light up on the daytime setting and the other settings the bulbs were very dull.  Would not recommend this product.  Very disappointed with Conair.</li>
    <li> Great mirror but came with broken lights .. Disapointing</li>
    <li> I purchased this for when I visit my boyfriend, he doesn&#x27;t understand the necessity of a good mirror.  When traveling, i have to have this mirror because most hotels have fluorescent lighting, and that is impossible for applying make-up. The bulbs are 20W; replacements may be found on Conair&#x27;s website. It is a little heavy, so if you&#x27;re stationary, I recommend a wall-mounted mirror.  Otherwise, its a good product.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as bright as my previously owned mirror. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I have a teenaged girl spawn, and ONE bathroom.  Every damn morning, it is a fight to get in the bathroom so I can get ready for my job.  The one that pays the bills. The only reason we have a house at all. Still, I&#x27;m lucky to get 15 uninteruppted minutes in my bathroom, because, to quote the girl spawn, &amp;#34;it is the only room with nice light.&amp;#34; I bought her this mirror so she can have four different forms of light to make her already gorgeous face slightly transformed into a still gorgeous face in some room other than the one bathroom. She loves the mirror.  I love that I will be getting my bathroom back. maybe.</li>
    <li> I bought the mirror for my daughter and she loves it. I definitely recommend this mirror to help with there make up.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace the identical one that I had had for about 10 years.  The need to replace it came when i traveled and lost the little stand on the back.  This mirror serves its purpose and I love it.  I like that I can pack it and take it with me on short trips.&lt;br /&gt;I like the different light settings, though I will admit I usually just use the brightest setting.</li>
    <li> The four settings are OK.  But day should be a lot brighter.  Can barely see to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> My wife liked the mirror but it came broken when plugged in it will not light up this might not reflect all of the products but this review is for mine and that is how it came.</li>
    <li> I had a Clairol 3 panel mirror for 15 year and loved it.  The lighting on the Conair mirror is not bright enough at ANY setting</li>
    <li> I had a makeup mirror similar to this one however the off button started to work intermittently.  I finally dedided to find another, which turned out to be quite a project.  There aren&#x27;t many of these left to choose from.  I read many reviews of this type of mirror out there and found that many of these mirrors have dim lighting.  I was hoping for the best with this one but it does have dim lighting.  The only setting I find comfortable is the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; position.  The home and office are, for me, unusable.  The evening is also difficult but can be used if you are truly going to a very dimly lit place.  Everything works well and I hope that it will continue to,  if the one setting goes bad it will become useless to me.</li>
    <li> We purchased two of these for our twin daughters heading off to college. They work great and provide nice lighting to put on their makeup in the dorm room everyday. It does not seem to get hot easily and the size is great as it is just big enough but does not take up valuable desk space either. Reminds me of the mirror I took to college years ago.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stand out as much as I&#x27;d like it too so I have to prop it upon a box but overall works great</li>
    <li> Mirror isn&#x27;t adjustable up and down.........only goes side to side.  Lights seem off not very bright.  Not at all what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Lighted Makeup Mirror for years.  When one gets too worn out, I get another.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;m a 30-year old woman, with 20/20 vision, and I cannot see anything in this mirror.  The lights are non-existent.  I&#x27;m afraid to put on makeup in this light, because I may very well walk out the door and look like a clown.  I am 100% sure that any color I apply under this light will look ridiculous in natural light outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning my mirror, and my advice to anyone is - don&#x27;t buy it in the first place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally find this mirror. Had more than one over the last 35 years, and they&#x27;re a great bargain. I really like the side mirrors - they aid in grooming the side and chin areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;There may be some others out there for more money, but this one will do the job very nicely!</li>
    <li> This product was received with a bulb out!</li>
    <li> Not at all happy..Loved it when I was younger but realized that now that I&#x27;m older I can&#x27;t see a darn thing due to the yellowed covers over the lights and the color changers (daylight, home, office, &amp; evening) are just a distraction! It&#x27;s not listed here for me to review but I know I exchanged it for the Ottlite Natural Daylight Makeup Mirror. It doesn&#x27;t have the side mirrors but it&#x27;s reg sizing on the front and flips to 5X magnification.  I found with my aging eyes that this works best for me even though it does cost a little more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a replacement for a similar Conair model she had for years.  She&#x27;s happy with it, and as long as she&#x27;s happy...everybody&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> I had this exact same makeup mirror for years when she finally just gave up the ghost.  A fantastic product that&#x27;s reliable, and can really taking a beating after multiple state to state moves.</li>
    <li> This is the first item I have ever purchased through Amazon that I do not like. I wanted to send it back but was not sure how. The lighting is not what I thought it would be, and the angle adjustment for it sitting is not good.</li>
    <li> I liked it but the side light panels do not stay in play. the lights are fine, the covers are what fall out constantly. The regular mirror is fine, the magnifying mirror is great, but the side mirrors do not do much.  Liked the concept well, but again the older model was what I should have searched for.</li>
    <li> Item as described! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Just recvd my makeup mirror today. I love it! I like the different lighting  settings.</li>
    <li> It is a little bulky.</li>
    <li> The lighting is a bit dimmer than I expected, but it does the job. I do wish it was brighter.</li>
    <li> As someone who has to use the tweezers a lot, this mirror is amazing!  It has great light settings and the three mirrors are a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> Very good for applying makeup when you need glasses! Needs a better quality mirror though. You get what you pay for. It served my purpose</li>
    <li> I really like this product, however unfortunately it arrived with one broken bulb.  I sent an e-mail to Conair to find out of replacement would be covered under guarantee but to date have had no response.  Perhaps Amazon could assist me with this?&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively will Amazon replace the bulb?</li>
    <li> WOW now I can finally put my contacts in with Confidence!!!!</li>
    <li> When I turned it on my first thought was &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s all the light?&amp;#34;  There aren&#x27;t enough bulbs in this thing to light up properly.  As you can see in the picture there are only four bulbs.  I didn&#x27;t notice this when I first bought it.  Because of this, it doesn&#x27;t disperse the light as well as it should, and what few bulbs it does have are dim.</li>
    <li> I thought the light on this was awful! It is very yellow and not bright enough at all. Really changed the way my makeup looked. I&#x27;m returning this one and hopefully will find one similar to the old style that uses white light and filters to imitate different lighting situations.</li>
    <li> This mirror is pretty good, but I really only use the daytime setting, as the other settings do not have the best lighting.</li>
    <li> The three panel make-up mirror was exactly what I was looking for.  This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend for her birthday, and she had NO idea her eye makeup was so uneven, until she used this great mirror.  Now she always looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I returned this makeup mirror. The lighting was really bad. The lighting was so uneven. I returned it and purchased one with single tube lights on either side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this makeup mirror for years only because I couldn&#x27;t find a better alternative.  The lighting is bad.  I would love a recommendation for a brightly lit makeup mirror.  The lighting with this Conair is minimal but from my research, it&#x27;s about the best thing out there.  Disappointing.  Conair - please provide a better product!</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this item, and would definitely recommend it to anyone! Very good quality and everything on it works perfect!</li>
    <li> This lighted makeup mirror is my second conair.  My first was purchased about 30 years ago and was only being replaced because it got badly damaged during a move. In all that time I never had to replace any lights.  I believe that conair makes a great product and this conair was a good price compared to others that I found on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I miss on this product compared to my previous one is that you must turn the light level knob at each use to power on and get to the level you want.  My previous mirror had an on/off switch to power on.  You could set you prefered light level and leave it there and have it ready to use at a flick of a switch.  Also I liked the light levels better on my old conair.  It had specific shades for sunlight, lamp, florescent and evening.</li>
    <li> Returned it.  Piece of junk.  The front dial was non-functioning when it arrived.</li>
    <li> wish it had a plug in for my hair curler.</li>
    <li> Throwback to my younger years. Arrived with one bulb already out.</li>
    <li> Finally found a lighted makeup mirror I like . Just wish the magnification was a little stronger .  Diana Schwartz</li>
    <li> This mirror is poorly angled. It leans back too far, so, unless you are very close, it&#x27;s difficult to see. I have owned many of this type of products and this is the first one with which I&#x27;ve had problems.</li>
    <li> I had my make-up mirror for many years so when it died I went out to buy a new one, I just assumed that I could find one anywhere&lt;br /&gt;well that was not the case.  I was very excited when I found this conair at amazon.  I really like the the three mirror and different light settings, although I only use the daylight.  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Joan from Walpole</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! My first one of these lasted almost 15 years and blew out, so I bought another one &amp; love it even more!</li>
    <li> Actually I love this mirror.  I already have another one like this.  However, this particular one came chipped on one side.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my vintage Clairol true to light mirror finally gave out. As some other reviews said, the lighting on this thing is really bad. The magnification makes me cross eyed and I have to get my face practically on the glass before my skewed vision can clear up and I can see how to do anything. And the lighting! Don&#x27;t get me started! The first time I went out after applying make up with this thing was down right scary. I&#x27;m sending it back. Unfortunately, after doing a lot of research, it seems there is much agreement that the true to light (now discontinued) was and still is the best make up mirror. I will be searching ebay for my replacement.</li>
    <li> It was like re-living my youth... finding this gem and buying it for my girls.  I bought two.  They are as fun as I remember.  Perfect gift for a young girl with tight vanity space.  I must have for every girl at least one time.  Product came in perfect condition and on time as requested.</li>
    <li> I have had my mirror for seven years. I&#x27;m a makeup artist. I use it everyday and it works great. I have had no problems at all.. I haven&#x27;t even had to change any bulbs. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this 3 panel mirror. Lights up and has 3 different light textures. This accomplimented my wife&#x27;s vallentines day present which was the Vanity, white with chair.</li>
    <li> this three way mirror is just the berries for me.  I live in Fl in a small rv and needed something that had it&#x27;s own light sorce..and by golly....here it  is...wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this because the lighting and mirrors in motels/hotels is so horrible.  It is great!  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Especially, the variable lighting makes it a superior product.</li>
    <li> the mirror is perfect both in size and clarity.  I love the magnified mirror for my putting on my mascara and tweeing my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;The different lighting is helpful too.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I have had  a mirror like this for years and one of the lights finally burned out. I did not know until this mirror arrived and I was going to throw my old one away that you can open the covers and just replace the small bulbs. At least I now have one for each bathroom.</li>
    <li> Best lighted make-up mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.  Lots of settings.  Folds up.  Beautiful.  Love it.  SO GLAD I got it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. I grew up with Clairol mirrors, but this one is quite nice and lighting is great.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my future daughter in-law, When she comes over from England to spend time with us she never had a proper place to do her make up. She loves it. She loves the different settings for the light. She loves how things look closer. It was a great success.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best that my wife has used.  She has tried everything that is easily available on the US market.  The fluorescent  models have too much glare for her eyes.  This one has a softer, more natural light. The colored bars on the fluorescent  models are really not a true match for various lighting conditions.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mirror! Great quality and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Great bright light. I use it every day to put on my makeup. It&#x27;s very bright; before I was using the bathroom lights, which weren&#x27;t bright enough. Now I sit at  a dressing table and can see what I&#x27;m doing!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t bright enough for me. So I returned it.</li>
    <li> I was taught to white light and when I received this mirror was not sure I liked. With the days I appreciated the yellow hue, brightness as less annoying and can see better with normal mirror and the mirror amplifier.</li>
    <li> I wish the lights were brighter. Otherwise I like it.</li>
    <li> My old Conair 3-panel makeup mirror used LED bulbs and gave off much more light than this one which uses what I would call nightlight size bulbs.  OK but not wonderful..</li>
    <li> This product only emulates candle-light.  It has 4 settings: \\&quot;orange dim\\&quot;, \\&quot;orange dimmer\\&quot;, \\&quot;orange dimmest\\&quot; and \\&quot;may as well put your makeup on in the dark.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this mirror, uses it every day.  great lighting, love the 2 side mirrors, works great, great value</li>
    <li> I like this make up mirror.  I had one similar years ago and really liked it, so glad to have one again.&lt;br /&gt;I would like for it to have a few more ways in the back to adjust it a bit. One the whole pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I absoulutley love this!! It works perfectly, it was definitely worth the money I paid for it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received the mirror in less than a week and I love it.  I find that it has more than enough light and works great for me.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this again and would purchases from this seller.</li>
    <li> I searched in the stores for a make-up mirror like I had back in the 70&#x27;s. I was looking for a Clairol mirror with the two lighted sides. The closest I could find was this Conair and after reading the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It was a total disappointment. Ended up giving it to my 10 year old daughter. I knew going into it that probably the only good setting would be daytime but even that didn&#x27;t work well. The bulbs are not the flourescent type and therefore do not give you  even-brightest that you need at 43 years old! It was way too forgiving and I wanted something that didn&#x27;t lie! I ended up finding an old Clairol one in by mother&#x27;s basement. Save your money and look on ebay if you want a good one like the olden days!</li>
    <li> I read all the comments about this mirror before I bought it and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t care for the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;It is different than my old mirror and maybe not quite as bright  but with 5 settings I am more than happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also the bulbs can be replaced if need be which is nice.  I did try to find a mirror in a local big box store and came home with a round one that had a picture on the box that looked like the mirror at a resort that we stay in. But by the time I got all the packaging out and got to the mirror it was hardly big enough to see an eyeball. Talk about lighting - a candle would have been brighter.&lt;br /&gt;How disappointing !!  Trust in Amazon - I love my new mirror which cost less than the one I had to drag back to the store and it came within a week right to the door!!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made. Oh well my daughter still likes it and uses all the time.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I was looking to replace the mirror I wanted the three panels that the old one doesn&#x27;t have. I&#x27;ve owned since the 70s. The lighting on this mirror is terrible. Since the only problem with my old mirror is that I broke the stand, I&#x27;ve retrieved it and prop it up. After all these years, the old mirror is still bright. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I love this make up mirror so far - if the lights stay on I for more than a year I will really love it :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror and when it arrived the lights didn&#x27;t work so I asked for an exchange which cost me over $60.00 in delivery, of which $6.00 was paid back. The second one arrived in the mail and amazon charged another $64.00 for some reason, and again it was faulty. The lights worked for a moment before fizzling out despite having bought a power adapter so as to match the recommended wattage in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;A $30-$40 mirror has ended up costing me over $120.00. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Since the item was a gift for my daughter. I asked her and she said it was great. Perfect lighting. Although there was a little hickup when the produce arrived and we could not use it die to the power issue because the power connectors here in europe are different to those in the states as well as the power itself, but that was quickly remedied by a quick trip down to our electronics store for an adapter. now everything is good. My daughter is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Distortion free, just the right magnification and light output.  She uses it every day.  We had one previously, but our Bulldog stepped on the upright support and cracked it the plastic piece where it meets the back of the mirror.  One part of the support is metal, the other is plastic.  I wish they were both made of metal.  But hey, if you use it with care, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> The lighting isn&#x27;t great. I also can&#x27;t get it to prop up well enough when applying my makeup. I keep it on the brightest setting, and it is still not good enough. It also gets very very hot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok, but I would have bought something else if I could turn back time.</li>
    <li> Very nice. You do need a lamp on near it though, no matter what setting you use.  Stays proper up with the stand in the back. I am satisfied with it so far.</li>
    <li> I had one as a teenager, so I bought one for my granddaughter.  She loves it!  Who doesn&#x27;t like to look at themselves when they are young and beautiful.  Now that I&#x27;m 60, I usually try to avoid mirrors.</li>
    <li> The mirror works great.  An improvement would be brighter lighting.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Mirror lights work really well for makeup application.  Changing magnification by rotating mirror works well.  Side mirror angle adds perspective of how others view your makeup. Back tilt angle is easily adjustable when sitting on a table or it can be hung on the wall.  Very happy with the mirror and it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The 4 light settings are a nice touch, but make sure you have more than just the make-up mirror for a light source.  The magnification mirror works fine.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> very nice mirror. Wifey loves it. That&#x27;s all that matters is wife being happy. Nice mirror for putting on her make-up</li>
    <li> I love this mirror, and use it every day to put on my make-up.  I don&#x27;t use the lights to much, as I have sufficient lighting in my bathroom, I really need it for the magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> My mirror works wonderfully! I had pre-order jitters before it arrived, because of how many negative reviews there are on this item, of which I didn&#x27;t read until AFTER I purchased it, due to sheer excitement about having my own light-up mirror, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only soft lighting is the Evening light setting, which expected, though, since it is the &amp;#34;EVENING&amp;#34; setting, it&#x27;s suppose to be darkened. It&#x27;s also very yellow, for a kind of candle light effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Day setting is the brightest, which uses all 4 light bulbs, and works great. The next brightest setting is the&lt;br /&gt;Home setting. The second to least brightest setting is the Office setting. The mirror comes with all of these, 4 settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the mirror works great, and I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks now, and so far, there have been no problems, what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a  Christmas present for a family member. She was attending a conference in San Antonio, TX, and the hotel where she stayed had this mirror. She fell in love with it during the 3 days she was there, and came back raving about it enough to put it on her List for Santa Claus.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like a lighted make-up mirror. Lots of color choices. It&#x27;s perfect for sitting on my bed and still able to watch t.v. while I am putting on make-up or doing my hair. I have a lap desk that I put it on. I had bought one of these 30 years ago and back than it came with a plug in at the bottom of the mirror so you could plug something into it. For example, I could use my mirror and plus a hair dryer, a curling iron or anything else into it. They quit making it that way and I wish they still had that installed.</li>
    <li> for medical reasons I can no long stand up and use the bathroom mirror to put on makeup  and comb my hair, but I can use the Conair mirror any where I am comfortable to do my makeup and hair</li>
    <li> love my new make up mirror. Great lighting and magnifying helps these older eyes to put make up on more easily</li>
    <li> I t is very useful and works beautifully in putting on makeup.  It also has a magnifying side for eyebrows. I find it very useful for what I have to do.</li>
    <li> Our daughter is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this for my 15 yr. old she would sit on the floor and use the mirror on the back of her door.  She loves having the light and being able to sit at her dressing table where she keeps all her makeup and hair products. It is not too big, and she really likes the three mirrors versus just one to make sure she has her makeup on perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife had this product before and we were not able to purchase it locally, so I was able to find it on your website. She is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair three way makeup mirror.  The first one lasted about 20 years but I won&#x27;t know if this one will last that long since I&#x27;ll probably be six feet under in 20 years!! It&#x27;s really great to see how your makeup and hair looks from several angles by just tilting the mirrors.  The magnified mirror is a little scary to use - shows up ALL the wrinkles and blemishes :( I highly recommend this product to anyone - female, male, young or old - it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I received this make-up panel two days after ordering using standard shipping (Amazon is great in shipping its products quickly - thank you)!! I love the size, height, and light settings, particularly the &#x27;day&#x27; setting which is bright. The magnifying side is super-magnifying and allows you to see every imperfection. I give it four stars only because the other light settings are not that bright, that&#x27;s why I prefer to always use the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting. Overall, happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I expected.  I had another Conair mirror since I was 12 and it finally broke (I am now 52).  This item is the same excellent quality as the first!</li>
    <li> The mirror is perfect for my mothers dresser.  This was for her early birthday gift and she has been wanting one forever.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I like that i have multiple settings for different lighting. looks very sturdy and it makes my applications a lot more accurate. thank you for the great price amazon</li>
    <li> lady is thrilled with her mirror.</li>
    <li> Good things:  the lights are bright, the settings are useful, e.g. office, day, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Poor things:  I had this mirror about two weeks and one of the doors broke off.  When it&#x27;s open, it&#x27;s quite large and bulky in general.</li>
    <li> No glare and adequate light for places I couldn&#x27;t see before.</li>
    <li> I brought this after seeing it at a friends house. I love the different light settings on the mirror. The magnification feature is great. The lights do get pretty hot tho.</li>
    <li> Anyone who thinks this mirror&#x27;s lighting is good never owned a Remington \\&quot;True to Light\\&quot; mirror.  I got this Conair mirror yesterday, and it will be going back tomorrow.  It doesn&#x27;t even come close to replicating real lighting conditions.  The \\&quot;brightest\\&quot; light setting is a dull yellow color, at best.  There is no way you can get a true picture of what your makeup really looks like by using this yellow light.  The only reason I gave this mirror two stars is because the 5x magnification is really great, but the lighting is what I want the mirror for, and it stinks.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Excellent Price! Speedy Delivery!</li>
    <li> If you want to look yellow this is the one for you.  No matter which of the settings you use, they are all some variation of yellow.  Plus, you need to turn on additional lights in the background in order to see clearly enough to apply makeup.  Whats the point in using a lighted mirror if you need even more light to see yourself???  D</li>
    <li> A light like this is definitely one of those things that you never know you&#x27;re missing until you get it and then try living without it. I love the way it lights up and has the adjustable mirrors on the side.Also, the maginifying mirror is great for detailed work (like plucking hairs).&lt;br /&gt;I never would have thought I &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; one of these but now I use it daily. Whether I&#x27;m using a lot of makeup or just a touch.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love. It is cheapish lightweight plastic, but that&#x27;s ok. That&#x27;s pretty much what everything is nowdays.</li>
    <li> Love my mirror. I don&#x27;t have to pay to get my eyebrows done anymore. Great for makeup app. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Works great!</li>
    <li> Brilliant for old eyes like mine to put on makeup properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside US needs transformer for 240v.</li>
    <li> Great well lit make up mirror! Its perfect!</li>
    <li> I get to see all three sides of my ugly mug&lt;br /&gt;every morning and if I&#x27;m feeling especially&lt;br /&gt;brave, I can flip the center mirror and&lt;br /&gt;use the magnifying lens and see my face&lt;br /&gt;up close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH THE HORROR !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice make-up mirror.  Lighting and magnification are great.  My problem is that the mirror tilts from left to right (fail to see the logic of that) and my table surface is too high for that to be practical.  Wish that I had a lower surface to use so that I didn&#x27;t get a view of the ceiling. I would have preferred a mirror that tilted up and down.  However, that is my problem and, except for that issue, it&#x27;s a really nice make-up mirror.</li>
    <li> sorry I waited so long to replace mine ....broke during a move 5 years ago boy was that a poor call.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my grandaughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I wanted. This was a birthday present for my wife and she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had purchased another vanity mirror, which did not work at all for me. This was my replacement mirror and I was extremely happy with it. I wanted it for applying makeup and seeing areas on my face that might be skin precancers and this works positively perfect for both!! Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT BUT IT COST MORE THAN THE MIRROR TO BUY AN ADAPTER TO USE IN AUSTRALIA ,THIS IS SOMETHING TO REMEMBER BEFORE PURCHASING FROM AMERICA</li>
    <li> The mirror isnt that big but with the lights and everything, its more like 20 inches tall, though i must say i really see just 2 shades of light intensity</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for doing your makeup and especially your eyebrows because there is a flip side of the mirror that magnifies by 10 I believe. The lighting options are great as well.</li>
    <li> Lighting, mirrors, everything about this mirror is amazing! It hasn&#x27;t lasted all these years for nothing. I remember my sister having one in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> i wish one of the panels , or sections of a panel was a close up mirror.  Love the lighting though.</li>
    <li> Not much difference in lighting</li>
    <li> Looks good, works great.</li>
    <li> Mom loved the illumination.</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> My mom is enjoying it! Early bday present</li>
    <li> Just as I expected. Don&#x27;t think you won&#x27;t need additional good lightning, but then I am 60+ The side mirrors make this unit so much better than the single mirror products. Even if you think they are not that important to you, get them. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the side mirrors.  The lights are not bright enough.  I&#x27;t okay.  The light settings work good.</li>
    <li> got this for my teenage daughter, she uses it everday, essential for getting ready for school, i had one one of my own</li>
    <li> I had a Clairol for over 36 yrs and loved it.  I can not get a new one, but this is the next best thing.  I just wish it was a little heavier (slides alittle) and the light get very hot.  Also wish it had more adjustments for the placement of the mirror, but overall I am happy compared to others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Works great. Have this mirror several years now. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for the lights and magnification.  Those things are great.  The only issue: the mirror is limited in positional settings.</li>
    <li> I had a previous mirror that like alot of you died after many years.  I order this one and was really disappointed. The stand doesn&#x27;t stay in place and lighting is awful.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! The lights are really bright and last a long time! It&#x27;s really great just to sit on the counter and doesn&#x27;t get in the way of anything.</li>
    <li> Bulbs burned out after 3 months. No problem just unsolder them and solder in new ones. Yea right back to china via the dump.</li>
    <li> The lighting is not what I hoped and the Jerdon mirror broke after just 1.5 years.  The Jerdon lighting is better, but I did not want to buy that brand again knowing it would not last.  Someone else mentioned that Jerdon and Conair should get together to create perfect mirror and I agree. Jerdon&#x27;s lighting is outstanding but does not last and the Conair is perfect for construction and ease of use.</li>
    <li> The bulbs are so dim, it&#x27;s brighter either in my bathroom or if I open the blinds.  Also the magnification isn&#x27;t strong enough for plucking your brows.  A real disappointment</li>
    <li> Great mirror - they last a long time</li>
    <li> I had previously bought this mirror after my old one just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I had done some research on reasonably priced tri-fold mirrors, and this was one of the results I had gotten. After seeing so many bad reviews about this product, I hesitantly purchased it since I was mirror-less. Unfortunately it lived up to its bad reputation. Two weeks after I had been using it, the lighting stopped working. If I had originally purchased it just for the mirror, this wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal. But I would like to see what I&#x27;m putting on my face, so if there were no lights it was useless to me. It worked decently while the lights were functioning, but they were nothing close to natural lighting. So I was a little shocked to see my face later in the day being a few shades darker than what I had remembered it being in the mirror. So as you can see this mirror just wasn&#x27;t right for me. I see in other reviews that this mirror is just the best thing that has ever happened to some people. So I&#x27;m guessing it is just a trial and error type of mirror. Just remember to keep the receipt c:</li>
    <li> Lighting isn&#x27;t that great.  Either too dark or lights shine in my eyes when all on.  Needs a better design.</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast shipping, very happy with my purchase! I use it to apply my own face makeup and it works just fine. The only thing I wish it would do was have a slighty higher elevation angle, other than that it is fine.</li>
    <li> Works great with the wall mounted vanity we put in the room. Love the 4 option lighting and the fact it folds up.</li>
    <li> Would be great if it worked in Australia..but it doesn&#x27;t...mirror is great but of coarse the lights don&#x27;t work due to not being able to convert to our voltage</li>
    <li> I have used this makeup mirror off and on since I was 15 (I&#x27;m more than twice that age now).  I don&#x27;t know why I keep going back to it, after it breaks countless times.  This last time, the arm that holds up the collapsable mirror broke off, which means that every time I tried to use it, the mirror would fall.  This would cause the bulbs to fry 10x quicker than usual.  And forget buying replacement bulbs--they are upwards of $5 a bulb, and there are four bulbs on the mirror.  The arm wasn&#x27;t the only thing to break or fall off.  Also, I only ever used the \\&quot;outdoor\\&quot; setting on the lighting because the others were way too dim...and even \\&quot;outdoor\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t that bright.  I&#x27;d get a better mirror if I were you--don&#x27;t be fooled by the multiple settings because you won&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product! Thank you! Will buy from you again!</li>
    <li> Love the mirror. Like the fact that it is a 3 way mirror. I can see the front and back style of my hair as I am doing it.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror.  Bright lights and very clean design. Good purchase</li>
    <li> Light source could be a bit stronger but overall good value for the price. I keep it in the packaging for travel just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mirror and great for travel!</li>
    <li> Not enough lighting and rather cheaply made!</li>
    <li> Perfect makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old loves it- and I do, too!!  Item as described, working order-- a fun gift for tweens and useful for moms as well.</li>
    <li> Works nicely for my daughter.</li>
    <li> the light won&#x27;t be very helpful to determine your makeup, since they are all warm &amp; yellowish. I won&#x27;t try to determine colors on my face based on such a light. Besides, it&#x27;s not bright enough, so you still need other lightening sources in the room. But I was only looking for a 3-panel desk mirror, and this one is large enough. I hope it can bend further down though.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for my wife, she loves it, works well and is a good quality product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this makeup mirror</li>
    <li> I bought the product for my sister ,she wanted the magnifiying capabilities and was good for the price,she likes the 3 mirrors and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My mother always tells her daughters that there is nothing she needs so don&#x27;t worry about getting her a gift (Christmas, birthday, mother&#x27;s day etc.). Well, about 3 weeks before mother&#x27;s day, I happened to see her makeup mirror. It has to have been from the 1980&#x27;s. Light bulbs were burnt out/missing. It was yellowed and cracked. It was pitiful! I know that she is particular, so I went to work online to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; mirror for her. I looked far and wide. Amazon had the exact item I was looking for and at the best price. Mom loves it! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Thank You Amazon!!!</li>
