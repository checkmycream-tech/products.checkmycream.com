      <li>I am glad I came across this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I just love it</li>
      <li>I have oily, blotchy skin with a lot of flaws and this covers them much better than applying foundation with my fingers or a brush.</li>
      <li>Bottom line save your money and look for something with better qaulity.</li>
      <li>I love these sponges.  </li>
      <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
      <li>great dupe for beauty blender for much much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It clean very easy.....</li>
      <li>I love these bliss pro blending sponges I find they work better then the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost all the lil beauty blenders thats out there and wasn&#x27;t so satisfied and seen this cheap 1</li>
      <li>Better than the original Beauty Blender.</li>
      <li>Anyway, It made it super easy to apply the paint for my halloween costume and really easy to clean too!</li>
      <li>skin and blends so easy and fast and just amazing..</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things bout it.</li>
      <li>This is the optimal dup for the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>Performs just as well as the original beauty blender although the sponge itself seems a bit denser.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this to use with some face/body paint from Mehron since it required water to activate and a sponge like this would have made it easier since to use it</li>
      <li>That one is much softer way more comparable.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re much better off buying the Real Techniques beauty sponge.</li>
      <li>I normally put my makeup on with my hands, and it normally DOES NOT do that surprisingly.</li>
      <li>They do not blend your makeup  and they soak up foundation really quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only thing is (and this maybe my fault, pretty sure it is as a first time beauty blender user) when i washed it the 4(?)</li>
      <li>First off there is probably no way you can get the same results as if you bought an original, but these are pretty good.</li>
      <li>Good but not a real dupe for the beauty blender.</li>
      <li>So love these sponges they are soft, and it two days to deliver.</li>
      <li>if you dont want to spent a lot on a beauty sponge this is a good deal</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>Threw them right away.</li>
      <li>used this right when i got it in the mail</li>
      <li>Spend the extra money get something of better quality.</li>
      <li>I think it is also more hygienic for use since replacement of the product is affordable and you won&#x27;t be reusing the same sponge over and over.</li>
      <li>I got 6 sponges for 20$ which is way better then only 1 beauty blender for 20+ dollars.</li>
      <li>Exact dupe for the beauty blender.</li>
      <li>They may have a similar shape, but this is MUCH harder (even when damp) you will not be happy with the texture.</li>
      <li>works just as good if not better than the beauty blender.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still very &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Will order again once mine are ready to be replaced</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase instead of the beauty blender as it is just as capable of giving the airbrushed look without costing so much.</li>
      <li>I really like mine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy these over the real beauty blender any day.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really dig</li>
      <li>and I really recommend it.</li>
      <li>It made my face very hydrated n melted the markup into my skin.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t remain damp as long as the original one, but these are as close as you&#x27;ll get.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first because they look like any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve tried but they&#x27;re just perfect!</li>
      <li>They blend very well on mature skin.</li>
      <li>Work better than the real techniques sponge not sure how it ocompares to the beauty blender</li>
      <li>Some other reviews on here claim as such, but I promise that if you&#x27;re used to using a real BB and are trying to find a more cost efficient dupe, this is not the way to go.</li>
      <li>Love these little makeup blenders!</li>
      <li>It is so soft it applied my foundation and concealer like a dream.</li>
      <li>it is a little denser than the original but does the job.</li>
      <li>It arrived fast and I started using this for everyday makeup and it works really well!</li>
      <li>A little better than previous way of applying foundation</li>
      <li>Hard to get completely clean also.</li>
      <li>Other than that I really like this.</li>
      <li>They seemed pretty small and firm at first</li>

    <li> Not beauty blender quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Looooooooooovvvvveeeeeee ittttttt!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕 this is the best beauty blender ever!!!!!! I have tried almost all the lil beauty blenders thats out there and wasn&#x27;t so satisfied and seen this cheap 1 and i was like what the hell well let me tell you guys its the best beauty blender out there its so soft feels so good on you skin and blends so easy and fast and just amazing..i recommend this bliss beauty blender to everyone💋 i give it  5 stars !</li>
    <li> I guess... A little better than previous way of applying foundation</li>
    <li> Perfect! This is the optimal dup for the original beauty blender. I just love it and I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really Good! IDK &#x27;bout Beauty Blender but this one is really good! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat up&amp;#34; all your liquid makeup. They blend very well on mature skin. Thnks.</li>
    <li> Love these little makeup blenders! I was using the beauty blenders, and loved them, then ordered some &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; ones...hated them. Threw them right away. When I saw these offered by Bliss, I knew they would be a great product, so I ordered some for myself, my daughters, and my daughter-in-law! We all absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this sponge regularly &amp; I have to say, I&#x27;m not a fan. Even after it&#x27;s wet and wrung out it&#x27;s still very &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;. It also absorbs quite a bit of makeup. Hard to get completely clean also.</li>
    <li> I was recommend this product from a video from YouTube by MSNIKKIGBEAUTY ... I love these bliss pro blending sponges I find they work better then the original beauty blender. I got 6 sponges for 20$ which is way better then only 1 beauty blender for 20+ dollars. As soon as I recieved these sponges in my mail  I immediately wiped off my makeup and tested these out. I ran it under water while squeezing out the water like 3 times. The sponge grow 10 times. It is so soft it applied my foundation and concealer like a dream. It made my face very hydrated n melted the markup into my skin. Very airbrush and flawless look..... I can&#x27;t say enough great things bout it. It clean very easy..... It came in 3 days ...... Great customer service... I would recommend to everyone this sponge over the beauty blender any day...n I will continue to by them from this amazon  seller</li>
    <li> It started to smell bad after a few uses, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is what its like for all beauty blenders but when I use this it shows all my bumps/pores. I normally put my makeup on with my hands, and it normally DOES NOT do that surprisingly. So yeah.... don&#x27;t know but I don&#x27;t really dig this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried as in touched other blenders (from friends) and they seem softer. Havent tried other blenders so I can&#x27;t really say if it legit sucks or not, but this was does not work with me.</li>
    <li> Awesome... doesn&#x27;t absorb makeup so makeup lasts longer.  Applies makeup smoothly and feels good in my hands, easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Exact dupe for the beauty blender. Same size, color, density, same everything! They even swell up to the same size after being submerged. Shipping was about 5 days. I will defiantly repurchase!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will order again once mine are ready to be replaced</li>
    <li> This product is a big no no. It soaks up all my foundation and doesn&#x27;t provide any coverage. It&#x27;s not bouncy nor squishy. Shouldn&#x27;t have wasted 10 dollars. I dont recommend this at all to anyone. Just buy the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. They seemed pretty small and firm at first but once I ran them under water and  squeezed them a few times, the sponge got softer and much bigger. Great dup for the beauty blender. Totally worth the price. I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I usually use MAC brushes to apply all my makeup but I needed a sponge to apply concealer under my eyes. These are perfect!!!!! Perfect size, beautiful coverage, soooo soft! I was going to buy the beauty blender but nevermind! Love these!!!!</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this little pink bundle? My makeup has never been this flawless, and I&#x27;m a make-up artist. I will be recommending this to all my clients!</li>
    <li> I hate these things! They are pretty hard to be a makeup sponge and DONT blend your makeup! They soak it up and slide around on it. You pay for what you get, IF your looking for a beauty blender dupe or just a good sponge, THIS IS NOT IT. Spend the extra money get something of better quality. I did not like them at all. 2 Sponges I&#x27;ll NEVER use. Take my advice and save your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the beauty blender but I&#x27;d assume this is an inexpensive dupe. I originally bought this to use with some face/body paint from Mehron since it required water to activate and a sponge like this would have made it easier since to use it, it needs to be wet (That&#x27;s what she said lol) Anyway, It made it super easy to apply the paint for my halloween costume and really easy to clean too! It arrived fast and I started using this for everyday makeup and it works really well!</li>
    <li> Good but not a real dupe for the beauty blender. Not porous enough.</li>
    <li> So love these sponges they are soft, and it two days to deliver. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. With it being a cheaper version of the beauty blender, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this good. The only problem I have is it&#x27;s starting to tear slightly where it&#x27;s rounded out. Other than that I really like this.</li>
    <li> Not a Beauty Blender dupe. Sorry. Some other reviews on here claim as such, but I promise that if you&#x27;re used to using a real BB and are trying to find a more cost efficient dupe, this is not the way to go. They may have a similar shape, but this is MUCH harder (even when damp) you will not be happy with the texture. You&#x27;re much better off buying the Real Techniques beauty sponge. That one is much softer way more comparable.</li>
    <li> Performs just as well as the original beauty blender although the sponge itself seems a bit denser. I am glad I came across this product on Amazon. I will continue to purchase instead of the beauty blender as it is just as capable of giving the airbrushed look without costing so much. I think it is also more hygienic for use since replacement of the product is affordable and you won&#x27;t be reusing the same sponge over and over. Sponges are notorious for trapping dirt and grime even if washed on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I bought these sponges based on the good reviews but I was very wrong. These sponges are VERY hard and they stay hard when ran under water and they do not expand. They do not blend your makeup  and they soak up foundation really quickly. I felt like I was beating my face just trying to blend out the makeup.  Bottom line save your money and look for something with better qaulity.</li>
    <li> Wish they were bigger and softer. They don&#x27;t expand when wet. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order this brand again.</li>
    <li> Bought these because the original Beauty Blender is too dang expensive! Ain&#x27;t no one got time for that!!&lt;br /&gt;I used this right when i got it in the mail and i love it!! It blends out so smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is (and this maybe my fault, pretty sure it is as a first time beauty blender user) when i washed it the 4(?) Time, i think i was too rough with it and it had a slight tear. And also i started to break out:( but now im not breaking out since i wash it almost every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will def buy more!</li>
    <li> First off there is probably no way you can get the same results as if you bought an original, but these are pretty good. I bought some other ones and they didn&#x27;t even absorb and swell. These do. They don&#x27;t remain damp as long as the original one, but these are as close as you&#x27;ll get. I really like mine.</li>
    <li> These sponges are very hard. They do not react as a beauty blender when ran under water. They stay firm and in no way blend out your makeup. I bought these because of the good reviews. They must be fake reviews which is annoying. Trust me when I say they&#x27;re not worth purchasing. I threw it away after one use.</li>
    <li> Better than the original Beauty Blender.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for money, the finishing is just amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing... I look like I have airbrushed makeup every day! I have oily, blotchy skin with a lot of flaws and this covers them much better than applying foundation with my fingers or a brush. I don&#x27;t know how other people do it, but I soak the sponge in water and then squeeze out the excess. I spread the foundation with my fingers and then blend it with the sponge. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Perfect foundation every time!</li>
    <li> Not a dupe for a beauty blender. I was looking for another alternative because the beauty blenders and a bit pricey, but this wasn&#x27;t it. It was still from even after I wet it. I then soaked it but it seem as if it never loosen up. Therefore it was very taunt and not comfortable on the skin.</li>
    <li> works just as good if not better than the beauty blender. Plus it cheaper your getting 2 for the price of 1/2 of a beauty blender.</li>
    <li> great dupe for beauty blender for much much cheaper. it is a little denser than the original but does the job. if you dont want to spent a lot on a beauty sponge this is a good deal</li>
    <li> I love these! I&#x27;d buy these over the real beauty blender any day. They are so light and spongey and apply makeup perfectly. I was skeptical at first because they look like any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve tried but they&#x27;re just perfect!</li>
    <li> Love these, they are fantastic and price is great! Such a steal!!! Work better than the real techniques sponge not sure how it ocompares to the beauty blender but these do an excellent job!</li>
    <li> Love the these blenders great quality and great price couldn&#x27;t as for more!</li>
    <li> I expected it to be softer as were the blender bud I had used previously.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
