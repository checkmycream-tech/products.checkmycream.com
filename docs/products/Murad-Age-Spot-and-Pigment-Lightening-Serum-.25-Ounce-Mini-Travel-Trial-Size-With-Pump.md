      <li>I have been applying each day and it works marvelous.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the best.</li>
      <li>The best fade gel!</li>
      <li>I am happy with it, with the exception of the size and the price!</li>
      <li>so it was perfect.</li>
      <li>Works great, believe all the hype about it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used murad products are was really happy with them,</li>
      <li>Great for if you have a lot of scars/ pigmentation</li>
      <li>Great stuff, love Murad!</li>
      <li>good product</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>For people with fair skin that&#x27;s prone to redden, I would be cautious with this product.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE this serum!</li>
      <li>I used it for 2 wks, &amp; the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>my hands look amazing........</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Perfect size and great cost to try this product out to see if I like it before I invest in the regular size.  </li>
      <li>Great! got to love the fast results!</li>
      <li>Love it, I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends and they love it too!</li>
      <li>Clinique age spot liquid is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The $10 bottle is perfect for trying this out, or if you only have spots here</li>
      <li>So glad that this is offer in this $10 bottle.  </li>
      <li>After this ran out I switched to Dr Fred Palmers Skin Cream - for only $2.00 and it works just as great!</li>
      <li>But I love that I got to try the sample size before buying the product.</li>
      <li>After more research, it&#x27;s probably better suited for age spots and freckles since it acts to block melanin production.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
      <li>They are gradually getting prominent and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Obviously it would be wonderful to find something to noticeably lighten the age spots.</li>
      <li>I do want to mention that hydroquinone is in many fade creams like Porcelana and Ambi, and those products are a much better value.</li>
      <li>Under eye circles noticeably fading after two weeks and skin is brighter and more even toned.</li>
      <li>Love love it.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I love it.. better than obagi.</li>
      <li>Product for years, I am easily prone to acne scars and discoloration.</li>
      <li>and you need something strong.</li>
      <li>This tiny bottle was just the right amount for what I needed it for...for a great price!</li>
      <li>I will continue to use as directed and if I see a notable difference will purchase the full size.</li>
      <li>A full month I believe would show more results.</li>
      <li>You might have some peeling but just do a scrub lightly once or twice a week</li>
      <li>murad makes great products but this is by far my absolute favorite in their product line.  </li>
      <li>I had melasma looking burns on my face from cheap chemical peels.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things for my sun spots, but nothing has worked as fast as Murad!</li>
      <li>a drop of the serum, on clean skin, and you will see a difference in 5-7 days!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Rapid is right!  </li>
      <li>cuz it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>I have to give it 4 stars because they fulfilled my order quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Murad has a new customer!!!!</li>
      <li>This is the very first product I have noticed a difference with.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to see a skin care product actually do what it says it does.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it...</li>
      <li>it was the right item.</li>
      <li>Its my first week using this product and</li>
      <li>I shopped around and saw that this item is priced much higher in retail stores &amp; on the murad site.</li>
      <li>The product definitely has brightened my skin although I think I needed to use it longer to see more drastic results.</li>
      <li>This is my first day using it.</li>
      <li>I have freckles that have gotten darker and more prolific in recent years.</li>
      <li>I first tried this stuff as a sample from sephora after being told it was $60.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different cream and ointments to fade my sun damage on my face.  </li>
      <li>Well first the item came in no box.</li>
      <li>This serum lightens dark spots, is not harsh on the skin, and has a pleasant smell and for me, it has the added benefit of inhibiting hairs that have started growing on my jawline.  </li>
      <li>this product really works I have one spot within my eye brow</li>
      <li>Used the whole bottle</li>
      <li>Really wanted it to work.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Thank so much for having this product.</li>
      <li>I immediately searched for it on amazon and found it at a MUCH lower price.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really know</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This worked very well against my scars</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>The spots have either disappeared or lightened so much that I sometimes forget to apply a dab of coverage before I leave the house</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I love murad products they are not harsh on your skin and actually work.</li>
      <li>, I really had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much, but it completely faded the spot in eight days!</li>
      <li>This stuff lightened the dark circles, and I looked so much better.</li>
      <li>I will most likely purchase the regular size of this product and continue to use.</li>
      <li>It really does clear up your skin.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t completely gone, however, they&#x27;re MUCH lighter than they used to be.</li>
      <li>Cannot live without it.</li>
      <li>now live by this stuff and tell everyone Iknow to give it</li>
      <li>I am 60 and love this product; fully intend to buy other facial products.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate me; that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say.  </li>
      <li>(Note to young women: Don&#x27;t go out in the sun without protection.</li>
      <li>So far no change or lightening of the spots</li>
      <li>OVERALL the delivery was extremely fast.</li>
      <li>This product may work for some people but it hasn&#x27;t had any affect on me so far.</li>
      <li>No way possible to leave the house without fully covering the whole area up under my chin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t lighten up my skin, but it did make it incredibly soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I should not have been surprised.  </li>
      <li>or at least to be able to make a noticeable difference .  .  .</li>
      <li>Buying on Amazon is the only way to go because it would be a huge expense at Sephora and other stores.</li>
      <li>I only have to use a very small amount to get great results though, so even this travel-size should last me quite a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Under eye circles noticeably fading after two weeks and skin is brighter and more even toned.I had stopped using Murad products and I don&#x27;t really know why but I should have stayed with it because this product works!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and great cost to try this product out to see if I like it before I invest in the regular size.  I will continue to use as directed and if I see a notable difference will purchase the full size.</li>
    <li> So glad that this is offer in this $10 bottle.  This serum lightens dark spots, is not harsh on the skin, and has a pleasant smell and for me, it has the added benefit of inhibiting hairs that have started growing on my jawline.  As a women, hairs sprouting up on my jawline are embarrassing to say the least.  I don&#x27;t know how this serum works but I know that I have had fewer chin hairs since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week I have seen a noticeable lightening of dark spots on my face and chest, and any areas where I previously popped a bump or dug an ingrown hair out of my skin, which left a dark spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $10 bottle is perfect for trying this out, or if you only have spots here and there that need lightening.  I use about a half pea size worth in the morning and again before I go to bed just on the areas in question.</li>
    <li> In process of trying this product, crossing my fingers it works!! Like the lightweight feel of the product. Bottle is small, though.</li>
    <li> This worked very well against my scars but it&#x27;s expensive! Great for if you have a lot of scars/ pigmentation and you need something strong. After this ran out I switched to Dr Fred Palmers Skin Cream - for only $2.00 and it works just as great!</li>
    <li> I used an entire one on my acne spot, it did nothing. Just waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used the product for two weeks, possibly a few days longer I don&#x27;t remember. The product definitely has brightened my skin although I think I needed to use it longer to see more drastic results. A full month I believe would show more results. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Used it twice a day till the bottle was empty. Didnt work for me : (</li>
    <li> Dark spots haven&#x27;t cleared up even after using for weeks, months.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week and I already see a difference in the dark spots on my face. Will definitely order a full size when this is empty. No offensive odor. I usually develop fever blisters when using Hydroquinone but this hasn&#x27;t happened yet!</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum! I had melasma looking burns on my face from cheap chemical peels. This product was the only thing that lightened the spots. They aren&#x27;t completely gone, however, they&#x27;re MUCH lighter than they used to be. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat what it does.</li>
    <li> Rapid is right!  I had sun/age spots I had been fighting over the last few years. Not anymore. This is good stuff. It is a small bottle but just a dab each night is all you need. I will be a repeat customer for this item!</li>
    <li> I am 60 and love this product; fully intend to buy other facial products.  Buying on Amazon is the only way to go because it would be a huge expense at Sephora and other stores.</li>
    <li> murad makes great products but this is by far my absolute favorite in their product line.  This tiny bottle was just the right amount for what I needed it for...for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many things for my sun spots, but nothing has worked as fast as Murad! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It helped me with my pigment spots that appeared during the last year.</li>
    <li> I am African American, and have been searching for something like this for years to lighten blemish marks, curler burns, or any dark areas on my skin. Well, I finally found it! I shopped around and saw that this item is priced much higher in retail stores &amp; on the murad site.So this price was great!&lt;br /&gt;Just a drop of the serum, on clean skin, and you will see a difference in 5-7 days!&lt;br /&gt;I now live by this stuff and tell everyone Iknow to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;Murad has a new customer!!!!</li>
    <li> I had struggled with dark spots under my chin from hyper pigmentation and have spent many hours and a lot of money on products that claim to lighten dark spots and none worked.i felt very insecure talking with people face to face. I&#x27;ve bern using this product for almost a year and even though the amount is small, I only apply very little and the results have been amazing. I need a very small dab of concealer under my chin for a couple of tiny spots and no one would know I have this issue. The spots have either disappeared or lightened so much that I sometimes forget to apply a dab of coverage before I leave the house and it&#x27;s no biggie. No way possible to leave the house without fully covering the whole area up under my chin.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and service!</li>
    <li> It works but no better than what you can find in a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends and they love it too! Cannot live without it. Love love it. It really does clear up your skin.</li>
    <li> it does indeed, lighten age spots...good product</li>
    <li> I received this product, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, I don&#x27;t see any difference but I will keep using it till its gone.  I cannot recommend it anyone at this point.</li>
    <li> Product for years, I am easily prone to acne scars and discoloration. I have olive skin and any scratch or bump causes a scar or a blemish. This is removing my oven accident on my hand. It is removing the blemishes on my nose and face I have been applying each day and it works marvelous. You might have some peeling but just do a scrub lightly once or twice a week and it seems to speed up the removal of, spots or acne scars and discolorations. Love it.</li>
    <li> Well,  I purchased this product thinking that it was going to help lighting my facial dark spots as advertised .  .  . or at least to be able to make a noticeable difference .  .  . But, to NO AVAIL ! ¡ (Totally Disappointed n Dissatisfied with the results that I&#x27;ve gotten out of this SO CALL AMAZING PRODUCT :(</li>
    <li> I have used Murad for approximately 10 days now and my age spots appear to be somewhat lighter. I don&#x27;t know if that is wishful thinking or not. I will most likely purchase the regular size of this product and continue to use. I am hopeful!!!</li>
    <li> Too small and too expensive. I did not see any results, so I would not buy a larger bottle. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Totally works!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product evey night for a week and see no results. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> this product really works I have one spot within my eye brow and it has faded since the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I love murad products they are not harsh on your skin and actually work. its actually lighting the dark spots but you have to use sunscreen or your defeating the purpose.Worth the money and I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
    <li> Product did fade spots somewhat, but not much better than any other product that I have purchased for the same use. Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this sample size cuz saw commercial on tv about it. Saw a difference immediately! Used the whole bottle so I ordered a bigger size. Still using but have not seen any difference since. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as directed so I&#x27;m not a good person to say how it works.  I have to give it 4 stars because they fulfilled my order quickly.  Not their fault I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different cream and ointments to fade my sun damage on my face.  This is the very first product I have noticed a difference with.  I have been using it about a month, probably 3-4 times a week.  Have had no adverse reaction to it and I am one of those people who is allergic to everything.</li>
    <li> Well first the item came in no box.And it look like it had been used already too.but it was the right item.</li>
    <li> Finally found something to replace my previous skin lightening product that is no longer being made and that really works. When this runs out I&#x27;m going to order another one.</li>
    <li> I bought a two month supply of this and I&#x27;m not blown away by it. This was recommended by a lady at Sephora to fade dark sports from healed acne, but it hasn&#x27;t made a big difference. After more research, it&#x27;s probably better suited for age spots and freckles since it acts to block melanin production.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.  I will toss it.  It didn&#x27;t irritate me; that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say.  Maybe I need to use it for longer but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works!!!! Truly a must have item, no more brown spots..,, I feel younger because skin is soft an no spots..</li>
    <li> Saw a difference within a few days. I&#x27;m hooked I&#x27;ve tried a few other projects. But nothing worked as well as murad.</li>
    <li> It did not lighten my age spots as advertised. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample a while ago and put it under my eyes. After a week, I noticed a big difference in the under eye area. This stuff lightened the dark circles, and I looked so much better. I buy it now, and am addicted.</li>
    <li> Thank so much for having this product. This stuff is the best. I will be order again. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely lightening the dark spots on my hands!  I apply it twice a day and have been for almost 6 weeks.  They&lt;br /&gt;are slowly fading!!!!! I am quite please with this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything noticeable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. But only used for a month.</li>
    <li> I garden, so the sides of my face get a lot of sun exposure, thus the dreaded dark spots. I tried this stuff. Was not impressed. Clinique age spot liquid is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It works!  This is the 2nd time I have used the product.  Both times it has worked well.  I suggest that you use it twice a day after cleansing</li>
    <li> Murad &#x3D; marketing rip off.  You&#x27;re just paying for their infomercials.  Waste of time and money - no lightening even after using twice a day for 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> The best fade gel! After using it for 1 week, I saw a signficant difference.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t lighten up my skin, but it did make it incredibly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It was kind of a let down, but at least I got something out of it.</li>
    <li> So far no change or lightening of the spots</li>
    <li> I only applied this 3 times and it seems to have permanently reddened the area I applied it to. It did lighten the brown spots about 50% but now there is a larger red spot around it from where I applied the serum. It&#x27;s been over a week and it still hasn&#x27;t gone away. It looks like it broke capillaries or caused rosacea. I&#x27;ve always used murad products are was really happy with them, I\\&quot;m unsure of this one though.     UPDATE: The reddening is finally diminishing but I&#x27;m a bit afraid to continue to apply this to my face. It did work to lighten the dark spots though. For people with fair skin that&#x27;s prone to redden, I would be cautious with this product.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;ve been using this each morning and evening, I have not as yet seen any difference in the age spots on my cheeks. Will continue to use until the bottle is empty. This product may work for some people but it hasn&#x27;t had any affect on me so far.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of little pimples during all over my cheeks!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used almost the entire bottle, as directed. I see no noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> ** UPDATE: After using this product for two weeks, I started getting raised red bumps everywhere I had applied it. The bumps didn&#x27;t itch or hurt, but it looked pretty bad. I stopped using this serum, and it cleared up in about five days. I can&#x27;t fault the product, because I am probably just allergic to the active ingredient in it, which is hydroquinone. I do want to mention that hydroquinone is in many fade creams like Porcelana and Ambi, and those products are a much better value. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this serum and used it on a little brown sun splotch underneath my eye. I really didn&#x27;t expect much, but it completely faded the spot in eight days! After it faded away, I stopped using the serum, and the spot did start to come back a little, so I used what I had left of the sample, and it faded away again within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came here to buy a larger size bottle because apparently the results aren&#x27;t permanent, or at least they aren&#x27;t for me. I only have to use a very small amount to get great results though, so even this travel-size should last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Really wanted it to work. Obviously it would be wonderful to find something to noticeably lighten the age spots. (Note to young women: Don&#x27;t go out in the sun without protection. You will regret it.) Tried the trial size before investing in the regular size. But it did not work well enough to warrant further investment.</li>
    <li> Its my first week using this product and im seeing quite a difference already!</li>
    <li> i have freckles a lot, havent really noticed a difference, and the pump on this bottle really sucks, doesnt want to come out</li>
    <li> Well I havnt seen results yet. I will give it another week. If no results then, I will be dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell. Been using for about 3 weeks . I have a dime sized dark spot on my face, caused by sun and age. I have applied a small dab on this spot twice a day. I see slight improvement so far. It is lighter in color. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to disappear, but lighter would be acceptable.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any change and its frustrating.</li>
    <li> I tried the product for a month, and the dark spot didn&#x27;t go away. They faded ever so slightly but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I go out to surf a lot and I got this to lessen the development of freckles on my face. They are gradually getting prominent and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. But I love that I got to try the sample size before buying the product.</li>
    <li> wont ever be without this product even though i think it is pricey...........my hands look amazing........use it every night at bedtime</li>
    <li> Do the work but really slow. Might cause some irritation if I used everyday. It is a expencive little botle.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This is my first day using it. I like the way it feels as it goes on my skin. I have just a few spots I wanted to get rid of so it was perfect. However for the price, I was a little disapointed. It&#x27;s a very small bottle. Hopefully it does the job. OVERALL the delivery was extremely fast. I am happy with it, with the exception of the size and the price!</li>
    <li> I first tried this stuff as a sample from sephora after being told it was $60. I used it for 2 wks, &amp; the results were amazing. I immediately searched for it on amazon and found it at a MUCH lower price. Works great, believe all the hype about it cuz it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> I love it.. better than obagi.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of annoying age spots develop on side of my face.  I am age 81 so I should not have been surprised.  I am certainly not particularly vain, but I did notice that the spots showed up as especially dark in photos.  So I have been using this stuff for about three weeks now.  Not every night as the instructions directed.  I often forgot to use it before going to bed.  Despite MY poor performance, the product did, indeed, do its job, and very well too.  The spots are almost invisible now.  There a lot of applications in this small bottle, so I am now fully motivated, and supplied, in my little war against dark spots.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have been using it for the past 3 weeks and you can see already the results.</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t produce any noticeable results I&#x27;m disappointed, I really had high hopes.</li>
    <li> I have freckles that have gotten darker and more prolific in recent years. I see a real difference (lightening) in the pigment of some (though not all) of my freckles and dark spots. And after a very short time, too! It&#x27;s nice to see a skin care product actually do what it says it does. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It takes awhile to work, but stay with it.  Took me about 6 weeks to get rid of my age or sun spots.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there wasn&#x27;t an instruction for use attached with the product. Looks not professional. Hope it will work to me.</li>
    <li> After a month of using any result!</li>
    <li> it takes a while for you to see results</li>
    <li> This stuff is like a miracle potion!  I know Murad is known for it&#x27;s products, but I had no idea that it would work so well.  I have purchased numerous lightening serums and this one is the only one I have seen with fast results!  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it...</li>
    <li> did not do any difference</li>
    <li> Great! got to love the fast results!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product. I use this for my age spots and the discolorations on my face. My daughter uses it for her acne marks. Love it...</li>
    <li> Great stuff, love Murad!</li>
