### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So if you are one of those no-nonsense, no smell type guys, this antiperspirant is perfect!  </li>
      <li>This did an excellent job of keeping the perspiration away though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it works great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect combination of practical and smelling good.  </li>
      <li>Good product, great scent!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a really great scent.</li>
      <li>This is a great smelling deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My brother tried this product and thought he was drier and smelled great.</li>
      <li>Much better than women&#x27;s deodorants!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s ok to smell some scent, but not be overpowered by it, so I have to give Harmony a plus for that!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also an effective antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Axe Harmony Antiperspirant has a strong and pleasant smell that keeps sweat at bay all day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent at keeping me dry all day, and smells really great as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a strong scent which is nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked the scent of most Axe products, although they tend to be on the strong side.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s overwhelmingly citrus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a potent scent that I find appealing.</li>
      <li>The overwhelming smell gives me a headache.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s interesting</li>
      <li>I love the protection I get from Axe Harmony.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>This product has good scent and is quick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Axe makes some pretty good products.</li>
      <li>Great product, my son only uses the Axe brand for deodorant, he likes Harmony, but it&#x27;s not his favorite, he prefers Peace.  </li>
      <li>They are very effective, last all day without a problem and don&#x27;t leave many marks in clothing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant part works fine, he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the Axe Anti-perspirant stick does a fine job and the scene is fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Axe products (I use their shampoo, body wash and antiperspirant).  </li>
      <li>Armpits&#x27; Primary Desire #2.</li>
      <li>for light use days&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
      <li>just a simple bar!&lt;br /&gt;Works great if you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy&lt;br</li>
      <li>For reasons that they will not divulge, my armpits&#x27; primary desires are two-fold</li>
      <li>deodorant itself seems to work okay, but not for an extended hot day, into work in the morning and going out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Crisp ,clean and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>I could definitely smell it on him, but the odor was pleasant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s masculine without being overpowering and my wife liked the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As with most axe products the aroma is just too much.  </li>
      <li>Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray</li>
      <li>They certainly have more products that are appealing to more than just middle school boys.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wifie says the fragrance is TOO mild</li>
      <li>He like the scent of this Harmony line and says it works adequately to keep him dry and pleasant smelling.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild, but smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>nice part is that the scent is mild enough that you don&#x27;t smell it when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s mostly because whatever scents they use can be so completely</li>
      <li>Smells much, much better than Degree or Old Spice.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays.</li>
      <li>This scent feels more mature .</li>
      <li>People around me generally seem pleased by this too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for a typical 9 to 5 workday but</li>
      <li>Smells great and last a long time.</li>
      <li>this deodorant has a great, long lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>While that goes away a little too quickly, the antiperspirant is effective at 18.2%.</li>
      <li>another nice addition that is not overly stinky as my young teen boys say&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fragrance is actually nice and my favorite out of a few different ones I tried.  </li>
      <li>It pretty much smells like a bar of Ivory soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually fine with the first of these aims as it&#x27;s a fairly simple task to keep these hairs covered and out of sight.</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant stick applies clean and keeps me fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
      <li>The smell is so strong that I instantly get congested</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s not musky) but a gentle, sea breeze-kind of scent.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i really like that it is not over powering&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the Axe line and the Harmony Antiperspirant</li>
      <li>It does work very well to stop the bacteria that cause body odor and to prevent sweating.</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant scent, Harmony comes in many other products too, he thought he might look for them.</li>
      <li>It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes much due to the talc content.  </li>
      <li>Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t require an extra special care to avoid streaks and it stops the sweat from coming through.</li>
      <li>They smell okay from a distance, but with scent titles like &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; I was thinking this would be a softer than a typical Axe product.  </li>
      <li>I think Axe has stepped up its game in making its products more appealing to a general audience.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a antiperspirant that&#x27;s as effective as this one while also maintaining a decent smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And unlike other AXE brand items, the fragrance is very mild.  </li>
      <li>The container is wide so it fits the hand comfortably.</li>
      <li>If you can freely use cologne and other deodorants with no problems, then the scents may appeal to you.</li>
      <li>and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this</li>
      <li>Not that they smell bad but this smells much more like a nice cologne.</li>
      <li>It is gentle (doesn&#x27;t irritate), and you don&#x27;t have to reapply much unless you are outside in the heat or working out.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It allows for a similar number of applications as other products with the same kind of package.</li>
      <li>on easily, no stupid little holes...</li>
      <li>The stick goes on clear, and doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin at all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance masculine but not obnoxious</li>
      <li>So far no skin sensitivity.</li>
      <li>, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
      <li>It is a masculine scent.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to scents, you make want to reconsider.  </li>
      <li>but I never got past the fruit because it&#x27;s too strongly scented.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly.</li>
      <li>This is a decent if overpriced antiperspirant - it&#x27;s geared toward men but the scent is neutral enough to be unisex -</li>
      <li>The Current  price on Amazon is high at seven dollars.</li>
      <li>The second of these aims, however, is *not* something that I&#x27;m okay with for my armpits are skilled at producing ucky smells that cannot be hidden by mere cotton garments.</li>
      <li>Through a combination of plugging these holes and masking the pits&#x27; natural stink (with the smell of &amp;#34;Harmony,&amp;#34; in this case), I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long I can counteract</li>
      <li>This is a good &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; antiperspirant for those days that you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy.  </li>
      <li>I never tried their &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; scent before and truthfully I find the scent a little odd - almost like smelling a bar of soap.  </li>
      <li>The scent blends into your skin, creating a natural, subtle, clean smell.</li>
      <li>My wife complained that it didn&#x27;t smell strong enough.  </li>
      <li>I gave this antiperspirant to my teenaged son to try as he has enjoyed other Axe products I have purchased for him in the past.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken to do, then, is to counteract my armpits&#x27; efforts by smearing various concoctions of resins, gels, old spices and such upon them.</li>
      <li>This bar-shaped material from the Axe Corporation is one such concoction, and it has the bonus feature of (apparently) plugging the holes through which my armpits secrete their fouls smells.</li>
      <li>He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and last a long time. Smells much, much better than Degree or Old Spice. Not that they smell bad but this smells much more like a nice cologne. I would recommend to others. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 days now.</li>
    <li> My brother tried this product and thought he was drier and smelled great. The antiperspirant scent, Harmony comes in many other products too, he thought he might look for them.</li>
    <li> I like how well Axe antiperspirants work. They are very effective, last all day without a problem and don&#x27;t leave many marks in clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one though is too fruity. The citrus hits you like someone dumped a big serving bowl of fruit salad on you. The description says there is ginger and pepper in the scent- but I never got past the fruit because it&#x27;s too strongly scented. I have a love/hate relationship with citrus scents. If it&#x27;s well balanced, I like them a lot. This isn&#x27;t well balanced. It&#x27;s overwhelmingly citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice part is that the scent is mild enough that you don&#x27;t smell it when it&#x27;s applied. It&#x27;s not overpowering any colognes a man might be wearing. It is a masculine scent. It does work very well to stop the bacteria that cause body odor and to prevent sweating.</li>
    <li> This is a good &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; antiperspirant for those days that you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy.  It does the job well. And unlike other AXE brand items, the fragrance is very mild.  My wife complained that it didn&#x27;t smell strong enough.  So if you are one of those no-nonsense, no smell type guys, this antiperspirant is perfect!  The fragrance is actually nice and my favorite out of a few different ones I tried.  It&#x27;s masculine without being overpowering and my wife liked the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance masculine but not obnoxious&lt;br /&gt;Good for light use days&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily, no stupid little holes... just a simple bar!&lt;br /&gt;Works great if you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wifie says the fragrance is TOO mild&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t work well for men who need something high powered or if you are sweating or working real hard</li>
    <li> This product worked well for my husband who is physically active in his job and needs something that works for hours. I could definitely smell it on him, but the odor was pleasant.</li>
    <li> I really like the Axe line and the Harmony Antiperspirant hasn&#x27;t let me down. It&#x27;s excellent at keeping me dry all day, and smells really great as well. It&#x27;s the perfect combination of practical and smelling good.  The stick goes on clear, and doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin at all.  I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> This is a decent if overpriced antiperspirant - it&#x27;s geared toward men but the scent is neutral enough to be unisex - it&#x27;s a subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;male!&amp;#34; (it&#x27;s not musky) but a gentle, sea breeze-kind of scent.  I think the cost goes into the silver and black packaging - it&#x27;s a cool design that shows you how expensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, I didn&#x27;t feel that this product leaves you dry for 24 hours.  I wore it to work and then went to the gym afterwards. I noticed it didn&#x27;t fully block the odor.  It&#x27;s good for a typical 9 to 5 workday but beyond that you might want a stronger product.</li>
    <li> As with most axe products the aroma is just too much.  The overwhelming smell gives me a headache.  I have 4 teenage boys and I guess they like it because it does mask whatever body odor they have but my goodness this stuff stinks.  They really didn&#x27;t use this product; it seems to go on thin, didn&#x27;t last and holy moly it smelled. I would pass on this and go with Speed stick or Gillette.</li>
    <li> I gave this antiperspirant to my teenaged son to try as he has enjoyed other Axe products I have purchased for him in the past.  He like the scent of this Harmony line and says it works adequately to keep him dry and pleasant smelling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Axe products (I use their shampoo, body wash and antiperspirant).  I never tried their &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; scent before and truthfully I find the scent a little odd - almost like smelling a bar of soap.  This did an excellent job of keeping the perspiration away though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked the scent of most Axe products, although they tend to be on the strong side. This one-Harmony, sad to say reminds me a bit of mildew, so it&#x27;s not very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant itself seems to work okay, but not for an extended hot day, into work in the morning and going out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those deodorants that after you apply it, you have to be very careful if you are pulling a shirt over your head, especially a dark coloured one. It leaves white marks.</li>
    <li> another nice addition that is not overly stinky as my young teen boys say&lt;br /&gt;this one is not a deodarant just the anitperspirant&lt;br /&gt;but it does seem to do both for a little bit during the day&lt;br /&gt;i really like that it is not over powering&lt;br /&gt;and it is one that the kids like to use</li>
    <li> My husband isn&#x27;t fussy when it comes to antiperspirants, but he&#x27;s always had a &amp;#34;woah!&amp;#34; attitude toward&#x27;s Axe products. That&#x27;s mostly because whatever scents they use can be so completely overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting that he made peace with Axe&#x27;s Harmony Antiperspirant. The scent is rather lemony and doesn&#x27;t knock you over like the typical Axe scent cloud. The antiperspirant part works fine, he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you like Axe products but could do without emptying a room from the smells they use, this is the one you want.</li>
    <li> It has a potent scent that I find appealing. While that goes away a little too quickly, the antiperspirant is effective at 18.2%. The container is wide so it fits the hand comfortably. It is a solid which men prefer unless they like an aerosol spray. So far no skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I think Axe has stepped up its game in making its products more appealing to a general audience. They certainly have more products that are appealing to more than just middle school boys. This is a great smelling deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also an effective antiperspirant. It doesn&#x27;t require an extra special care to avoid streaks and it stops the sweat from coming through. It&#x27;s hard to find a antiperspirant that&#x27;s as effective as this one while also maintaining a decent smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market to switch up your deodorants, you should give this one a try. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> (My husband used this deodorant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes the smell. It&#x27;s mild, but smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue he has with it is the fact that it clumps badly in his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works great!</li>
    <li> this deodorant has a great, long lasting scent.  I have bought several AXE products (such as shampoo) and I would recommend their products to anyone.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in other reviews, I don&#x27;t like scented deodorants.  DE-ODORant implies the absence of odor.  But the Axe Anti-perspirant stick does a fine job and the scene is fine.</li>
    <li> This product has good scent and is quick and easy to apply. It allows for a similar number of applications as other products with the same kind of package. My toughest task is keeping my teenagers from using it up!!</li>
    <li> Axe Harmony Antiperspirant has a strong and pleasant smell that keeps sweat at bay all day.  It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes much due to the talc content.  Nevertheless, the Axe does not show up when arms are lifted up and nobody would know it was worn, as it cannot be seen.  It contains aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly to obstruct pores in the skin and prevent sweat from leaving the body.  The Axe contains also cyclopentasiloxane (reduces evaporation), dipropylene glycol (perfume solvent), stearyl alcohol (emulsion stabilizer), PPG-14 (polypropylene glycol) butyl ether (reduces skin flaking/restors skin suppleness), hydrogenated castor oil (resists moisture), talc (prevents rashes ), PEG-8 Distearate (helps water to mix with oil and dirt so that they can be rinsed away), BHT/butylated hydroxytoluene/butylhydroxytoluene (prevents oxidation).</li>
    <li> The scent blends into your skin, creating a natural, subtle, clean smell. It is gentle (doesn&#x27;t irritate), and you don&#x27;t have to reapply much unless you are outside in the heat or working out. Good product, great scent! Much better than women&#x27;s deodorants!</li>
    <li> Wow! This deodorant has a really great scent. Crisp ,clean and sophisticated. This scent is not overwhelming like some other AXE products. This scent feels more mature . I found that it lasted all day and left no marks on my shirt. If your looking for a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; scent in your deodorant try this product. The Current  price on Amazon is high at seven dollars. I have seen it for four dollars at local mass market stores.</li>
    <li> There is not much you can say about an antiperspirant besides it kept me from stinking up the train during the afternoon commute and allowed my underarms to stay dry and not create a stain. Another positive for me was that it doesn&#x27;t cake on or leave a nasty residue like some deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if it works on the afternoon MTA and NJ Transit commute, it deserves 4 stars. It would get 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t care for the heavy fragrance.</li>
    <li> About 2 years ago, I switched over to Axe products and have rarely been disappointed since. This product is no different. This particular product is a deodorant and not anti-antiperspirant; therefore, while it will not stop or otherwise reduce perspiration, it will prevent bad odor (actually mask). In this regard, the product performs very well providing about 12 hours of odor control in the form of a slight citrus ginger smell, not as overpowering as some others.  The product applies evenly and does not stain shirts. Also, it appeals to my wife quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I love the protection I get from Axe Harmony. It pretty much smells like a bar of Ivory soap. This antiperspirant stick applies clean and keeps me fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
    <li> Axe makes some pretty good products. They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly. Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays. Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
    <li> Great product, my son only uses the Axe brand for deodorant, he likes Harmony, but it&#x27;s not his favorite, he prefers Peace.  Despite the scent the product works as well as any of the other Axe scents, keeps him dry and stink free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a strong scent which is nice, it&#x27;s ok to smell some scent, but not be overpowered by it, so I have to give Harmony a plus for that!</li>
    <li> For reasons that they will not divulge, my armpits&#x27; primary desires are two-fold: 1) grow scraggly, awkward-looking hairs and 2) smell bad. I&#x27;m actually fine with the first of these aims as it&#x27;s a fairly simple task to keep these hairs covered and out of sight. The second of these aims, however, is *not* something that I&#x27;m okay with for my armpits are skilled at producing ucky smells that cannot be hidden by mere cotton garments. These scents bother the people around me, and they bother the non-armpits parts of me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve taken to do, then, is to counteract my armpits&#x27; efforts by smearing various concoctions of resins, gels, old spices and such upon them. This bar-shaped material from the Axe Corporation is one such concoction, and it has the bonus feature of (apparently) plugging the holes through which my armpits secrete their fouls smells. Through a combination of plugging these holes and masking the pits&#x27; natural stink (with the smell of &amp;#34;Harmony,&amp;#34; in this case), I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long I can counteract Armpits&#x27; Primary Desire #2. People around me generally seem pleased by this too.</li>
    <li> I received this Axe Harmony Antiperspirant through the Amazon Vine review program.  My husband tested the product.  He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.  He said that this product kept him dry throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this as 4 stars because of the cost of the product.  At the current Amazon selling price, this costs about double of a competing brand at my local big box store.</li>
    <li> I got the &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; scents, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t use either.  The smell is so strong that I instantly get congested and I have to shower it off.  They smell okay from a distance, but with scent titles like &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Harmony&amp;#34; I was thinking this would be a softer than a typical Axe product.  If you are sensitive to scents, you make want to reconsider.  If you can freely use cologne and other deodorants with no problems, then the scents may appeal to you.</li>
