### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent quality, service and price....HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
      <li>Great brush!  </li>
      <li>WORKS GOOD</li>
      <li>The bristles and shape are comparable but the quality and finish of the handle isn&#x27;t nearly as good the Fuller.</li>
      <li>Handle is very comfortable, fair price for a good product.</li>
      <li>IT IS A NICE BOAR BRISTLE BRUSH</li>
      <li>I own the 5 row and 7 row Diane boar bristle brushes and use them every day.</li>
      <li>It would have been a nice product in my opinion if it had held together</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s grayish and looks nice</li>
      <li>curly).&lt;br /&gt;Would have preferred it much more, if the \\&quot;wooden\\&quot;(?)</li>
      <li>Love it for my beard.</li>
      <li>The handle of the brush is light, I think it is made of a formed wood resin.</li>
      <li>This is a nice reasonably priced brush.  </li>
      <li>it looks a lot like cheap wood imitating plastic.</li>
      <li>This is more of a soft to medium bristle brush likely good for very fine hair but not curly or course textures.  </li>
      <li>But for anyone with thicker,longer hair, it just isnt good enough to get through tangles.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Great brush to keep looking sharp!</li>
      <li>not hardly as firm as a diane brush i purchased many years ago.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>It will not, or more accurately CAN not and is not meant to get down to your scalp.</li>
      <li>This is more like a smoothing/finishing brush, for example to smooth little flyaway hairs in up-dos.</li>
      <li>Fast service from this supplier</li>
      <li>Better off going to your local drugstore and paying a few more dollars for a brush you can see and touch.</li>
      <li>Nice and firm.</li>
      <li>Appears to be of decent quality.</li>
      <li>This product would be good for someone with thin hair, wanting to be gentle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>The very first time I used it, entire sections of bristles fell out.  </li>
      <li>Just feeling like I can&#x27;t get it right down to my scalp, but wouldn&#x27;t do without a boar&#x27;s hair brush for soft, smooth and shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>This is NOT a firm bristle brush.  </li>
      <li>I looked replacing an old Fuller brush until I saw they were going for over five times the price of this one.  </li>
      <li>Instead they are rather soft.</li>
      <li>The bristles are way too soft and flexible.  </li>
      <li>This is the brand of brush I have used for a number of years, last a long time and are better quality then a lot of the other brands.</li>
      <li>The firmness is just about right to gently get through to the skin - for medium hair (medium thick, medium long and medium</li>
      <li>but Who wants half of what they paid for?</li>
      <li>This brush is not very sturdy as in the bristles are very very soft.  </li>
      <li>If you want something that will detangle, you want a nylon/boar mix, or probably no boar at all if you have anything besides extra fine, thin hair.</li>

    <li> The bristles are way too soft and flexible.  I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, service and price....HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> No good, lost my money and time</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to an extra firm brush by the descriptions and even ratings but this is NOT the case at all.  This is more of a soft to medium bristle brush likely good for very fine hair but not curly or course textures.  I was disappointed and will be sending it back.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Nice and firm. Shipped quickly. Will see how it holds up in the long run. Appears to be of decent quality.</li>
    <li> Bristles not as long as stated. Not good for long hair</li>
    <li> Just feeling like I can&#x27;t get it right down to my scalp, but wouldn&#x27;t do without a boar&#x27;s hair brush for soft, smooth and shiny hair.  Handle is very comfortable, fair price for a good product.</li>
    <li> This is the brand of brush I have used for a number of years, last a long time and are better quality then a lot of the other brands. Fast service from this supplier</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Love it for my beard.</li>
    <li> not hardly as firm as a diane brush i purchased many years ago. i returned and company never refunded.</li>
    <li> This is a nice reasonably priced brush.  I looked replacing an old Fuller brush until I saw they were going for over five times the price of this one.  The bristles and shape are comparable but the quality and finish of the handle isn&#x27;t nearly as good the Fuller.</li>
    <li> This brush is not very sturdy as in the bristles are very very soft.  I thought boar bristles meant a little on the firm side.If your looking for a firm brush this is not it.</li>
    <li> The firmness is just about right to gently get through to the skin - for medium hair (medium thick, medium long and medium curly).&lt;br /&gt;Would have preferred it much more, if the \\&quot;wooden\\&quot;(?) part would just have been oiled, instead of being painted and/or varnished - it looks a lot like cheap wood imitating plastic.</li>
    <li> Great brush to keep looking sharp! What can I say? I own the 5 row and 7 row Diane boar bristle brushes and use them every day. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> IT IS A NICE BOAR BRISTLE BRUSH BUT I DO NOT NOTICE THAT IT IS ANY FIRMER.  MY HAIR IS THICK AND I WAS HOPING FOR A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE BUT THERE IS NONE.  IT WORKS GOOD AND I LIKE IT BUT I DON&#x27;T FEEL IT&#x27;S EXTRA FIRM.</li>
    <li> People may not realize that for Boar Bristles, this actually IS extra firm. You are brushing your hair with hair. It will not, or more accurately CAN not and is not meant to get down to your scalp. No 100% boar-bristle brush will, regardless of brand. This is more like a smoothing/finishing brush, for example to smooth little flyaway hairs in up-dos. If you want something that will detangle, you want a nylon/boar mix, or probably no boar at all if you have anything besides extra fine, thin hair. Not fair to give this a low rating because you are unfamiliar with 100% boar bristles. It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this purchase as I thought the bristles would be extra firm as advertised. Instead they are rather soft. The handle of the brush is light, I think it is made of a formed wood resin. This product would be good for someone with thin hair, wanting to be gentle on the scalp. But for anyone with thicker,longer hair, it just isnt good enough to get through tangles. I learned my lesson not to buy a brush online, unless I know the product. Better off going to your local drugstore and paying a few more dollars for a brush you can see and touch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as firm but it is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s grayish and looks nice but if you&#x27;re looking for a firm brush, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used it, entire sections of bristles fell out.  It would have been a nice product in my opinion if it had held together but Who wants half of what they paid for?</li>
    <li> This is NOT a firm bristle brush.  Will keep to groom cat.  Made in China.  Not suitable for scalp stimulation at all unless you&#x27;re bald.</li>
