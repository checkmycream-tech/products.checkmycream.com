<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my daughter likes in her hair</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughters ages 6 and 15. The older one uses the largest size. She has long hair and it stays up all day in this style. She did her little sister&#x27;s hair with the smallest bun and it looked really cute.</li>
    <li> They unraveled the first day i got them but otherwise, they work great!</li>
    <li> These little hair buns can be made out of a old long sock, cut at the toe and rolled, however these buns really blend with my hair color and they were super cheap so, why not?! They arrived 3 weeks before the expected time (which was 1 and a 1/2 months(from china)).&lt;br /&gt;You get what you see. Not sure what the material was but it reminded me of a plastic sponge.</li>
    <li> I received these earlier than was posted, I thought it was something else. The brown ones aren&#x27;t black BUT they are dark enough to not be noticed. These bun markers are good quality and seem like they would last long due to quality. I received two small ones and one larger one. The large one kinda stretches.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> if I&#x27;m in execelente conditions</li>
    <li> THEY ARE GREAT. I USE THEM TO CLEAN MY BRUSHES AS A DUPE OF COLOR SWITCH ;)</li>
    <li> Nice selection of bun helpers. They didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair was too thin even for the small one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great for a bad hair day :)</li>
    <li> good product easy to use i likeit</li>
    <li> Meh. Doesn&#x27;t stay in hair well. Took way too long to arrive for disappointment. Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> I got 3 larges instead of 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large like it says I will get. When I put the large on I think it looks too big. It would have been nice to get a medium like it said I would. I don&#x27;t think I like the large.</li>
    <li> It took really long to get here.. But I love it. The small one fits my hair the most</li>
    <li> I thought the large bun ring would be bigger, is more of a small/medium size.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and did the trick. The shipping was faster than I expected. I would order them again.</li>
    <li> love these.  I have really long hair and these really help me manage my long locks while working!</li>
    <li> Amazing set. Works perfectly. Enjoy the size options makes hair possibilities endless</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a few days now and I love them. They are a lot darker than what was pictured here but it still works so I&#x27;m ok with it. They are firm and allow a bit of stretching for those with thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos are of my messy bun using the smallest bun and 2 hair ties.</li>
    <li> Took longer than expected for this type of product arrived, I know it came out away from China, but they usually don&#x27;t take as long as this product did. Once it arrived it was in beautiful shape and I could use them immediately, all three are very useful. As long as you know it&#x27;s going to take a little longer I think its worth it cuz the price is much better than the competition.</li>
    <li> Donuts were actually a darker brown than expected but did the job well.</li>
    <li> I expected them to be a lot bigger lol my daughter has alotttt of hair and looks silly with the little bun</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re kind of hard to use, i looked up tutorials on how to use them and i still cant get it right,</li>
    <li> Held my daughter&#x27;s hair in a tight bun for her ballet exams.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Love these. Easy to use and cheaper than buying from any stores</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure these out. My arms got really tired trying to make it work. They are probably fine, but if you aren&#x27;t good at hair, don&#x27;t believe your friends that tell you it is &amp;#34;so easy&amp;#34; to use these.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you have too much hair.</li>
    <li> wife loves them took a little while to get here but worth the wait</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just what they say they are. No surprises or anything weird. Great product, especially for the price. Holds bobby pins well. No complaints about this product or the seller whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I got a set and a set for my granddaughter, easy to use, she can do all sorts of things with them</li>
    <li> Took A LONG time to ship, however still a fairly good product.</li>
    <li> The buns all arrived on time and work really well! Well worth the price! One of those rare finds of cheap yet quality. Very happy with this :)</li>
    <li> Cheap and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Different kind of buns</li>
    <li> The delivery was on time, and most importantly: the ítems really work. I&#x27;m satisfied with this set.</li>
    <li> it is cheap and it is easy to use, it is good item to have.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I was a little worried because my hair is really thin, but when I used if you didn&#x27;t even see the bun. I love them and use them all the time!</li>
    <li> Medium and small are basically the same size and both too big for long fine hair. Plus my hair is dark blonde light golden brown and these are too dark.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied once my sister in law done hair for me. Turned out to be useful.</li>
    <li> The three sizes are good to have.  The smallest can be used as a ponytail bumper or a bun for a small child.</li>
    <li> great hair sponges, fantastic price however shilling was painfully slow (almost 3 weeks) and even the large one is on the small side the other two are tiny and would only be fit for a toddler.</li>
    <li> Love it! &amp; it Arrived before the estimated time.</li>
    <li> These are the best and easiest way to make a perfect bun.  I&#x27;m stunned that even I can do it  LOL</li>
    <li> it´s likes look and good product</li>
    <li> They came faster then expected but I was expecting them to be bigger. They are very good quality for the price and super cute and easy to put in your hair.</li>
    <li> They arrived a lot sooner than expected, also great quality! I love them!! ❤️</li>
    <li> This is the best price I saw for these donuts. Usually, I would buy one bun maker at this price. I was so glad that these buns were much darker than seen in the picture. I have natural brown highlights in my black hair and my ends are jet black, therefore these did not show. I am so glad I made this purchase. I recommend this to bun heads. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just saying though, in the picture these donuts are an auburn-brown but what I received was a natural black.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters love these and all their many uses. I got them to curl their hair, but they love being all grown up with a bun, as well. It did take an extremely long time for them to arrive.</li>
    <li> Donuts were too small for my thick hair.  They would have worked better if larger.</li>
    <li> Works well! Definitely worth the price. Warning: don&#x27;t mess around with the material of the bun, it rips. I have shoulders length hair, but my hair is very thick. So I am now using the large bun. You don&#x27;t need allot of hair to use these, so don&#x27;t worry if you have short hair! Also these work well with my hair, they stay in, I like using them in my tennis matches. Perfect for a fast, cute way to style your hair. Note: comes from China so it might take a little while, but I got them quickly.</li>
    <li> We would recommend this item to anyone with long hair. It keeps your hair where you want it. Try it :)</li>
    <li> These bun donuts are very good in your hair. But the only thing is, is that I can&#x27;t fit the biggest one in my hair because it is short and barely the medium sized one. But the small one is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> These donut buns are amazing, and taking into account they are shipping from China arrived rather quickly.  I used the large one on my dd&#x27;s hair first, next I&#x27;ll try the medium, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the small one, but it is an amazing deal for a product that works.  Still using 2 years later, so they do hold up well!  Getting ready to order some more, just because they magically disappear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused. I ordered these and got one random giant brown donut in the mail. No other packaging. It does work pretty well, but I ordered this purely for the smaller sizes because I&#x27;m not one of those people that can pull off a bun bigger than my fist.  I just emailed the seller and I hope it can be addressed, because I think I got something completely different from this.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in brown but I received blonde. I am disappointed with this order.</li>
    <li> I use the largest one for my lower-back-lengthed hair. Super easy to use!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Amazing price for an amazing product. The material is high quality and is not flimsy or cheaply made at all. Perfect for sock buns, and night time curl-bun. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Im awful at doing hair and even i can make my hair look good in a short amount of time. Plus, these 3 are the same price that walmart charges for 1</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Good quality. great price. So easy to use. I use this everyday for work. Takes no time to use on those busy mornings</li>
    <li> This were PERFECT!!!  My friend was very happy to receive them.  shipping took a little longer than expected, but overall, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have extra long hair... To my waist..&lt;br /&gt;And I had to get really creative with it&lt;br /&gt;Ibwould highly recommend for shorter length hair. Easy to use. I didn&#x27;t really find use foe thw xsmall ones.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the varying sizes were great- I&#x27;m wearing one right now!</li>
    <li> Good price for the product and quantity. These get used all of the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice of sizes, and veylry good coloring of brown to match my hair!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Love the different sizes they are going to be great for my nieces!</li>
    <li> little is fine, but the medium is very small and the large is medium.&lt;br /&gt;The largest should be the size of a hand</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re all too small couldn&#x27;t use any. i was expecting the grand to be perfect sized but is actually very small. dissapointed but mybe will work for someone else who has shorter or less hair.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I have no skills with hair styles and I have a 6 year old who loves &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; hair dos.  She has very thin hair, and the smallest doughnut  created a thick looking large bun on her head.  It held all day on an active child who does about 100 cartwheels each day.  I bough at doughnut before, but it was smooth and the hair kept slipping away.  These have texture and it is so much easier to create a neat bun.</li>
    <li> these were not even the color i needed. got a browm so dark they were almost black. and the smallest one was still to big. they were huge and my hair is past my shoulders. if you hav  long very dark hair go for it. if not keep looking...</li>
    <li> My hair is only shoulder length, but I was able to use these with no problem.  There are a lot of great YouTube tutorials on how to make a sock bun for different lengths of hair.  These make it a lot easier than using an actual sock.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and if you have thin hair they really add some umph to your bun</li>
    <li> The grand is way too small, it looks bigger in the photo.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love using this. I use these nearly everyday. They give me so many options as to what I can do with my long, curly hair. I looked up tutorials on Youtube and found many ways to use them. I also bought my sister and set and she loves them as well. They do kind of have a weird smell to them at first, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> The large was not as big as I thought but they are of good quality. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> I honestly got these expecting to be disappointed, but since I couldn&#x27;t find anything better I figured for the price I might try anyway. My hair is very very fine, so most hair things don&#x27;t work in it. The color is as pictured- just barely light enough brown to work in my hair, but it DOES work. I was also really happy that I went with this 3 pack, as I thought only the smallest bun would work in my hair, but the medium actually seems to work best. Does take a while to arrive, but no longer then anything else shipping from Asia.</li>
    <li> Good, just takes a long time to put it in my hair, considering buying a quicker one.</li>
    <li> i cant use it since i have too much hair</li>
    <li> Good product for an awesome price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Instructions would be nice and make it easier.</li>
    <li> Love these. Took some time to arrive but came in perfect condition just as described.</li>
    <li> these are cool- too bad they don&#x27;t come in black</li>
    <li> Makes a perfect bun, super easy!!</li>
    <li> does it job and holds well</li>
    <li> Just opened the package, only came with two buns not three. I wasn&#x27;t even able to use them because I needed the small one and there was only medium and large.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. Very nice product, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Its fun and easy to use!</li>
    <li> to small, the fabric is to slippery and does not let the hair stick to it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my thick long hair.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I was expecting but otherwise it is a decent product</li>
    <li> They were not big at all. The biggest one was as big as a sock ,atually smaller. Don&#x27;t waste your time. It took a month for mine to get here in alaska. I usually get stuff in two weeks. I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> Fast shipper --- good buy</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Love that you get all three sizes.</li>
    <li> The medium and big one are great but the small one is to small! I dont know for what kind of hair or hairstyle is... But other than that the product came some days before and is great.</li>
    <li> Beyond what I expected! Needed the largest, but it&#x27;s great to have alternatives.</li>
    <li> These are great and easy to use. Also, a great deal getting the 3 pack. I have long hair and have found it easiest to put my hair in a ponytail, slide the donut over my ponytail, and then use a hair tie to secure my hair around the donut. I can then take my ends and curl and pin them around the donut or bobby pin them into place so that they are no longer exposed. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments when I use this and it is soooo easy to use.</li>
    <li> Even the smallest didn&#x27;t work for my fine hair. And why do you have to have a minimum of words when writing a review? There, That should do it.  :)</li>
    <li> The shipping took way too long but the product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go-to for mornings I can&#x27;t get out of bed, or prefer to sleep in some. Unfortunately, the sponge material has started coming apart and has made it more difficult to twist my hair through it. The large is by far my favorite, I have shoulder length hair and haven&#x27;t had any issue with it not keeping it all in there. I haven&#x27;t used the smallest one, yet, and don&#x27;t really intend to.. honestly.. although I wish there were a way to buy just the large one instead of all 3, without paying twice as much. I guess if I buy enough packs, I will have enough small ones to do all over my head before bed and wake up with curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will hold your hair at the gym, but I wouldn&#x27;t want it to harbor the sweat and bacteria..and it&#x27;s not really an ideal gym look. lol.</li>
    <li> I have long, thin hair, and these are just wonderful for a fairly quick up-do. They are actually really well-made--better than some of the others I have used. The material seems denser and does not compress as easily, so I think they will last longer. The color is just about right for my med brown hair, and the three sizes seem like they would be nice for different styles (although I haven&#x27;t taken the time to experiment much). The price is right on these too!</li>
    <li> This helped end my forever &amp;#34;bun struggle&amp;#34;. before this it took me forever to try to do a bun, I&#x27;m glad i invested in these.</li>
    <li> Very happy- works great!!!</li>
    <li> i love these buns. different sizes. i can make many styles  now.</li>
    <li> Such a perfect price, it didn&#x27;t come with the hairties or the bobby pins though, just came with the buns.</li>
    <li> The shipping took about 2 weeks to come in. Which is pretty fast. It does not come with elastic bands or pins. But I think these are way better. At CVS it cost $5 to $6 so I would recommend this product. Its amazing!</li>
    <li> These bun rings work as advertised and looks as described! It&#x27;s a hell lot easier using these than improvised buns from old socks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Took along time to get here</li>
    <li> works very well to make the perfect ballet bun</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and effective!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, worked great.</li>
    <li> Very nice and convenient. I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> The middle size works perfect for my daighter&#x27;s hair. The first set I bought stretched a little quickly but that was probably my fault. I ordered a second set to have as back up for dance.</li>
    <li> ughhhh my long, wavy hair doesn&#x27;t work with this. i was really excited, because buns never work -- especially not neat buns</li>
    <li> There work GREAT!!!!! I love how easy it is to fix my hair and they got to me way sooner then what I was expecting.  Thank you for your amazing service and product!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money. I thought the largest one would be a bit bigger, but it will work. Good quality. Ships quickly.</li>
    <li> Arrived one week earlier. Great items</li>
    <li> Seems like I got one small and two large.</li>
    <li> Work great in my hair</li>
    <li> Works just like it should. Took a long time to ship though.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. The buns are VERY small and fall apart after 2-3 uses.</li>
    <li> Took weeks to arrive from Asia..only had two tiny ones exactly the same size and one larger one that was not large enough, but it was very low priced. ..You do get what you pay for...nothing more</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Like having a bun shaper!</li>
    <li> the small bun is perfect size for my 3 years old</li>
    <li> not sure how they work there is no instructions so will have to check the internet to find out.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and dont like the way it looks in a bun because its all tiny, so i got these just for the large bun shaper but I do think I will be using the others too because the large one makes a bigger bun than I thought it would. There&#x27;s two ways I know to use these first you tie your hair into a pony tail and pull your hair through the donut and place it directly on your head and spread your hair around it and grab the excess hair and pull it around the bottom of the bun and secure it with a bobby pin. The second which I like more because it gives it a fuller look is to start off with a pony tail and pull you hair through keep the donut at the end of your ponytail and start to rolling your hair around the donut in towards your head and once its rolled into a bun spread your hair out to cover the bun maker if any of it is showing. I hope this helps and mine did come with a little paper with picture instructions, but i know it differs depending on the sellers.</li>
    <li> They come with no instructions or anything.  Arrived in a clear plastic bag.  Would be nice if they came with some tips and tricks or at least a bit of guidance.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  I love that the kit comes with different sizes.  Perfect for different styles.</li>
    <li> Took way to long to get... ordered over a week before recital and didn&#x27;t get them until 2 weeks after the recital!</li>
    <li> All but the largest bun ring was too small</li>
    <li> These were not shipped in a timely fashion and the first time I wore the big donut it ripped and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very nice and for a good price.</li>
    <li> wife ordered it.. Her everyday go to item...</li>
    <li> Got them far faster than I thought I would and the product works wonderfully. The color is actually better than it was in the picture and works great for my hair color.</li>
    <li> At first, it was hard because I didn&#x27;t know how to do it right way. After practicing and learning, finally I got it right. Other women gave me the looks of &amp;#34;Im jealous of your bun.&amp;#34; haha. But it is easily stretch out so I simply leave them for awhile then use it again. It is very reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and I love using them to make stylish hairdos. I get compliments every time I use these. Good quality and a reasonable price for all three!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product.  It stays on without coming loose and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m hoping it will last a long time since I intend to use it alot!</li>
    <li> Harder than they thought they&#x27;d be but they get the job done. Great color and great service.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but item as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure these out, but so far..... I LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> The buns are so small not big at all. The &amp;#34;biggest one&amp;#34; is smaller then your palm. If that&#x27;s what you want great ! Overall the package came so fast! That was a plus. But for my self size not like said in the description.</li>
    <li> Makes a ponytail much more professional.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sock buns, great price, timely shipping. Must have for bad hair days and wayyyyy cheaper than Old Navy, or &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27;</li>
    <li> The sizes in person are very small.  I was hoping for a very large donut for the &amp;#34;grand&amp;#34; size - these will work....but do not buy if you are expecting something a little more on the large size.</li>
    <li> A lifesaver for any dancer!</li>
    <li> The biggest one is good for medium to long hair which is just what I was looking for the other two are good for short hair and the smallest is good for really thin or little kid hair</li>
    <li> Got the product really fast...love it..love it</li>
    <li> Came almost a week before estimated which is awesome. Plus they are way easier to use than I thought they would be. I have short thin hair and could never get this look right until now. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I wear these things basically everyday! I&#x27;m obsessed! They match my hair color perfectly, and look AMAZING❤️ I recommend this things all the way!</li>
