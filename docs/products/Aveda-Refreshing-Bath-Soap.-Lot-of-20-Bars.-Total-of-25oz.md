      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and ver refreshing to use.</li>
      <li>I am so said that Aveda decided to discontinue to make the Aveda Refreshing bath soap bar.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to dry my face out a bit more, but after I put on my lotion, it&#x27;s actually perfect.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like everything else.  </li>

      <li>It is refreshing, it makes me feel clean after a day of grime.</li>
      <li>Love this soap due to its refreshing smell and it is great on my skin.</li>
      <li>They were like the bars that you would get in a hotel room for free.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts much longer than many of the store brands on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>These are good bars of soap but definitely travel size.</li>
      <li>I might as well gone to Super 8 and collected soap bars</li>
      <li>I only had one bar from a hotel but would buy it if I did not need to use a special kind of soap now.  </li>
      <li>I thought I had found a great deal on discontinued soap from Aveda, but apparently didn&#x27;t read the description carefully</li>
      <li>Was shipped fast!</li>
      <li>Love it, especially when travelling.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping and will buy from again</li>
      <li>I really like these soap bars.</li>
      <li>Much better than your typical bath bar !</li>
      <li>I like to suds up and wipe it off with a rag every few days to get more of an exfoliation (for my sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have no problem with this soap.  </li>
      <li>Seems to last a long time and doesn&#x27;t melt easy in the shower</li>
      <li>Smells nothing like the Aveda Refreshing Bath Soap that I&#x27;ve purchased from Aveda in the past.</li>
      <li>They have a light fragrance and last a long time.</li>
      <li>Somehow, Amazon needs to make it clear what you are getting.  </li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and never use bar soaps, but I was at a hotel and my face wash was in my bag, not in the bathroom, so I reached for this.</li>
      <li>I suspect that these were old samples from someone who worked at a hotel.</li>
      <li>Just the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the size really was smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now going to buy these, and I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re the same small ones that I got at the hotel.</li>
      <li>My wife has very sensitive skin, and this soap worked well when she used it at a hotel recently.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find this and thought I could get my last soap.</li>
      <li>These little bars lather well, but I have the feeling they aren&#x27;t very fresh, as there is no scent other than a rather &#x27;waxy\\&quot; one.</li>
      <li>Exaggeration, of course, but being a person with extremely dry skin yet allergic to nearly all products after a time</li>

<li> It was just weird, and seemed like it was not from Aveda.</li>
<li> I was wrong, again.</li>
<li> Hated it.</li>
<li> I had a feeling that it would be horrible on my skin, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>

<ol>
    <li> ITCHED LIKE YOU KNOW WHERE AFTER USING THIS SOAP!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have no problem with this soap.  It also lasts much longer than many of the store brands on the shelf.  I also like the smaller bars, easier for me to hold.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I would not have typically purchased small bars like this but the manufacturer has discontinued this line of product. I was surprised to find this and thought I could get my last soap. Good product and the vendor was quick and responsive.</li>
    <li> These are good bars of soap but definitely travel size. About the size you would expect to see in a hotel. Still happy with the quality and Aveda products are awesome. Just the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the size really was smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> I thought I had found a great deal on discontinued soap from Aveda, but apparently didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough- they were extra-small samples (hotel freebie size). Nest time I&#x27;ll be more careful- my bad!</li>
    <li> I am so said that Aveda decided to discontinue to make the Aveda Refreshing bath soap bar.  I have allergies and cannot use just any body soap or soap bar.  I was just getting used to this bar soap and now I have to go research for another one.  My expectation was to receive this small bar soap in an Aveda box packaging, but it came wrapped in paper (like the picture shown).  I never seen this small bar soap come in this packaging before.  It was just weird, and seemed like it was not from Aveda. The bar soap seemed okay but have not used enough to know if this was a bad decision.  I definitely will need to try the only bar soap Aveda has.</li>
    <li> I ordered this size of soap thinking that it would have the same aromatherapy as the regular sized bar.&lt;br /&gt;It does not.  A BIG disappointment in a very small bar.  Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Works great my grandson wanted this soap bar. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and ver refreshing to use. Much better than your typical bath bar !</li>
    <li> Great soap but no smell like the original.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Aveda would bring back this citrus refresh bar soap . This travel size has no smell at all.</li>
    <li> best bath soap I ever used</li>
    <li> Exelent product pity it&#x27;s not available in Canada</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!  I only had one bar from a hotel but would buy it if I did not need to use a special kind of soap now.  It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like everything else.  Exaggeration, of course, but being a person with extremely dry skin yet allergic to nearly all products after a time, this is how I feel.</li>
    <li> Love it, especially when travelling.  It is refreshing, it makes me feel clean after a day of grime.</li>
    <li> this is great for my sensitive skin and when I heard they were discontinuing it I freaked out and bought these little bars. fast shipping and will buy from again</li>

    <li> I really like these soap bars. So does the hubby. There&#x27;s not a strong fragrance that would turn off guys. The soap is great for normal/dry skin.</li>
    <li> Bag of mini-bars seemed to have lost fragrance and color was off.</li>
    <li> Awful. They don&#x27;t smell like the large Aveda &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; bars did (unfortunately, now discontinued). I suspect that these were old samples from someone who worked at a hotel.</li>
    <li> An ideal and useful Christmas Stocking stuffer.  Can&#x27;t go wrong on this item; I&#x27;m sure I will reorder next year.</li>
    <li> Arrived well before stated date. Great product. Will purchase this again! Using this product reminds me of all the times that we stayed at Hotel Oceana in Santa Barbara.</li>
    <li> I did not know that the bars of soap were so tiny.  They were like the bars that you would get in a hotel room for free.  Somehow, Amazon needs to make it clear what you are getting.  So disappointed that I paid so much for so little.</li>
    <li> I love these. They have a light fragrance and last a long time. I don&#x27;t share them with anyone because I want them all for myself. They make wonderful stocking stuffers, house guest items, travel items, and house gifts too.</li>
    <li> My wife has very sensitive skin, and this soap worked well when she used it at a hotel recently.  We bought the 20 bar pack; she loves it.</li>
    <li> Hated it. I might as well gone to Super 8 and collected soap bars</li>
    <li> These little bars lather well, but I have the feeling they aren&#x27;t very fresh, as there is no scent other than a rather &#x27;waxy\\&quot; one. Smells nothing like the Aveda Refreshing Bath Soap that I&#x27;ve purchased from Aveda in the past. Other than that, no complaints! Was shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Love this soap due to its refreshing smell and it is great on my skin. Seems to last a long time and doesn&#x27;t melt easy in the shower</li>
