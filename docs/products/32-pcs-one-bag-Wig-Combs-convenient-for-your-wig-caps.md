<li> The combs fall apart with the wire exposed which makes it very uncomfortable.</li>

    <li> PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED THEM FOR</li>
    <li> I like these for my wigs...they are not too long and dont snag in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SOO happy that I found these because I was still buying the wired wig combs that came as a whole, and I had to cut individual pieces with wire cutters.

    <li> Just what I needed. Combs received in great condition.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it the little fabric on these combs aren&#x27;t very secure and the sharp edges stick out and hurt. But they are bendy and flexible and that is a plus.</li>

I would definitely recommend them to others.  As long as you keep selling I&#x27;ll keep buying.  Awesome product! Oh and the shipping was amazing.  It was very fast and the sellers communication was superb</li>

    <li> Comfortable. Easy to sew on to wig cap . I don&#x27;t need to sew wig Down it is super secure. I even went jumping on trampoline, very secure.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THISE CLIPS THE BEST OUT OF ALL THE WIG CLIPS OR MY HAT AS I CALL IT THE COLOR WAS PERFECT AND THEY WORKED REALLY WELL WITH MY LITTLE FISHNET CAP THAT I  PUT ON FIRST WHEN I AM GOING SOMEWHERE IN DISGUISE. THAT IS HOW I FEEL WHEN I WEAR MY WIGS. I LOVE NOT HAVING TO WASH AND STYLE MY HAIR ALL THE TIME. WHAT A RELIEF! EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR WIGS OR HATS AS I CALL THEM.</li>
    <li> They hold my wig up well</li>
    <li> Good price for functional pieces. I sewed them into the lining of the wig, and have held up well and comfortably under &amp;#34;test wears&amp;#34;. Will update if they don&#x27;t fare well for 8 hours at the con! They are very flexible, I can&#x27;t imagine using them in any other way but sewn in.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took quite a while from China, which is to be expected, but be aware, it&#x27;s marked as delivered when it arrives at your local PO for delivery. Not when it arrives at your door! It took an extra 3 days to arrive after it was showing delivered.</li>
    <li> They do what they should</li>
    <li> It will serve its purpose. I was expecting different lengths, they&#x27;re all the same. I&#x27;ll use them that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> These were great I sewed them into my hair piece and they are soft and do not budge. I love their service. They shipped quickly</li>
    <li> wonderful. shipping was fast and the quality of the bombs are great they don&#x27;t scratch my scalp when i apply my wig and they dont pull my hair when i remove my wig. i would give 10 stars if i could</li>
    <li> Wig combs are nice have satin wrapped base. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of wigs arriving without combs or set in the wrong places for you, these are the solution! I can push them through between wefts from the outside of the wig and hide them (better than bobby pins!!) or sew them to the i side of your wig cap. These hold really great. I&#x27;m very happy I tried them.</li>
