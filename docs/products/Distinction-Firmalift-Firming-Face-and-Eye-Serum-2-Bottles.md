    <li> Thank you &#x27;Distinction&#x27; for the opportunity to rave about this product. I am 53 years young but I feel 30.  Firmalift is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and will continue to order it. Definitly works to smooth lines around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a very light eye lift. It goes on and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. It also lifts the skin over the eye...  Mrs. J. McPherson</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for years.  I use it twice a day.  Once in the morning under make-up and at night with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Picture was for product containing 1.5 oz .  Picture was wrong and only contained 1.0 oz.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work all that great for me.</li>
    <li> I like the results so far.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased 2 bottles instead of 1 because I use it on my face and my neck twice a day! I can feel my skin tightening throughout the day and when I wake up in the morning. Yes, I got a tan, but I&#x27;m in Hawaii.  Everybody&#x27;s tan here! I get the inquiries about losing weight and looking a little younger.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the end result!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this after I bought the face lift. This stuff starts working in a bout a week to see any real change. Worth the money. Give it a try..</li>
    <li> great service and have used the product for years.Very easy to use and not any heavy odor.Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It tightens the skin.  Use twice a day..  Your price was the best and beats all others</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, its very natural, good for your skin, not full of all that&lt;br /&gt;toxic stuff most other ptoducts add, I try other things but always come back</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I still love this product, however the Picture was for product containing 1.5 oz . Picture was wrong and only contained 1.0 oz. I WILL NOT order from this again.  I already receive this product every 2 months for $40.00...I sure will not pay $59.00 again.  I DO LIKE to be mislead.  Correct your picture OR get off of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good job and a great product, Way to go and worth the price. keep up the good work, my Friends</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I recommend it highly. It lifts and firms around the eyes and  I see an instant difference when my eyes are puffy.  I&#x27;ve used other products with no results.  Everyone&#x27;s tissue is different and not every product works the same way.  This product works great for me!</li>
    <li> I love what it does for my face...I get many complements !!!!!! Would buy it again from her !!!!! Thank You 1</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!</li>
