      <li>It smells good but for a cheap shampoo it is what it is.  </li>
      <li>My hair for some reason does not like most shampoos and will feel like I couldn&#x27;t wash it all out (even though I did) - but not with this kind.</li>
      <li>&amp; well now that I&#x27;ve got it after the first week it was awesome until it started leaving my hair greasy &amp; full of flakes not to mention bumps on my scalp.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
      <li>It felt good when I was using it and seemed to get my hair really clean but the true test is the hairdryer!</li>
      <li>love love love this shampoo, and I feel it is a perfect replication of the earlier version.</li>
      <li>I have used Herbal Essences for years, and always love their products.</li>
      <li>It is NOT sulfate free (just look at the ingredients!)</li>
      <li>and the conditioner is NOT silicone free!</li>
      <li>Will order more</li>
      <li>&quot; What more do you need?</li>
      <li>my favorite pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will not be using this stuff any more...</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even understand why they replaced them all with sulfate laden cheap fruity smelling stuff.</li>
      <li>This is infinitely better.</li>
      <li>A BIG LOL!</li>
      <li>missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found Herbal Essences smooth collection to use because it&#x27;s actually affordable, smells great and works!</li>
      <li>Well I figured I might as well try it since I paid for it, and I fell in love all over again with the scent</li>
      <li>Reminds me of my childhood :)  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell.</li>
      <li>Favorite shampoo ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo in the 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s and loved it!</li>
      <li>It’s a very light and gentle shampoo and conditioning set, smells good, and I love the way my hair feels afterward.</li>
      <li>hair feel very clean</li>
      <li>It really does a nice job and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>My very favorite herbs in the best shampoo delivered to my door gets no better than that.</li>
      <li>Recently I jumped on the sulfate free band wagon and I can&#x27;t say I have been impressed with any of the products I have tried.</li>
      <li>It smells really good and very soapy.</li>
      <li>when I used it without conditioning - my hair did feel a bit hurt but was fine when I conditioned again).</li>
      <li>My mom used this collection and like a lot of little girls, I thought that everything about her was the best.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to see that this shampoo is back.</li>
      <li>Now we get \\&quot;sulfate free conditioner\\&quot; but sulfate shampoo and \\&quot;silicone free shampoo\\&quot; with silicone conditioner.</li>
      <li>that I realized the shampoo is labelled silicone free and the conditioner sulfate free</li>
      <li>I used it throughout the vacation and remembered why I liked using it so much.</li>
      <li>Makes hair shiny, smooth &amp; \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>How deceitful to imply on the commercials that the conditioner and shampoos are sulfate free when they are not.</li>
      <li>Cleans hair fairly well and holds up all day, although you can tell its natural and not chemically fortified</li>
      <li>I was able to comb the tangles right out</li>
      <li>When I used it in pair with the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have this problem, but I&#x27;ve tried it with two other conditioners and it isn&#x27;t as ideal.  </li>
      <li>I also had to wash my hair every day because it does not keep my hair clean like comparable sulfate free shampoos.</li>
      <li>I wish Meyers-Briggs and even the Original Owners would have had some balls and did not sell out.</li>
      <li>I had been using this shampoo for years, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back on the shelves in some stores now, even more glad to find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Product did not have original scent.</li>
      <li>and I got excited “</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to clean all your hair, so you save money, too.  </li>
      <li>It turns out this is another thing my mom got right!</li>
      <li>As long as I&#x27;m alive and Herbal Essences is still selling this awesome shampoo, I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, this is really unethical of any company to mislead customers to believe that they&#x27;re paying more to have healthier hair, which turns out just a trick</li>
      <li>I figured it smells way too good to actually work!</li>
      <li>This is the stuff i was using when it first came out - same lovely sent same great cleanse !</li>
      <li>I remember this from my childhood - the late 90s were a great time!</li>
      <li>However, it does a great job as a shampoo and, when used with other products, will set you on the right track!</li>
      <li>It smells feminine and clean at the same time but best of all, actually makes my hair feel smoother!</li>
      <li>It leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>His exact words were: \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheap shampoo.</li>
      <li>Please be aware of this fact if you are hoping for or used to using sulfate free products as I am.</li>

    <li> I am mixed with THICK, very curly hair. Even though my hair is relaxed, it is still just as thick and the curls are only a bit looser. I have learned one thing from trial and error: only use products from the \\&quot;black people section\\&quot;. Unfortunately many of those products are laden with chemicals, parabens, and other ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce. This looked attractive to me because of all of the great reviews and the simplicity. One sniff of it, and Herbal Essences had me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair very light&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair feel very clean&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair feel very soft&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING scent that lasts all day &#x3D; my favorite pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Is a bit harsh on hair and on my scalp (but I have a sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shampoo every day and it works out perfectly for a nice refresher. I condition every day so I never see any damage (except once when I used it without conditioning - my hair did feel a bit hurt but was fine when I conditioned again). For any girls with hair like me, understand that this won&#x27;t fix all of your hair troubles and give you a perfect head of hair. However, it does a great job as a shampoo and, when used with other products, will set you on the right track!</li>
    <li> Proctor &amp; Gamble is horrible. I absolutely hate what they did to herbal essences and their REAL original Product line. They are fraudsters from day 1. I wish Meyers-Briggs and even the Original Owners would have had some balls and did not sell out. This is what happens when their is a monopoly in anything. Now we get \\&quot;sulfate free conditioner\\&quot; but sulfate shampoo and \\&quot;silicone free shampoo\\&quot; with silicone conditioner. A BIG LOL! I still have my original bottle from when I was in High School. THE INGREDIENTS ARE NOT THE SAME !</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it works well for my difficult, greasy-prone hair. My hair for some reason does not like most shampoos and will feel like I couldn&#x27;t wash it all out (even though I did) - but not with this kind. It leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> For me is the best shampoo</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so clean and smells fresh and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Mmmmmmmmm, this Herbal Essences Shampoo smells just as delicious as I remember!  I used it years ago and what I remember most is that wonderful scent!  Herbal Essences still smells Heavenly and has a rich, thick lather that you can feel cleaning all the way down to the scalp.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to clean all your hair, so you save money, too.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s Herbal Essences.  What do you expect?  It will clean your hair and in my opinion leave it dry as hell.  It smells good but for a cheap shampoo it is what it is.  I only ordered this to get free super saver shipping.</li>
    <li> i use all products from herbal essence and I LOVE THEM ALL!!  I used tresseme and pantene and alot of other different shampoos and conditioners but WOW what a differnce in looks and the way it feels.. Makes hair feel fresh new and light and shiny.  Just makes it feel so much healthier and cleaner.  I hope they never ever take this off the shelf!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and smells good. Cleans hair fairly well and holds up all day, although you can tell its natural and not chemically fortified so you get what you get with natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> Where did the scent go?  Anyways it is gone, making this shampoo pointless.</li>
    <li> works great, smells great and is cheap</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite shampoo/scent EVER! I look forward to washing my hair just so I can stand there in sniff the air haha.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff i was using when it first came out - same lovely sent same great cleanse !</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair very dry and tangled. I got this because I remember using it as a kid, and really like the smell.</li>
    <li> My very favorite herbs in the best shampoo delivered to my door gets no better than that. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my childhood :)  Glad they brought back this line!  The smell is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers up soooo thick and luxuriously.  I loved the conditioner and thought I would buy the shampoo as well.  In my experience, the shampoo works best with the conditioner.  It does make my hair feel less weighed down, but it seems to make my hair a tad bit frizzy.  When I used it in pair with the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have this problem, but I&#x27;ve tried it with two other conditioners and it isn&#x27;t as ideal.  It feels like it really cleans your hair and washes free of residue.  The shampoo smells amazing and the packaging of course is nostalgic and GREAT.  My only suggestion is to make sure you buy this as a pair.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t even understand why they replaced them all with sulfate laden cheap fruity smelling stuff. This is infinitely better. The nostalgic memories of middle school is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I used this shampoo for many years in the late 90&#x27;s and LOVED it!  I was so peeved when they stopped making/selling it.  So for the last 10+ years I have been looking for a reasonably priced, good quality replacement and couldn&#x27;t.  I have bought everything from celebrity hairstylist to drugstore shampoo and all of the newer H.E. products and never really liked any of them.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I was on my way to the grocery store (with \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; on my shopping list again) and I guess I had nothing better to do, but while driving started to reminisce about this old school herbal essence product and I thought, damn I miss it so much!  I ended up buying some Tresseme shampoo and conditioner, which is now sitting in my guest bath - that&#x27;s how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then (just last week) I found myself doing a happy dance in the middle of the local W-mart when my eyes spotted this H.E. shampoo on the shelf.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I started singing and dancing to the amusement of other shoppers and my husband calling me a freak. I tried to explain to him and asked him if he remembered me using it years ago, but he could have cared less.  His exact words were: \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheap shampoo. If you want it just buy some\\&quot;.  I did.  Bought like 7 bottles to stock up. It sounds silly, but it made my week!&lt;br /&gt;Just yesterday, out of the clear blue sky he says to me: \\&quot;Your hair does look a lot better since you started using that stuff again.\\&quot;  Hallelujah! Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways... here is what this shampoo does for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lathers great&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes hair shiny, smooth &amp; \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells divine&lt;br /&gt;4. Is affordable and doesn&#x27;t break the bank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, naturally wavy, strawberry blonde hair that has been high-/low-lighted and this product works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now I only hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it again.</li>
    <li> Product did not have original scent.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when they brought these back. I was even more excited when the commercial claimed they were sulfate free.  I immediately ordered 2 sets of shampoo and conditioner online because none of my local stores carried it. I was shocked to see once I received them that only the conditioner is \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot;. What&#x27;s absurd about that is sulfates are what produces suds so of course conditioners don&#x27;t have sulfates. How terrible to have an entire marketing campaign based on the assumption that people are too stupid to know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with sulfates is that they can strip your hair of oils. If your hair is colored,  as mine is,  it will strip the color faster.&lt;br /&gt;Not that it makes any difference but this is what I wrote on their Facebook page;&lt;br /&gt; I just received my Smooth collection shampoo and conditioner and I am appalled!  How deceitful to imply on the commercials that the conditioner and shampoos are sulfate free when they are not. It&#x27;s an entire marketing campaign focused on the publics ignorance of what sulfates do. Of course conditioners don&#x27;t have sulfates! I would highly recommend you rely on the nostalgia of this product to sell it and stop attempting to mislead people with false advertising.</li>
    <li> I remember this from my childhood - the late 90s were a great time! My mom used this collection and like a lot of little girls, I thought that everything about her was the best. It smelled so good, and when she let me use it before bed I was in heaven! Fast forward 15 years and seeing this on the shelf at the drugstore made me grab it instantly. This stuff is even better than I remember! It leaves my hair soft but not weighed down and I can still smell it at the end of the day. It turns out this is another thing my mom got right! You can never go wrong with a classic.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with the leave in conditioner in the early 2000s and I was disappointed when it was discontinued. I was so thrilled and surprised to see it back on the shelves! I have long wavy hair and ever since I started dying it, it has been a struggle to comb all the knots out after a shower. However this product makes my hair so soft and manageable and I&#x27;m able to run a comb right through it with just a couple tiny tangles to work out. So much better than before! It smells wonderful too! Thank you for bringing back this product and I hope they also bring back the leave in conditioner of this product too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve missed this shampoo and conditioner for 10 years!!! Leaves my waist length fine hair, soft  manageable without the added build up  all others leave behind. I will buy over and over, I hope they never again remove it from the market.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I am so glad they brought it back, and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it! The matching conditioner is great too! This is the ONLY standard shampoo I have found in years that doesn&#x27;t cause waxy/oily build up on my scalp. It leaves my hair light, soft, and smelling so fresh! If you have not tried it, please do! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This review is on the product, not the seller. I used this shampoo/conditioning set when I was younger (and less picky about my hair) and I remember loving the smell. I didn’t notice that it went off the shelves as I’m ALWAYS switching up my hair care regime. I was reintroduced to the product this past summer at my parent’s vacation home and I got excited “I remember this stuff, it smells so good.” I used it throughout the vacation and remembered why I liked using it so much. When I ran out of my salon shampoo and conditioner this last time I decided to go the drug store route, like I said, I’m always switching it up, I got this product and I’ve been using it and love it! It’s a very light and gentle shampoo and conditioning set, smells good, and I love the way my hair feels afterward.</li>
    <li> We had to stop using this product.  My daughter and I started losing so much hair each time we washed out hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Love the smell of roses, long lasting scent</li>
    <li> Used to buy this item all the time. The one I recieved was missing some and was watered down.</li>
    <li> I had been using this shampoo for years, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back on the shelves in some stores now, even more glad to find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I was having trouble with really smelly scalp with excessive grease when I started using different shampoos (I had no other choice)my scalp stayed that way for a long time, however often I washed my hair. I found/bought this product just the other day and started to use it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Voila, the bad stink from my scalp is gone!!! It leaves such lovely sweet scent on your hair all day long, just as i used to enjoy when I was using this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very mild and has REAL herbal extracts in it. I would not use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> excellent scent, everyone asked what perfume i used when I used this shampoo. only thing that matters would that there are no other functions such as repair, hydrating, softening, etc.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Will order more</li>
    <li> I am so incredibly thrilled that the Herbal Essences brand decided to bring this product back! I used to use this shampoo religiously years ago and was distraught when I could no longer find it in the stores. Since its heartbreaking discontinuation I have experimented with so many different types and brands of shampoos, and non has compared. While I do enjoy the other products Herbal Essences has to offer, this one stands taller than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is slightly course but also somehow fine. I have lots and lots of hair that tends to fall flat and dry out easier. It is also naturally wavy. I know, my hair contradicts itself. Recently I jumped on the sulfate free band wagon and I can&#x27;t say I have been impressed with any of the products I have tried. They dried my hair out, and zapped the life and volume right out of it. I stumbled across this gem about two weeks ago at the local grocery  and decided to give it another shot, hoping it still offered the same high quality hair care as before. Boy does it ever! My hair is coming back to life. It has volume, it&#x27;s shiny, and incredibly soft even after blow drying and straightening and basically massacring my hair. Even after using it a full two weeks straight ( I normally use multiple shampoos) its still performs well. Most of the other products start out working great for a short time then fall short. And the smell... OH THAT GLORIOUS SMELL! Remember that old commercial with that woman making all that suggestive pleasurable racket? Yeah that&#x27;s me. Even if u blow dry and straighten my hair the smell remains ever present.  Most shampoos don&#x27;t, my hair always ends up smelling gross.  Even the next day if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair I can still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this shampoo, and I feel it is a perfect replication of the earlier version. I would recommend this to denying.</li>
    <li> Great just what i remember!! Would def buy it again want to get the green one next see if its still the same</li>
    <li> A great shampoo ive used this almost all my years 16-25 ! ! ,still love this in my shower my hair feels so clean.</li>
    <li> Looking for the best shampoo on the market? You found it! I grew up on this shampoo (and the conditioner) and would always use it after swimming practice. It got rid of the awful chlorine smell, made my hair soft, added shine and smelled great. What&#x27;s not to like? I was so sad when they decided to pull it off the market in 2006 (when I was sixteen) and I just about cleaned out every bottle in the city. Giving Herbal Essences the benefit of the doubt, I began trying their other shampoos, none of which were even close to comparable. So I switched to another brand and just forgot about the shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this week when I happened to stumble across it when looking for the brand I was recently using. I think I even made a little joyful squeaking noise when I saw it, haha. Needless to say, I bought the shampoo and conditioner pair and tried it out- and it&#x27;s exactly how I remember it! Once again my hair is shiny, soft and smells like roses just like the old days! As long as I&#x27;m alive and Herbal Essences is still selling this awesome shampoo, I&#x27;ll buy it. No one will tell me otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice: buy it alongside the conditioner. Using the shampoo alone can dry your hair out, but that&#x27;s what conditioner&#x27;s for anyways. Massage it into your hair and let it sit there for about five minutes before rinsing. Then, beautiful hair! Plus, my boyfriend says it makes my hair smell \\&quot;sexy.\\&quot; What more do you need? Thank you Herbal Essences!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo in the 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s and loved it! I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back!!!! I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like fruit or coconut, so this is a godsend. This may be the only shampoo that keeps my hair (almost) knot-free and SO soft, shiny, light &amp; smooth. YES! YES!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Pricing is crazy. Target is the place to get this.</li>
    <li> UGH! I was so excited to see that this was back in stores because it brings back memories of when I was little and used to use my mom&#x27;s shampoo (this being the stuff). WELL what I didn&#x27;t take into account was that when I was that age I used whatever shampoo I could, and lately I have been using sulfate free shampoo because I am growing my hair out. After seeing the commercial for this product which advertised it as &#x27;Sulfate Free&#x27; I thought &#x27;perfect!&#x27; and went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner. It wasn&#x27;t until I brought it home that I realized the shampoo is labelled silicone free and the conditioner sulfate free... DUH. What a disappointment herbal essences! Well I figured I might as well try it since I paid for it, and I fell in love all over again with the scent but that&#x27;s as far as it goes. The sulfates dried out my scalp and my head was itchy after only two uses. I also had to wash my hair every day because it does not keep my hair clean like comparable sulfate free shampoos. I will not be using this stuff any more... It is NOT sulfate free (just look at the ingredients!) and the conditioner is NOT silicone free! Please be aware of this fact if you are hoping for or used to using sulfate free products as I am.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see that this shampoo is back. I have always loved the smell and the quality of this product. Plus, its a great price. Now if only they would bring back the hairspray in the original clear bottles!</li>
    <li> I love shampoo and conditioners that smell good but for some reason, my hair doesn&#x27;t! It seems like whenever I buy something just because of the scent it makes my hair feel rough and have lots of fly-aways sticking out everywhere. For this reason I&#x27;ve never tried Herbal Essences. I figured it smells way too good to actually work! When I saw there was a new smooth collection I was willing to give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product line! I LOVE the smell. It smells feminine and clean at the same time but best of all, actually makes my hair feel smoother! It felt good when I was using it and seemed to get my hair really clean but the true test is the hairdryer! At this point when I dry my hair, that&#x27;s when the bad shampoo and conditioners show their true worth and my hair feels rough and sticks out. With the Smooth collection, my hair actually felt soft AND smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my three year old daughter Paige because her hair seems to get tangled really easily so I need a really good conditioner! I was able to comb the tangles right out and I loved the way her hair smelled! When she cuddled up to me after her bath, the smell was as good as that baby smell I have been missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found Herbal Essences smooth collection to use because it&#x27;s actually affordable, smells great and works!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Sulfate-free and silicone-free\\&quot; hair products from a major company!  Awesome, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.  Shampoos typically contain sulfates (lathering and cleansing agents), while conditioners contain silicones (waxy substances that coat the hair shaft and provide the appearance of shine).  For a variety of reasons which I won&#x27;t get into, lately there has been a shift in demand away from these products towards more organic hair products that do not contain these substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust P&amp;G to capitalize on this trend through the use of purposefully misleading marketing!  Notice how the shampoo is labeled \\&quot;silicone-free\\&quot; while the conditioner is labeled \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;.  Think about that for a second and read the previous paragraph.  See the problem here?  The shampoo may be silicone-free, but it sure as heck contains as much sulfates as every other brand!  P&amp;G has some nerve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned cash on this joke of a product.  I stopped using sulfates and silicones YEARS ago and my hair has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> To start with, I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of P&amp;G products. But when this line was brought back I was so excited to try it out because it&#x27;s affordable and advertised as silicone free and sulfate free. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of research on healthy hair products and have always avoided shampoos with those nasty ingredients in it. After I&#x27;ve gone through an ENTIRE bottle of this shampoo, and was about to throw away the empty bottle, I saw it was labeled \\&quot;SILICONE-FREE\\&quot;, then I came back to grab the conditioner and of course it&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;. As another reviewer mentioned, this is really unethical of any company to mislead customers to believe that they&#x27;re paying more to have healthier hair, which turns out just a trick and we&#x27;ve all been fooled. It is obvious that P&amp;G does not care enough to eliminate sulfate from shampoos and silicone from conditioners, and they think customers are simply morons.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick hair and this does a great job at cleaning it and making it smell great.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product. It smells really good and very soapy. Combined it with the conditioner and you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used Herbal Essences for years, and always love their products. I like these &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; shampoos, since I am prone to grease despite having thick, wavy hair. This shampoo is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. My hair always feels clean afterwards and not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; like some other brands. It smells great and I&#x27;m so glad they brought this shampoo back. I remember it from years ago, and it still works just as well. I tend to switch Herbal Essences shampoos every month or so since I don&#x27;t want my hair used to one shampoo, but I always come back to this one. It really does a nice job and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I remember having this shampoo &amp; I loved it I hated it when it was taking off the market But when I heard it was coming back I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and tell all my friends about cause they wanted it too &amp; well now that I&#x27;ve got it after the first week it was awesome until it started leaving my hair greasy &amp; full of flakes not to mention bumps on my scalp. and that&#x27;s strange because it also went the same way for my friends Now I no longer use this or my friends.</li>
