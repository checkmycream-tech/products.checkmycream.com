### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>awesome product</li>
      <li>Fits wall mount dispenser perfect.</li>
      <li>Works great but a bit pricey.  </li>
      <li>Works great for disinfecting hands and adding a touch of softness too.</li>
      <li>Although the container leaks a bit of foam as it is being dispensed, the foam itself is great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>It works great for the dogs, and I love it as a hand sanitizer as well!  </li>
      <li>We have loved this foam ever since a hospital stay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but pricey.</li>
      <li>I bought this to clean our dogs&#x27; ears after seeing it in a hospital and thinking it would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>Will buy it again for sure!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more but wish I could find a better price.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>Easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>We have it right by the garage door, and it is very easy to use (we have the holder attached to the wall).  </li>
      <li>- trust me, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>In any case: Amazing product, MUCH better than regular hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>Quick to apply.</li>
      <li>exactly what I needed and arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands feeling clean and smooth, not dry like most of the hand sanitizers do.  </li>
      <li>And there&#x27;s a good amount in each can, it lasts a long time.   </li>
      <li>This product is great for a medical office or anywhere else that you would be working with constant germs like a nursing home or child care.</li>
      <li>Received some of this after a local hospital visit and man, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>This is a safe way to get your hands sanitized and get that extra level of protection.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out your hands, and we feel confident using the same foam as the hospital.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Very professional.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out our hands the way that many other hand sanitizers do and it lasts a long time (only a little is necessary!)</li>

    <li> This stuff is great. Just like you get in the hospital. We use it through the flu season.</li>
    <li> Although the container leaks a bit of foam as it is being dispensed, the foam itself is great.  Easy on the skin. Quick to apply.</li>
    <li> This product has a smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming. This product is great for a medical office or anywhere else that you would be working with constant germs like a nursing home or child care.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled. Works great for disinfecting hands and adding a touch of softness too. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it...just wish it had been the smaller version that sits upright instead of upside down.</li>
    <li> Falsely advertise and pictured.  It did no come with the holder and did not note that in the description!</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great but a bit pricey.  Fits wall mount dispenser perfect. I will be buying more but wish I could find a better price.</li>
    <li> buy this constantly.  use hunting / fishing / camping / tailgating / biking  ---- awesome product</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff they used at the hospital so I thought it would work well for the household. It&#x27;s good but pricey.</li>
    <li> We have this installed in the &amp;#34;Utility Bay&amp;#34; of our Fifthwheel RV. After handling sewer hoses and other items used in RV set up, it&#x27;s extra level of cleanliness. We use gloves, but you might still have come in contact with nasty germs.  This is a safe way to get your hands sanitized and get that extra level of protection. We keep two on hand!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not a fault of the bracket, but it does not hold. In any case: Amazing product, MUCH better than regular hand sanitizer. Very professional.</li>
