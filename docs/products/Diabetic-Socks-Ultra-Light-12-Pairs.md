      <li>I was impressed by the way the socks kept their shape after several washings.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;yarn\\&quot; in the top isn&#x27;t even spun -</li>

      <li>I might sound like a lunatic that I get so excited over socks.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad sock.  </li>

      <li>Great price, however, very light and the hem on the front is extremely poor causing great discomfort unless you very carefully put them on.</li>

      <li>the rare occasions when I need those.</li>
      <li>I had an idea that these socks might be nice because they&#x27;re designed not to be very tight fitting.</li>
      <li>They are comfy, nice and white, come out of the wash well, and they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
      <li>This was one of the very few disappointments I have experienced with Amazon.  </li>
      <li>These are great for summer wear - light and thin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good socks, but a little tight if you have edema.</li>
    <li> I have already sent a distasteful review to e-source complaining about the advertisment on the socks.  The ad says &amp;#34;Diabetic Socks, Ultra Light, 12pair, Crew/White Size 10-13&amp;#34; but the actual size is 11, which does not fit my foot. On the label when I received the socks says women&#x27;s size 10-13, men size 11. Their response was to blame Amazon for the labeling mistake.</li>
    <li> I love the fit and feel of these diabetic socks.&lt;br /&gt;exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy the black ones next.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who is on his feet all day. He loves them, the tops do not leave marks on his legs and they are very soft. We threw all of his old socks away!</li>
    <li> I purchased the socks for my grandmother who has alzheimer and is a diabetic.  The socks slips on easily over her ankles (which is very helpful for me as her caregiver) and they expand when my grandmother&#x27;s ankles swells.  The socks are light weight which makes them perfect wear for the spring and summer.  I was impressed by the way the socks kept their shape after several washings.  I would have imagined that the socks would have shrunk due to the light material but that didn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m definitely going to order more.</li>
    <li> My legs swell, and I need socks that don&#x27;t bind.  These socks are very comfortable.  They are thin, but that&#x27;s to be expected if you want a non-binding sock.</li>
    <li> These socks do what you said they would, I love them. I bought the white and will buy the black. Does not cut in to my legs and do not fall down. A great product for the price. I will buy them again!</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND PRODUCT. FASTEST ORDER I HAVE EVER RECEIVED AND THE  SOCKS WERE GREAT.</li>
    <li> Bought these to help a family member who was diagnosed with diabetes and circulatory problems to the leg. They were comfortable and kept up to the job which they were made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would also use them as a great compliment for physical activities/sports.</li>
    <li> These socks do the job, and for a good price. If they can sell 13 to 15 socks, they will be perfect!</li>
    <li> Great all the way around...comfortable, good quality, and a great value. These diabetic socks fit very nicely around the calf and leave no unsightly marks of being to tight. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered these socks for my husband who is not a diabetic but has trouble with swollen ankles.  He loved them and wears them exclusively.  They are so comfortable and don&#x27;t leave the cruel marks on his ankles like regular socks.</li>
    <li> I purchased these socks for my Dad and he absolutely LOVES them.  He says they are the most comfortable and easy to put on socks that he&#x27;s owned.  He would highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> like the socks and way feel I wear size 8 shoe and these are way too big have sock left over at toe or if pulled up the heel is way up ankle. Makes them uncomfortable in shoe.</li>
    <li> I had reviewed these socks before and given negative remarks and somehow the company thought it was ok to remove my comments without my permission. That being said these socks are VERY uncomfortable to walk in. They leave a terrible waffle pattern on the bottom of your feet and feel like you are walking on grates. Was a terrible wast of money.</li>
    <li> These things are huge, and very cheaply maid. Spend a few dollars more and maybe get a decent sock. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality on these socks is dramatically below what I expected. It&#x27;s been less than a month, and already the top edges on 3 pairs are \\&quot;unravelling\\&quot;.  The fabric has already become rough and brittle, despite following instructions for washing and drying.  These are the worst diabetic socks I have ever purchased.  I will go back to Wal-Mart and purchase the Dr. Scholes.  Its worth the trip to the store.</li>
    <li> Not diabetic quality .. band on top stops circulation.</li>
    <li> These socks are very comfortable and do not leave a line on the leg like ones we&#x27;ve had in the past.  They do not impair the circulation and they stay up, which is a big plus.  I would heartily recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great price, however, very light and the hem on the front is extremely poor causing great discomfort unless you very carefully put them on.</li>
    <li> I wear size 13 shoes, and it&#x27;s hard to find socks that are really large enough for me. I had an idea that these socks might be nice because they&#x27;re designed not to be very tight fitting. And I love them. They are comfy, nice and white, come out of the wash well, and they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
    <li> When I bought these socks, people who wore these socks they bought, said they were not any good. But I found out how wrong these people were. These are the most comfotable socks that I have ever worn, and also they keep my feet cool in the shoes I ware.    If you want a great cool sock try these, these are also crew socks, and they don&#x27;t bind up arround, your ankles.     I would recommend these socks too anyone, and they also come in colors, but I wear white.    I GIVE THESE SOCKS A 5 RATING ALL THE WAY AROUND, THEIR GREAT. Jim in Ohio.</li>
    <li> These are great and sturdy, non-binding socks, but I would not consider them to be Ultra Light. My foot is very wide plus bunions, and they are too thick for wear in most of my shoes due to those reasons. I&#x27;m keeping a few pair, but giving a few pair to Salvation Army. [[ASIN:B002DQW7ZK Diabetic Socks, Ultra Light, 12pair, Crew/Grey Size 10-13]]I got them in white.</li>
    <li> I might sound like a lunatic that I get so excited over socks.  But let me tell you, this is by far the best thing that happened to me since I became a diabetic. I spent so much money and time trying to find the right socks for my swollen legs (even here on Amazon) but nothing was close to these.  They are soft with a loose compression, which is great for my blood circulation, and its firm enough to give you the compression you need &amp; holds up beautifully on your legs and fits into my walking shoes very nicely. Thank you ARROWSON! You got a customer for life and I will recommend these socks to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my father so he could have some comfortable socks for the warmer months. The socks have wide stitching which helps with keeping his feet dry. He tried them on and they fit well, he is a size 10 (USA). The value is great so I hope they work well for him. Twelve pairs for under $20 bucks...can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I knew I wouldn&#x27;t care for them when I picked the socks up out of the box and cotton dust flew everywhere.  I bought PHYSICAINS CHIOCE brand ankle socks and find the quality of the PC brand much better.  CONS:  thick seam at toes  top of sock stretches like a web and looks like I&#x27;m an old man (sorry, no insult intended)  poorly made  made in Pakistan  PROS:  Cheap price  Great for those that like the \\&quot;old\\&quot; look.  ;)  I&#x27;m throwing these away and going to order crew sock with PC (made in USA).</li>
    <li> My husband loves them, he says they are comfortable and leave no marks on his legs. Good job!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the socks.  I received them perfectly packaged and delivered very quickly.  I would not hesitate purchasing from this seller again.  It was a pleasure doing business through amazon.com.</li>
    <li> The order came promptly. Great socks, but I had wrongly thought they would have seamless toes -- my reason for ordering. I was very wrong; but, it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
    <li> Husbands legs swell,socks very hard to get off. These are made well,except the stitching by toes and heal need to be of more thread. Dont last long,holes wear quickly.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present. It was great.. so many pairs of socks for such a good deal on the price. My Dad was very happy. Thanks again so much!</li>
    <li> Really nice socks; not thick &amp; fluffy, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after. I&#x27;ve found them ideal for me, as I work on my feet all day.</li>
    <li> The socks smell even after several washings. I can&#x27;t wear them because of the smell, so they aren&#x27;t worth much.</li>
    <li> I bought some diabetic socks (probable a different supplier) about two years ago - they were wonderful. However the last batch (and I tried to duplicate my order) were a disappointment. They ran small and do not fit well over my heel!</li>
    <li> they are too thin for me.  the price is ok, and are ok for walking around the house.I need some thick socks for a diabetic.</li>
    <li> Best socks for diabetics at the best price.  Now that I know how good they are, I plan to buy more.  Wish they would offer them in black too, not for everyday, but for when you wear dress shoes.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE FOR 12 PAIR OF DIABETIC SOCKS BUT POOR QUALITY. LOOSE THREADS THOUGHOUT THE BODY OF THE SOCKS. HOLES DEVELOPED AFTER WEARING ONLY ONCE OR TWICE. SEAMS AT THE TOES ARE SO BULKY, SOCKS HAVE TO BE WORN INSIDE OUT.</li>
    <li> One pair was considerably smaller than the other pairs in this group.  Otherwise, I was very happy with this product.  Very comfortable!</li>
    <li> These are not the same socks as prevously received. I&#x27;m not complaining about the quality as these are well made. However, they are made smaller and fit tighter then I like. Just not the same comfortable loose fitting socks as before. I won&#x27;t be ordering any more of these.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in these socks.  After washing a few times the socks loose their shape.  All of the diabetic socks I have purchased in the past have been very soft, these were not.  In the future I will continue to purchase Wal-Marts \\&quot;Dr. Sholls\\&quot; diabetic socks.</li>
    <li> socks are way to big the heel is about 3\\&quot; up my leg poor material holes in socks after using 3 o4 4 times</li>
    <li> Not a bad sock.  Does not leave a pressure ring AT ALL on my calfs.  I only wish that the bottom of the sock was a little thicker.  These are great for summer wear - light and thin.  Overall, an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> These socks were exactly what my husband has worn.  We have been able to get them from flea markets previously, but was surprised to be able to purchase them on line.  We were very pleased with them and also with the price.  Will be ordering more....</li>
    <li> Bought these for my grandma and she loved them. Great value and price. Great for diabetics and older ones who have larger calf muscles</li>
    <li> Not diabetic, but legs swell and this helps to keep from cutting off the circulation.  They do seem to run a tad small though.  Think I would have been happier with 13 to 15, even tho my normal socks have been 10-13.</li>
    <li> The socks were on the small side and tight. Left marks on my leg from blocking the circulation down my calf.</li>
    <li> This was one of the very few disappointments I have experienced with Amazon.  The company sent a product that was not as advertised.  There is no return slip in the package and when I wrote a review earlier they scolded me for not giving them a rave review.  I have since emailed them twice offering to change my review if they will work with me to return the product I don&#x27;t want.  No response from them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agnes Duffy Wyman</li>
    <li> i ordered these two years ago, and need to get more! my husband and i fight over them b/c they are the most comfy things. i am done with harsh socks that leave band-marks on my poor ankles.</li>
    <li> These socks are well made, but not light.  They are quite heavy.  Living in the desert, I can only wear them in the winter.  They are too thick to fit under any of my shoes.  I use them for slippers, and inside my snow boots...the rare occasions when I need those.</li>
    <li> Summer means lots of white socks. These fit the bill. They are comfy.</li>
    <li> The socks were as described and if fairly good quality. They were shipped quickly and have been wearing them daily.</li>
    <li> Its really nice to fine a pair of socks that fit, these are nice and soft, fit well around the calf, don&#x27;t cut into your leg. And you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe that some of these reviews are for the same product. Certainly the socks I received were not remotely soft and the tops are not \\&quot;elastic free\\&quot; unless they mean a separate piece or strand of elastic because the entire \\&quot;yarn\\&quot; is elastic.  I can&#x27;t even wear them at all because they are so harsh on the bottom of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very familiar with yarn because I&#x27;m an avid knitter and though most yarn has some natural give to it this is actually stretchy. The tops are overall elastic but not a very tight elastic. The \\&quot;yarn\\&quot; in the top isn&#x27;t even spun - it&#x27;s just a bunch of fibers held together without any twist at all. At the tops, they&#x27;ve taken a length of the yarn at the end of knitting and simply pulled it through the top loops - it&#x27;s not even tied off, but only enough to keep the top loops from unravelling. No wonder some people report that they fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer who left a good review mentioned a different seller, which also makes me wonder if they&#x27;re truly the same socks being reviewed or if different sellers are using a non-specific description for different items. No brand is mentioned in the description but mine say \\&quot;Excell\\&quot; on the label.I&#x27;ve bought Dr. Scholl&#x27;s but the tops give me problems with both my swelling ankles and my psoriasis - I need something maybe less textured. Time to get out the sock knitting needles, I guess.</li>
    <li> These socks are very nice, as they are light weight and do not compress the foot and leg, and they leave no marks on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am a 12 E and the socks stretch out and slip off my feet when wearing without shoes on at home.</li>
    <li> These socks are so comfortable. I have purchased other brands, but they were bulky with terrible stitching that rubbed the tops of my toes. These socks are Very Soft, 85% Cotton &amp; 15% Nylon. I hope that these MADE IN THE USA socks will be around for a long time, because I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> I believe I got what I paid for and they are completely truthful in their description.  They will be great for bed in the winter and I will, that way, give them light wear.  I do not think they would hold up for heavy wear.  But they will be wonderful bed socks.  Good bargain for bed socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/17/12  I am disappointed that after one washing the socks are horribly pilled.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and these socks are fine. They are good quality, but they do not come up your calf as shown in the picture. The last ones I bought did. These are a little short for me.</li>
    <li> Not very comfortable; the yarn is not soft, nor ultra light.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a much thinner sock - these are like uncomfortable sweat socks.&lt;br /&gt;But the price was great.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and keep swollen feet happier. What else to say? Good stuff. Like it. Likeit. five more words, two. one.</li>
