      <li>awesome conditioner for frizz control</li>
      <li>Best shampoo and creme rinse I have found for my frizzi hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is just about perfect.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells great!</li>
      <li>Hey, it was an awesome 4 days while it lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Working with this product was not so great.  </li>
      <li>but this time it still looked great</li>
      <li>This conditioner is amazing for taming my hair&#x27;s frizziness!</li>
      <li>Love it, and smells great too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read good reviews referring to this conditioner&#x27;s ability to define</li>
      <li>good:  </li>
      <li>For a product that&#x27;s lacking, it&#x27;s not the best economical choice to be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this conditioner works better even with cheaper price!  </li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>But this conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel as nice.  </li>
      <li>but conditions the hair nice.</li>
      <li>Best purchase of the year so far.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is very light and does not compete with my body wash.</li>
      <li>i am highly satisfied.</li>
      <li>Holy Crow does this stuff do what it says!!  :-)  </li>
      <li>In fact, yeah, I&#x27;m SURE I won&#x27;t use this ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff defines and KEEPS curls like no one&#x27;s business, but it&#x27;s NOT slippery, it&#x27;s NOT moisturizing, you&#x27;ll pay more for it</li>
      <li>i am highly satisfied.</li>
      <li>It smells great-- very fruity.</li>
      <li>Many people don&#x27;t like Herbal Essesnces hair products</li>
      <li>I personally really enjoyed using the None of Your Frizzness product line.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Now, I add olive oil to my combing conditioner to improve slip and moisture, and I found that I had to add A LOT more olive oil to this stuff to get it to work.  </li>
      <li>Why spend more?</li>
      <li>Fingers crossed...!  :-)</li>
      <li>The moroccan is better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t have everything!\\&quot; and happily stock up on a gazillion little bottles of this stuff, like a happy chipmunk hording nuts.  </li>
      <li>my hair naturally frizzes and this product is great.</li>
      <li>my hair naturally frizzes and this product is great.</li>
      <li>The conditioner also smells great -- no heavy floral scent, just the impression that I added some citrus to my rinse water.</li>
      <li>so I kept it down, and undoubtedly it will look great on Day 5 as well)!  </li>
      <li>The bonus is that this works well for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>but after using this conditioner, my hair is sooo straight:) no frizzness!  </li>
      <li>I am a follower of what&#x27;s called the Tightly Curly Method as designed by Teri LaFlesh in her awesome book \\&quot;Curly</li>
      <li>Works like a charm and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>It really helped with flyaways and gave my wavy hair a nice uniform look</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, time is important to me.  </li>
      <li>but it does make my hair soft and manageable and smells good too.</li>
      <li>of right now, Aussie Moist is winning.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of hair conditioners before, but this one has the best results, it makes my hair nice smooth, silky, frizz-free and barely weighs down my hair.</li>
      <li>Of the three I&#x27;ve tried so far, the award for Best Curl Definition definitely, without compare, no contest, goes to Herbal Essences None of Your Frizzness.  </li>
      <li>The test will be when I go outside in the humid air, but initially, after washing and conditioning, I was impressed with this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It also smells great, a kind of sweet citrus-y smell that is stronger than the scents of both Aussie Moist and Hello Hydration (actually, the scent&#x27;s a little stronger than I need it to be,</li>
      <li>great smell and works great with humidity to bad</li>
      <li>The core of this method revolves around choosing a good conditioner, applying to your hair after its been washed and is soaking wet, combing it through and then leaving in to define the curls and seal in moisture.  </li>
      <li>My curls are seperated and sit on top of each other more, making my hair look fuller.  </li>
      <li>I also had to use A LOT more conditioner, as the sheer high volume of it would help make it more slippery.  </li>
      <li>Hair is easy to manage and very soft.</li>
      <li>First of all, the conditioner had a light scent, not heavy at all</li>
      <li>So, after wearing my glorious, popping curls for 4 days, I am going to switch back to Aussie Moist in the morning for the rest of the week JUST to give my hair more moisture again in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>After slathering A LOT of conditioner on my hair and using A LOT more olive oil than usual, I was able to get the brush through my hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glad I tried it, but likely won&#x27;t use this again.  </li>
      <li>You will most likely have to get it on the internet, as I did.  </li>
      <li>Ever since my previous \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; combing conditioner (Herbal Essences Hello Hydration) began injecting a potentially harmful ingredient into its product (sodium hydroxide), I have kind of been testing a few conditioners to find my new perfect one.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice (as most Herbal Essences products do), but it did a pretty mediocre job as a conditioner.</li>
      <li>I know too much moisture can cause frizziness, but I expect conditioner to have a certain level of moisture that this product just did not have.</li>
      <li>I have really curly-kinky hair.</li>
      <li>It really works and I have tried a lot of products.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t care too much...</li>
      <li>This usually feels good, like my dry hair&#x27;s literally getting a nice, deep drink of water in the morning.  </li>
      <li>With this Method, you go through A LOT of combing conditioner, and I REALLY had to go through a lot of this stuff in particular just to get the brush through my hair.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, fine, frizzy, color-treated hair; so, when I wash and blow dry it becomes frizzy like I stuck my finger in a socket.  </li>
      <li>I love my hair and it needs its time, but hey, I got other things to do on a Saturday!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Essences, but I won&#x27;t repurchase this particular product.</li>
      <li>wanted a little more long-lasting curl definition, however.  </li>
      <li>I have natural, very curly hair.</li>
      <li>and when I went to rub it in, it was not thick.  </li>
      <li>Though I could tell during the combing process that it wasn&#x27;t nearly as hydrating as the other two (which, hey, to Clairol&#x27;s credit, None Of Your Frizzness is not billed as moisturizing, while Hello Hydration and Aussie Moist ARE), it became most apparent when I \\&quot;refresh\\</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, not too thick and creamy at all, just enough to massage into your scalp and rinses out clean and silky.  </li>
      <li>my hair felt soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re sensitive it might be overpowering).  </li>
      <li>but I really like this specific one.</li>
      <li>My hair looks soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>Hello Hydration did really well was keep my curls well defined for several days.  </li>
      <li>I use in college.&lt;br /&gt;Two bottles last me a semester and the set of these shampoo and conditioner serves its purpose very well.</li>
      <li>last thing I have to say about this is that as of right now, None of Your Frizzness only comes in a 10 oz.</li>
      <li>It made my hair slick and easy to rub the stuff in my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I use Herbal Essences pretty regularly and I try to switch it up every now and then to try different products.</li>
      <li>, my hair is very thick and coarse, and it loves this conditioner, it remains very smooth, moisturized, and vibrant until my next hair wash (on the 3rd day).</li>
      <li>After a quick ingredients check (no sodium hydroxide in this one...yet), I bought it and tried it this past</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about this, it works like a regular conditioner, doesn&#x27;t really take care of my frizz at all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure yet if this is the right product for my hair</li>
      <li>As of right now, I like to do my hair on the weekends, Saturday mornings usually, and that being one of my two days off from work, I want to be done as soon as realistically possible.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily fast, but with most conditioners, it weigh down my hair and leave a weird texture to it that make my 2nd-day hair look so rough, dry and flat, it consistently happens across various different brands.</li>

<li> The result is spirals of curls that are very soft, glossy, well-defined, not weighed down, and which don&#x27;t frizz.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pretty thick fluid, which is a cross between pink and orange in color.</li>
<li> The only downside is that my hair is also really dry after using it.</li>
<li> My curls are crazy defined after using this conditioner and I love this product for that reason.</li>
<li> It was a LONG 80</li>
<li> I&#x27;m tempted to leave the conditioner in and blow dry it to see what happens.  </li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to combat frizz, but it seemed to lack moisture and make my hair dry.</li>
<li> When following this method, you want your combing conditioner to have slip so that you can get your brush through your wet hair to get out tangles with as little stress damage as possible.  </li>
<li> Again it&#x27;s not very slippery, and it doesn&#x27;t alleviate the daily morning dryness like the other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this, it works like a regular conditioner, doesn&#x27;t really take care of my frizz at all but conditions the hair nice. But, on the plus side, the scent is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner yesterday night. OMG, my hair looks so silky! My hair is somewhere between straight and wavy hair, and I always hated looking like a lion because of so much frizzness. but after using this conditioner, my hair is sooo straight:) no frizzness!  I&#x27;ve been using a pantene conditioner, don&#x27;t remember the name. I bought this because Pantene conditioners were almost $6~7, and this was only $3~4 at Smith&#x27;s. I think this conditioner works better even with cheaper price!  Sorry for my English :)</li>
    <li> I have natural, very curly hair. It&#x27;s difficult to find something that will eliminate frizz, define my curls, and yet not leave my hair hard, greasy, or sticky. This conditioner is just about perfect. I wash my hair, and comb it through once to detangle it while it still has soap (shampoo tends to be too drying) in it. I then apply the None of Your Frizzness conditioner immediately after rinsing off, to very wet hair. I don&#x27;t rinse the conditioner out, just use a larger brush and my fingers to set the curls the way I want them. The result is spirals of curls that are very soft, glossy, well-defined, not weighed down, and which don&#x27;t frizz. The conditioner also smells great -- no heavy floral scent, just the impression that I added some citrus to my rinse water.</li>
    <li> great smell and works great with humidity to bad they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if this is the right product for my hair but it does make my hair soft and manageable and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with Type 4 kinky/curly hair.  I am a follower of what&#x27;s called the Tightly Curly Method as designed by Teri LaFlesh in her awesome book \\&quot;Curly Like Me,\\&quot; which changed my life.  The core of this method revolves around choosing a good conditioner, applying to your hair after its been washed and is soaking wet, combing it through and then leaving in to define the curls and seal in moisture.  This \\&quot;combing conditioner\\&quot; is never rinsed out until you wash your hair again.  Ever since my previous \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; combing conditioner (Herbal Essences Hello Hydration) began injecting a potentially harmful ingredient into its product (sodium hydroxide), I have kind of been testing a few conditioners to find my new perfect one.  My previous experiment was with Aussie Moist.  That experience was solid, 4 out of 5 stars (you can check out my review on Amazon for that product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a little more long-lasting curl definition, however.  One thing that Hello Hydration did really well was keep my curls well defined for several days.  The Aussie did it well enough, and my hair was a lot softer, but it was a little less defined than I was used to and my hair became frizzier faster.  I&#x27;ve read good reviews referring to this conditioner&#x27;s ability to define so I decided to give it a go one weekend. After a quick ingredients check (no sodium hydroxide in this one...yet), I bought it and tried it this past Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:  Holy Crow does this stuff do what it says!!  :-)  My curls were EXTREMELY defined, not a frizzy in sight, not a hair out of place!  Of the three I&#x27;ve tried so far, the award for Best Curl Definition definitely, without compare, no contest, goes to Herbal Essences None of Your Frizzness.  My curls are seperated and sit on top of each other more, making my hair look fuller.  It doesn&#x27;t just define, it also weighs the curls down, so I get lots of bounce and movement, even after three and FOUR days post-wash (I usually pull my hair fully or partially up beginning on Day 4 because it starts to get frizzier...but this time it still looked great so I kept it down, and undoubtedly it will look great on Day 5 as well)!  It also smells great, a kind of sweet citrus-y smell that is stronger than the scents of both Aussie Moist and Hello Hydration (actually, the scent&#x27;s a little stronger than I need it to be, but I like it, so I didn&#x27;t care too much...but if you&#x27;re sensitive it might be overpowering).  One quarter of the way in, I could tell by looking in the mirror that I was going to like the end result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is this conditioner&#x27;s only attribute:  the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad: Working with this product was not so great.  This product by itself has very very little \\&quot;slip.\\&quot;  When following this method, you want your combing conditioner to have slip so that you can get your brush through your wet hair to get out tangles with as little stress damage as possible.  Now, I add olive oil to my combing conditioner to improve slip and moisture, and I found that I had to add A LOT more olive oil to this stuff to get it to work.  I also had to use A LOT more conditioner, as the sheer high volume of it would help make it more slippery.  After slathering A LOT of conditioner on my hair and using A LOT more olive oil than usual, I was able to get the brush through my hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, time is important to me.  As of right now, I like to do my hair on the weekends, Saturday mornings usually, and that being one of my two days off from work, I want to be done as soon as realistically possible.  I love my hair and it needs its time, but hey, I got other things to do on a Saturday!  Working with this conditioner added at least an extra 10 minutes of combing time to each side of my hair (it usually takes me an hour, about 30 minutes on each side).  And the morning that I tried this, I actually was staying at a friend&#x27;s vacation home and left my computer and MP3 playerat home, so I had no music or movie while I did this...Ugh. I listened to silence occasionally punctuated by my cursing as I struggled to get my hair slippery enough for the brush to pass through.  It was a LONG 80+ minutes, let me tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is also lacking in the moisture department.  Though I could tell during the combing process that it wasn&#x27;t nearly as hydrating as the other two (which, hey, to Clairol&#x27;s credit, None Of Your Frizzness is not billed as moisturizing, while Hello Hydration and Aussie Moist ARE), it became most apparent when I \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; my hair in the mornings.  I do this, as instructed, by dampening my hair and applying a bit of conditioner to each section.  This usually feels good, like my dry hair&#x27;s literally getting a nice, deep drink of water in the morning.  But this conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel as nice.  It just doesn&#x27;t work well for my purposes in small amounts. Again it&#x27;s not very slippery, and it doesn&#x27;t alleviate the daily morning dryness like the other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  In fact, I feel like unlike with Aussie Moist and Hello Hydration, my hair in the morning gets all of its moisture from water and NONE from the None of Your Frizzness.  So, after wearing my glorious, popping curls for 4 days, I am going to switch back to Aussie Moist in the morning for the rest of the week JUST to give my hair more moisture again in the mornings.  Hey, it was an awesome 4 days while it lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I have to say about this is that as of right now, None of Your Frizzness only comes in a 10 oz. skinny bottle.  You don&#x27;t have an option to buy a larger one like with Aussie Moist and Hello Hydration.  Now if this conditioner moisturized and combed as well as it defined, I would say, \\&quot;Oh well!  You can&#x27;t have everything!\\&quot; and happily stock up on a gazillion little bottles of this stuff, like a happy chipmunk hording nuts.  But it doesn&#x27;t, so this is just another thing that works against me ever buying this again.  With this Method, you go through A LOT of combing conditioner, and I REALLY had to go through a lot of this stuff in particular just to get the brush through my hair. You would have to buy like 10 bottles at a time to prevent yourself from being at the drugstore every other minute.  And in fact, this Herbal Essences line is not popular among the masses, so you probably can&#x27;t even GET it at the drugstore.  You will most likely have to get it on the internet, as I did.  Yeah, shipping costs.  For a product that&#x27;s lacking, it&#x27;s not the best economical choice to be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...Yeah.  This stuff defines and KEEPS curls like no one&#x27;s business, but it&#x27;s NOT slippery, it&#x27;s NOT moisturizing, you&#x27;ll pay more for it and you&#x27;ll have little bottles of it all over your house everywhere.  Glad I tried it, but likely won&#x27;t use this again.  In fact, yeah, I&#x27;m SURE I won&#x27;t use this ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of right now, Aussie Moist is winning.  But I&#x27;m not done yet! I want a conditioner as \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; as Hello Hydration was! I am next going to try Tresseme Curl Hydrating Conditioner.  Fingers crossed...!  :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  The moroccan is better.  I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in how it controls frizziness.  My hair is thin.</li>
    <li> I use Herbal Essences pretty regularly and I try to switch it up every now and then to try different products. I purchased the &amp;#34;None of your Frizzness&amp;#34; after reading positive reviews, but I was disappointed after using it. It smells nice (as most Herbal Essences products do), but it did a pretty mediocre job as a conditioner. I know it&#x27;s supposed to combat frizz, but it seemed to lack moisture and make my hair dry. I know too much moisture can cause frizziness, but I expect conditioner to have a certain level of moisture that this product just did not have. I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Essences, but I won&#x27;t repurchase this particular product.</li>
    <li> The only thing that calms my &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; frizz!  Works like a charm and smells fantastic. A must have for the winter months. Why spend more?</li>
    <li> i bought this, along with the shampoo, to undo some damage caused by another product. my hair naturally frizzes and this product is great. after just one application, along with the shampoo, my hair was noticeably smoother i bought this, along with the conditioner, to undo some damage caused by another product. my hair naturally frizzes and this product is great. after just one application, along with the conditioner, my hair was noticeably smoother. the fragrance is very light and does not compete with my body wash. i am highly satisfied. i will order this item again and do recommend it.  . i am highly satisfied. i will order this item again and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and SERIOUSLY frizzy. Rainy day? I should probably wear a hat. Or a bag over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this product at Walmart one day, curious as to whether or not it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, I will NEVER use another conditioner. I&#x27;m not kidding. I buy in bulk just so I never run out. The smell is out of this world and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing for taming my hair&#x27;s frizziness! In fact, it is the only conditioner that works for my hair! I&#x27;ve used plenty of hair conditioners before, but this one has the best results, it makes my hair nice smooth, silky, frizz-free and barely weighs down my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily fast, but with most conditioners, it weigh down my hair and leave a weird texture to it that make my 2nd-day hair look so rough, dry and flat, it consistently happens across various different brands. But not the herbal essences none of your frizzness conditioner, my hair is very thick and coarse, and it loves this conditioner, it remains very smooth, moisturized, and vibrant until my next hair wash (on the 3rd day). This is one of those hair products that I can not live without! Definitely, recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for conditioners with anti-frizz properties.</li>
    <li> It actually was the snarky name that caught my eye.  The bonus is that this works well for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> awesome conditioner for frizz control</li>
    <li> I personally really enjoyed using the None of Your Frizzness product line. It really helped with flyaways and gave my wavy hair a nice uniform look (for once I didn&#x27;t have waves going every which way). The price for Herbal Essences products is also wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;But sadly the None Of Your Frizzness product line is becoming more difficult to find in stores :/&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I&#x27;d say to try out the product. Though don&#x27;t be expecting a miracle.</li>
    <li> Many people don&#x27;t like Herbal Essesnces hair products but I really like this specific one. It makes my hair shiny and manageable. I wish Amazon sold it in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, fine, frizzy, color-treated hair; so, when I wash and blow dry it becomes frizzy like I stuck my finger in a socket.  I have to say, I used the shampoo (same product) and then this conditioner.  First of all, the conditioner had a light scent, not heavy at all and when I went to rub it in, it was not thick.  It made my hair slick and easy to rub the stuff in my scalp.  I then rinsed it out and I have to say, my hair felt soft and manageable.  Usually, my hair feels dry like straw even after rinsing with conditioner.  I then let my hair air dry a bit and blow dried for 30 seconds and then used a flat iron.  My hair looks soft and manageable.  The test will be when I go outside in the humid air, but initially, after washing and conditioning, I was impressed with this conditioner.  It has a light scent, not too thick and creamy at all, just enough to massage into your scalp and rinses out clean and silky.  I even noticed I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my comb after combing it.  I&#x27;m tempted to leave the conditioner in and blow dry it to see what happens.  Overall, for the price, I recommend you give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I use in college.&lt;br /&gt;Two bottles last me a semester and the set of these shampoo and conditioner serves its purpose very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think Herbal Essences makes this anymore and I LOVE it. Too bad...</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and creme rinse I have found for my frizzi hair.</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters have long, thick hair and they&#x27;ve always preferred this product line.  Given a choice, this is what they pick every time so I have to assume it works!</li>
    <li> The only conditioner that takes care of my frizz problem.  Love it, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I normally NEVER get any results with &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;frizz-control&amp;#34; hair products.  I have mixed hair, and it&#x27;s just too hardy for anything but a perm.  After trying this, even after washing my hair and then sleeping, I only had a head of tossed curls instead of the usual struck-by-lightning do.  It definatley made my hair smoother than the Pantene line.</li>
    <li> It really works and I have tried a lot of products. This works. Will be ordering this product again. Hair is easy to manage and very soft.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great! I&#x27;ve used it for a cowash and a leave in and it works well as both. This is an affordable product that does what it says it does. Best purchase of the year so far.</li>
    <li> I have really curly-kinky hair. For those who use the curl chart, I would say that my curls are 4C. This conditioner was suggested to me by a friend and I use it for my mid-week co-wash. It&#x27;s a pretty thick fluid, which is a cross between pink and orange in color. It smells great-- very fruity. The front of the container boasts that it contains a fusion of Mandarin Creme and Pearls (pearl extract). I have no idea why those two ingredients are especially helpful to hair. However, this product comes through on its promise to banish frizz. My curls are crazy defined after using this conditioner and I love this product for that reason. The only downside is that my hair is also really dry after using it. I can usually remedy that problem by using another product to add moisture but this conditioner says \\&quot;serum-infused formula for moisturized softness\\&quot; and I got none of that softness when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;ll buy this conditioner again because it seriously reduces frizz and defines my curls but it is not a perfect product for my hair because it leaves it feeling dry.</li>
