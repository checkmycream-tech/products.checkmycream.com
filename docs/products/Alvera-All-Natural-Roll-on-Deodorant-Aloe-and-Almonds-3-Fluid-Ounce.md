<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Maybe I sweat more/worse than most people... I wanted this to work for me but it didn&#x27;t.  Within 4 hours I was smelly. It does smell good though.  Might be good for someone that doesn&#x27;t get hot or stressed during the day.</li>
    <li> I only use this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been looking for a deodorant without anti-perspirant which doesn&#x27;t leave me stinking after 5 hours. This is it! Love it. It actually works, unlike Tom&#x27;s or any other natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me stink. Tom&#x27;s makes me stink more than if I didn&#x27;t wear any deodorant at all. The Jason apricot makes me smell funny. This one keeps me smelling nice &amp; almondy all day. The only problem is it&#x27;s hard to find!!!! And I hate paying shipping on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review before, but I had to write about this deodorant.  This is by far the best all natural deodorant I have ever used.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, as every other all natural deodorant I have used is sub-par at best.  This actually works though--both at blocking odor and sweat.  I hope this product is made for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in July of this year and I was happy with it to start with. After about six weeks of use, I started having swelling and discomfort in my armpits. My boyfriend  noticed that the left side of underarm was a bit swollen and told me to stop using this product. I stopped using it and after a couple of days, the discomfort and swelling went away. I checked the ingredients of this \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; product and I found it had Alcloxca (an aluminum compound) and TEA (Triethanolamine), which is NOT a natural ingredient. Another ingredient is \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot;, which could be just about anything.  I would advise anyone to avoid this product, as it&#x27;s not really so much \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for years.  I have allergies and have reactions to all other deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried.  I even used the crystals and they dried my skin so badly it brought on a bout with excema.  This deodorant has been a life saver.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ll use it for as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I like this, very good product</li>
    <li> I made the switch to natural products, and I love this deodorant.  It smells like almonds which is one of my favorite scents.  Oh, and it works!  It keeps me feeling fresh, and I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I finally found a natural deodorant that actually works. This one has almond and I like the scent. It&#x27;s a roll on so there is drying time but after so many losers, this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use and feels nice and cooling.  I have given it to all my girls and they like it very much</li>
    <li> The only natural deodorant I trust to work.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff. He has very sensitive skin so there are many products he cannot use. This product does not agitate him.  It also has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> Works well.  The scent is ok.</li>
    <li> This is a good natural deoderant. Has a strong almond smell that doesn&#x27;t dissapate over time (in the bottle or under the arm). This is not a bad thing, but it is kind of strong. But, it doesn&#x27;t make me itch or sneeze. The only drawbacks is that it can be expensive and takes a while to dry. It doesn&#x27;t have any alluminum, which is probably a good thing. It has arnica, calendula, and coriander in it, among other things. I would buy it again, but I would also like to find a natural one that doesn&#x27;t have to dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to write, but it is very good product and i like the smell. My kids also like the smell</li>
    <li> I have tried them all. Nothing ever worked for me. This product is very affective on odor and it keeps you dry too (an added benefit). I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and works great</li>
    <li> Smells nice and does not have the aluminum in most over-the-counter deodorants, which I tend to think is bad for breast health.</li>
    <li> The deodorant goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  The scent is light and clean and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my perfume.  The fragrance and protection has lasted at least 24 hours (It could have easily have gone longer, but I needed to bathe!).  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product as I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and have had problems with burning and itching (Tom&#x27;s and Miessence) or a weird odor (Tom&#x27;s).  I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions or unpleasant odors with this product and it is now the only deodorant I&#x27;ll use.  I just hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, for being all natural it stays on all day. I love the soft fresh soft scent.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER written a review, but this product deserves one, their deodorant is amazing. I tried so many kinds of natural deodorants that never worked, but I discovered this brand over ten years ago and it&#x27;s always worked. If you are looking for an effective, natural deodorant, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I was in the search for a non toxic deodorant for years. I would try one, like it, and then after a few months, it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. Not the case with this one, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and it&#x27;s still the best. I do not love the wet roll-ons but the most effective non toxic deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried them all. I even give this as gifts- yes, strange, but people thank me once they start using it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this deodorant. I have a really tough time finding a deodorant that works for me; this works decently enough &amp; the scent is okay. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for sweat, so I have to switch to something else during the warmer times, but this is just fine for winter &amp; fall :)</li>
    <li> I was having sores under my arms. They were so painful!I looked up remedies and found how bad my deodorant was for me. So I tried this and wow! I have no sores and it lasts all day. It smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that does not have aluminum in it that actually works.</li>
    <li> The Aloe Almond Deodorant is okay. I have tried it in hot, California weather. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. I will probably use it in cool weather and may like it better then.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant around.</li>
    <li> This product has a decent smell, however it did not last very long, after about 4 hrs I started smelling funky.</li>
    <li> I used the crystal and Tom&#x27;s deodarant...and my husband definately asked me if I was wearing deodarant....he basically told me it did work.    Wish this deodarant...it works...I love it...I will never change my deodarant...they better not go out of business...or I will be seriously distraught!    Love Love Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and scent for years and I have never found anything I like more.  It does not have that aluminum that may contribute to Alzheimer&#x27;s in it, it does not have all kinds of chemicals in it either.  The only thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled from myself was the faintest whiff of almonds at the worst.  Now I have not done lumberjacking or roadwork with it; I&#x27;m an older female but I do walk my dog in the summer heat, I do garden, I do take long walks with my friends and while it does allow for some perspiration and dampness, it has never wet my blouses with a huge patch of perspiration, and never found my odor to go in the wrong direction.  It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;d track this down anywhere just to keep using it which I did here because the local store got sweet-talked into using it&#x27;s shelf space for someone local.  I plan on using this my entire life.  You should try it at least once.  Oh, and they have other scents.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law recommended this deodorant as I have been looking to stop using aluminum deodorants. It works much better than Kiss My Face deodorants, but one review on here stating that this deodorant has an aluminum derivative makes me a little hesitant to continue use. When I looked up the ingredient online, it had a rating of 3/4 out of 10 as being harmful.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use a deodorant that did not have aluminum or other harmful chemicals.  I have tried several that work somewhat, but this Alvera deodorant works and smells good!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Alvera All Natural Roll-On Deodorant Aloe and Almonds for several years and I believe it to be the very best natural deodorant on the market.  It smells great and it works great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant it works great only this is because its roll on you have to let it dry for a few minutes after applying it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all-natural deodorant, and some woman blogged about this one, so I tried it. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d really love it, but I do!!!  I didn&#x27;t know I could have such a wonderful deodorant that really is all natural!  I have tried Uncle Tom&#x27;s before -and besides the fact that they really aren&#x27;t all natural, it didn&#x27;t work great for me, hence my hesitation on ever finding one I liked - but I LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  (I should mention that it&#x27;s winter here, so I&#x27;m not running around in July… maybe then I might need something more powerful, but for now - hooray!)</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have used it for years and, while I have to reapply, it works better than most natural deodorants!</li>
    <li> It smells really good! However, after a couple hours it definitely wears off.. It definitely has to be reapplied a few times throughout the day!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 20 years and would never change for anything.  It is the absolute best.  It does not have a strong odor and it WORKS great.  It is not irritating.  I use to have to find health markets to find it, but no longer.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this awesome product.</li>
    <li> Worked Great for one week. Now it only lasts a few hours before I smell. This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used aside from Only Goodness Inside in 2 years. Thought this was a cheaper alternative but I&#x27;ll stick to O.G.I it costs more but it&#x27;s all natural and the max and ultra prevent odors or if you&#x27;re already smelly it kills odors. I&#x27;m very disappointed that this aloe Vera deodorant didn&#x27;t work plus I&#x27;m upset to see that it actually has aluminum so I will have to do another detox. Happy Camper I Am not!!!</li>
    <li> Only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. I have bought others at natural health stores and they don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
    <li> One of the reviewers CLEARLY did not research before making the statement that this product contains aluminum.  Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;75% ALOE VERA GEL, Herb Water (containing Arnica, Calendula, Gentian Root and Coriander), Alcloxa (contains allantoin), Glyceryl Stearate, Gum Arabic, Whole Oat Protein, Witch hazel, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Comfrey, TEA, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of those ingredients bother you, don&#x27;t use it.  I use this pit stick every day and it is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
    <li> I break out with a rash after a few days</li>
    <li> After using this natural deodorant product with good results for several years, I wrote a glowing review for them on Amazon.  I believed I had finally found the perfect aluminum free deodorant until another Amazon reviewer told me this deodorant contains aluminum...under another ingredient name. I did some research and discovered she was correct!  Alcloxa is a form of aluminum.  Very disappointed in this company that is suppose to be promoting healthy alternatives!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! I cant use regular deodorant as I am allergic to it, I have for years tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands, but still no luck. This roll on deodorant works for me yippie skippie to that!! This product has a real nice natural pleasant smell and it works!! Seller got the job done arrived promptly &amp; well packaged will buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I use these for years,very nice product,aluminum free and protect me for about 13 hours.I recommend it.Arrive fast and smell good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love it.It is free from all of the chemicals that other deodorants use.It works to stop odor even when you sweat.</li>
    <li> I love the deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using it for some years now.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant (natural or not) that works well for me. I recently read that it contains an ingredient called alcloxa. I have been unable to find any negative information about this chemical, which is made from an aluminum salt and has been used for years for skin-treatment. Therefore, I have no qualms about using this product.</li>
    <li> This all natural product works as well as any clinical strength chemical based product on the market.  I can not say the same for other scents or unscented versions, but if you have sensitive skin or a medical problem that the use of commercial products may exacerbate, this is the item for you.  Good for men and women alike.</li>
    <li> I used to think &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants didn&#x27;t work because the only one I had ever tried was Tom&#x27;s (which was horrible). A friend suggested I try this one and I have been using it ever since! I love the almond scent and love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. And it holds up at the gym.</li>
    <li> When shopping for a deodorant it&#x27;s important to understand that a deodorant is only meant to prevent odor, and is NOT meant to keep you from sweating, those are antiperspirants. That being said, this deodorant is awesome! My girlfriend and I both use it, and all I know is she never complains about me smelling like b.o., and I know she never smells like b.o. so I&#x27;d say it works really well. Because I know she&#x27;s not afraid of telling me when I smell</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I purchased this before creating an EWG report with its ingredients. Due to Fragrance and TEA (an 8 and a 5), it puts the deodorant at 3. Pretty decent, however your standard Dove is a 3-4 anyway... so this doesn&#x27;t really do much to make your routine more natural. Very unfortunate as this stuff works pretty well and does not sting my armpits as some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, Alcoxa, which everyone seems to be so concerned about, is only a 3 on the EWG scale. You should be more worried about the mysterious Fragrance that shows up everywhere, and TEA (in this case).</li>
    <li> Great deodorant that truly lasts, without the more worrisome ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past ..and could no longer find it .I am glad it was on Amazon .Ideal for someone concerned about exposure to chemicals include in many other deodorants.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I use, LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this because of the reviews but I guess my chemistry doesn&#x27;t mesh well with this deodorant. The smell of this deodorant is not good and it justdoesn&#x27;t hold off a day out in the sun. I&#x27;m going back to good tidings!</li>
    <li> Loved this roll on deodorant. Goes on smooth, smells delicious (almonds) and stays working all day. Plus, it&#x27;s supposed to be natural and price is reasonable. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Discovered that this product contains aluminum. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY natural deoderant that has worked for me. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. I have spent much more for less quality. I first discovered this deoderant at my local healthfood store when I was looking for natural alternatives. They stopped carrying it, so I checked Wholefoods thinking they would have it, but they didn&#x27;t carry it either. After trying all of the other natural deoderants and being disappointed, I searched on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t remember the name of the deoderant, but I remembered the packaging -- I was so happy to find this on Amazon!!! I will never use another deoderant. This works well as an antiperspirant, as well. All my clothes are saved! This deoderant works for hours! Absolutely love, love love.</li>
    <li> I switched to Jungleman unscented - love that.  And remember if you order these during a hot time of year to not leave it in the mailbox all day.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST EVER....my chiropractor recommended it because it even was awesome during his weight training and excercise.  It is the ONLY natural deoderant that works for me.  Must be the Almond one ;)</li>
    <li> Not only does this not work as a deodorant, the smell of the product is sickly and overpowering. I swear it made my armpits smell more than they would have with nothing at all, and the product perfume mixed with that was overpowering in a bad way. If you really need something natural, just rinse off with a little diluted lemon juice after the shower.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is awesome. I have tried other natural, aluminum free deodorants (such as Arm and Hammer, and Tom&#x27;s), but they did did not keep my armpits smelling fresh all day. This one does! It is wonderful for summer AND winter. The smell is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;AMENDMENT: UNFORTUNATELY JUST LEARNED ONLINE THAT THIS DEODORANT CONTAINS ALUMINUM! The whole reason I use this deodorant is to be free of the harmful effects of aluminum that so many deodorants contain. I bought it at my local health food store and have used it for years now. Unfortunately, it contains Alcloxca (an aluminum compound). WHAT WILL I DO NOW?! TOM&#x27;S DOES NOT WORK!</li>
    <li> Works well for me every day in the winter and every-other-day in the summer.  Great for sensitive skin!  Love the almond scent!</li>
    <li> This was one of my favorite deodorants that I used on and off for several years since I became conscious of the aluminum issue in most over-the-counter deodorants and anti-antiperspirants. This does not state that it has no aluminum, but I very recently just found information pointing to the Alcloxa (contains allantoin) being in the aluminum family.... VERY DISAPPOINTING, but I guess I&#x27;ll stick to my powdered coconut one.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff until I googled alcloxa, one of it&#x27;s ingredients.  Its aluminum + allantoin.  It should say anti perspirant on label.  Everyone here loves it bc they are under the impression that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum.  It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> Amazing how well it works for me. The way my armpits feel when I use regular deodorant, goes away when I use this natural alternative. Feels better knowing whats going into my pores is better for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well. No smells even after working out. Can&#x27;t get past the perfume like scent. Might be okay for grandmas or some women but not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about a year now and still think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate, Tom&#x27;s, Hugo Naturals, Crystal products, Kiss My Face, Naturally Fresh and homemade aloe/powder solutions and this one is still the best choice for me. I apply once in the morning and it works all day (I work at a desk and commute about 10 blocks to and from work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am going to the gym to work out (3-5 mile run), I find that I do need to wear a t-shirt that will soak up sweat, otherwise, I will have irritation on the underarms from the skin friction. Since this deodorant doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cake-on&amp;#34; it will be hard to try and swim/sweat and still expect coverage. In those cases, I just reapply. It&#x27;s small enough to carry around in my bag. I do find, though, that you have to wipe off the cap area after you close it because since it&#x27;s liquid, it tends to smear a bit once I screw the cap on after applying. That&#x27;s a slight annoyance. Other than that, I love how easily it&#x27;s removed in the shower (hated those secret brands) and it hasn&#x27;t irritated or changed the color of my skin. One bottle lasts me about a month and needless to say, I&#x27;m about 12 bottles in! Ideally, I would find one with no chemicals of any kind (as I&#x27;ve read this has some), otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. I&#x27;m not actively searching for another one, though, since this has worked so well for me.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I use, it is the only natural product that works! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works awesome; even in the Tx summer:)</li>
    <li> This actually works! The almond scent is really nice. I don&#x27;t like anti-perspirants, and this deodorant is the best I&#x27;ve found. No body odor even after exercise!</li>
    <li> I wanted an alternative to regular deodorant, I like the smell. Kind of smells like almond extract. My only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling after you put it on.</li>
    <li> works like a charm and it smells like a very luxurious  summer lotion !!  I also didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it staining my clothes or anything! dries very fast after application, and it really leaves my skin all soft and supple!  I really can&#x27;t talk about the aluminum derivative it contains,  I&#x27;ll let the experts judge that.  I can say though that after using regular very nasty deodorants all my life, this one feels like a great far more natural alternative for a change!! I&#x27;ll perhaps switch to a 100% natural ingredients next but for now I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this product!  also it really looks like this bottle contains enough to last for several months! that&#x27;s definitely something that makes me happy  too!</li>
    <li> A great product that keeps you dry. Has no fragrance and leaves no marks on clothing. A must  purchase.</li>
    <li> I love almond scented stuff but this doesn&#x27;t really smell like almonds, it actually doesn&#x27;t smell good on your body at all. Doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other run of the mill deodorant from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever had. After using synthetic stuff for most of my life, I decided to make the switch (there&#x27;s something totally unnatural about a deodorant that leaves a film for days on end, even after washing). I tried another natural deodorant, but it didn&#x27;t deodorize effectively. This deodorant does, and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I discover this deodorant and it works perfectly for me. Smell is good as well.</li>
    <li> Finally found a natural deodorant that works! I&#x27;m very pleased with it &amp; hope that it continues to be available, as I don&#x27;t want to have to go through a number of them to find a good one again.</li>
    <li> Best natural roll on. I have tried many.</li>
    <li> Great, natural product.  I love it but am giving it only 4 stars since when my husband uses it, it makes his skin itch.  Strange...     4/2017 I&#x27;m now editing this review  since I learned it has an ingredient with aluminum in it.  1 star only.   The whole reason I wanted a natural deodorant was to avoid aluminum.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap hotel shampoo , very thin liquid that  drips down my side after applying. Not happy, won&#x27;t ever buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite all natural deodorant so far. I don&#x27;t smell like onion b.o., it rolls on and dries nicely, it does not get on my clothes and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, which is good. My husband really likes this deodorant, but it&#x27;s really hard to find in stores. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this deodorant so far. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and just wanted to try it out; I don&#x27;t really care rather it&#x27;s all natural or not, so the origin/&amp;#34;naturallness&amp;#34; of the ingredients don&#x27;t really concern me too much.&lt;br /&gt;Rolls on a bit wet, but dries quickly with no nasty residue (yaaaay!) and has a fairly mild planty smell, kind of like aloe. I can&#x27;t really attest to its powers as an antiperspirant as I don&#x27;t really sweat that much even in high heat, but it does a great job controlling odor. Even after working all day my underarms smell like I just stepped out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used natural deodorants for years, pretty much every brand out there and even some homemade DIY varieties. But Alvera is my all time favorite deodorant! Love the subtle almond scent. I work in a factory and this deodorant lasts and lasts long through my 12 hour shifts. No burning or pit rash. Love that it is cruelty free and not tested on animals which is of utmost importance to me.  Love love love!</li>
    <li> Works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant, it smells so good like real almond, and the size is decent will last for awhile. love it.</li>
    <li> smells good, drys quick and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good deodorant.  I switch off with two other deodorants so I don&#x27;t worry about all the talk about what it might or might not contain.  I don&#x27;t use anti-perspirants for that reason.  This has a pleasant, light smell and seems to do the trick.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to all natural deodorant instead of the antiperspirant from the local store and I like the smell of this although sometimes it reminds me of my grandmother and I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad. It is cheaper here than at my local health food store and I like that I will order again</li>
    <li> Seriously great! Ive had it with the &amp;#34;gel sticks&amp;#34; that are sticky &amp; dont work, this is a great product if used daily on  clean skin. This works even better than the salt sticks, lasts longer. Im not a fan of scented products for the underarm, their is nothing worse than walking by someone that smells like that fake fresh rain smell, and I know Im smelling their deodorant....yuck,  I thought the almond scent would be weird, but totally so light, its fine for men for men and ladies no problem.</li>
    <li> this is a non-drying deodorant that does not make your body toxic -- and IT WORKS!!  it&#x27;s the only all natural deodorant that truly does the job!</li>
    <li> If you are seeking to stay away from aluminum discoloration and absorption from your deodorant, you will be pleased with this product.  No aluminum, fresh fragrance, bullet proof control of perspiration odor.  Absolutely no discoloration or irritation to armpits. Although I don&#x27;t perspire excessively, it also does a great job keeping me dry.  This is my go-to deodorant from this day forward.  FYI, goes on as a rather thin, creamy consistency that requires a few minutes to completely dry -- no white residue on clothing is another bonus.  Gotta love it to find a product that resolves so many common problems in deodorants !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I see from other reviews that there is a form of aluminum (Alcloxa) in this product...I found from a number of websites on hazardous chemicals that Alcloxa is considered low risk...I have more to learn about what the risks are.  Dissappointed to see that the containers had a sticky label applied covering the ingredients -- when I peeled it away, I do see Alcloxa as an ingredient.  Thanks to other reviewers for pointing this out.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product because it works great and there is no overpowering scent that comes with most other deodorants.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for years..no aluminum and it is gentle on skin!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this deodorant anymore after discovering it has aluminum in it. I make my own deodorant that works way better.</li>
    <li> Great natural deodorant! Smells amazing and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Only natural deodorant I have found that consistently keeps me smelling delightful. Most natural deodorants wear off halfway through the day, or don&#x27;t work to begin with. This one is quite liquid, so be prepared to give it a few moments to dry to achieve full effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I bought this locally. It works great and smells scoop good. But...it made me break out like non natural deoderant. I guess because it has aluminum which I didn&#x27;t realize but maybe it is something else. I  really wanted it to work but irritated skin is no fun. Great product other than that.</li>
    <li> The best ever natural deodorant!  I have tried so many natural deodorants. None seemed to work until alvera aloe and almond! (I have also tried the unscented  which did not work nearly as well.)My underarms tend to get sweaty easily throughout the day and this deodorant keeps the stink away. It&#x27;s the only one I use now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I have found it for less on other sites.</li>
    <li> I was kind of hesitant to buy this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.. But it sure did. It keeps me fresh all day and the best part about it is it is all natural and its smells soooooo good. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many of my friends and they all went out and bought it and loved it. If your looking for an all natural deodorant thats safe and will keep you fresh then purchase this because you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> i gave the product 3 stars mostly due to its efficacy - long term (day &amp; night). the odor is quite nice but it doesn&#x27;t last all day/ night as i&#x27;d hoped it would. in fact, by late evening, i feel almost self-conscious about &amp;#34;BO&amp;#34; &amp; needing to re-apply which wasn&#x27;t/ isn&#x27;t my general habit when it comes to pit deodorant. overall, its decent but all body chemistry varies so don&#x27;t assume my experience applies to you. i think it&#x27;s well formulated &amp; works great (for awhile) but by evening (again, for me) it doesn&#x27;t go the distance in terms of stink deterrence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for along time and was so happy that AMAZON sells it.  Regular Deodorant&#x27;s make me itch, break out, it&#x27;s terrible.  Been using this for the past 5 years and no problem.</li>
    <li> Works great! LOVE THE SMELL! Doesn&#x27;t clog lymph glands. Much healthier than chemical brands...anti persiperants</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. But I do feel that their product presentation is a bit misleading. I thought it was aluminum free but upon further review of the ingredients found that it contains a substance called &#x27;Alcloxa&#x27; which is more technically known as aluminum chlorhydroxy allantoinate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it because after spending a small fortune over the years on natural deodorants that left me ummm &amp;#34;not fresh&amp;#34; at the end of the day, this one does actually work very well. I figured it does contain aluminum but hopefully is a little better for me than other regular deodorants you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Looove this deodorant. It lasts all day and the smell is amazing. The only problem for me is that is kinda spills when i put it on. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;too liquid&amp;#34; so i have to clean the drops that fall when i apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> Using this for the past 14 years and it is still a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective and you can&#x27;t ask for more. More effective than the crystal.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work; you just have to reapply once or twice during the day...definitely the best &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
    <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found. It somehow seems to reduce my sweat in addition to masking odor, and the product scent is luscious (and frankly, I can&#x27;t stand most scented items). One star removed only because it does not always 100% work for my husband - namely if he&#x27;s been doing extended outdoor work. But really, even the chemical-based anti-perspirants don&#x27;t work 100% on that, either. I actually order this in bulk online because it&#x27;s not available locally since I&#x27;ve moved.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little wet, but it dries and is the first natural one I have found that actually works - doesn&#x27;t get wet during the day.</li>
    <li> I know that others have said that this deodorant still contains dangerous ingredients, but after trying 11 other safe, natural products that absolutely didn&#x27;t work (see other review for one that didn&#x27;t work), I&#x27;ve decided to take my chances and stick with this (on my 3rd bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a short ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;75% Aloe Vera Gel, Herbal Water (containing Arnica, Calendula, Gentian Root and Corriander),Alcloxa (containing allantoin) Glyceryl Stearate, Gum Arabic, Whole Oat Protien, Witchhazel, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Comfrey, Tea, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether or not this is safe, this really works for me. Through humidity and long days. NO REPPLICATION REQUIRED. I&#x27;m no longer worried about how my deodorant is performing-what a bizarre thing to have to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that it contains no animal ingredients, alcohol, dyes, artificial preservatives or bactericides.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT..free of the aluminum and it is very Effective. A great product.. I have&lt;br /&gt;purchased this herbal deodorant twice and would recommend it to those who want Natural deodorants without&lt;br /&gt;any chemicals added.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an all natural way to stay fresh throughout the day this is the product to use. Prevents body odor without having the toxic effect of antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> This Deodorant Feels great and smells wonderful. Its not as intensive as other main stream deodorants because it lacks those terrible chemicals but it allows you to sweat like you naturally should while battling smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Degree for the last 15 years and have unknowing been using antiperspirant and began to sweat profusely through my feet over the last several years. This product has helped me correct this issue noticeably--</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just some liquid that smells good. Doesn&#x27;t really do the job of a Deoderant.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Every other anti-perspirant caused irritation.  Eventhough it says deoderant, I think it is also and anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly drippy. When you apply it, it runs down your side and feels like someone came in your armpit. It also smells like dirt and hippies. I couldn&#x27;t even wear it to work because the smell of the product was so offensive.</li>
    <li> Straight-out, no deodorant worked for me before.  I looked everywhere for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals but that also worked.  Tom&#x27;s deodorant doesn&#x27;t cut it.  This one doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients and it works great.  One of my secrets.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I would recommend it for sure. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff and this is the best natural product that I&#x27;ve found. The smell is not over whelming and it dries clear.</li>
    <li> I love this deoderant and have used it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;I am not hugely concerned by the Alcloxa because I do use antiperspirant from time to time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema which can flare up under my arms and get irritated by regular deoderant/antiperspirant and this is pretty much the only deoderant  (including the crystal salts or other all natural lines) that I can use at that point.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it regularly and just use antiperspirant  when I am going to be more active or outside a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years. Works really well and doesn&#x27;t really stain clothes. A friend of mine has been using it for over 10 years as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodrant for three years.  Works perfectly! Even will cover existing smell. ;) Maybe only a busy mom of four would care to try that. I also have extremely sensitive underarms. I have tried many types...only this one leaves me smooth and un-irritated. Finally, it lasts FOREVER! In three years I have had three bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this at a local health food store, but they don&#x27;t always have it in stock. I Love it because it smells great, does not irritate my skin and keeps e from perspiring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It&#x27;s the only one that really, really works for me. Sometimes it is out of stock on the shelves, and I&#x27;ve only found it at health food stores (like Sprouts). Lately I buy several bottles at a time so I don&#x27;t run out, because you do NOT want to wait until the last minute with this challenge looming. I was very happy with the delivery of the product, the condition of the packaging, etc.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant- smells nice, works well, is easy to apply and soothing to the skin. The seller is wonderful (A+++) and the shipping was fast.  The item was well-packaged against shipping damage. Thank you so much for a terrific shopping experience!</li>
    <li> All I can tell you is my sister and my man have both been using this product for over a decade. They both like it and stand by it, and all of us like the scent. I can&#x27;t tell y&#x27;all how many times I have walked past people while shopping and I get a HUGE whiff of deodorant overwhelming my olfactory senses! Its like opening a container of Right-Guard or Sure and having a sniff. Gag! Who wants to smell like chemicals and manufactured scents? This deodorant smell natural, pleasant not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find they actually sold my deodorant online! Usually I have to drive 30 minutes out of my way to get this deodorant, but now when I&#x27;m running low all I have to do is order it before I run out! This deodorant does work, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty white stuff behind. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just love this deoderant.  I have tried just about every natural deoderant product out there - from the items offered at the grocery stores to designer items handcrafted and purchased off the internet.  This item was recommended to me by a friend over dinner, believe it or not, as we discussed potential links to antiperspirant ingrediants and disease.  She said she had purchased it at a local grocery store in their &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; section and, although it has a stronger scent at first, it is both effective and does not leave a rash.  The smell is quite &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; and maybe a little overpowering at first but quickly goes away after a while and mellows out into a wonderful, soft almond scent.  Best thing of all - it WORKS.  I had problems with other natural deoderants - something in them caused me to get a sore rash under my arms.  Other brands that I tried purchasing offline were ineffective or just too expensive!  This was my miracle product.  I have most of my friends and family using it now!  I was happy to find it available online to order, since the stores don&#x27;t always stock it.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to make the switch to a natural deoderant product.</li>
    <li> Both myself and my daughter use this deodorant.  Way better for your body than the deodorant with all the chemicals and it helps keep you from not smelling.  This is not an antiperspirant so keep that in mind if you sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that lasts all day for me and it has a pleasant fragrance. Shake well before using!</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday! I love that it is natural and works well especially given that I am in an office all day long.</li>
    <li> I am a big guy and do my fair share of sweating.  By the end of the day I usually have a little B.O. going. This stuff works better than any of the Anti-Antiperspirant/Deodorant combos on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that with this all-natural deodorant it protects all day from unwanted odor, and at the end of the day it washed off easily in the shower.  That is the problem with the everyday store bought Anti-Antiperspirant/Deodorant (like Speed Stick, Old Spice, etc.) which I have used for years, is that they are virtually impossible to wash off your skin after use.  I found that no matter how well I scrubbed my arm pits, the Anti-Antiperspirant/Deodorant would not fully get washed off which traps unwanted bacteria and causes your B.O to start up quickly, even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about all those chemicals seeping into my body since its all-natural!</li>
