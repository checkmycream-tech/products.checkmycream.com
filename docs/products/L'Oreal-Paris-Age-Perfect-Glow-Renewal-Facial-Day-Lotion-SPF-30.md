<li> This product is sunscreen, plain and simple.  </li>

<li> i would recommend after you check out active ingredients for sensitivity.</li>
<li> Yes, I have sensitive skin, but have never experienced anything like this.</li>
<li> Too late to return it since I opened the package</li>
<li> Advertised as a skin care product, this is basically a sunscreen with a lotion base.</li>

    <li> The product is OK, although I&#x27;ve received it today (6/29/2015) and it expires in Oct 2015.</li>
    <li> wanted more of a tint...</li>
    <li> Love this oil and so does my skin.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is not a product designed for the neck and chest as advertised.  It is just sunscreen.  Not a bad thing, but it is touted and advertised as being specifically for the neck and chest and it is ONLY sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This product is sunscreen, plain and simple.  If you look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s just sunscreen, no lotion or other ingredients.  Loreal should be ashamed of trying to pass off sunscreen as a neck, chest renewal lotion!</li>
    <li> Many users caution about this product.. but my wife says it&#x27;s the best&lt;br /&gt;to cover up some skin issues.  She also knows that she should &amp; does&lt;br /&gt;use a separate Sun Screen.. to the L&#x27;Oreall cream works very well for her.</li>
    <li> Advertised as a skin care product, this is basically a sunscreen with a lotion base. At about $35, it was definitely overpriced.</li>
    <li> I use this on face and neck, and so far, I love the smell, I love the non greasy texture, and I love that it has SPF 30.  i would recommend after you check out active ingredients for sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I look like I&#x27;m glowing. awesome scent. I wish they would use more organic products.</li>
    <li> Is a nice product to apply, your skin feels good, not grease and it protec fron the sun</li>
    <li> I put this on my face today, and six hours later, I look like the inside of a ripe watermelon. Yes, I have sensitive skin, but have never experienced anything like this. The description says it will make my skin glow, but don&#x27;t think they meant bright RED!  Beware.</li>
    <li> Smooth as silk! The glow is for real! Great on my skin- ( 1/2 Filipino 1/2 Caucasian).</li>
    <li> This and all the products from Loreal in there newest group of creams are great. It absorbs great in my skin. I Use with the oil renewal product.</li>
    <li> Smells fragrant clean and kicks out the dry lines.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, never disappointed</li>
    <li> I use loreal products all the time but this one did not agree with my skin.  Too late to return it since I opened the package</li>
    <li> I am optimistic now since having bought this lotion after reading positive reviews on another site. Sunscreens in face lotions tend to make my face turn red or sting. This did not do that. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the smell, but it fades away. Otherwise, I think this is a great product and love that it was an spf of 30 because I am very fair-skinned.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great for older skin - very moisturizing ... Love that it&#x27;s 30 SPF - highly recommend for women that need heavy moisture</li>
