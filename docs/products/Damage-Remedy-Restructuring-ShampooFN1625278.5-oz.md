      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love their products to the point of absurdity.</li>
      <li>love love this stuff for my hair</li>
      <li>but i think amazon should take more care in packaging</li>
      <li>and I have never seen a difference in my hair color even when I try to use \\&quot;color safe\\&quot; hair products, but I can say that I have tried all kinds of brands (from Paul Mitchell and Redkin to Herbal Essences) and this brand is my favorite of all time.</li>

      <li>But to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>In looking at the ingredients, it would seem to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than other shampoos, but there are many ingredients with chemical names I don&#x27;t recognize.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is kind of dry and damaged because of it.</li>
      <li>It is so nice on my hair - I will continue to use this product along with all the other Aveda products.</li>

      <li>It works very well to control damaged hair and does not cause any irritation.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The price is also much cheaper than anywhere,i have been using aveda for my hair since 4 years and now i started using aveda prodcuts for my face too.</li>
      <li>When I began coloring my hair, I asked my hairdresser to recommend a product that (a) would smooth and control the inevitable damage that coloring does and (b) not cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and healthy, is soft to touch rather than dry and damaged, and the shampoo smells natural rather than overly-perfumed.</li>
      <li>this stuff works great on my thick, messy hair, wish it cost less, but I have never used anything better, makes hair very soft</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo religiously for the past year and my hair is back to original healthy condition.</li>
      <li>Damage Remedy Intensive Restructuring Treatment--/4.2OZ]], and my hair feels soft and looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes it soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I only use this once a week, because I don&#x27;t want too much protein in my hair, which will cause it to be drier.</li>
      <li>product worked on Day #1, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
      <li>This shampoo keeps the tips looking soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>have seriously had better results from Suave purchased at Walmart.</li>
      <li>I gave it a 3 because most of the time amazons packaging is not good.</li>
      <li>*really* damaged and dry.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, especially for those with african american natural or relaxed hair.</li>

<li> Highly recommended, especially for those with african american natural or relaxed hair.</li>

<li> - it really made my hair dry and limp.</li>
<li> My hair is long and at the tips</li>
<li> If your hair is really dry and thick get Redken Real Control Shampoo and Conditioner instead.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be a shampoo expert; I don&#x27;t know much about what ingredients mean which things</li>
<li> I actually get a little panicky when I&#x27;m running low.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
<li> Whenever I use this shampoo and/or the accompanying conditioner, my hair is completely lifeless, dull, and unruly.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not really getting the results I read about.</li>
<li> Aveda shampoos are expensive but worth the investment.</li>
<li> , i have thick hair and this shampoo gets rid of all the product build-up yet doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
<li> I normally love Aveda&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners but this particular shampoo smells absolutely terrible.  </li>
<li> and i find myself only using very little of it to do the job</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll use this shampoo every other week or so to give my hair some protein and build it up.</li>
<li> This is by far the most overpriced, horrible hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
<li> I go back to Aveda Damage Remedy, and it&#x27;s dull, lifeless, and almost &#x27;sticky&#x27;.  </li>
<li> I color my hair regularly and had a pretty horrible experience with a hair colorist who clearly had no idea</li>
<li> And the price is half of the Aveda Damage Remedy Products.</li>
<li> but this shampoo is too harsh for my hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been a few months now</li>
<li> But as the price is much cheaper i started ordering from them again,last week i had the same situation the shampoo was leaking so bad because packaging was not good</li>
<li> I have very thick, wavy and dry hair.</li>
<li> This shampoo strips my thick, colored hair of all its oils.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using this wrong, but today my hair feels weighed down and not bouncy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve then tried using a different brand of shampoo the next day, thinking that maybe it&#x27;s just my chemistry or something and that if it was the case, my hair would still be nasty.  </li>
<li> Initially I did not like the smell, but in the shower its not so bad.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, yes.</li>
<li> what she was doing: my color looked awful and required 2 additional coloring sessions to correct it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I will always come back to this product</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and Aveda products are some of the only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t break me out. When I began coloring my hair, I asked my hairdresser to recommend a product that (a) would smooth and control the inevitable damage that coloring does and (b) not cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was her recommendation. She was spot-on. It works very well to control damaged hair and does not cause any irritation. I also use [[ASIN:B002CMLRX8 Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]] and [[ASIN:B0016JFH3O AVEDA by Aveda: Damage Remedy Intensive Restructuring Treatment--/4.2OZ]], and my hair feels soft and looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, yes. But to me it&#x27;s worth it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The shampoo arrived undamaged and in a timely manner.  This shampoo is the best!</li>
    <li> This product has strengthened my hair with repeated use.</li>
    <li> As usual an excellent Aveda product.  Their products do what they say and make your hair look good.  I like the way these products work on colored and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> My mom introduced me to this shampoo several months ago and after trying it, my only thought regarding this shampoo is that I wished I had discovered it sooner! I color my hair regularly and had a pretty horrible experience with a hair colorist who clearly had no idea what she was doing: my color looked awful and required 2 additional coloring sessions to correct it. 3 dying sessions within 2 months left my hair *really* damaged and dry. My mom recommended Aveda products, and I went with her to a salon to purchase some. To my embarrassment and shame, as soon as I walked into the salon, the owner grabbed me and said he could tell what I had done to my hair, and directed me to the Aveda Damage Remedy products. I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioning mask, and went home with a lot of hope and his instructions to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked on Day #1, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised. In my experience, the very first time I use any product it&#x27;s amazing and my hair feels so much softer than normal, etc. Day #2, same thing. Day #3, same thing. Etc. It&#x27;s been a few months now and I still experience soft, gorgeous hair every time I wash it! I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be a shampoo expert; I don&#x27;t know much about what ingredients mean which things and I have never seen a difference in my hair color even when I try to use \\&quot;color safe\\&quot; hair products, but I can say that I have tried all kinds of brands (from Paul Mitchell and Redkin to Herbal Essences) and this brand is my favorite of all time. My hair feels clean and healthy, is soft to touch rather than dry and damaged, and the shampoo smells natural rather than overly-perfumed. Even better: Aveda does not test their products on animals and is powered by 100% wind energy! Feel confident in your decision to purchase this product. I certainly am glad I made the change!</li>
    <li> love love this stuff for my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use this shampoo every other week or so to give my hair some protein and build it up. It smells great and i find myself only using very little of it to do the job, i have thick hair and this shampoo gets rid of all the product build-up yet doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils. Works great with the damage remedy conditioner. Highly recommended, especially for those with african american natural or relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> i really love aveda prodcuts,this shampoo cleans well and smells great.The price is also much cheaper than anywhere,i have been using aveda for my hair since 4 years and now i started using aveda prodcuts for my face too.I gave it a 3 because most of the time amazons packaging is not good.I used to order from them and stopped in between because the shampoo was leaking from the top.But as the price is much cheaper i started ordering from them again,last week i had the same situation the shampoo was leaking so bad because packaging was not good,they dint use any bubble wrap to send it,i cald amazon and they replaced it but i think amazon should take more care in packaging</li>
    <li> I normally love Aveda&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners but this particular shampoo smells absolutely terrible.  It has a strong chemical odor and does not appear to help my hair in any way.</li>

    <li> Love the1 product --had not used Aveda in a while--glad to be using again--great product--a little pricey but is well worth the price</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is long and at the tips it&#x27;s dry.  This shampoo keeps the tips looking soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo strips my thick, colored hair of all its oils.  In looking at the ingredients, it would seem to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than other shampoos, but there are many ingredients with chemical names I don&#x27;t recognize.  I need moisture, so I tried it twice - but it ruined my hair.  I had to use an incredible amount of leave on conditioner after I shampooed just to get it back to normal.  has a great scent, but NOT WORTH IT - it really made my hair dry and limp.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work. $30 for 8 oz of shampoo...should make your hair feel like silk. Doesn&#x27;t lather and makes your hair like straw!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy and dry hair. I get highlights done every 3 months and my hair is kind of dry and damaged because of it. I like the damage remedy conditioner but this shampoo is too harsh for my hair. It feels like straw after. It strips all the oils out of my hair. Not to mention that it is way over priced. If your hair is really dry and thick get Redken Real Control Shampoo and Conditioner instead. It saved my hair. It makes it soft and silky. And the price is half of the Aveda Damage Remedy Products.</li>
    <li> Smells great and you get a great lather but I&#x27;m not really getting the results I read about. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> My daughter went to Aveda. I love their products to the point of absurdity. I actually get a little panicky when I&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> Love Aveda! Received quickly</li>
    <li> Whenever I use this shampoo and/or the accompanying conditioner, my hair is completely lifeless, dull, and unruly.  Style won&#x27;t hold, curls fall out (and I have hair that takes and holds curls well).  I&#x27;ve even tried the shampoo and conditioner separately, and I get the same result.  I&#x27;ve then tried using a different brand of shampoo the next day, thinking that maybe it&#x27;s just my chemistry or something and that if it was the case, my hair would still be nasty.  Nope.  My hair regains its body, shine, and styling.  I go back to Aveda Damage Remedy, and it&#x27;s dull, lifeless, and almost &#x27;sticky&#x27;.  This is by far the most overpriced, horrible hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously had better results from Suave purchased at Walmart.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great on my thick, messy hair, wish it cost less, but I have never used anything better, makes hair very soft</li>
    <li> Aveda shampoos are expensive but worth the investment. It has helped my damaged hair very much, and is must better for your hair than a wax-based shampoo like Pantene.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo from my Aveda salon. Initially I did not like the smell, but in the shower its not so bad. Not as wonderful as other Aveda products as far as scent. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using this wrong, but today my hair feels weighed down and not bouncy. It doesn&#x27;t feel/look greasy, it just doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;clean.\\&quot; I do like that when I lather it in my hair, I can actually kind of use my fingers to comb thru my hair so it is somewhat moisturizing. I only use this once a week, because I don&#x27;t want too much protein in my hair, which will cause it to be drier.</li>
