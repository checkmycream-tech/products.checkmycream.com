<li> Works well, but it very small, hard to work with.</li>
<li> I like that it is very small..</li>
<li> Not good....</li>
<li> I was afraid that my dark skin would allow the powder to show, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
<li> It was spilled and used half of the makeup was gone when I opened the package it was also impossible to use</li>
<li> just because its about a few times use and it&#x27;s gone :-(</li>

    <li> This product does a great job with removing the shine from my face whether I wear makeup or not.  I just have oily skin.  However, I do find myself applying it serveral times during the day.</li>
    <li> It works really good. I was afraid that my dark skin would allow the powder to show, but it doesn&#x27;t! I even use it with brands of foundation other than Mary Kay &amp; works fine.  I must purchase the regular sized version.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this out, works great I really like it! Very small container but great if you just want to sample it</li>
    <li> I liked it because it will be good for trips and want take up too much room. Thank you, God Bless</li>
    <li> It was spilled and used half of the makeup was gone when I opened the package it was also impossible to use</li>
    <li> Make sure you note the size of this. Its the size of a Mary Kay creme eye color. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using this brush for anything.</li>
    <li> Works well, but it very small, hard to work with. I would recommend it to anyone who asks about it.</li>
    <li> Marykay is wonderful and this was just what I needed for my on the go bag! The powder goes on pretty much clear and blends with whatever foundation you&#x27;re already wearing!</li>
    <li> I always love MK products,it does not stay white on your face,help keep the shine away and last all day too[used with other MK products]</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Blends wonderfully with my complexion and feels light and not like it&#x27;s caked o. My face. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> cute little pkg, nice item, container stays on tight,  no spills in my purse. I like that it is very small..</li>
    <li> I should have understood when it said mini it was TINY......but I didn&#x27;t and I wasted my money as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It arrived in the Mary Kay box and the brush was sealed in plastic wrap so that was a plus--- but as far as being happy with it I&#x27;m not...just because its about a few times use and it&#x27;s gone :-( Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to waste your money.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey for such a small amount but definitely love it(:</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.  Lightweight  powder .the makeup  looks natural</li>
    <li> Tiny.  It&#x27;s 1.6 GRAMS not 1.6 OUNCES.  It is so small I can barely hold it in my hand without dropping it</li>
    <li> This item is advertised as &#x27;travel size&#x27;.  What it is is a small sample.  The jar is between a quarter and half dollar diameter in size and the brush while soft is very small.  So, if you want to try the  product, I advise you to see a dealer and get a free sample, put your money towards the full size product.  I used to purchase Mary Kay loose powders regularly and this one is not as fine or soft as the older ones, thus 4 stars rather than 5.  That said, it does cover and give a finish to makeup.</li>
    <li> pretty good product to set makeup and control shine</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Too cute and perfect size :)</li>
    <li> didnt realize how small it was going to be. I know it says travel size, but sheesh! Still will use it though.</li>
    <li> Not good.... leaves face looking chalky white and its waaaaaaay to small</li>
    <li> this product is very good</li>
