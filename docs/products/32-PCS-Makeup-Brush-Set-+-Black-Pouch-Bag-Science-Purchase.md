      <li>They just look so nice and sturdy</li>
      <li>It just kind of reminds me of the way leather has a smell.  </li>

      <li>I figured I didn&#x27;t want to spend 20 bucks on each brush, until I had an idea of what types of brushes I liked....</li>
      <li>i really liked it</li>
      <li>the hair on these brushes falls out very easily .</li>
      <li>she was so excited she loved the softness of goat hair</li>
      <li>Definitely a good gift for that special lady in your life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i did get 32 brushes in a set with the black pouch included, but they weren&#x27;t the ones pictured. I thought i was getting some mixed with brown and white hairs, but instead there all black. Good brushes though.</li>
    <li> Gave this to a young lady whose into makeup. Will definitely consider buying again from this source. Thanks for making it easy</li>
    <li> So honestly I was really iffy &amp; skeptical with buying this ... But when I got it, it didn&#x27;t smell funky to me &amp; then when I started using it, it worked/works so wonderfully!! If your being skeptical don&#x27;t it&#x27;s worth the buy!!!! :)</li>
    <li> They we&#x27;re ok for the price I paid they just had a weird smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best price that I have found,better than in stores!&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more brushes for cheek contouring, but other than that there is alot of options!&lt;br /&gt;definately worth the money spent</li>
    <li> it does have a plasticy smell, but it&#x27;s okay as long as you air it out. for the price the quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t that bad. i just wish there was a more variety in the brushes cause they&#x27;re all the same basically.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! Love this set!!! It&#x27;s good quality and great price!!! I am very happy with my purchase! It was worh it!</li>
    <li> Horrible brushes. Shed during the whole time applying make-up. Don&#x27;t buy these they&#x27;re not worth the money even being cheap.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this buy because it was so cheap for so many brushes. I am absolutely in love with these brushes. They work great and for a great price. I really only use about 9 of the brushes regularly (or at least once a week) but it&#x27;s still nice to play around with the others. They smelt kind of funny at first (like straight goat smell, reminded me of a petting zoo... Is it weird that I actually kind of liked it??) but after a few weeks the smell faded. Some reviews claim that the brushes shed but only the large fan brush has shed for my set. The brushes are pretty soft, I&#x27;ve felt softer but I&#x27;ve definitely owned brushes that are more coarse. Overall great buy(:</li>
    <li> I  have  made many purchases in the  past  but never felt the need to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;This is the exception...I  am so pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> good buy for the price, after the airing out period they work good. they do smell like plastic at first but after they air there is little to no smell (the case maybe the cause of the smell, that took a bit longer for the smell to leave)</li>
    <li> I got the 32 piece makeup brush set....I hated searching through these reviews, cause they combine a whole bunch of them...mine were in the black pack....the brushes look brown in the picture, but the ones they sent me, the tips are red on the bigger ones.&lt;br /&gt;Well, where to begin....first off, I&#x27;m not a MUA....though I&#x27;ve done makeup for whole bridal parties before...&lt;br /&gt;So this was my first brush set....I figured I didn&#x27;t want to spend 20 bucks on each brush, until I had an idea of what types of brushes I liked....&lt;br /&gt;The big brushes are nice and soft, but I don&#x27;t use them, I really only use the concealer and eyeshadow brushes, which are not as soft....&lt;br /&gt;I had to pull a few stray bristles out of a couple brushes, but other than that, I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall-outs, and I&#x27;ve had the set almost a month (with everyday use)...&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s missing one type of brush that I see in a lot of tutorials, which is a bummer...it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;all-over blend brush&amp;#34;...I also kinda wished there were names on the brushes...&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think I got a pretty good deal for a pretty basic starter kit, and now I know what types of brushes I like so when I buy better ones, I won&#x27;t have to play the guessing game.</li>
    <li> FORGET ALL THE NEGATIVITY THAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. THIS IS A MUST BUY. THE PRICE IS PERFECT AND SO IS THE PRODUCT. THE BRUSHES ARE VERY SOFT. YES SOON AS YOU OPEN IT THE PACKAGE SMELLS LIKE PAINT BUT THAT IS WHY YOU WASH YOUR BRUSHES BEFORE USING THEM. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND PURCHASING THEM. IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE !</li>
    <li> YES!!! they did come with a smell but only the bag and who wants the bag? Not me (: I recommend these to brush lovers</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the price. And I&#x27;m SOO Impressed. The brushes are amazing and soft. Love IT!</li>
    <li> The 4 larger brushes are lower quality than the rest. I was impressed by the set! Definitely a very good buy!</li>
    <li> When I had gotten my brushes I was expecting for them to be soft and good brushes.the hair keeps falling out and its really sharp on the face. So I&#x27;m not to happy</li>
    <li> This brush set is the first one that I&#x27;ve gotten, and I&#x27;m in love. They came in a very timely manner and all of the brushes came individually wrapped and very neat inside the case. The smell that I read about in previous reviews is just the scent of the case, and it isn&#x27;t too bad. The only concern that I have is the shedding on the large fan brush, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> They are ok. The big brushes were shedding before I took them out the plastic and the the smaller brushes are a bunch of duplicates and there was only one brush you could use for blending eyeshadow the rest were flat shadow brushes which suck. I guess they would be good starter brushes. Oh and I had to super glue the brow spoolie cause it kept coming off before I used it!</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes are amazing.  I was a little turned off by the smell, which smell like finger nail polish remover or acetone to me.  The case is really sturdy and overall great product for a great price.!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a gift, but only after I bought a set for myself.  They do have a little smell to them, but after you wash them they are fine.  The holder is what really has the smell, but is just the product material and it is NOT a bad smell.  It just kind of reminds me of the way leather has a smell.  Will order again when I need new brushes.</li>
    <li> the hair on these brushes falls out very easily . its nice to have a lot of brushes but not when you cant use them .</li>
    <li> The pouch is stinky, but I ended up tossing it anyway. Bigger brushes aren&#x27;t all that great, they shed. Can&#x27;t beat tho. Still an excellent value</li>
    <li> These are so/so. my brushes did not shed as much as others were stating theirs did. However there are many duplicates of the flat eye showdow brush which is a real bummer. 5 of them to be exact :( the overall quality is lacking,  they offer no real resistance when using either, meaning they arent densly packed, some brushes are supposed to be stiffer to pick up color but these deffinately lack that. The actual handle is comfortable to hold though and long enough for my long slender hands to be able to control as much or as little brush movement as needed. These would be a good starter set for a pre teen maybe? Deffinately not for pros and iffy even for the normal daily makeup wearer. Id say you MAYBE have 8 brushes of decent quality you can use out of this bunch. The brush bag/holder was better than I expected. Someone said pleather i think (ive read so many reviews lately on brushes my head is spinning lol) and i pictured that shiny awful plasticy stuff, but no. Even if I give the brushes to my daughter for play I would use the brush bag again. It did have a slightly strong smell at first, I left it open on my table over night (delivery came in the evening) and the next day it was significantly better so im sure that will eventually go away. I would not recommend these for anyone other than pre teens, teens or if this is your first ever brush set. The bad outweighed the good for me on these. I needed quality brushes, as im sure you do as you are reading this and they dont make the cut. you deff get what you pay for on these.</li>
    <li> the face brushes were terrible with the exception of the small fan brush and standard foundation. they sheded like crazy before I even washed them.&lt;br /&gt;the eye brushes are repetitive. theyre all basically different variations of flat shader brushes, angled brushes, and detailer brushes but there was a pencil brush and a flat top blending brush that I really like and use often. the eye brushes haven&#x27;t sheded at all and are really nice quality</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Love the brushes they are so soft! And no shedding at all!!! Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these specifically for eyeshade brushes, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. However as soon as I got them, I immediately did my makeup using them. Any brush past the foundation one , i.e. the powder and fan and blush brushes, it was like applying makeup with a dog. Bristles were falling out EVERYWHERE, it was terrible! The set was great about picking up makeup and applying. They aren&#x27;t as soft as my ecotool brushes I&#x27;ve had. And there is a smell, but its mainly the smell from the leather-like pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoy the eyeshadow brushes, and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are so soft and my models have all commented on how nice they are, as well. I read the reviews before I bought them about the smell and shedding and after washing them, I have not had a problem with either issue.</li>
    <li> The hair on these brushes falls out very easily and the eye shadow brushes fell apart within a few uses.  I would not recommend these brushes at all.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes. They just look so nice and sturdy</li>
    <li> I recently received my order. As soon as I opened I got the paint smell but that went away within a few seconds. Started looking at the brushes and saw some were repeated but that&#x27;s okay, doesn&#x27;t hurt to have extras ! Also saw that the big fan brush bristles or hair were falling out even on the contouring and blush. The rest were okay. You are getting what your paying for. So I guess I would recommend this to those who want low priced brush set !</li>
    <li> It is a good makeup brush set for the price. The smell that people complain about goes away. They do shed quite a bit in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Well i just got it today , on july 28th all the brushes are there i really liked it im 13 but when i pulled out one of the big brushes the handle fell off! So i super glued it tigether but other then then they all look good some hairs fell of all ready but its okay i dont mind</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome, I have used them all and its good quality and great price. So worth it, I even bought a second set for my mom</li>
    <li> These brush are OK. Considering the price. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I didnt like the product at all but the customer service was really good</li>
    <li> stinky bag: de-tox for the day outside or nearby a window with a neutral solution, that&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;con.&amp;#34;  the BRUSHES ARE HIGH QUALITY, ROCK IN PERFORMANCE, EASY TO CLEAN....the rollerbag holds them all solid and they are full-size brushes that look a lot smaller than when they are delivered: they are large easy handle and I&#x27;m keeping them for LIFE!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I had hoped for! Perfect for any make up need I have!</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice but the face brushes shed very badly and the eye brushes aren&#x27;t as soft and fluffy as I was hoping, they&#x27;re rather dense. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is so inexpensive and you get a lot of brushes with it. More than you would need, which is great for storing. The bag is very handy and the brushes are mostly amazing, of course I haven&#x27;t tried them ALL but I am looking forward to it :)</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, these are ok for the price. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Two of the brushes fell off when we first opened it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Wish had description of each brush and use. Overall great</li>
    <li> The only hair fallout I&#x27;ve experienced was from the small fan brush, not much of a problem because my bare minerals brush sheds way more. When opening the product it smelled of paint and a bit dusty but after a wash they where fine and very soft.</li>
    <li> I love my new makeup brushes. They are very soft and they make my make up look smooth and flawless!!</li>
    <li> sister loves it one brush was broken but she said she didnt need it so its good she said</li>
    <li> Perfect on time and not bad material.  Love these brushes could not go wrong with these. Do recommend these brushes</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are great. I&#x27;ve been using them for over 2 months and i have no complaints. At the begining,the hairs did fall out a little bit but on the 3th day they were good to go:) and you cant complain about the price!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> bota muchos pelitos pero si hace su trabajo</li>
    <li> I got thes in three days and I love the quality for the price especially I feel like I have every brush ill ever need and they look so professional</li>
    <li> no the hairs are falling out of the brushes.</li>
    <li> All the brushes work pretty well. The bigger brushes (powder, blush, fan, and contour) shed a lot and aren&#x27;t very soft and full. But all the eyeshadow brushes work great! My one other complaint is that the tops fall off sometimes but they are easy to put back on. Over all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for is right!! Started shedding  the second I started using them</li>
    <li> I love these brushes but they feel so fake and plasticy. The blush brushes are a bit rough and the fan brush was all bent up. I expected more from them especially after everyone else&#x27;s reviews. I am very disappointed in these.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes ! There so soft but the one big brush has a little but fall out but not complaining ! But the holder it does come In does have a little weird like paint or like some weird smell ! But the brushes aren&#x27;t smelling just the case ! But over all there really good brushes ! Just wish they had labels on the brushes saying what are they but very good brushes !</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They hold so much pigment and are wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... Nothing special... But ok...</li>
    <li> First off, this is my first true set of makeup brushes.....  I truly love them!!  I got them 2 months ago &amp; use them daily.  Great product.....  I have not had any problems with the bristles coming out.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good gift for that special lady in your life. I bought this brush set for my wife and she absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> these brushes are overall nice the only default i would say are the bigger brushes withe the brown color ends come out individually and I didnt like that much as i did my make up but the smaller brushes are perfect!</li>
    <li> Love all my brushes, but they shed too much. Well the larger brushes shed more then the other ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product five stars because I think the brushes are a lot better than I would have expected for a $14 set. That&#x27;s not to say that these brushes are professional quality: as a lot of other reviewers have noted, the larger brushes tend to shed quite a bit—definitely more than some of my Sephora brand brushes—and the construction is a little sloppy on some of them (e.g., there is a gap at the end of one of the brushes where there&#x27;s no hair!). The hair used in some of the larger brushes is also a little too coarse for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased this set because I wanted the case, and I figured I could use the brushes that came inside it as my backup brushes for when my normal brushes are being washed. But I was surprisingly pleased with the quality of some of the smaller brushes, which I&#x27;ve started using for my eye makeup and concealer. These brushes are softer than the larger ones, and they seem to work really well—I&#x27;ve stopped using my Sephora brushes and switched to these instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell that a lot of other users commented about. Also, the shedding from the larger brushes has reduced with use; I suspect that with more use and a few washes they will stop shedding and they might become a bit softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: These brushes are not mind-blowingly great, but they are well worth the price, and the smaller brushes are some of the better brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there were so many bad comments. It didn&#x27;t smell. There was no shedding. The only bad thing is that the face brushes were really bushy and kind of course.I love them. Plus very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love each and every brush! Very minimal shedding for me (only one brush was the culprit). They feel very soft and have a decent density. The pleather case smelled a little funny, but other then that I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for about a week now and here is my personal experience with them. All of the big, fluffy type brushes are crap. I expected some shedding because of the other reviews. But, at the end of using the blush brush, it looked like I cut my hair and it all landed on my face. One of the brushes wasn&#x27;t connected to the handle, I didn&#x27;t bother to try and put it together. I threw them away (I figured for the price, you get what you pay for).&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes, to me, are all the same type of bristles in different sizes. Kind of like different size concealer brushes. There aren&#x27;t any fluff brushes. So, if you don&#x27;t mind patting on your eyeshadow, this will work. I like them, so I just use my old fluff brushes to blend.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the brushes are ok, not the greatest, not the worst! (Except the big, fluffy brushes!) :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Great for the price as well. However the one thing is that the handles tend to detach from the brush head after a whille</li>
    <li> I just bought this, I recieved it in the mail today, I ordered this sunday. I absolutely love it. I did a review on my youtube channel if you guys wanna take a look. its at youtube backslash user backslash monica mo millan</li>
    <li> A bunch of people were complaining and I thought that this was amazing. I love the brushes and the pack was awesome! The thing did smell like fish, but after a while it was alright.</li>
    <li> The brushes are cheapand break easy and the kabuki brush is hard and brittle</li>
    <li> Got here really fast unlike the last seller!! They work great and the set is complete!</li>
    <li> Cheap brushes fall off quickly</li>
    <li> i did think this was a really good deal and that the price was great for what you got but i do have some comments on the brushes. So tey got her pretty fast so thats good, but i dont really like the black brushes perticularly because rhey are not soft, however, the brown ones are good. I think i big fluffy brush shouldve been included that was really good at blending, btu this is overall a good set... Inly thing is, you should look into purchasing a good bigger size brush because these arent soft and i didnt like them. But other than those things this was great</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I was pretty iffy but they were soft and easy to use loved them!</li>
    <li> For the price these brushes are great. I do wish it included a list of what each brush should be used for, and one of the brushes did detach from its wand, which is the reason I&#x27;m not giving them five stars. But, I will say I&#x27;ve traveled with them on many occasions and they are still working well and I&#x27;ve received many compliments from all of my friends who&#x27;ve seen them. I&#x27;m getting another set for my mother.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friends birthday, and then went on to buy one for myself!! Amazing set!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes&#x27; bristles come out of them. Some others have some defects of fabrication. Therefore, I didn&#x27;t like this and I returned them.</li>
    <li> I am happy happy happy.  As good as a 2,000 set I almost bought.  Quality is excellent.  Impressed. I highly Recommended.  Soft, great feel.  Love as much as my mac brushes.</li>
    <li> I really like my makeup brushes I just wish that there was labeling on each brush...&amp;#34;eye-shadow&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; etc. A few of the bigger brushes seem to be made from synthetic fiber as opposed to the goat hair and have shed a bit. The smell of the leatherette may be a bit much from some but to me it was bearable and it does go away after some time.  A good buy overall.</li>
    <li> I love the product. excellent</li>
    <li> They are ok. Not shaped very well, kind of hard to work with to put your makeup on properly. I recommend spending a little extra and get a nicer set...</li>
    <li> I loved this set it&#x27;s my first set of brushes and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased great starter set for beginners</li>
    <li> The worst brush ever!!!!!  I really did it to myself trying to save a few bucks. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot on brushes now.  I have to go buy all brand new ones. Each and everyone I use I had to throw away not only do they permanently spread out once you use it, it feels like you are using a broom  on your face. It&#x27;s so bed it hurts. I only gave it a star cause I had to</li>
    <li> So I just received my makeup brush set today. Played with it right away. Brushes are great. Was really iffy because of the reviews. But everything was fantastic. No smell. No hairs came off the brush. And even if it does it happens. I have Mac brushes that has hair that falls off all the time. Be serious. I love this and ill def be ordering from this buyer again.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Package arrived really quickly too. Thanks so muh</li>
    <li> Brush quality is subpar. The price equalled the quality, low price, poor product.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to friend nor a stranger.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. They need to be washed before use and the PU case that it came in has an odd smell at first but over time it goes away. Great brushes for the price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush set is the best that i had. It doesn&#x27;t smell like other reviews stated nor does the bristles fall off, I just love it. I will be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> There alright. A lot of them the hairs fall out and mostly in big chunks so they can&#x27;t be used and also they&#x27;re very stiff. I really like a few of the brushes like the eyebrow and angled brush. The foundation brush, and a few others but not too many. Overall I&#x27;d say spend a little more money and get a better set. But they may work for you just watch out for fallout on some of them. The bad is pretty cool though!</li>
    <li> was great but the bigger brushes do shed but they work perfectly i wold recommend for traveling and freelance makeup artists.</li>
    <li> This was part of my makeup giveaway the young lady that won it was so excited make sure you check out my YouTube channel</li>
    <li> Most of these brushes are synthetic which means, it will be difficult to use powder with them because they wont&lt;br /&gt;get a good grip. There is maybe 3 brushes out of this whole collection that I actually liked.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its okay for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Great item and quality. The brushes look just like the pictures. Very sturdy</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is that the larger brushes had bristles just falling out. The eye shadow brushes do not collect as much product as they should. It&#x27;s almost like they are too slick or something. There are several of the exact same brushes, and not a vast variety. It is a great starter kit, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are looking for a professional kit.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good, not great. You get what you paid for. The hairs fall out but not too much, I recommend for beginners :)</li>
    <li> the paint on the brushes where chipped and coming lose and one of them where bent</li>
    <li> I have had my brush set for about 7 months now and use it everyday. Very happy with the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality brush set, but rather thought I could get something half-way decent for my everyday use. Well, you get what you pay for. I saw comments regarding the shedding, but dismissed it as I&#x27;ve never had brushes that didn&#x27;t shed somewhat, but the shedding of these brushes are honestly out of control. Super annoying. The other issue I have is although the variety of the brush shapes are great, they don&#x27;t do a good job of picking up and transferring the right amount of product to my face. I&#x27;ve found myself going back and using my two old ELF brushes over and over, while these sit by no longer being used after getting so frustrated with every use. Save your money and invest in something else.</li>
    <li> I believe it had some good and bad it didn&#x27;t have a blending brush :(, the bigger brushes to my taste were to flimsy the smaller one tan ones so far are a good quality for the price a little stiff but I am sure with a couple of uses they will be fine.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my brushes.  absolutely love my new brushes...My client&#x27;s makeup is flawless...awesome set of brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes for the price are GREAT! I have not had the same problems other people have had (the bristles falling out). They are not soft to the face after a couple uses...but that is just fine. I own all types of brushes ($60 Dior brushes to $1 store brushes) and I can safely say the more expensive brushes bristles fall out, but these do not. I&#x27;m using them for my wedding (I&#x27;m doing my own makeup) so they will be perfect. The only negative I can say about this is the petal brush (foundation brush)...its VERY fine...which is OK but I need something thicker when I apply the foundation. Would I buy these again? Yes. Would I suggest them to my friends? Yes.</li>
    <li> Today my wifey got her make up brush set she was so excited she loved the softness of goat hair she was so surprised she cant wait to put it on her make up but the black pouch that holdts it pleather meaning fake leather that what smells bad I just hope strongly these brushes last long</li>
