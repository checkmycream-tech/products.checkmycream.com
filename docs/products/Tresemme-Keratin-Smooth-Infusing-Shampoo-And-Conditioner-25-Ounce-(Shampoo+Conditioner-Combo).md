      <li>Works great with Brazilian,Peruvian, Malaysian hair</li>
      <li>I like that he has a touch of fragrance, fly in the ointment</li>
      <li>This item is a great size, but no pumps.  </li>
      <li>how well I liked it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary shampoo/conditioner for a couple months now and very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Good price,  smells nice.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and price of this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner use these products then the serum nice results.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better than these!</li>
      <li>Love Love Love This Shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Was looking for a top rated shampoo and conditioner, and these products did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I can go now every other day now and have nice shiny hair and it awesome!</li>
      <li>Made my hair silky smooth...</li>
      <li>This product did not work well for my hair, which surprised me as reviews are so good.  </li>
      <li>Works great with the flat iron!</li>
      <li>but I would say its the next best thing to professional products.</li>
      <li>However I really love the smell of professional hair products I normally don&#x27;t buy Tresemme..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no that I&#x27;m rating the actual shampoo and conditioner this poorly, it&#x27;s mostly for the fact that the conditioner opened up while en route.  </li>
      <li>This is the first keratin shampoo I have tried</li>
      <li>I have naturally fine but chemically lightened hair which is now super dry &amp; frizzy.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair, and here the summers get pretty hot and extremely humid on most days.</li>
      <li>especially the strong odor.</li>
      <li>but it smells very chemically.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall really like the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
      <li>I would love to find a more natural product that can give the same great results, but I&#x27;ve tried several with disastrous outcomes and keep coming to tresemme&#x27;s keratin smooth combo.</li>
      <li>used it several times to give it a good chance, but ended up tossing the unused portion as I disliked it so much</li>
      <li>Make my hair feel soft and silky!</li>
      <li>I had been using cheap shampoos and conditioners, and they were turning my hair into a mess.</li>
      <li>When I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on professional hair products I will buy Tresemme.</li>
      <li>For the price I was surprised</li>
      <li>I give this 3 stars because the only hair products that get 5 starts are professional products.</li>
      <li>This is the only shampoo/conditioner I have found that keeps my hair manageable, untangled and soft.</li>
      <li>In addition to making my hair extremely soft and shiny and cutting down on tangles, it helps to keep my hair more smooth on those humid, frizzy days.</li>
      <li>and so far my hair is less frizzy and feels so soft!</li>

<li> Even though the bottles were in plastic wrap, the conditioner made a mess within the wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s affordable, and keeps my hair &amp;#34;in check&amp;#34; even when it&#x27;s not blow dried.</li>
<li> Not sure if all keratin shampoo has this odor</li>
<li> is that the packaging is not very good.</li>
<li> I mean I had really bad greasy hair</li>
<li> Very disappointed when I found out the have it at Walmart for $4.98 each</li>

    <li> Love the smell and price of this shampoo!  It works well and doesnt seem to dry out my hair.  I&#x27;m not a shampoo snob, but I do get picky about drying out my hair.</li>
