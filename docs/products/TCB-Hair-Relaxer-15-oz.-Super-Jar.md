<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this relaxer religiously about fifteen years ago, and off and on since then. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. BUT, I found upon discovering it again recently that it dried out my hair a LOT and within three weeks I had growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not awful -- no burns or breakage, but not great either, which earned it three stars from me.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a hair relaxer that didn&#x27;t actually last for 2-3 months. My hair would be straight-ish for maybe a week or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is kind of strange.  So I have weird hair.  I blame it on the bipolar weather around me.  Sometimes my hair has got a slight wave and looks appealing, other times it is almost curly with a frizz.  I have no idea about why or what sort of conditioner to use to help me, so I tried a relaxer lol.  The relaxer itself works. Instead of being all frizzy my hair goes back to how it normally is on a good day.  So why 3 stars? Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this stuff is a bitch to rinse out of my hair.  I use a colour-changing neutralizing shampoo and it NEVER runs white. I have to sit in the shower for 30 minutes rinsing my hair over and over and over.  Finally when the water runs a pale pink, I stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason it gets 3 stars is my skin tastes like something burnt it for about 2 weeks after using this product.  I don&#x27;t mean my scalp got burnt.. I mean my skin.  My lips, my arms.. my mouth.  I am hoping it has to do with water run off when trying to rinse this stuff out of my hair, if not I hate to think what my body is absorbing to be making my skin like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a girl reading this that spots this is a fault of mine, feel free to comment below.</li>
    <li> Its nothing extraordinary. Just like any of the other products out there. Does what its suppose to and its a good price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived timely and the product is was expected.</li>
    <li> I got it pretty fast, and the product relaxed my hair perfectly!!! After using the product, my hair was silky and beautiful !!! I just love it.</li>
    <li> Loved it, got it on time works perfect, no burning or very minimal  burn feeling,turn my hair all-most all the way straight,super is perfect don&#x27;t even go for mild.</li>
    <li> I find the price to be pretty reasonable.  Also the product is always fresh and not outdated.  I actually get a long term with this product.  It is shipped quickly and I have no complaints what so ever!</li>
    <li> excelente recomendable 100%</li>
    <li> it diidnt really live up to my expectation, but at the same time it was a good product to use.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is simple to use, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to buy neutralizing shampoo and gloves. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair gel but makes hair little dry and thick after having shower</li>
    <li> Usually buy this down the street for like 2.99 but have been extra crispy lazy ( plus it was cold) and just ordered it. I&#x27;ve tried many relaxers over the years but this pre-made jar is the ONLY that truly straighten my naturally curly hair and it lasts.</li>
    <li> i used to use elasta QP after getting sew ins i would relax my hair after the 7th day of taking my braids out and my growing hair would break off!!! i knew i had to try another brand or something! so being the cheap chick i am, i picked this up in the hair store. i was using the super from elalsta qp and got burns so i decided to go ahead and get mild with tcb. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER RELAXER OR STRENGTH this mild relaxer from tcb is perfect!! i have thick 4c-ish hair and i try to relax every 4 to six months touch up my edges every 3. i do use the elasta qp shampoo to rinse out the perm(cant think of the word) and do whatever else i need to do, no burns no sores, just straight HEALTHY hair! so im gonna stick with this until my hair decides it doesn&#x27;t like it anymore -_-</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It will listen your curls and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Just wash out with your shampoo (non acidic) after a while and you&#x27;re set. Compared to other relaxers this one is very low on the skin irritation scale. It&#x27;s a good price for how many uses you can get from it.  If you&#x27;re looking for singing who&#x27;s effects only lasts a few days this product should be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Great relaxer, gentle enough to use on my Euro-Latin hair. I leave it for 10 min only, then wash out. Good to go. I can do it myself and save myself money in the meanwhile.</li>
