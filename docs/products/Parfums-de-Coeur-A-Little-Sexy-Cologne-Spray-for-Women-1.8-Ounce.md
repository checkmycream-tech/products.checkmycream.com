      <li>any more so I searched Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>and we both Love it.</li>
      <li>As much as I love the scent of this cologne, I have to re apply often.</li>

      <li>Very pleased to be able to get it for her for her birthday for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>i love a little sexy!!!!</li>
      <li>I found that each bottle that I have used does not spray as freely as those that I have bought at K-Mart.  </li>
      <li>She thought it was a discontinued item, so I am excited to surprise her with it.  </li>
      <li>Was so excited to find it.</li>
      <li>but Red doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good on me as this does.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments with A little sexy than anything I wear!</li>
      <li>it was not a little sexy.</li>
      <li>I have worn A Little Sexy Cologne for most of 20 years...</li>

      <li>I was excited to fine this product on Amazon, because it is becoming more difficult to find it in the stores in my area.  </li>
      <li>This was bought as a gift for a friend, who absolutely adores this product.  </li>
      <li>THANKS FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK</li>
      <li>Thanks for having this in stock</li>
      <li>I get compliments every time I wear it - many more than I do on the expensive colognes.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is highly subjective, so I&#x27;m not knocking those who wear this.</li>
      <li>The packaging for A Little Sexy claims it is \\&quot;soft and subtle.\\&quot; Only if a sledgehammer is mild and gentle.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using A Little Sexy for decades</li>
      <li>Finding my favorite perfume in a store local to me was impossible, this has made me so delighted to know I can now have my preferred perfume back.</li>
      <li>This is a hard to find item in my area, and my Mom&#x27;s favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>I have complete strangers ask, \\&quot;What perfume are you wearing?\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Just wish I had a store near me that sold it.</li>
      <li>I surprised her for her birthday</li>
      <li>You can no longer purchase this cologne in stores, so Amazon.com is the only place to purchase at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>When I tell them the name and that it is actually inexpensive and a knock off of Giorgio&#x27;s Red, I get a lot of positive response.  </li>
      <li>Red by Giorgio was a big, bombastic, complicated &#x27;80s fragrance with a thick wallop of jasmine and sandalwood, and A Little Sexy is a fairly faithful copy thereof.</li>
      <li>Not as fragrant as a bottle I&#x27;d purchased locally the first time for less money.</li>
      <li>I bought it for a friend who talked to me much about it, he said he used it since I was little, when I gave it</li>

    <li> I brought this colonge as a gift for someone who happened to mention it one day in talking. I surprised her for her birthday and she was happy about receiving it.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find item in my area, and my Mom&#x27;s favorite scent.  Very pleased to be able to get it for her for her birthday for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Everything as promised.</li>
    <li> I was excited to fine this product on Amazon, because it is becoming more difficult to find it in the stores in my area.  I recieved the product quickly and was very satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just what my wife wanted!</li>
    <li> I have worn A Little Sexy Cologne for most of 20 years... It is my favorite perfume, but it is very difficult to find.  I have complete strangers ask, \\&quot;What perfume are you wearing?\\&quot;  \\&quot;It smells great\\&quot;... When I tell them the name and that it is actually inexpensive and a knock off of Giorgio&#x27;s Red, I get a lot of positive response.  You can no longer purchase this cologne in stores, so Amazon.com is the only place to purchase at a reasonable price.  I love this product and purchasing it here at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Maybe it had just been too long (since high school in the &#x27;80s), but P.U., this fragrance made me and everyone around me feel so ill, I had to go home and shower in the middle of the day. Fragrance is highly subjective, so I&#x27;m not knocking those who wear this. I suspect it works better with their chemistry. Red by Giorgio was a big, bombastic, complicated &#x27;80s fragrance with a thick wallop of jasmine and sandalwood, and A Little Sexy is a fairly faithful copy thereof. If you&#x27;re not up for that sort of thing-- it is VERY different from current fragrance trends-- then proceed with caution here. The packaging for A Little Sexy claims it is \\&quot;soft and subtle.\\&quot; Only if a sledgehammer is mild and gentle.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using A Little Sexy for decades and we both Love it. What we received did not look like or smell like &amp;#34;A Little Sexy&amp;#34;. The &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; arrived in an unmarked bottle inside a small plastic bubble wrap baggie. There was no RED BOX as you see in the picture. The perfume was a greenish color instead of the rich amber you normally see. The smell was TERRIBLE! Disgusting! My wife scrubbed it off immediately.  It took hours for the stench to dissipate from inside the house. The smell made us both sick to our stomachs. Be Warned.</li>
    <li> I found that each bottle that I have used does not spray as freely as those that I have bought at K-Mart.  However, it does save me from going to the store (the essence is the same).</li>
    <li> A wonderful fragrance...been around for years. My husband is fussy about what I wear and this is one that made him go \\&quot;MMMM, that smells great!\\&quot;. Buy this and you&#x27;ll both be happy!</li>
    <li> Actually it is the perfume not the body spray that I like! I get more compliments with A little sexy than anything I wear!</li>
    <li> it was not a little sexy. it was something completely different didnt like. i love a little sexy!!!!</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for a friend, who absolutely adores this product.  Received it in plenty of time to mail it to her for her birthday!</li>
    <li> I just love Amazon!!! Made my sister very happy Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that I use. It is the generic of Red. Don&#x27;t know why but Red doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good on me as this does. I received my order quicker than I anticipated I would. Wonderful experience. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I could not find it in the stores any more so I searched Amazon.com. Was so excited to find it. I get compliments every time I wear it - many more than I do on the expensive colognes.</li>
    <li> I can only say that I get complements when I wear this scent all the time. So, for me, what works I stick with. Thanks for having this in stock</li>
    <li> Was prompt delivery, exactly what I ordered. Very pleased all around by Parfumes De Coeur and Amazon. Finding my favorite perfume in a store local to me was impossible, this has made me so delighted to know I can now have my preferred perfume back.</li>
    <li> This will be a birthday gift for my daughter.  She thought it was a discontinued item, so I am excited to surprise her with it.  She has used this fragrance for many years and loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend who talked to me much about it, he said he used it since I was little, when I gave it became so happy to see him. Has a delicious fragrance. THANKS FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK</li>
    <li> Only fragrance I wear that gets compliments over and over. Just wish I had a store near me that sold it.</li>
    <li> As much as I love the scent of this cologne, I have to re apply often. And I guess that&#x27;s okay, although I have to carry it with me always</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Not as fragrant as a bottle I&#x27;d purchased locally the first time for less money.</li>
