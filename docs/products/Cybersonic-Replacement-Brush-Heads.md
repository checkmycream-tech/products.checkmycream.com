      <li>Dentists always ask me during a cleaning &amp;#34;what brush do you use because your teeth are so clean?&amp;#34;  These heads are PERFECT and last a bit longer than others I&#x27;ve found.</li>

      <li>:)</li>
      <li>but hey, if you can live with that you&#x27;ll feel like you got a good deal.</li>
      <li>But, the one I am using does fine at this time.  </li>
      <li>These are not always available in stores</li>
      <li>I love the fresh from the dentist</li>
      <li>ON PACKAGE WERE BILLED AS FREE FOR LIFE.</li>
      <li>But there are great because you need to focus your attention like you should with the standard size.</li>
      <li>These brushes are the original for the Cybersonic D109.</li>
      <li>I have the original Cybersonic and hadn&#x27;t had any luck finding replacement brush heads.  </li>
      <li>Everyone should use to clean teeth of stains and plaque .</li>
      <li>The sonic toothbrush is good for when I want a deep clean.</li>
      <li>I had been searching for replacement brushes for a long time without success, so I was happy to find these.  </li>
      <li>Brushes work pretty good and come with a clear plastic dust/protection cover.  </li>
      <li>SWEET AMAZON</li>
      <li>and I received it quickly</li>
      <li>Receives this quickly and efficiently.</li>
      <li>In less than a week his gums were happy again.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had the original cybersonic when it first came out.</li>
      <li>Good quality, cheap enough to replace frequently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can order through Amazon without having to deal directly with the source.</li>
      <li>Their teeth will be cleaner, &amp; brushing will be fun, well as much fun as brushing can be.  </li>
      <li>nice to have four in a packages with different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>some reason the replacements from Amazon hold together just great and cost half as much as the \\&quot;free\\&quot; exploding ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love having extra brushes for my Cybersonic on hand.  </li>
      <li>The brushes were exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Years ago i bought one when they first came out.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same battery operated tooth brush for over 10 years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it since they first came out.</li>

      <li>No other brushes fit.  </li>
      <li>LIKE A LONG LOST LOVE RE-UNITED.</li>
      <li>Just what was promised fast shipping no issues</li>
      <li>and I was much in need of some replacements.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Always felt the regularly shaped brush head didn&#x27;t quite fit all the teeth.  </li>
      <li>you have children in your home, it really helps,</li>
      <li>Also noticed the smaller round head seemed to clean the backs of the teeth better, again especially the backs of the front teeth, top &amp; bottom.  </li>
      <li>They are high quality and fit my base perfectly.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day and like a fresh brush regularly.</li>
      <li>because not only does it fit their smaller mouths better, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; their little tender gums, making them hesitant to brush at all.  </li>
      <li>I have had my Cybersonic Toohbrush for MANY years ( don&#x27;t even know how long, that&#x27;s how long it&#x27;s been, probably close to 20 years now)</li>
      <li>He had looked at local drug stores and back on HSN where he originally got it</li>
      <li>They are exactly what I expected and they arrived fast.</li>
      <li>THE ORIGINAL BRUSH HEADS WERE LONG LIKE A REGULAR TOOTHBRUSH HEAD.</li>
      <li>Somebody smart picked up the slack and now they&#x27;re making big bucks.</li>
      <li>My old Cybersonic toothbrush from 20 years still works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to buy them from the company that puts out the Cybersonic because I have heard mixed things about them.</li>
      <li>was able to load up my secondary unit as well.</li>
      <li>Not sure what the difference is in blue kind versus white.</li>

    <li> Great heads. Found them by accident. Glad I did. My old Cybersonic toothbrush from 20 years still works. I bought it from watching a T.V. ad. So, now I have the replaceable heads that go with it. The sonic toothbrush is good for when I want a deep clean. So glad I found these. I thought the company went out of business. Somebody smart picked up the slack and now they&#x27;re making big bucks.</li>
    <li> The brushes were exactly what I needed.  Thanks![[ASIN:B000067ETY Cybersonic D109 Replacement Brush Heads (4 Heads)]]</li>
    <li> Apparently these replacement brushes are hard to find.  My Dad loves his automatic toothbrush and one day he happened to mention on the phone that the bristles were cutting his gums but hated to part with his cybersonic unit.  He had looked at local drug stores and back on HSN where he originally got it and they had no clue what he was talking about.  I googled it and 5 minutes later had these replacement brushes ordered for him off Amazon. In less than a week his gums were happy again.  I can&#x27;t personally review the product for myself but if he&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement brushes anywhere. Checked Amazon, Low and Behold..I purchsed them and received in a timely manner..</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had our Cybersonic toothbrushes for years, but lost track of how to get replacement heads...a great option!</li>
    <li> This was a minor purchase but it was just what I wanted and I received it quickly</li>
    <li> CYBERSONIC D109 BRUSHES WERE NOT PACKED AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE,BUT WERE LOOSELY PACKED IN CELLOPHANE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAGS- 2/BAG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AS TO THERE NEWNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD PRACTICE. I HAVE THROWN AWAY THE BRUSHES-LESSON LEARNED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURINDER</li>
    <li> These Cybersonic brushes are great, they are affordable and perfect for my electric toothbrush.  They are hard to find but Amazon always has them.  I love it.</li>
    <li> ordered it and thought it would come in a few days.  seems to have arrived almost immediatley even thought ordered on a weekend. great service</li>
    <li> The so called \\&quot;free\\&quot; Replacement Brush Heads that Amden Corporation wants to send you every 3 months shattered in my mouth cutting me to ribbons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amden Corporation (maker of Cybersonic) claims they&#x27;ll be happy to replace them but they never come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the replacements from Amazon hold together just great and cost half as much as the \\&quot;free\\&quot; exploding ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Receives this quickly and efficiently. Came in great shape too. I would order from them again!</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best tooth brush. Years ago i bought one when they first came out. My dentist could not believe how better my gums looked. So then for some years used a different one. Now i went back to Cybersonic and after my last dental cleaning they asked me what i was doing different. Cause i had less plaque buildup. That has to tell you this thing works.</li>
    <li> Convenient and efficient ordering from Amazon.  Brushes work pretty good and come with a clear plastic dust/protection cover.  Cheers!!!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for replacement brushes for a long time without success, so I was happy to find these.  I have used this brand of toothbrush for years and I was in need of replacements, so these are great.</li>
    <li> Bought the Cybersonic Replacement Heads and was very happy with the price, product and the seller. These are not always available in stores so it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy them online. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Thank you for the fast shipping! These worked great and I was much in need of some replacements. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I like the Cybersonic and have had one since 2001; it still works! These are a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I HAD  PURCHASED THE CYBERSONIC SYSTEM ABOUT 10YRS AGO, CAME W/4 HEADS&lt;br /&gt;LOVED IT,  BRUSH HEADS ON PACKAGE WERE BILLED AS FREE FOR LIFE. HAD NO LUCK W/&lt;br /&gt;MINIMAL EFFORT. I USED FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS THEN STORED AWAY,BEEN USING A MANUAL BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;FORGOT HOW GOOD THE CYBERSONIC FELT N WORKED SAW THE HEADS ON AMAZON COULD NOT&lt;br /&gt;SAY NO . LIKE A LONG LOST LOVE RE-UNITED. SWEET AMAZON</li>
    <li> Decided to try the round head, thinking it would go around each tooth, especially the smaller ones on bottom, in front.  Always felt the regularly shaped brush head didn&#x27;t quite fit all the teeth.  Also noticed the smaller round head seemed to clean the backs of the teeth better, again especially the backs of the front teeth, top &amp; bottom.  Try these, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have children in your home, it really helps, because not only does it fit their smaller mouths better, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; their little tender gums, making them hesitant to brush at all.  Their teeth will be cleaner, &amp; brushing will be fun, well as much fun as brushing can be.  :)</li>
    <li> I am on my second Cybersonic and would not trade if for the world.  My dentist ask me what  am doing and when I told him what toothbrush I use he said don&#x27;t stop using it. I have been using it since they first came out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product ... We have had our Cybersonic System for years and still LOVE it!!!  This is a really good price for the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Cybersonic toothcare system for quite some time. I recommend anyone using a manual toothbrush to switch. I love the fresh from the dentist feel I get after every brush. The replacement heads are hard to find however, except online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same battery operated tooth brush for over 10 years and love it.  The replacement heads are great!</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have to learn how to rate correctly&lt;br /&gt;seems nice to have four in a packages with different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love having extra brushes for my Cybersonic on hand.  I use it twice a day and like a fresh brush regularly.</li>
    <li> I have the original Cybersonic and hadn&#x27;t had any luck finding replacement brush heads.  I found these and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and a good price</li>
    <li> I used to see Cybersonic replacement brushes in stores but haven&#x27;t in some time. I didn&#x27;t really want to buy them from the company that puts out the Cybersonic because I have heard mixed things about them. I had considered buying another sonic tooth brush but when I saw the replacement brushes on Amazon I immediately sent off for them. After I got the brushes and started using my Cybersonic again. The next time I went to the dentist there was a reduction in bacteria that had built up in my gums (I&#x27;ve had trouble with that on and off for a few years now). I very much believe this was due, at least in some degree, from using the Cybersonic.</li>
    <li> Thank you for providing these replacement brushes. I have had my Cybersonic Toohbrush for MANY years ( don&#x27;t even know how long, that&#x27;s how long it&#x27;s been, probably close to 20 years now) and it is still working like a charm. I hope you continue to make the replacement brushes. They are excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better. Everyone should use to clean teeth of stains and plaque . Have used this product for many years!</li>
    <li> I love my Cybersonic, but the replacement brushes are so overpriced that I just might have to give it up.  No other brushes fit.  Just a sad case of a very greedy company. :(</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I noticed one reviewer lamented that the picture of the product shows a store style packaging, and yes, the don&#x27;t actually come like that. Mine arrived in a sealed little baggie-but hey, if you can live with that you&#x27;ll feel like you got a good deal. They DO have a firm plastic mini-casing over the bristles themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been noted, many of us bought the original Cybersonic and that IS a great toothbrush. And really the replacement head cost from Cybersonic isn&#x27;t THAT bad, but most people don&#x27;t replace as often as they recommend, so it starts to feel like not a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finding these on Amazon was a great discovery and almost ready to buy another set. I&#x27;m thinking about getting those jumbo sized replacement heads. But there are great because you need to focus your attention like you should with the standard size. Not sure what the difference is in blue kind versus white. I just took them out and compared and MAYBE the blues are firmer...</li>
    <li> These brushes are the original for the Cybersonic D109. They are exactly what I expected and they arrived fast. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> brush heads are to little</li>
    <li> Good transaction...perfect fit for my toothbrush. Great price. Will definitely be ordering more of these.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to load up my secondary unit as well.</li>
    <li> As a dental assistant I see lots of teeth.  I prefer this type of rotation to the up and down type of brushing.  It cleans better and I also believe it is easier on the gums.  A really great product!  Thank you to whoever designed this!</li>
    <li> Just what was promised fast shipping no issues</li>
    <li> I needed replacement brush heads for my cybersonic.I love my cybersonic toothbrush. And Cybersonic is not as costly as other sonic toothbrushes. Plus ever since I started using a sonic toothbrush my dentist says I have perfect dental hygiene!</li>
    <li> I have had a Cybersonic tooth brush for more than 15 years. Dentists always ask me during a cleaning &amp;#34;what brush do you use because your teeth are so clean?&amp;#34;  These heads are PERFECT and last a bit longer than others I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> THE ORIGINAL BRUSH HEADS WERE LONG LIKE A REGULAR TOOTHBRUSH HEAD. THESE ARE TOO SMALL FOR MY PREFERANCE. GOOD BYE</li>
    <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used this product for months, I don&#x27;t know how long each head lasts.  But, the one I am using does fine at this time.  They seem to be the same as the originals.  I think one of the originals lasted over 6 months, before you could see even a little loss of the blue color at the ends, and a little bit of widening or fraying of the head.</li>
    <li> They worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Good for your gums also.</li>
    <li> Great price. We&#x27;ve had the original cybersonic when it first came out. I can&#x27;t find the tips in stores. So reliable Amazon had them. Yeah!!  Saved us money. Didn&#x27;t have to buy a newer model.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and needed. They are high quality and fit my base perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly!  A new brush head is a wonderful thing!</li>
    <li> Good quality, cheap enough to replace frequently.</li>
    <li> Go on our Cybersonic Toothbrush and again I have nothing more to say.  I like to do my part in reviewing what we bought but why is there a minimum amount of words, I mean on toothbrushes?</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush, but it&#x27;s hard to find the heads for it locally.  When I first bought the system I was supposed to get replacements at a greatly reduced price, but when I ordered them I was sent a pile of stuff that I didn&#x27;t want and told that was the way it was and deal with it.  I couldn&#x27;t order just the heads.  Why should I have to pay for stuff I didn&#x27;t want?  I finally located brush heads in a local store, but they eventually discontinued the item.  I&#x27;m glad I can order through Amazon without having to deal directly with the source.</li>
