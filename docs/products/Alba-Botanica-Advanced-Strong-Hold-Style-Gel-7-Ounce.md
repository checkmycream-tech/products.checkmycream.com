      <li>No flaking.. strong hold..and organic.</li>
      <li>I mistakenly placed an order for Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel on a online vitamin/health food store when I meant to purchase Alba Botanica Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I tried out the Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel this morning while styling my hair into a puff.</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time yesterday, and my hair came out really nice, with an even curl.</li>
      <li>I have used many brands of hairstyling gel, but this one is by far the best for a medium hold, great wet look if that is what you want, not heavy or sticky, combs out without residue.  </li>
      <li>My house is a scent free home.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for about a year and consider it an important part of my hair care.</li>
      <li>I enjoy that</li>
      <li>I have no idea how they can claim this as fragrance free.</li>
      <li>may probably have to to go for the light hold on my ends.</li>
      <li>Good hold once it sets and it does not dry your hair out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
      <li>My wife has been using the Alba Botanica Strong Hold gel for a couple years now and likes it very much.  </li>
      <li>This is my new styling gel!!!!    </li>
      <li>Excellent medium/stronghold gel washes out easily does not turn white and flake like other gels</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other gels and so far this has worked the best for me.</li>
      <li>Most of the styling lotions I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; even though they do help smooth my hair.  </li>
      <li>This gel is great especially for those sensitive to chemicals and smells.</li>
      <li>This dries stiffly, but does a great job holding unruly hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Not the right product.  </li>
      <li>Finding hair products for my wife and daughter that don&#x27;t stink, aren&#x27;t toxic and actually work has been a chore for sure.  </li>
      <li>If you are interested in learning about how toxic your beauty products are, vist    cosmeticdatabase.com</li>
      <li>On second-day hair, I apply a bit more of this, mixed in with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It really stiffens up your hair, so it takes some getting used to.  </li>
      <li>This works really well, I like that it has no silicones or alcohol in it.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
      <li>I t is very think, and</li>
      <li>I am currently in the process of replacing all my beauty products with natural and safe products.</li>
      <li>What a relief to find this product that we can use without it being so very highly scented ,which allows one to breathe normally.</li>
      <li>Once you have a fair amount of product on your wet hands, disperse the product over your wet hands so they are evenly coated, before running your fingers through your hair.</li>
      <li>(Guys undercut) Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for curly hair.</li>
      <li>I feel it works just as well as my old Garnier gel, and it is much safer for my body.</li>
      <li>Granted, it does start to let your hair frizz a bit after a long day, but not bad.</li>
      <li>Strong Hold Style Gel: Water, VP/VA Copolymer, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Biotin, Panthenol, Niacin, Sage Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract,</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first, only because I was applying too much, and it left my hair too sticky.  </li>
      <li>I use this with a natural pomade to add weight for shape.</li>
      <li>I had never found a natural product to work on my curly hair as well as the salon stuff (with all the chemicals).</li>
      <li>I saw this gel at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I love this to tame my edges because it does the job and does not leave ANY residue, even after several applications.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I spray a leave in conditioner on first then put this through my hair, then blow dry.</li>
      <li>It may seem like this product is pricier than a lot of the other styling gels out there, but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much</li>
      <li>So I was eager to try this gel, in hopes that it would have a more serious hold from one shampoo to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new styling product that has low toxicity.</li>
      <li>rotate this with Deva AnGel or Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee, and all three work well on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Once dry, I scrunch out the crunch (SOTC), and am left with soft waves that last two days.</li>
      <li>Strong Hold Style Gel slicked and smoothed my dense, tightly coiled hair just as well as Eco Styler Krystal Gel if not BETTER</li>

<li> Made my hair stiff and hard, likes the eco styler so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Best part is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like fake vanilla, fake citrus, weird fruit or anything.</li>
<li> Scent is very minimal.</li>
<li> used this three different times, applying different amounts each time, but I was never happy with it.  </li>
<li> If you put a little less, it will dry softer, but I like a lot of hold.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t feel as hard as the one I buy at wholefoods.</li>
<li> her hair dosen&#x27;t stink like fake flower smells or some other toxic chemical.  </li>

    <li> Most of the styling lotions I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; even though they do help smooth my hair.  So I was eager to try this gel, in hopes that it would have a more serious hold from one shampoo to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this three different times, applying different amounts each time, but I was never happy with it.  It DOES have a strong hold, but it made my hair feel tacky, and my hair got dirty faster.  Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My house is a scent free home.  Finding hair products for my wife and daughter that don&#x27;t stink, aren&#x27;t toxic and actually work has been a chore for sure.  My wife has been using the Alba Botanica Strong Hold gel for a couple years now and likes it very much.  I enjoy that her hair dosen&#x27;t stink like fake flower smells or some other toxic chemical.  She also uses the [[ASIN:B001ET7BJ4 Alba Botanica Leave In Conditioner, 7-Ounce Tube (Pack of 2)]] and has had good results with it.</li>
    <li> This is the only scentless hair get that I have found.  It really stiffens up your hair, so it takes some getting used to.  I do like how well it &#x27;&#x27;holds&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This dries stiffly, but does a great job holding unruly hair in place.  If you put a little less, it will dry softer, but I like a lot of hold.  I highly recommend this for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a few weeks now, and I really like it.  I didn&#x27;t like it at first, only because I was applying too much, and it left my hair too sticky.  I now use about two or three quarter-sized globs, run them through my palms so spread out the gel, and then run it through soaking wet hair in the shower.  After I distribute it, I scrunch it in, and it activates my waves.  Once dry, I scrunch out the crunch (SOTC), and am left with soft waves that last two days. On second-day hair, I apply a bit more of this, mixed in with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those following the Curly Girl routine (no silicones or sulfates), it&#x27;s also CG-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rotate this with Deva AnGel or Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee, and all three work well on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I always buy this at wholefoods. I thought I would give it a shot here save $5. However, when I received them I compared it to the one I buy at wholefoods and this one seemed watery. Didn&#x27;t feel as hard as the one I buy at wholefoods. Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know it yet, you should do research on the neurotoxins that are in most hair care products.  Go to ewg.org to see how your products measure up.  The Alba gel is very easy to apply, holds up well over the course of a day and best of all, no neurotoxins!</li>
    <li> I mistakenly placed an order for Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel on a online vitamin/health food store when I meant to purchase Alba Botanica Leave-In Conditioner. I was running low on the Eco Styler Krystal Styling Gel so I figured it wasn&#x27;t a total lost cause.  I tried out the Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel this morning while styling my hair into a puff. Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel slicked and smoothed my dense, tightly coiled hair just as well as Eco Styler Krystal Gel if not BETTER [less crunch, no white residue, faster drying time, etc.] AND it it does the job with more natural/non-toxic ingredients. I can&#x27;t wait to try it for my bun and updo styles.  Ingredients: Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel: Water, VP/VA Copolymer, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Biotin, Panthenol, Niacin, Sage Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Saw Palmetto Fruit Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Lavender Extract, Chamomille Flower Extract, Moringa Seed Extract, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol</li>
    <li> I am 4A-B type.  I love this to tame my edges because it does the job and does not leave ANY residue, even after several applications.&lt;br /&gt;That is different from my eco-styler gel.&lt;br /&gt;However, I tried it on my ends: never again. Made my hair stiff and hard, likes the eco styler so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I may probably have to to go for the light hold on my ends. Anyway since I am trying to trash products full in weird chemicals, that&#x27;s an option.</li>
    <li> I had never found a natural product to work on my curly hair as well as the salon stuff (with all the chemicals). This one does a great job! Granted, it does start to let your hair frizz a bit after a long day, but not bad. It works, trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a ton of stuff due to sensitive skin developing after age 30! It is a bit cheaper on vitacost though, so I started getting it there.</li>
    <li> One of the best natural gels out there. Good hold once it sets and it does not dry your hair out. Scent is very minimal. I use this with a natural pomade to add weight for shape. (Guys undercut) Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over 8 months now and I shall continue to. No flaking.. strong hold..and organic. It will be a long time before I change my preferences      I quit using hair gel now and I am using a herbal protein based hair cream from Himalaya brand and I am not turning back</li>
    <li> Not the right product.  It is a different Alba that I like - it is okay, but not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new styling product that has low toxicity. I am currently in the process of replacing all my beauty products with natural and safe products. I saw this gel at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. I feel it works just as well as my old Garnier gel, and it is much safer for my body.I t is very think, and though the directions say, \\&quot;use sparingly,\\&quot; I suggest wetting you hands before squeezing the product into them. Once you have a fair amount of product on your wet hands, disperse the product over your wet hands so they are evenly coated, before running your fingers through your hair. I tried this for the first time yesterday, and my hair came out really nice, with an even curl. It may seem like this product is pricier than a lot of the other styling gels out there, but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much and I have a feeling this tube is going to last for a long time. This is my new styling gel!!!!    If you are interested in learning about how toxic your beauty products are, vist    cosmeticdatabase.com</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of hairstyling gel, but this one is by far the best for a medium hold, great wet look if that is what you want, not heavy or sticky, combs out without residue.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  I love it!  And it is free of harmful chemicals!  Yeah!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent medium/stronghold gel washes out easily does not turn white and flake like other gels</li>
    <li> Fragrance free,not sticky,washes out easily.  I have used it for about a year and consider it an important part of my hair care.</li>
    <li> This works really well, I like that it has no silicones or alcohol in it. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all, I don&#x27;t know why another reviewer said it has a scent...it doesn&#x27;t. I spray a leave in conditioner on first then put this through my hair, then blow dry. Holds hair and gives it volume!</li>
    <li> This gel is great especially for those sensitive to chemicals and smells.</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place with no fuss. Does what it is supposed to do. Best part is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like fake vanilla, fake citrus, weird fruit or anything. In this over-scented world that is an enormous plus.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients, not my favorite gel but not terrible.</li>
    <li> And lasts for ever. I still have this in my stock.</li>
    <li> Non-irritating, no perfume and I&#x27;m very happy with the hold.  I&#x27;ve tried other gels and so far this has worked the best for me.</li>
    <li> What a relief to find this product that we can use without it being so very highly scented ,which allows one to breathe normally. Thanks so much.  We are customers for a long tome.</li>
    <li> Holds nicely all day.  Great for spiking.  It does not leave any sort of gel flakes nor does it appear to irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have many, many allergies, this truely has no scent and it works.  You put it on, it dries, you comb through and there&#x27;s no flaking.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my husband has allergies to fragrances and this product is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how they can claim this as fragrance free. it is NOT fragrance free! I sent it back for a refund.</li>
