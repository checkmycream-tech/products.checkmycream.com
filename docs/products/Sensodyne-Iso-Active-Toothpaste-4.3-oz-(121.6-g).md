### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>is excellent.  </li>
      <li>this is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>It is the best works great and foams awesome.</li>
      <li>Great toothpaste, not so great dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect though, and I&#x27;ll get to that, but first the good bits:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>This is a very refreshing way to brush your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>NOTHING SPECIAL!!</li>
      <li>elaborate packaging seems wasteful (contradictory, I know).&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>This is a favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love this tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>Research suggests that products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate (\\&quot;SLS\\&quot;), a foaming agent found in most toothpaste and mouthwash formulations, may be associated with an increased risk for canker sore outbreaks.         </li>
      <li>I then have to rinse this off before I can deliver more toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>but it sure seems as though it is doing something.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>love the foaminess of this toothpaste during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to remove before getting more out.....</li>
      <li>I prefer the smooth gel and the foaming action is great.</li>
      <li>Mostly when I was brushing, but normally I had very healthy gums.  </li>
      <li>Several studies have reported that participants who used SLS-free toothpaste experienced fewer canker sores.</li>
      <li>No refund available.</li>
      <li>All in all, it WILL clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I tried to clean the nozzle, nothing worked.  </li>
      <li>Even if you clean the dispenser after using it, the foam comes out over time.</li>
      <li>In fact, the foam quickly feels like it has filled my mouth</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not a bubbly foam, but a creamy, almost Cool Whip-ish texture.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said that, I really, really, like this stuff and have since bought a couple more cans of it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s honestly not as bad as others have said</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean and fresh when I use it.</li>
      <li>Came in the mail quickly.</li>
      <li>After brushing my teeth feel squeaky clean and the mint flavor is just right its not over powering the so</li>
      <li>exactly is what it said it would be, and with all the different options on toothpaste these days, I was relieved to find the exact one I&#x27;ve been happily using.</li>
      <li>i used the original tube but as someone else pointed out the texture is kind of gritty</li>
      <li>Hubby was very happy with this purchase - hard to find item in the stores!</li>
      <li>The commercials for Sensodyne \\&quot;Isoactive\\&quot; are compelling in that it correctly claims that the gel turns to a foam rather quickly when brushing begins.  </li>
      <li>toothpaste is not so special that I am willing to hassle with the inadequate packaging again.  </li>
      <li>I think the modern packaging of this stuff is fantastic; it is what caused me to buy it.  </li>
      <li>When I first got it, it was kinda fun.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this new product after receiving a free sample.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste tastes good and does not leave the overwhelming taste of mint behind.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It was easy to rinse, left no residue and had a pretty mild mint taste</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>There is a sort of aerosol flavor at first, but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive and it faded in about two seconds.  </li>
      <li>Ok enough ranting.</li>
      <li>At first it was just one</li>
      <li>There was still more product that continued to leak from the dispenser after I put the cap back on and walked</li>
      <li>From the first moment I used it, I was displeased.  </li>
      <li>I cannot state with certainty that the foam cleans better than regular tube toothpaste, but it certainly cleans as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>as I said, excellent packaging.&lt;br /&gt;5) tube/can seems to go a long way considering its small size.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found that use of certain foaming toothpastes can cause mouth ulcers.     </li>
      <li>When I saw this product, I liked the idea of it foaming up and getting into the little cracks and crevices.&lt;br</li>
      <li>expect to make this something that I always have available; although, I am certain that I won&#x27;t abandon the traditional tube of toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>One learns to improvise, and a pump delivery system vs a tube or even squeeze bottle was so much easier.  </li>
      <li>(Unlike most people, I do not really like the flavor of \\&quot;mint\\&quot; in food or anything else.)  </li>
      <li>(though I agree that GSK really need to fix that.)</li>
      <li>really foamy, which may or may not be helpful</li>
      <li>I stopped using this, and went back to my original Sensodyne, and everything seems to have cleared itself up.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer to purchase everything through Amazon.com because I live in their state and shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to give it less than five stars just because they don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The problem with this particular Sensodyne product is the packaging.  </li>
      <li>To top it off, last bottle l bought &#x27;broke&#x27; last night when l used it and didn&#x27;t Stop until it fully emptied.</li>
      <li>This reduction was found to be as high as 81% in one study.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste has really helped my sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>Also, more is wasted than used.</li>
      <li>I thought the toothpaste worked well and liked the flavor though the foam took a bit of getting used to, but the packaging is too flawed to be worth the money.</li>
      <li>Excellent toothpaste, helps with my sensitive teeth, it is a little expensive but well worth it, I bought a different tooth paste becasue of the expense of this one, buy quickly went back to the sensodyne</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth and have used Sensodyne toothpaste before.</li>
      <li>Sensodyne Iso Active seemed like it would be a wonderful product, so I purchased a can at its rather expensive price.  </li>
      <li>I usually have to spit once, when I&#x27;m near the end because it does get sort of overwhelming</li>
      <li>Eventually I ran the nozzle under the faucet, and then the foam just started coming out non-stop, making a huge mess all over my sink.  </li>
      <li>It tasted good, and it&#x27;s much less messy than tube style toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Although the toothpaste itself is helpful is soothing my sensitivities in my teeth, the gel won&#x27;t stop coming out of the top properly, and every time I use it a lot is wasted, becoming a dried up lump of gunk</li>
      <li>When the cap is popped off for the next use, there is a large buildup of residual gel that has leaked from the nozzle.  </li>
      <li>fault ppl are pressing to hard on the top it like blaming soda that sprays everywhere after you shake the can and pop the lid.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is not press so hard on the dispenser top.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands of sensitive toothpaste (including regular Sensodyne) and they do little to help.  </li>
      <li>Just be ready for the taste and texture, especially if you use a sonic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>sensitivity protection really does work (as it does with all similar toothpastes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a canine tooth that is so sensitive</li>
      <li>i taught my 7 yr old</li>
      <li>I used an electric toothbrush and the foaming action with this</li>
      <li>The directions say to use an inch of the toothpaste, I generally use less, mostly because my toothbrush is smaller, but it still generates a lot of foam.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s better than regular Sensodyne since they both contain the same amount of the active ingredient, but it works.  </li>
      <li>Love it because I SHOULD be using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, but also because I suffered a major fracture of my left wrist and basically had one hand, only fingers on the other.  </li>
      <li>More than half of the whole bottle went to waste in one night.</li>
      <li>Super efficient, low flow dispenser allows one to put exactly the right amount of product on the bristles leading to vastly less waste than a traditional tube of toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste but only hard to find in stores</li>
      <li>I have been using regular Sensodyne for years, so when I saw an ad for this new stuff on tv, I figured why not?    </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth, so I&#x27;ve been a Sensodyne paste user for a long time.  </li>
      <li>This version of Sensodyne seems to work as well as their regular version, with one major drawback: the taste/texture.  </li>
      <li>feel a bit guilty about using an aluminum can dispensed toothpaste because it seems wasteful, but on the other hand, I do think that the foaming nature of this toothpaste does a really good job of cleaning my teeth, whether it does or not.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Called Sensodyne because of tremendous waste of product after you press down, Also my other can just didn&#x27;t work after the first use.</li>
      <li>far as sensitivity, I haven&#x27;t lost any protection since switching from the tube to this, and it seems like it&#x27;s having a good effect on some gum soreness I have near the base of a couple of my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m a sucker for a new and unusual product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My suggestion: if you must have a pump-operated toothpaste that helps with sensitivity, use less than the recommended amount on your brush (can says at least 1 inch, which is far too much, unless it is just being aggravated by my particular brush), and be ready for an odd flavor.    </li>

<li> you can get past the couple seconds of aerosol-ish taste and don&#x27;t mind the big foaming action, then I recommend this product to you.  </li>
<li> It turned out the be the opposite, every time I used it extra came out and made a mess.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The commercials for Sensodyne \\&quot;Isoactive\\&quot; are compelling in that it correctly claims that the gel turns to a foam rather quickly when brushing begins.  The toothpaste tastes good and does not leave the overwhelming taste of mint behind.  (Unlike most people, I do not really like the flavor of \\&quot;mint\\&quot; in food or anything else.)  I cannot state with certainty that the foam cleans better than regular tube toothpaste, but it certainly cleans as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this particular Sensodyne product is the packaging.  Each time I popped the cap off, there was a gooey build-up of the gel that continues to leak from the dispenser after each use.  To correct this annoyance, I began waiting until I finished my tooth care routine, at which time I wiped the gel from the nozzle and placed the cap back on the standing tube.  Given that it takes me at least 5 minutes to brush and floss, I thought this would solve the problem.  WRONG!  There was still more product that continued to leak from the dispenser after I put the cap back on and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the problem is, but it seems impossible to stop the slow leakage of gel once the dispenser is used for the first time.  I do not want to wipe off the dispenser each time I use the toothpaste.  I do not want to find dried gel caked on the dispenser and inside the cap each time I take it off.  This is, simply put, messy and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is not so special that I am willing to hassle with the inadequate packaging again.  There is no way Sensodyne could not have known about this problem when the product was packaged and tested.  Either the company was too lazy to correct the problem or did not care.  Either way, I will not purchase Sensodyne \\&quot;Isoactive\\&quot; toothpaste anymore.</li>
    <li> NOTHING SPECIAL!! NOT A SPECIAL DIFFUSSED FOAM!! JUST REGULAR TOOTHPASTE IN A CAN!!!  NOT WORTH THE $$$$$....</li>
    <li> After trying this I will never again buy it. Even if you clean the dispenser after using it, the foam comes out over time. It&#x27;s messy and sticky and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews about the packaging of this product.  There are a lot of cons (gel oozing out of the container during the day, you can&#x27;t see the fill level, and it costs 2-3x what regular toothpaste does.)  I also don&#x27;t like that it has an odd taste (maybe something to do with the propellant they use?)  I&#x27;m frankly a little worried about what chemical I&#x27;m ingesting from the propellant.    However, I continue to buy this product because it is the only toothpaste that works for my sensitivity.  I have a canine tooth that is so sensitive the hygienist has to numb it when she cleans my teeth.  I have tried so many brands of sensitive toothpaste (including regular Sensodyne) and they do little to help.  I got desperate and shelled out over $5 for a tube of this stuff, and now I won&#x27;t go back.  My tooth doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I brush with this stuff.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s better than regular Sensodyne since they both contain the same amount of the active ingredient, but it works.  If you are desperate to soothe a sensitive tooth, I&#x27;d give this a try.  Goop on the can is a small price to pay for my tooth not bothering me! (though I agree that GSK really need to fix that.)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has really helped my sensitive teeth.  It tasted good, and it&#x27;s much less messy than tube style toothpaste.  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using regular Sensodyne for years, so when I saw an ad for this new stuff on tv, I figured why not?    When I first got it, it was kinda fun.  Like other reviewer&#x27;s stated it was a little funky smelling, but nothing too bad.  It also leaked after it was done spraying out, but that didn&#x27;t bother me either.    What did bother me was how after a week of using this my gums started to bleed.  Mostly when I was brushing, but normally I had very healthy gums.  I figured it was something else and kept using it.  After a week or so more my gums were randomly bleeding for no reason.  This toothpaste is the only thing that I could figure would cause this.  Went to the dentist a week later and my hygienist said it was the worst she had ever seen my gums, and this was brushing and flossing every day.      I stopped using this, and went back to my original Sensodyne, and everything seems to have cleared itself up.    Would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone after the pain I was in.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I&#x27;ve been a Sensodyne paste user for a long time.  When I saw this product, I liked the idea of it foaming up and getting into the little cracks and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does foam almost immediately after you get it in your mouth and it&#x27;s not a bubbly foam, but a creamy, almost Cool Whip-ish texture.  There is a sort of aerosol flavor at first, but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive and it faded in about two seconds.  The directions say to use an inch of the toothpaste, I generally use less, mostly because my toothbrush is smaller, but it still generates a lot of foam.  I usually have to spit once, when I&#x27;m near the end because it does get sort of overwhelming and you start foaming at the mouth like Cujo if you don&#x27;t get rid of some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to rinse, left no residue and had a pretty mild mint taste afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hate that glob of gooey, sticky toothpaste that leaks out of the tip a few hours after brushing, mostly because I wonder how much toothpaste I&#x27;m losing.  I usually wait until the evening when I brush again and just pinch that part off and toss it into the drain and repeat in the morning.  It&#x27;s not a lot, maybe a quarter inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as sensitivity, I haven&#x27;t lost any protection since switching from the tube to this, and it seems like it&#x27;s having a good effect on some gum soreness I have near the base of a couple of my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and it seems like it&#x27;s about half gone, although it&#x27;s hard to tell from the weight of the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the couple seconds of aerosol-ish taste and don&#x27;t mind the big foaming action, then I recommend this product to you.  It&#x27;s honestly not as bad as others have said and I&#x27;m going to continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> How do toothpaste manufacturers make more money off a product that changes little over time and consumers use very slowly?  Put it in a package that leaks and makes a mess everywhere!  After dealing with this for a few weeks you&#x27;ll use it even faster to get rid of it so you can go back to regular toothpaste without the guilt of throwing away still useable foaming toothpaste.    Stay away-this product is horrible.</li>
    <li> Called Sensodyne because of tremendous waste of product after you press down, Also my other can just didn&#x27;t work after the first use. I have no idea how this product was ever released. The company said \\&quot;sorry, we know about this problem\\&quot; \\&quot;we are looking into it.\\&quot;  No refund available. My dentist had recommended his brand. I will now have to look at other options</li>
    <li> Every time I take the cap off I find there&#x27;s a sizeable lump of dried up paste from the previous time I used it.  I then have to rinse this off before I can deliver more toothpaste.  I&#x27;m guessing that about 30-40% of the toothpaste that comes out gets wasted in this fashion.  Back to the drawing board Sensodyne....</li>
    <li> Love it because I SHOULD be using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, but also because I suffered a major fracture of my left wrist and basically had one hand, only fingers on the other.  One learns to improvise, and a pump delivery system vs a tube or even squeeze bottle was so much easier.  Odd, I can no longer find in my grocery store.</li>
    <li> Sensodyne Iso Active seemed like it would be a wonderful product, so I purchased a can at its rather expensive price.  From the first moment I used it, I was displeased.  The stuff has a faint taste of glue, which is not exactly what I look for in a product I use twice a day.  But it is the packaging that is so annoying.  The instructions say to rinse the nozzle after each use.  But this only provides temporary relief.  When the cap is popped off for the next use, there is a large buildup of residual gel that has leaked from the nozzle.  If one fails to rinse the nozzle previous to this, the buildup is even larger.  It is unpleasant to deal with and a pain to have to clean twice a day for little result.  I am just waiting for this can to be empty so I can go back to regular toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is a very refreshing way to brush your teeth.  I used an electric toothbrush and the foaming action with this is excellent.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This version of Sensodyne seems to work as well as their regular version, with one major drawback: the taste/texture.  I use a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush so the \\&quot;iso-active\\&quot; foam starts IMMEDIATELY.  In fact, the foam quickly feels like it has filled my mouth and I have to fight back the urge to pull what feels like an entire wad of sterile gauze from my mouth.  That, along with the taste that reminds me of what a hospital room smells like, combines to make it an unpleasant experience.    My suggestion: if you must have a pump-operated toothpaste that helps with sensitivity, use less than the recommended amount on your brush (can says at least 1 inch, which is far too much, unless it is just being aggravated by my particular brush), and be ready for an odd flavor.    All in all, it WILL clean your teeth.  Just be ready for the taste and texture, especially if you use a sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  My teeth feel so clean and fresh when I use it.</li>
    <li> Although the toothpaste itself is helpful is soothing my sensitivities in my teeth, the gel won&#x27;t stop coming out of the top properly, and every time I use it a lot is wasted, becoming a dried up lump of gunk I have to remove before getting more out.....it&#x27;s expensive, and this waste makes it doubly or triply expensive!</li>
    <li> Everyone keeps complaining about the toothpaste making a mess. The solution is oober simple i taught my 7 yr old and I&#x27;m working on getting my husband to do it. All you have to do is not press so hard on the dispenser top. THAT&#x27;S IT! It&#x27;s not the containers fault ppl are pressing to hard on the top it like blaming soda that sprays everywhere after you shake the can and pop the lid. Ok enough ranting. this is an excellent product. i used the original tube but as someone else pointed out the texture is kind of gritty and i dont like that feeling in mouth or on my teeth. I prefer the smooth gel and the foaming action is great. After brushing my teeth feel squeaky clean and the mint flavor is just right its not over powering the so i dont have to wait till the horrible mint taste goes away to enjoy breakfast.</li>
    <li> Got two, one did not dispence, the other did. Great toothpaste, not so great dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should never be an issue with these, and buying through the mail means expensive returns.</li>
    <li> I think the modern packaging of this stuff is fantastic; it is what caused me to buy it.  I expected it to be an overpriced gimmick but I&#x27;m a sucker for a new and unusual product.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I really, really, like this stuff and have since bought a couple more cans of it.  It isn&#x27;t perfect though, and I&#x27;ll get to that, but first the good bits:&lt;br /&gt;1) Super efficient, low flow dispenser allows one to put exactly the right amount of product on the bristles leading to vastly less waste than a traditional tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;2) Subdued flavoring means that doesn&#x27;t feel as though one has scoured his mouth out with mint flavored bleach.&lt;br /&gt;3) really foamy, which may or may not be helpful but it sure seems as though it is doing something.&lt;br /&gt;4) as I said, excellent packaging.&lt;br /&gt;5) tube/can seems to go a long way considering its small size.&lt;br /&gt;6) sensitivity protection really does work (as it does with all similar toothpastes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bad:&lt;br /&gt;1) The little glob of gummy residue that inevitably balls up on the end of the spout is off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;2) elaborate packaging seems wasteful (contradictory, I know).&lt;br /&gt;3) spendy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to make this something that I always have available; although, I am certain that I won&#x27;t abandon the traditional tube of toothpaste.  Actually, using regular toothpaste after using this stuff for a long period of time is a bit shocking because of all of the extra product that goes onto the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I feel a bit guilty about using an aluminum can dispensed toothpaste because it seems wasteful, but on the other hand, I do think that the foaming nature of this toothpaste does a really good job of cleaning my teeth, whether it does or not.&lt;br /&gt;I will likely stock up on it when it goes on sale and always have a can next to the sink.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and have used Sensodyne toothpaste before. I decided to try this new product after receiving a free sample. After using it for several weeks I started getting ulcers in my mouth. They were EXTREMELY painful.      I had no idea why I was getting them. At first it was just one but then they kept coming. I changed toothbrushes and stopped eating foods I thought may have caused it. After no relief I started searching the Internet to find out what causes mouth ulcers. I found that use of certain foaming toothpastes can cause mouth ulcers.     When I STOPPED USING this foaming Sensodyne, I stopped getting them. I suggest using regular toothpaste. This is what us stated on [...], and further supported on Wiki,     \\&quot;Toothpastes and mouthwashes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).  Research suggests that products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate (\\&quot;SLS\\&quot;), a foaming agent found in most toothpaste and mouthwash formulations, may be associated with an increased risk for canker sore outbreaks.         This may be due to SLS&#x27;s drying effect on the protective surface of oral tissues. Once this protective layer has been compromised, the tissue underneath is more vulnerable to irritants such as acidic foods.       Several studies have reported that participants who used SLS-free toothpaste experienced fewer canker sores. This reduction was found to be as high as 81% in one study. This same study also reported that some participants felt that the canker sores that did form were less painful (than those that developed during those time periods when they did use SLS-containing products.)\\&quot;          [[ASIN:B002KHNMYM Sensodyne iso-active Multi-Action Toothpaste, 4.3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste but only hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> exactly is what it said it would be, and with all the different options on toothpaste these days, I was relieved to find the exact one I&#x27;ve been happily using. Came in the mail quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste, helps with my sensitive teeth, it is a little expensive but well worth it, I bought a different tooth paste becasue of the expense of this one, buy quickly went back to the sensodyne</li>
    <li> Hubby was very happy with this purchase - hard to find item in the stores!</li>
    <li> l have been using this product for a while. The toothpaste itself works well for me but the bottle is always leaking and oozing. This toothpaste is already expensive Compared to other ones. Also, more is wasted than used. To top it off, last bottle l bought &#x27;broke&#x27; last night when l used it and didn&#x27;t Stop until it fully emptied. Whatever l did from pushing it again to pulling to turning did not help. More than half of the whole bottle went to waste in one night. that prompted me to write this review.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth paste.  It is the best works great and foams awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking the canister would provide a neatness that is difficult to achieve with toothpaste.  It turned out the be the opposite, every time I used it extra came out and made a mess.  That in and of itself wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal.  Then about two weeks after buying it, it just stopped working, I would press and press and nothing came out.  I tried to clean the nozzle, nothing worked.  Eventually I ran the nozzle under the faucet, and then the foam just started coming out non-stop, making a huge mess all over my sink.  I had to throw the canister away because it wouldn&#x27;t stop oozing out.  I thought the toothpaste worked well and liked the flavor though the foam took a bit of getting used to, but the packaging is too flawed to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite toothpaste. I like the container and don&#x27;t mind the little bit that always comes out after I use it. The contents are under pressure and therefore some toothpaste will always come out after it is dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the foaminess of this toothpaste during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that Amazon.com doesn&#x27;t seem to carry this product any more. I&#x27;m not going to give it less than five stars just because they don&#x27;t carry it any more. After all, I&#x27;m rating the product not the seller. I&#x27;ll have to find another vendor. I&#x27;d prefer to purchase everything through Amazon.com because I live in their state and shipping is fast.</li>
