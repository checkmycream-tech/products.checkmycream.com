      <li>My skin feels great !</li>
      <li>Great item great price</li>
      <li>You must hold it like a banana with 2 hands, and then with great effort, act as if you are breaking it to force the battery</li>
      <li>Great gift for her.</li>
      <li>This was delivered within timeframe promised and it great condition.  </li>
      <li>Very nice cleansing brush, affordable, and something I&#x27;ve incorporated into my nightly routine.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Great way to keep the face clean and the hands off the face....</li>
      <li>Great product, within the first week I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my face feels better after using this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Better deal than via a representative.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!!!  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the price :)</li>
      <li>This facial cleansing brush is great.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>Haves noticed a significant difference in my face&#x27;s texture.</li>
      <li>I use it with either the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift cleanser or Dove soap,  and it gets my skin clean.</li>
      <li>Even when I think I have done a good job with just my hands, I go back and use the brush...</li>
      <li>It works and feels like the really high priced models but is much more affordable.  </li>
      <li>But I have to say, the Mary Kay brush is really pretty good, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>My 42-yr old skin is more pliable and has taken on a fresher, healthier appearance.  </li>
      <li>Just got my cleansing brush today and it left my face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>My mother called me after using it for the first time and raved about it.</li>
      <li>I find this very unsatisfactory.  </li>
      <li>My face is so much clearer and my skin is so much softer.</li>
      <li>It was much cheaper than buying from a representative.</li>
      <li>It takes off all the dry skin and makes my face feel so fresh and clean and alive.</li>
      <li>I reviewed them on line and this one was highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I used to have a Clarisonic, but I find it hard to gauge whether the Mia was much better, as my skin was just better overall back then.</li>
      <li>I used it once a day for the first week and now I only use it once a week.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin smooth, especially in this dry winter air.</li>
      <li>The brush works very well, but I don&#x27;t recommend anyone with sensitive hands to purchase this unit unless they have someone to open it.</li>
      <li>Also, it feels so soft like it is massaging my face instead of scrubbing it off.</li>
      <li>I use it in the evenings; I&#x27;ve heard that you&#x27;re not supposed to use cleansing brushes every day, but the Mary Kay seems like it&#x27;s gentle enough.</li>

    <li> The battery compartment is extremely difficult to open - I had to have a man pull it apart for me to put the initial batteries in and he found it difficult.  I find this very unsatisfactory.  You must hold it like a banana with 2 hands, and then with great effort, act as if you are breaking it to force the battery end off.The brush works very well, but I don&#x27;t recommend anyone with sensitive hands to purchase this unit unless they have someone to open it.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money! I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy something as expensive as a Clarisonic, but this definitely does the trick! My face is so much clearer and my skin is so much softer. Arrived on time. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to remove all my makeup. Even when I think I have done a good job with just my hands, I go back and use the brush... Guess what? The bristles are covered in all the makeup I missed! Also, it feels so soft like it is massaging my face instead of scrubbing it off. Totally worth the price :)</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mother. She&#x27;d wanted one for years but would never get it for herself. I reviewed them on line and this one was highly recommended. My mother called me after using it for the first time and raved about it. Great gift for her.</li>
    <li> This facial cleansing brush is great.  It works and feels like the really high priced models but is much more affordable.  I use it serveral times a week and have noticed that my skin looks brighter and cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great product, within the first week I noticed a difference in my skin. I used it once a day for the first week and now I only use it once a week.</li>
    <li> My 42-yr old skin is more pliable and has taken on a fresher, healthier appearance.  Awesome value for the price.</li>
    <li> Just got my cleansing brush today and it left my face feeling smooth and clean.  I felt like I had a facial and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it daily. Thank you Mary Kay!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It takes off all the dry skin and makes my face feel so fresh and clean and alive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a month ago. It does make your face feel cleaner, especially after wearing make up. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> It was much cheaper than buying from a representative. Works very well! Haves noticed a significant difference in my face&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleansing brush, affordable, and something I&#x27;ve incorporated into my nightly routine. I&#x27;ve never had another facial brush to compare it to, however...</li>
    <li> I use this brush about once a day. I love it! I can use it at the sink, or in the shower, with any cleanser I want.  It keeps my skin smooth, especially in this dry winter air. My only complaint is that it does not get rid of all my black heads</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my face feels better after using this product.  Great way to keep the face clean and the hands off the face.... Would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleansing brush with a refill brush from the same seller.  This was delivered within timeframe promised and it great condition.  Love this product so much!!!  My skin feels great !</li>
    <li> Better deal than via a representative.</li>
