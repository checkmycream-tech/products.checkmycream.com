      <li>I am normally a tingle fan, but the results of this tanner and the smell of it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because of my choice of lotions or lack or experience, but this product did not do anything significant for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference from this product to the ones much less expensive</li>
    <li> I definitely think this is not real. Does not have the same consistency nor smell as the professional sample purchased in the facility I tan with.</li>
    <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s smells great and is very moisturizing !</li>
    <li> My wife uses this when tanning.  She likes the aroma and the consistency of the cream.  We paid 1/3 the price charged at the local tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it looks and it makes my skin look tan</li>
    <li> Wow! Talk about fast shipping! Got it In a few days! Thank you seller!!! I love the smell and consistency . My bf said I smelled like metal but I think he&#x27;s crazy. Also left my skin soft after the shower</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very nice tanning lotion  smells very good</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t get slimy &amp; stinky after tanning like some cheap lotions.</li>
    <li> Smells good and definitely helps to influence a tan! Definitely does not protect from the sun in any way!</li>
    <li> love the way it works, but the smell is overwhelming</li>
    <li> not impressed with product at all smells like old womans perfume and doesnt seem to make a difference in tanning bed</li>
    <li> Thank you, Kardashians!  I never thought I could get my white butt and thighs this tan without using spray paint.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Smells wonderful.  The skin care in it is amazing!  My stretch marks are disappearing!!  Tanning super fast as well!  So glad i ordered and paid only $25 verses $90 at the salon!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but honestly got a better tan out of the regular kardashian dark bronzer. The smell of this iced bronzer is like a sandalwood vanilla which is nice but has a smell sort of a men&#x27;s cologne, and the ATO is really bad for me. I don&#x27;t feel ANY &#x27;cooling&#x27; what so ever. I would probably not buy again. My next bottle will be either luminary or the kardashian dark bronzer, which gives me a really awesome tan but i always have bad ato with the kardashian line.</li>
    <li> This is the third Kardashian tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s probably my least favorite, but that&#x27;s mostly because of the scent. As with their other lotions, it smells nice, but not as good as their others. The bottle lasts awhile. I never have to worry about streaking when I use this lotion, which is awesome for a bronzer. I&#x27;m not a super huge fan of the cooling affect, if you tan in beds with air conditioning or high velocity fans, it can get quite a bit chilly.</li>
    <li> They really talk this one up but I think its just ok</li>
    <li> love that after I get out I do not smell like sweat it really has a great scent for when u are done tanning.. but  I really don&#x27;t see that great of results iam used to using lotions with tingle so that could be why im expecting more.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the second best tanning lotion I have ever purchased. Not only does it work incredibly good, as I was instantly one good shade darker but it smells incredible and leaves your skin so soft and silky. I would recommend this for everyone and would absolutely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> LOVE it ! Don&#x27;t feel dry out of the bed. I am an avid tanner and I love this bed! Found my forever lotion! Price was completely on point.</li>
    <li> I am a pretty hard sale...this product was okay, not awesome but okay for the money. I did like the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells great even after tanning (no burnt smell) leaves skin feeling clean. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shower after tanning. Also saw immediate results after my first use! I would recommend this lotion to anybody!</li>
    <li> Kardashian Glow Iced Bronzee smells great! I haven&#x27;t tried any other kardashian lotions to compare it to, but it&#x27;s one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Amazing, way better than paying an arm and a leg at the salon! I&#x27;ve wanted the glow since day one, pumped is my next target.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions.  Has a clean smell but doesn&#x27;t turn &#x27;funky&#x27; while you are in the tanning bed.  I never have any problem with using this lotion and then going about my day afterwards without a shower.  Absorbs easily and has a very smooth consistency.  Would recommend to anyone who prefers a non-tingle lotion with a great smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a very nice smell, but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my tan.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 4-5 months now. I started out about as light as a porcelain doll.  The tanning salon workers consistently comment on how well I tan from day 1. (I am half Hispanic, I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it.)  This was the third lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  I started with girlfriend sexy, then glam slam, and then made kardashian glow my first online ordered lotion.  Just can&#x27;t beat these prices.  I don&#x27;t exactly notice a difference in lotions. I tan 3-5 days a week.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because of my choice of lotions or lack or experience, but this product did not do anything significant for me. However, I have no complaints, it didn&#x27;t have any negative effects on me. It smells nice. Reliable delivery, got it the day it said would delivered. I have had no problems with any lotions I&#x27;ve used, but I have yet to find the lotion to give me my desired color (looking for a dark natural tan with brown pigment [trying naked ambition next].</li>
    <li> this product is no better than any other lotion that I have bought,I actually prefer to use my $10 bottle than this one.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion, was introduced to it at my tanning salon. I am normally a tingle fan, but the results of this tanner and the smell of it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion and the sandalwood smell.  Gets me bronze fast without making me look orange.  I have noticed the cooling effect, but its normally about an hour after I tan.  I even get chill bumps!  Great lotion.</li>
    <li> This definitely got my base tan down within a short period of time. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell though.</li>
    <li> Smells great, the silicon in it makes it really smooth. I still feel like I smell like burning skin after tanning (maybe that&#x27;s a personal problem). Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion,.. the shipping was super fast. Pretty bottle. Smells really good, its a &amp;#34;light and flirty floral and sandalwood&amp;#34; scent which stays after tanning,so theres not a burnt trash smell afterwards. I am getting a really nice color from this lotion, however I dont feel the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effects.. but I usuallydont notice the tingle in other lotions either. Overall very good lotion, i am a bit disappointed about the cooling effects though as i was looking forward to it on hot days</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> smells like old ladys but im so tan from using this</li>
    <li> This is the best Kardashian tanning lotion on the market, by far. I would recommend this to anyone. Safe to put on your face and has a great smell afterwards.</li>
    <li> The lotion is expired, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Not a bad price for a ds silicone based lotion. It&#x27;s silky and goes on smooth and is by far the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of packets while working in salons). I find myself going back to it every time because I can still run errands after tanning without smelling nasty. It&#x27;s not the darkest bronzer because it&#x27;s natural but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ideal for darker olive skin tones (I suppose like the kardashians lol). It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin,  I even use it on my face sometimes. The cooling sensation actually helps in high pressure and incredibly hot beds. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy! Your salon is going to try to charge you $90+ when they get it at this price too! If it&#x27;s the kardashian label that bothers you, rip off the plastic and try to remember it&#x27;s still designer skin lol</li>
    <li> smells like a baby and it feels so good</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and seems to be working great so far! Definitely will be buying lotion from amazon in the future! This lotion was sold at the tanning salon for $120. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love love love the smell of this lotion &amp; it gives you great color.</li>
    <li> So far I have no complaints about this product. Gives a good deep tan. It does have a lingering smell (until you shower), but it isn&#x27;t nearly as unpleasant as some of the others I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for fad tanning lotions, but decided to give this one a try. First of all the shipping was flawless, I receive it in 2 days. The scent of it was alright prior to tanning, but after getting out I do not have the burnt tanning bed, bronzed smell. I only smell the sandalwood. As far as the product itself, I tan in higher level beds anyway, but I could tell a difference in my tan immediately after getting out. I would recommend this to anyone and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is very good lotion. Smells good and keeps skin soft. Love it like all the other products they have.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Nice smell and good quality.</li>
    <li> It smelled horrible didn&#x27;t like it at all. Smelled like a man that didn&#x27;t take a shower for days and kept trying cover up with colonels. I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to see if lotion really works. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Got me dark quick! I loved it!</li>
    <li> It smells very good and works very well. I got a very nice tan within only a month using this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any tan after using for two weeks</li>
    <li> Love it, creates a darker richer tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for building a nice base tan. Smells wonderful and the smell lingers long after you tan. Ive had compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smelling nice lol. Howeever it doesnt get me the shade of dark I desire.</li>
    <li> What is important- there is no DHA which means you get no color. I don&#x27;t know if they know what &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34; means because this for sure doesn&#x27;t have it. This should be classified as a white lotion, very basic. Not worth the money. Only plus is the smell (sandalwood floral?) and the silicone in the lotion which is very hydrating. It&#x27;s good if you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t smell sweet, doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning lotion and hydrates the skin without turning you orange! There is an after-tan odor which I can&#x27;t explain since there is no DHA which is normally the root of ATO... This lotion is OK</li>
    <li> Great tanner for beginners!</li>
    <li> Nice smell compared to so many others that smell of flowers or fruit.  This is light and musky.  Nice change.  Light bronzing.</li>
    <li> I am very very satisfied with this tanning bed lotion. it is one of the best I have used lately.</li>
    <li> I compared it to the real lotion and it&#x27;s nothing like it. Smells so strong... Gave me a headache. I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it makes your skin feel very soft but i don&#x27;t feel the cooling feeling at all while tanning.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great feeling after the tan. The value is great too!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell of this lotion, glad i didn&#x27;t pay full price.but it does leave your skin very soft &amp; pretty once you get out of the tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Smells good but the bronzer isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> The best Kardashian lotion in my opinion. Smells amazing and is a light bronzer( it&#x27;s not a white lotion but not a super brown lotion either) that&#x27;s not hard to rub in to your skin. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I burn every time I use it. I missed the window I had to return.</li>
    <li> I bought this online after because it is to expensive in the tanning salon. I switch it between this and the special event lotion. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Other than the name, I luv the product! Def for tanners that are results driven and want to smell good too!</li>
    <li> Great lotion no lingering smell great color even after one use and no streaking or tingling at all I LOVE this lotion.</li>
    <li> Did not work well for me at all. Didn&#x27;t help me tan.</li>
    <li> I really like the color results I get from this product and my color lasts much longer. The price was great and the scent is nice.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother to try and use this in the winter. I leave my tanning products in a bag in my trunk. When I first bought this it was really hard to shake out. I was able to use it, but every time after this it WILL NOT COME OUT of the bottle. I figured it had to be the cold weather. I will try it again in the summer months, but until then I&#x27;ll use my Bombshell lotion. I can get that lotion out of its bottle every time.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful works really well</li>
    <li> This is definitely a cheap knock off of the real stuff, smells different and the texture isn&#x27;t the same from the bottle I purchased at my salon. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Smells like men&#x27;s cologne. My husband asked me why I was wearing men&#x27;s cologne when I came home from tanning.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> No, no, NO. I cannot take the smell of this!!</li>
    <li> Love this worked so well helped me pick up a nice glow. The scent was good for when I knew I was not running straight home after tanning and you don&#x27;t smell like burnt sweating skin.</li>
    <li> Product gives good dark natural brown color. Doesn&#x27;t smell the best after using but the color and feel is nice enough to get over it.</li>
