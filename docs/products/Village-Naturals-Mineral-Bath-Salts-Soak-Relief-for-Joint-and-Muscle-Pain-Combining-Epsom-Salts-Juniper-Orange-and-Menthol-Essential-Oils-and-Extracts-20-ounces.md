<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a broke graduate student, sometimes you need to destress with a bath, but you&#x27;re broke, so you buy some cheap bath salts that smell good, and think, well...theres no reason to spend a little more on more expensive stuff. Wrong!!! I was looking up on Amazon some bath salts and wandered across this one, with awesome reviews, so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m completely amazed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set up my bath, dumped about a third of the bottle in, and dipped in. Immediately I felt a difference just because of the smell, it was very soothing. I&#x27;ve never felt that with other bath salts that smelled good too. Then a few minutes later I felt the menthol and was staring at the spout in my bathtub thinking that I had run out of hot water, but realized I felt cold only at the bottom. It was the salts!!! Now that was great to feel. Never felt that with cheaper bath salts (boy have I missed out). I put on a spa-treatment kind of spotify playlist and just soaked in it. Next time...i&#x27;m adding candles to make it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed. I am definitely going to try their &amp;#34;Aches and Pains&amp;#34; as well as &amp;#34;Cold &amp; Flu&amp;#34; bottles. The only sad thing is that you really do get 3-4 baths out of a jar (just like a previous review said). Thrilled about my purchase, and you will be too.</li>
    <li> After a hectic day, I tried this for the first time (with just 2-3 spoons of minerals) I felt good for first 5min. Felt very relaxed. But after like 10min, I started feeling dizzy. I went to sleep, and got a severe head ache!!!  I thought something was wrong that day, and give it a try the second time after a week. Same thing, end up with head ache. Its not working for me. I feel good for the first 5min. Cant tolerate the smell after that. I feel so negative.</li>
    <li> My customers love it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great and it tingles when using for a foot soak.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This entire line is just wonderful. The therapy stress and tension  bath is an ultra-relaxing, clean &amp; fresh smelling blend of bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recover from a very stressful day with bath oiI, bath salts, or body wash. After an aromatherapy bath like this, have a great night&#x27;s sleep-naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of these make a terrific and very appreciated gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget going to a spa-recline in aromatherapy at home!  Your cares will just melt away- \\&quot;Now, what was bothering me?\\&quot;...............</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend to help brighten her day. She received them and immediately tried them out to relax, her message to me was one of pure bliss! If you want to make your sweetheart happy, definitely pick her or him up some of these!</li>
    <li> got these for my hubby for Christmas- the stress, cold and allergy and aches and pains... just saw them in walmart for $4. What a waste of money buying them on here. (not to mention I was going to prestige since it was a gift. Thank goodness it was for him, not someone i was trying to impress with something from my local wally world.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this version of the Village salts.  It does provide for a pleasant bathing experience.  My overall fave, however, are the green salts in this product line.</li>
    <li> wish they had been shipped to me, but i put in the wrong address, i have had them in the past and they are amazing. they work wonders.</li>
    <li> The menthol in these salts is so strong you can&#x27;t smell anything else.  In addition, if you get any bath water in your eyes--watch out, it stings!  Overall, disappointed.  I&#x27;ll go back to mixing my own plain epsom salts and essential oils.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and does the trick: you feel relaxed and your skin gets a spa treatment. Unfortunatly, the 20oz container will only last you through 3-4 sessions. You must use half a cup every time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, to ease her stress when she comes home from work. I immediately could tell when I received the package what it was. This stuff is very very strong, I believe its the menthol. She loves it, and she says it helps her relax, which was what I wanted !</li>
    <li> CHRISTMAS GIFT.  RECIPIENT LOVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD ORDER AGAIN IF ASKED TO/</li>
    <li> Got these for my mother for Mother&#x27;s day and for some friends. Ladies love it and they&#x27;re actually quite useful for relieving stress and pains. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several village naturals products as presents for my mother.  She loves them all but her favorite is [[ASIN:B0034ZGZR0 Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Foaming Bath Oil]].  All of the village naturals products have a great scent, are reasonably priced, and work wonders in the tub.    Tip: With the bath oils a little goes a long ways.  Don&#x27;t add too much or it might foam up and over your tub!</li>
    <li> Since this was bought as a present I have no knowledge as to what the recipient will think of it.  I only know she was very pleased when she opened the gift.</li>
    <li> After surgery I needed to take warm baths daily and liked having this in it.  It smells great and feels good on the skin.  Another poster said it leaves a blue tinge in the tub.  I noticed it starting to do that after a few baths.  When draining the tub one night, I just used my hand to wipe the tub walls and it came off very easily.  So it doesn&#x27;t actually stain the tub, it just leaves a residue that is easy to clean...don&#x27;t worry.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> These salts work great but have a dark secret...tub stains.  They will leave colored ring based on salt type that is VERY hard to clean/remove.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the product that was the problem, but the shipping. I got this as a gift for a friend, and it was packed (badly) in with other items. It broke and they received a mess. Amazon never made good on it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product, and since my mother in law hasn&#x27;t complained, I can only assume that she likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I plan on buying the other soaks they offer. It really helps- I use it as a foot soak after a long day and it makes me feel a lot better.</li>
    <li> I really like the aroma of the bath salts but I can&#x27;t tell whether it does much besides add smell.  Also perhaps I&#x27;m using too much but it goes too fast and costs more than I like to pay for a bath item like this.  Probably will not order again even though I liked the item.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for quanity</li>
    <li> When delivered, the lid was cracked. Nothing fell out, but it doesn&#x27;t close right and the crack is very obvious.</li>
    <li> I am not normally moved enough by a product to write a review, but in this case I feel morally obligated.    This product contains menthol.  If you&#x27;ve never used something with menthol before, it produces a cooling sensation.  I&#x27;m not sure what genius thought it would be a good idea to put menthol in a product used in conjunction with hot water, but it seems to me like a lawsuit waiting to happen.    Last night I used this in my evening bath.  I used it exactly as directed on the label.  It took about two minutes for me to realize why I was very cold even though the water was about as hot as I could stand it.  If I hadn&#x27;t had experience with menthol, I might have turned up the heat and burned myself.  As it was, my skin was bright pink with heat even as I sat there shivering.  As soon as I figured it out, I immediately emptied the bathtub and rinsed it and myself off.  It took about ten minutes for the cooling effect of the menthol to wear off even though I refilled the bath and used some of my other bath salts.    I bought several other kinds of salts from this manufacturer, and now I&#x27;m actually scared to use them.  I may just return them unopened so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any problems with them.    If anyone from Village Naturals is reading this, I strongly suggest that you rethink this formulation.</li>
    <li> The scent is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a blend of Juniper (balances and restores), Orange (renews and rejuvenates), and menthol (comforts and relaxes). When I take the lid off, I immediately smell the scent of menthol, which clears my sinuses immediately. But I like it because it&#x27;s got a nice freshness from the juniper and the citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this is a pretty natural product. Village Naturals states that this product is 99.51% naturally derived. It contains Sea Salt, Epsom Salt, Corn Starch, Vitamins A, B2, C, and E, as well as a variety of natural extracts in addition to the ones mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions call to use roughly 1/3 cup under running water. I just eyeball it and shake in what looks to be the right amount. Based on how much I used, I could probably get about 6-7 uses from this 20-ounce bottle. The crystals immediately disintegrate and the fresh invigorating scent fills my bathroom. No foam or bubbles are produced, but I did check their website and they have a foaming bath oil product in the same scent. The crystals also do not change the color of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I normally prefer foaming bath products, I immediately fell in love with Stress and Tension Mineral Bath Soak. It leaves the water nice and soft, and my skin feels so much better afterwards. I would definitely say that it&#x27;s less drying than a foaming product. The scent does last quite a while, too, although that&#x27;s not as much a priority for me.  I use this on nights that I just want a quick 10-minute bath (save the bubble products for long soaks) to warm me up before bed and relax me. It definitely is a soothing scent that helps relieves stress. It reminds me a lot of scents used in spas, so it does feel high end and luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good bath product. It&#x27;s a little bit boring in that it doesn&#x27;t change the color of the water, fizz, or product bubbles, but the scent makes up for these deficiencies. 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Very nice product that does what it claims. Would recommend it. It takes quite a bit however to make a difference. If you are willing to use a quarter of the jar every time you will be very pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> Great product for a very inexpensive cost. In any bath store these products can easily run $20 or more, great value for what you get.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the scent before getting into the bath, my bath was so relaxing. The bath salts lived up to the description.</li>
    <li> very relaxing, sprinkle a little in the shower, really fragrant would recommend for anyone who needs to relax. Never used it as a soak.</li>
    <li> This one is so far my favorite!  It has a eucalyptus scent and also a floral scent!  I went  though this fast, I was soaking in the tub every night!</li>
    <li> Great for after a long week of school and work! It smells fantastic and is so relaxing. I love it!!</li>
    <li> They are really strong, but smell nice.  The only think I didn&#x27;t like was after using them I felt like I had a filim or oil on my body so I took a shower after lol, but they are relaxing while you soak.</li>
    <li> lovely scented bath crystals and dissolved quickly in bath water,beautiful blue crystals. will be purchasing other scents from vaillage naturals.</li>
    <li> Def good for the money as for a christmas gift. My mom really enjoys it and so do it. I have used it time to time, very relaxing and can put you right to sleep!</li>
    <li> Along with my bath pillow, I purchased this in hopes it would help my stress level before going to bed. It does, and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is the best bath soak on the market. I keep a supply of all of Village Naturals bath soaks, cause after a bad day whether it&#x27;s at the gym or shopping cause a warm bath with anyone of their product will make me feel better</li>
    <li> All of the Village Naturals Bath Soaks I&#x27;ve used have done what they claim to do. They have a lot of aromatic quality for even a small amount of salts. I don&#x27;t use very much in any given bath and I still get a nice aromatic experience through my entire bath, not just at the beginning. The scents are great. I would use the scents for more than just baths if they were available in for example, room spray or candles. These actually encourage me to take a bath to relax, even though I&#x27;m not a bath person, because of how much I like the aroma. They dissolve really well- you won&#x27;t be sitting on a bunch of rock salt when you&#x27;re trying to relax. I&#x27;m a generally high strung, stressed out person- both because of personality and what I have going on. I have tried so many various teas, oils, and natural vitamin drops in an attempt to get relief from something other than prescription drugs and seriously, I feel way more relaxed after using these salts. Could be actually related to some sort of stress hormone interaction with the molecules of the scents, or could just be a great placebo from relaxing in a bath with a scent I actually love. Either way- works best for me to relax. I highly recommend these. They&#x27;d make a great gift too! Especially for someone going through a tough time, a student headed toward finals in school, or someone with a high demand job. The scent is pretty universal, seems like most people would like it.</li>
    <li> If you are expecting for this to cure all your problems, you might need to consult your life counselor. If you are looking for a small way to rid yourself of that tension you carry around all week, this product will fit the bill. I got this item at a discount, and with the discount I feel like this was a steal! I have used it twice now and it&#x27;s very subtly relaxing--I don&#x27;t feel overpowered by relaxation, but I can feel the tension loosen in my muscles and the scent somehow /feels/ therapeutic. I used this after working in the garden for several hours for the first time this year, and I have to say, it made a big difference on my recovery time (not just the product, but the bath as well).  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you are bath taker--it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Smells relaxing, works well as a foot soak, and has lasted quite a while. I even sprinkle a little in my showers for the quick spa effect.</li>
    <li> This is an aroma that adds to relaxation and seems to help prepare for preparing to sleep. Quickly dissolves and immediately fills the nostrils with a comforting kind of response.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of menthol and juniper and this bath soak is just lovely. I had a cold this past weekend and soaked a few times with this, and though it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong, it gently helped with my congestion. The granules are larger than the Epsom salts that come in the bag and take a bit longer to dissolve, but that&#x27;s hardly a valid &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34;. My roommate enjoys this as well. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and was told that it smells great and feels devine.  I can&#x27;t comment on it for myself since I didn&#x27;t use it.  The price was much better than elsewhere so I&#x27;m glad I ordered it,.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are the BEST! They desolve quickliy and the aroma&#x27;a are amazing! I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t received aches/pains yet, but stress/tension i have. it&#x27;s a christmas gift for my mom so i haven&#x27;t used it, but the packaging it came in was phenomenal. seriously. even though it&#x27;s a plastic bottle they still wrapped it in plastic wrap, bubble wrap, tissue paper, and put it in a bubble wrap envelope. very great wrapping AND it came in the mail super quickly. a lot quicker than i expected!</li>
    <li> My mom loves these bath salts! With all bath salts, it takes quite a bit to get the aroma (don&#x27;t expect a tablespoon to do the job). My mother has used TONS of bath salts of different brands, scents, origins, therapeutic properties, etc, and she said these were some of her nicer ones. I&#x27;m not a bath salt guru myself, but if it pleases the woman, then its good enough for me! Price isn&#x27;t outrageous, either!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift. Its my aunts favorite. Best price. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separate from purchase,&lt;br /&gt;Why is there a length requirement to write a review? Its annoying.</li>
    <li> This bath soak really does help with stress and tension and it a really wonderful product.  I also love the smell of Lavender that this product contains.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent and herbal combination that is very soothing. Wish the jar was bigger or they sold a bulk size.</li>
    <li> Love these bath salts.  I enjoy taking baths.  It makes my skin tingle.  I love gifting these too.  I&#x27;ve bought them ALL!</li>
    <li> I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;I do, of course, have my favorites, but the aromatherapy works for each type. This one was truly did relieve my stress and tension. Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Although I loved the price and the packaging of the item, I was not crazy about the smell of it. It reeked of mint. I would buy the item again but in a different color.</li>
    <li> I did not note any extra stress releif when using this product.  The aroma was nice, along witht he warm water, but not a significant relase of stress or tension for me.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good, but nothing to write home to mama about. The disappointment came about a min after I added the salts to the water. The scent faded to nothing but plain water. I added Epsom salt to the mixture which shouldn&#x27;t have changed anything. I didn&#x27;t feel anymore relaxed then I would have with plain ol soap and water. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t purchase a large container. I actually brought the 2oz packets from target for a dollar. Yeah, 1 buck. That should&#x27;ve hinted me that these are cheap salts. You&#x27;re better off making your own using Epsom salt, sea salt and essential oil drops of juniper and menthol. It will last longer and give a better effect. So don&#x27;t buy- especially at this price! Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these salts for my mother for Christmas. She loves aromatherapy products as well as bath salts, so this seemed like a perfect combination for her. She really loves them! She says the scent is very calming and soothing. I&#x27;ve used them a few times, as well, and the aroma is very relaxing. The salts are scented very strongly, so I don&#x27;t use nearly the 1/3 cup that the label recommends.     I also had no problem with any staining at all, and our bathtub is a relatively new white-colored tub.    I ended up buying more of these salts because my mom ended up liking them so much! So I would definitely recommend them. Having ordered them twice, I had no packaging problems either, everything arrived sealed and in order. Great product and company.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Mom and she loves using them (bought 3 kinds).</li>
    <li> My daughter is going to love this for Christmas! Then I&#x27;m going to love it when I borrow it from her after the stressful holidays! : D</li>
    <li> These products are awesome. However, you can go to your local walmart and pick up the bath salts or the soap for $5</li>
    <li> First time I used this product and it really works. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave residue in the tub or my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought 3 bottles to share with my two best friends. Now, I&#x27;m sure I will have to order more for myself.</li>
    <li> This was a great balt salt.  I enjoy relaxing in the tub.  The scent was lovely.  I would definetely get it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my sister. She loves the product however  was disappointed that it arrived  broken into pieces. Her husband was able to gather the product into a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing and well worth the cost. Don&#x27;t have to put half in like some people say. Only sprinkle across the bath and your good.</li>
    <li> Quality item at a great price !!</li>
    <li> I throw a capfull of this in my tub and soak and it does seem to help some. I suffer with fibromyalgia so warm baths are soothing during a flare up. Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> Truly relieves stress and tension.  I keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my fiance who comes home very stressed from work. He loves the stress and tension relief and we will definitely be buying more Village Naturals Therapy products!</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift. They really don&#x27;t make the water feel any different. I was disappointed. I asked my husband not to buy them for me again.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our new &amp;#34;walk-in&amp;#34; Tub and they are great. Let the jets sooth you into a nice comfortable state of mind.</li>
    <li> Following the reviews of others on here I picked up a bottle of these and it was a really great choice. This smells amazing and you feel so great getting out of the tub afterwards. I will buy many more of this brand of bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used them in a foot bath after long runs and it feels so amazing. These live up to all the reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and husband as a relaxation/stress reliever.  My son uses it after a stressful afternoon playing sports and my husband uses it for his stressful days.  They both say it is a nice product and actually smells stronger in the bottle but once it is in the bath water, it is not so bad.</li>
    <li> It works.  Be careful, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  Good value</li>
    <li> Fresh smelling, and arrived fast. No problems here!</li>
    <li> These crystals are so relaxing, I don&#x27;t want to get out of the tub. This is a great way to relieve stress after fighting traffic on the way home everyday.</li>
    <li> I really liked this salt. It smells good and it works really well. I use it after massages and really makes me feel good and I like the minerals contained within it.</li>
    <li> Awesome bath rocks and wonderful smell! Will buy more!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She said it smelled really nice and made a nice addition to her bath time.</li>
    <li> I love the village naturals therapy bath soak.  It makes my bath very relaxing after a long day at work.</li>
    <li> Oh man is this stuff relaxing. Sat in the tub for an hour and couldn&#x27;t leave. Was so relaxed and care free, relaxed my body and my mind and got rid of the stressful world quickly. Was like experiencing some kind of eurotopa for the body and mind. Helped me sleep too. Slept like a baby. Stuff smells strong and has some dangerous chemicals in it, but that&#x27;s the price you pay to use a product that&#x27;s so good for you at the same time. Trade off you could say. Leaves my skin so soft too...... Highly recommend this one kiddies. Just don&#x27;t use to much and get to much of a good thing now :-) a rub a dub dub......</li>
    <li> While it may be soothing in the tub, if any of the wet product gets on a shower curtain or towel, you&#x27;ll have a stain there!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for aching muscles!  Soak in the tub!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that it gave me any stress relief or tension release. It dissolved well, but didn&#x27;t really make any difference. I didn&#x27;t notice any aroma therapy or any skin softening agents when I used this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - the perfect addition to any bath!  I&#x27;m actually about to purchase more!  Wish it was in a bigger package!</li>
    <li> Nice bath salts but it needs more scent. What else can I say to get to the word minimum? Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great Buy! I love to take a bath in this product! It makes you feel refreshed and smells awesome. Try it.</li>
    <li> I love my mineral bath salts and lotion. I don&#x27;t like lotions that are too perfumy or fruit smelling. These are minerals that help sooth and the menthol aches and pain one really helped my sinuses and my aching muscles. They have a light fresh smell that I really like. Will buy more for sure. I bought the Stress and Tension and the Aches and Pains - looking forward to seeing what other selections are available!</li>
    <li> Does not specify how much to use per bath, sometimes I feel we use too much or too little. The smell can be a bit strong at times and using too much makes the water extremely blue. Overall, the product is not bad, but not one of our favorites.</li>
    <li> Really works for soothing tired muscles. I use it in my bath at night and my pregnancy is much more bearable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like to bathe but my wife does and she loved this product.  It smelt pretty good but I don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
    <li> I tried using it, The aroma was okay and it was a little relaxing but I think I will try to look for something better instead.</li>
    <li> I love all of their bath salts. I love the brand. But I found them at my local walmart in the bath soap isle for $5. I used to get them as a splurge item but know I know they can become a daily routine.</li>
    <li> ...and staying in longer.  This stuff is amazing.  I want a giant tub of it so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and was told that it smells and works great.  In fact, the recipient is almost out of product.</li>
    <li> A lot of bath products can be too &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34;, very strong, or have weird undertone and chemically notes to them. This one is pleasant all the way through. Is actually calming and potent enough that a few shakes will make the whole bath great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put some on the floor of a hot shower occasionally and it works pretty well too.</li>
    <li> Recibi el paquete a tiempo comtestaron mis preguntas&lt;br /&gt;sin ningun  problema  los recomientdo&lt;br /&gt;para que hagan  sus compras&lt;br /&gt;Saludos  Cordiales</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times already in my bath.  It smells great &amp; is very relaxing.  I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> nothing is better then relaxing in a nice hot bath after a long stressful day, these bath salts are the icing on the cake, amazing product that smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the bubble bath for aches and pains from this line and love them both!  They make a nice bath even more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves baths and bath salts. I am sure she will enjoy the large container of these salts to relieve stress and tension.&lt;br /&gt;They surely smell good.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I workout everyday very hard so I needed something to relax my body and mind so I could get ready for bed. Loved this, smell is good but can be overbearing if you&#x27;re not careful when adding it to your bath.</li>
    <li> I love a good soak, and love adding epsom salts to enhance the experience. I&#x27;ve used a different Village Naturals product- the green bath salts (I can&#x27;t remember exactly the name, sorry!) and I love that one. This one made the water feel oddly cold; the menthol would be the culprit. Not my favorite, as I want to feel warm and soothed in a bath. Will save to use for foot baths, however.</li>
    <li> Love it. Going to get some more soon.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and the wife loves them... With the foot spa</li>
    <li> These are gifts and my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> Love this bath scent. I had a travel sized mini pouch that I tried and loved it so much I had to buy a full size. Smells calming and clean. Love this soak! So relaxing! If you&#x27;re stressed I&#x27;d definitely give this a try.</li>
    <li> If there were a way for my husband to purchase stock in this item, he would. He gets a lot of lower back pain and works a high stress job--at the end of each day he&#x27;ll lay in a bath with this stuff in it for 10 minutes and it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s a new man. We will continue to buy this stuff until we can&#x27;t find it anymore. ABSOLUTELY amazing.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little light in my opinion if using 2 capfuls in a bath as suggested on the packaging, but not too bad.  You can&#x27;t really smell the orange, and you can definitely smell the menthol, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  Really nice for those days I just want to tear my hair out or cry in a corner.  Someone mentioned it leaves some colored stains in the tub, but mine seem to come off with a mild cleaning detergent and a sponge.</li>
    <li> have not tried this item yet, but it smells great, I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> I like ALL sault of this company, we keep buying it regualrly.</li>
    <li> I love this bath soak after a long day but I also find it helpful when I have tension in my back and neck.  I honestly love all of the Village Naturals products I have ever used.  This one with Camphor, Juniper, and other soothing elements is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started buying products from Village Nautrals I only bought one or two wondering if I would even like them or if they would help for what I wanted them for.  I was so surprised and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each, including this one, has a great smell...but it isn&#x27;t overpowering or too strong.  I love the fact that there are natural products that I recognize in each bottle I&#x27;ve bought.  And each one has helped with more than one thing.  Like this one for stress also helps to relax my muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one for aches and pains also helps me to breathe easier when I have congestion...etc.  They are all wonderful products.  If you are looking for a great brand, something that is natural &amp; helpful, and you like baths..these bath soaks are great.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times. Overall it was a nice relaxing bath. Very strong smell to it. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to rest her feet, well after her not using it for 3 weeks, I had to try it out after a long day.  It has a very strong menthol smell (more then i expected) but it actually feels and smells nice.  I really enjoyed how it worked.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product! It is a repeat buy every time it runs out.</li>
</ol>
