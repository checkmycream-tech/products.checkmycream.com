      <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for almost 25 years, and this Braun Series 3 - 360 is one of the best that has ever tackled my whiskers each morning.</li>

      <li>Great ball trimmer no nicke&amp;#34;s.</li>
      <li>Cons:  Great design, but</li>
      <li>Great shave.  </li>
      <li>The Braun is a much better razor and he loves it!!</li>
      <li>Very nice close shave...</li>
      <li>Amazing deilvery service!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having been very impressed with Braun quality for many years, I was amazed at what an inferior product the Series 3 razor turned out to be.</li>
      <li>Choose the 360 because it did everything I needed at a good price and didn&#x27;t require a \\&quot;cleaning station\\</li>
      <li>The unit works beautifully, gives a great, comfortable, close shave</li>
      <li>The Braun works great, cleans easily and no problems.</li>
      <li>I liked the convenience of easy storage the pouch offered and wish this came with one.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll surely tear my skin or draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Braun Shavers, each time upgrading to a better version.</li>
      <li>The battery stays charged through many days of shaving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Trimmer is OK, I suppose...</li>
      <li>I read many review before deciding on this shaver.  </li>
      <li>I would do better scraping my face with a credit card.  </li>
      <li>It shaves OK</li>
      <li>If they ever make one like this that works I would love to have one.  </li>
      <li>I like to blow it out with compressed air too, just to get more water</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews noting an issue with the top popping off.</li>
      <li>and it shaves better.  </li>
      <li>The double-foil shavers (Braun, Remington, and Panasonic) tend to be under-powered and don&#x27;t offer any better shave.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for years and was glad to get a new one at a great price.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and in great brand new condition.</li>
      <li>The one redeeming feature is it easy on the skin</li>
      <li>one thing I had difficulty with was getting the protective cover off without inadvertently removing the cutter head, but I realized I was causing it, and figured out a better technique where I don&#x27;t disturb the cutter head, and now I can remove it quite easily.</li>
      <li>After the best shaving effort with this, my skin is still rough with leftover hair.  </li>
      <li>far this shaver is great for me.</li>
      <li>This razor shaves my face fine.</li>
      <li>It stays on just fine.</li>
      <li>This is fine and very comfortable and does render a close shave right up until the screens pop off.  </li>
      <li>but you have to work the shaver to get smooth results.    </li>
      <li>It works great, shaves well, holds a charge and it is not much bigger than the unit I replaced.</li>
      <li>I thought this Braun shaver would fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I had to buy another shaver, a Remington rotary which is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shaving with this Braun is extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>One of the unique charging features of this Braun is the \\&quot;5-minute charge.\\</li>
      <li>Works great for the price, blades are very sharp, very light and charges quickly.  </li>
      <li>This portion of the razor is removable by design, of course, so you can clean the blades.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather have a clean shave than a fancy shaver - even if the battery doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; foil does NOT shave cleanly.  </li>
      <li>I get a quick, clean, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>This Braun is rated better than the Remington but costs about twice as much and was supposedly a lot quieter, which indeed it is.</li>
      <li>So the cutter quickly clogs up and then all you have is a vibrating bar beneath the foil.  </li>
      <li>Aside from that major design flaw, I really liked the razor.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the discounted price I paid for it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I currently own a Braun Series 1 meant to be a back up</li>
      <li>the worst .The shaving head mechanism is awesome and gives a great shave ..............  </li>
      <li>This Braun is very gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had always associated with Braun, but at a significantly higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s first test drive.  </li>
      <li>This is the most poorly-designed electric shaver I have ever used (40yrs of shaving), I&#x27;m going back to Remington.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I thought the design of this Braun shaver would do the same thing, perhaps even better.  </li>
      <li>My first Braun (54XX)</li>
      <li>Easy to clean though, As far as the shaver head pooping off there&#x27;s a simple fix for that...</li>
      <li>My favorite feature of the Remington is its trimmer setting that lines up with the screens to cut the long hairs the screens can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>though this is a single blade shaver (high-end Braun shavers have 2 blade heads), I continue to experience close, even shaves after more than 9 months.</li>
      <li>Or any shave at all, really.  </li>
      <li>A feature I really appreciate.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this if you intend to really shave, it&#x27;s junk.  </li>
      <li>I get a very close shave with this one, so that I haven&#x27;t used a blade since I started using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had brauns for years and this design is much easier to clean { the way it&#x27;s constructed} than prior models</li>
      <li>Bearing down on the razor invariably causes the top to pop off the razor.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy shave only good for few hours, not at all close.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it will after it gets older?</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
      <li>Generally, I have found the single foil shavers to do a better job because they tend to have more surface area but are usually cheaper.  </li>
      <li>If you do happen to wake up and your shaver is completely discharged, a quick 5-minute charge will give the shaver enough power for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just plugged in my New Braun Series 3-360 shaver and gave it</li>
      <li>The new cutter design with two vibrating parts with \\&quot;contouring\\</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave no matter how hard I tried, and no matter how many passes I made over my face.  </li>
      <li>Other shavers have the trimmer blades vertical which is just a matter of popping up - this may be more of personal preference.  </li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a new model rather than invest in re-building the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t clean it, you can&#x27;t bear down with it.  </li>
      <li>I have been useing Braun for over 40 years and this is by far</li>
      <li>The lock mechanism is quite cheap and does not hold firm.</li>
      <li>That works just like my old Remington.  </li>
      <li>thing to note here is that my old Braun is made in Germany while the newer flimsy plastic design is made in China.  </li>
      <li>I had to take another pass with the older Braun 5735, which left my skin silky</li>
      <li>But for now it works fine, no matter how hard I push.</li>
      <li>If you shave wet, then you clean it wet, under running water with the shaver running on battery, not plugged in.</li>
      <li>Cutters cannot be separated from the foil without destroying the head, the only way to clean it is to shake it out</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit initially charges quickly, and interim charges take less than an hour, unless the unit is fully discharged.</li>
      <li>It efficiently cuts my wishers with no drag.  </li>
      <li>I have an older model of the same razor and was hoping that some improvements haad been made but apparently not .</li>
      <li>Then remove the head and shake it out, and leave it off to dry completely before putting it back on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only real problem is a less than close shave.</li>

    <li> Braun Series 3-360 solo Men&#x27;s Shaving System    Pros:  Short and long hair screen design  Battery charge indicator  No need for a \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot;  Money Back Guarantee    Cons:  Great design, but Catch-22 implementation    I&#x27;ve been using a Remington MS3 shaver for some time, but it&#x27;s in need of replacement.  I thought this Braun shaver would fit the bill.  My favorite feature of the Remington is its trimmer setting that lines up with the screens to cut the long hairs the screens can&#x27;t.  I thought the design of this Braun shaver would do the same thing, perhaps even better.  While my Remington has three screened cutting sections, this Braun has two - with a third, center section designed to cut the long hairs.  It&#x27;s a great idea and a brilliant design, but it has a problem.      The Braun screens are on a spring cushion - I suppose for comfort - and the manual says to get a close shave you have to press down firmly.  This is fine and very comfortable and does render a close shave right up until the screens pop off.  Bearing down on the razor invariably causes the top to pop off the razor.  This portion of the razor is removable by design, of course, so you can clean the blades.  That works just like my old Remington.  There is even a \\&quot;locking\\&quot; trigger on the front of the screen cap that is meant to lock the cap firmly in place.  When I slide the locking mechanism, I can see the cap \\&quot;hunker down\\&quot;* onto the razor to imply that it&#x27;s firmly attached.  But, alas, no.  It pops off anyway.  If I pass the razor lightly enough across my face to keep it from popping off, I can&#x27;t get a close shave.  Or any shave at all, really.  Pressing down is required to compress the springs and allow the blades to reach the screens and actually cut something.    Aside from that major design flaw, I really liked the razor.  If they ever make one like this that works I would love to have one.  Maybe I got a lemon and another sample would have been functional.  But as it is, I returned therazor and just received my refund check from the manufacturer.    *Sorry about the regional vernacular.  I don&#x27;t know how to translate \\&quot;hunker down\\&quot; from Southern to English.  If you didn&#x27;t understand what I meant, please ask a Southern friend for a translation as a visual representation that can only be demonstrated in person may be necessary.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for almost 25 years, and this Braun Series 3 - 360 is one of the best that has ever tackled my whiskers each morning. I bought 1 of these shavers at Target for almost $90.  Then I bought this one on Amazon for half the price so I would have a spare when the one I currently use dies from extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit initially charges quickly, and interim charges take less than an hour, unless the unit is fully discharged. One of the unique charging features of this Braun is the \\&quot;5-minute charge.\\&quot;  If you do happen to wake up and your shaver is completely discharged, a quick 5-minute charge will give the shaver enough power for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a single blade shaver (high-end Braun shavers have 2 blade heads), I continue to experience close, even shaves after more than 9 months. Braun recommends that you replace the blade and foil after 18 months. There is a built-in notification system in the shavers Power-on and Power-level lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this Braun is extremely comfortable. The foils glides over my skin with no irritation.  It efficiently cuts my wishers with no drag.  It never feels like it is actually pulling my whiskers out of my skin. I have had some electric shavers that gave me razor like nicks that actually bleed. This Braun is very gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading the other reviews, it is frequently mentioned that some are having problems with the head assembly popping off; I have had this happen on occasion, but it happened when I was really pressing the razor foils hard against my skin and moving it around.  I&#x27;ve found that I can prevent that my only applying moderate pressure against my skin.  It still shaves my face just as well and the razor head does not pop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last item, Braun&#x27;s Instructions inform you that running the razor and the blade under water is a convenient method for cleaning your whiskers from the shaver. I have found that this process leaves water in the razor assembly even after it has sat overnight, and it interferes with shaving because of the dampness in the blade. If you want a great method for cleaning out the whiskers, I&#x27;ve got a can of compressed air that I use for this purpose. Works great!leaves water in the razor assembly even after it has sat overnight, and it interferes with shaving because of the dampness in the blade. If you want a great method for cleaning out the whiskers, I&#x27;ve got a can of compressed air that I use for this purpose. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great shave.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric in years, but was forced to due to health issues.  The Braun works great, cleans easily and no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years - I bought this one without researching it. Um...when you press against your face to get a close shave, THE HEAD POPS OFF. Noise level and build quality mean nothing when you can&#x27;t use the stupid thing. I&#x27;ve been shaving with electrics for 30 years, I know it&#x27;s not me - don&#x27;t waste $100+ on this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I have been useing Braun for over 40 years and this is by far the worst .The shaving head mechanism is awesome and gives a great shave ..............  if only one could keep the head attached to the body !!!!!!!!!!  I have an older model of the same razor and was hoping that some improvements haad been made but apparently not . The newer model was even worse . I sent the junk back for a refund . Braun used to make a great product .  Now it is terrible .</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t clean it, you can&#x27;t bear down with it.  Trimmer is OK, I suppose... but beyond that, this is the worst Braun product ever made.  Do not buy this if you intend to really shave, it&#x27;s junk.  Cutters cannot be separated from the foil without destroying the head, the only way to clean it is to shake it out and if you shave wet like I do, nothing comes out.  So the cutter quickly clogs up and then all you have is a vibrating bar beneath the foil.  This is the most poorly-designed electric shaver I have ever used (40yrs of shaving), I&#x27;m going back to Remington.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Braun Shavers, each time upgrading to a better version. Even the $10 AA battery version was very good at shaving my face! This one is no exception. I get a quick, clean, comfortable shave. I like the head movement for doing under my nose. The sideburn trimmer works well. I get a very close shave with this one, so that I haven&#x27;t used a blade since I started using it. Well worth the discounted price I paid for it here on Amazon. The battery stays charged through many days of shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price, blades are very sharp, very light and charges quickly.  I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband and he is likely to only use it occasionally - prefers the Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this as the Remington that was also reviewed by Consumer Reports kept wearing out every six months. I believe that was happening ever since they \\&quot;shipped\\&quot; their manufacturing all to China, but that&#x27;s another story. This Braun is rated better than the Remington but costs about twice as much and was supposedly a lot quieter, which indeed it is. The problem is a total lack of horsepower! It shaves OK but it takes twice as long as the Remington. I do not yet know how long it will last, nor how long the shaving head will last. I am not very thrilled with EITHER of these two shavers.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Braun fan but I have to say this shaver is unimpressive. It is under powered if you have a thick beard.  The trimmer blade is perpendicular to shaver and on the back side.  You must turn the shaver around to use it. Other shavers have the trimmer blades vertical which is just a matter of popping up - this may be more of personal preference.  I currently own a Braun Series 1 meant to be a back up and it shaves better.  Generally, I have found the single foil shavers to do a better job because they tend to have more surface area but are usually cheaper.  The double-foil shavers (Braun, Remington, and Panasonic) tend to be under-powered and don&#x27;t offer any better shave.  I have resorted to buying cheaper shavers because they only last me roughly 2 years whether I buy an expensive one or not.      The one redeeming feature is it easy on the skin but you have to work the shaver to get smooth results.    I got this shaver from credit-card points so no great loss and will give it to my son to just started shaving.    My first Braun (54XX) I owned 20 years ago was just a plug-in, single-foil and lasted me over 10 years.  Since then, Brauns have gotten cheaper and less reliable as have other brands.</li>
    <li> Great ball trimmer no nicke&amp;#34;s.</li>
    <li> I read many review before deciding on this shaver.  I could not have been more disappointed with my purchase.  After one month of use the head of the shaver kept falling off.  Sometimes griping facial hair as it separated from the handle.  The lock mechanism is quite cheap and does not hold firm.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in great brand new condition. I sent the shaver to my soldier and he calims it to be perfect. He loves everything about it.</li>
    <li> Having been a Braun shaver user for the last 10+ years, I wanted to replace Braun 5735 purchased in 2008 that was starting to lose battery charge.  I picked the Series 3 since that was what was recommended by Amazon as the \\&quot;new\\&quot; upgrade product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the worst recommendation by Amazon.  The new cutter design with two vibrating parts with \\&quot;contouring\\&quot; foil does NOT shave cleanly.  It&#x27;ll give you the 5pm shadow shave if that&#x27;s what you want.  After the best shaving effort with this, my skin is still rough with leftover hair.  I had to take another pass with the older Braun 5735, which left my skin silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ended up returning the Series 3 and ordering a replacement foil/cutter combo for my aging 5735.  I&#x27;d rather have a clean shave than a fancy shaver - even if the battery doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note here is that my old Braun is made in Germany while the newer flimsy plastic design is made in China.  Nothing wrong with outsourcing, but Braun needs to revisit their design or manufacturing standards.  Otherwise, my next replacement will NOT be a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit to replace a Braun 3612. Choose the 360 because it did everything I needed at a good price and didn&#x27;t require a \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot; sucking up counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews noting an issue with the top popping off. But I needn&#x27;t have been. The unit works beautifully, gives a great, comfortable, close shave and I have had absolutely no problem with the shaving head whatsoever. It stays on just fine. I can only assume the folks having a problem may not be seating it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What no one seems to have mentioned is just how wonderfully quiet this unit is. A feature I really appreciate. It works great, shaves well, holds a charge and it is not much bigger than the unit I replaced. I&#x27;m really pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that I wish they included a zippered carry pouch as did my old 3612. I liked the convenience of easy storage the pouch offered and wish this came with one.</li>
    <li> Worthless shaver.  Its like shaving with no blade at all.  I would do better scraping my face with a credit card.  The steel mesh is so small, facial hair cannot get in to be cut. I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it.  I had to buy another shaver, a Remington rotary which is fantastic.  Its probably too late to return it so I will wind up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had brauns for years and this design is much easier to clean { the way it&#x27;s constructed} than prior models</li>
    <li> its slow when compared to 7 series, you can feel the speed difference when its plugged and unplugged&lt;br /&gt;economic option</li>
    <li> This razor shaves my face fine. I read all these negative reviews after buying it over the net, so when it came in I was critical of certain things and scrutinized it closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try as I might, I can not make the shaver head pop off. I don&#x27;t know how people do this, but mine just doesn&#x27;t. Maybe it will after it gets older? But for now it works fine, no matter how hard I push. Any harder and I&#x27;ll surely tear my skin or draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And anybody having difficulty with cleaning it should read the directions. If you shave wet, then you clean it wet, under running water with the shaver running on battery, not plugged in. Then remove the head and shake it out, and leave it off to dry completely before putting it back on. I like to blow it out with compressed air too, just to get more water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this shaver is great for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t need any other stuff on my counter or in my luggage when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I had difficulty with was getting the protective cover off without inadvertently removing the cutter head, but I realized I was causing it, and figured out a better technique where I don&#x27;t disturb the cutter head, and now I can remove it quite easily.</li>
    <li> Just plugged in my New Braun Series 3-360 shaver and gave it it&#x27;s first test drive.  Very nice close shave... Amazing deilvery service!  I ordered it on 7/11/12 and despite choosing standard delivery and I received it via USPS (regular) mail today!!! Unreal delivery time...  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave close at all...Easy to clean though, As far as the shaver head pooping off there&#x27;s a simple fix for that...remove head and turn it around 180 degress and that will fix it....the reason the head pops off is because its put on reversed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real problem is a less than close shave.</li>
    <li> Do not buy shave only good for few hours, not at all close.  Even if you bear down will not shave close, I guess I will have go back Noralco.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and was glad to get a new one at a great price. Gives a close shave and reaches hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor.  He had a Panasonic and it kept nicking his skin.  The Braun is a much better razor and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace a very old Braun 5635 that was starting to fail.  Thought I&#x27;d \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a new model rather than invest in re-building the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been very impressed with Braun quality for many years, I was amazed at what an inferior product the Series 3 razor turned out to be. I couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave no matter how hard I tried, and no matter how many passes I made over my face.  Virtually worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the Series 7 Braun...which provides the quality and performance I had always associated with Braun, but at a significantly higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried other makes of razor to see if there are acceptable alternatives at the Series 3 price point.  But I would caution anyone to avoid the Series 3.</li>
