      <li>It smells great and is very relaxing while also making my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, the lotion felt kind of cooling and settled into the skin quickly though, it does feel pretty nice.</li>
      <li>It has a refreshing effect and dries quickly, leaving skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling silky and smooth .</li>

      <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it&#x27;s non greasy.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overly scented and it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>It smoothes on very easily, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face.</li>
      <li>Rich and creamy but not oily.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands and finally found a face cream I love!</li>
      <li>Perfect level of thickness-not too light or thick.  </li>
      <li>But I love the Diva Scar cream I have had good results with it and will continue trying the other products.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try since I love Alba hawaiian Hibiscus toner so much and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>This cream is perfect thick but not heavy smells great and leaves you feeling silky soft</li>
      <li>but I love it so far!</li>
      <li>It is brighter, tighter, and clear!!!!!</li>
      <li>particularly right where my eyebrows meet</li>
      <li>Highly recommended! !</li>
      <li>There is no oily residue, it feels so light, and my skin is so soft.  </li>
      <li>They seem to make my skin really soft and it does smooth everything out</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this enough :-)</li>
      <li>Thanks, hormones!</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it&#x27;s very delicately scented, with a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really wanted it for allover my face, because I have such lovely acne based hyperpigmentation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for awhile now and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive changes in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s only good for dry skin...</li>
      <li>I appreciate that it leaves you with a matte finish but a little glow would be nice too.  </li>
      <li>am the occasional acne sufferer, so it&#x27;s important for me to buy face creams which moisturize but do not clog pores.  </li>
      <li>It is light enough to use under makeup.</li>
      <li>I was really freaking out over my forehead lines,</li>
      <li>My skin is absolutely glowing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with prolonged use, I will start to see results for acne and firm skin, but as of now, my skin is super soft!</li>
      <li>but if you are sensitive to scents maybe try a sample first?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed some fine and deep lines across my forehead as well as hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck.</li>
      <li>My main concern was layering make up over it.</li>
      <li>, so I thought it would be too heavy when I first got it, but WOW it sinks right in your skin and just feels amazing.  </li>
      <li>The scent is subtle and nice.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it helped clear my breakouts</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s, premenopausal (yay), with oily skin.</li>
      <li>I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>The hibiscus lift literally makes my skin feel as soft as baby skin and so does the pineapple cellulite cream.</li>
      <li>This morning, I decided why not try this moisturizer since I&#x27;ve been struggling with my other one, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Recently just purchased my first Diva Stuff item last week, their Eyelash Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have seen no changes to my fine or deep lines on my forehead but since my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore they&#x27;re not nearly as noticeable.</li>
      <li>new daily skin regime:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich but not too thick</li>
      <li>SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the little bit of acne I had is drying out fast.</li>
      <li>Usually when I switch products my skin will have a little break out party until it gets used to the new product, but to my amazement I have not broken out with this!!</li>

    <li> Non-greasy and smells nice. I love this moisturiser! It smoothes on very easily, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face. I&#x27;m sure with prolonged use, I will start to see results for acne and firm skin, but as of now, my skin is super soft! I will definitely be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I HAD to on this product! LOVE it! I am in my early 40&#x27;s, premenopausal (yay), with oily skin. I have had acne since I was 9 and am now starting to get lines (ok wrinkles) but not to bad because of my oily skin. I started using this nightly and when I woke up after a few uses, I literally did a double take!  My skin is smoother, waaay less oily and acne is improving. Additionally my make-up absorbs better, sets and looks flawless! I&#x27;ve tried MANY expensive products and never got these results. I cannot recommend this enough :-)</li>
    <li> I love you Diva stuff, great service, really nice email previously from Kym the owner answering questions, she is awesome, but this product&#x27;s scent was so strong my eyes burned. However, the lotion felt kind of cooling and settled into the skin quickly though, it does feel pretty nice. I try to use it a little on my neck and high on my forehead. I really wanted it for allover my face, because I have such lovely acne based hyperpigmentation. But I love the Diva Scar cream I have had good results with it and will continue trying the other products. I&#x27;m sure this product will work well for others but if you are sensitive to scents maybe try a sample first?</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the anti-aging care sample package, which caused me to go purchase the full-size bottle. The texture is very nice, doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, and moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer! It isn&#x27;t overly scented and it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. It is light enough to use under makeup. I have combination skin and this is a great product to bring balance.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased several Diva Stuff products and have yet to get something I did not like. The customer service is beyond excellent and they are happy to help whether it is a question you need answered or a defective airless pump bottle that needs replaced, these gals are on top of it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this face cream from the brand&#x27;s site, but need to comment about the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it&#x27;s very delicately scented, with a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;I am the occasional acne sufferer, so it&#x27;s important for me to buy face creams which moisturize but do not clog pores.  I use this one before bed, after showering, when my skin  just soaks up this moisture.  Perfect level of thickness-not too light or thick.  A little goes a long way.  This one is a keeper-especially for the acne-conscious gal.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile now and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive changes in my skin.  One of the reasons why I purchased it is because it&#x27;s listed above (and on their website) as having argan oil, but when you receive it--argan isn&#x27;t on the ingredient list.  I&#x27;m really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels sooooooooooooo good on my skin!  Its thicker than some other moisturiziers I&#x27;ve used (not super thick, but a little thicker than foundation for example), so I thought it would be too heavy when I first got it, but WOW it sinks right in your skin and just feels amazing.  There is no oily residue, it feels so light, and my skin is so soft.  Loving the no makeup look I can pull off with this!  :)</li>
    <li> Incredible stuff. I decided to give this a try since I love Alba hawaiian Hibiscus toner so much and have been using it for years. Something about the Hibiscus does wonders to my skin. When I found this cream, I knew I had to try it out... It&#x27;s light weight and smooth. It just feels really good on. I purchased their toner in Hibiscus as well and now I think I found my replacement for my other products... Don&#x27;t stop making these products.  They seem to make my skin really soft and it does smooth everything out and I&#x27;m finding it firming too. My make up looks really good over this. The scent is nice as well...</li>
    <li> I recieved the hibiscus lift as a free sample with the purchase of a cellulite cream and absolutely loved both products. The hibiscus lift literally makes my skin feel as soft as baby skin and so does the pineapple cellulite cream. Ive been using the cellulite cream as directed along with exercise and it is definitely infact working. My legs and rear look tighter and smoother already and its only about a week. Im very happy with these products and the service. I will definitely continue to buy these products. Highly recommended! !</li>
    <li> I love the smell, the consistency and the results I&#x27;m getting from this lotion. It makes my skin feel really soft and not greasy at all. The hydration is making my skin look better and more even. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the little bit of acne I had is drying out fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for about a week and I must say that my skin feel so good and looks brighter. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed some fine and deep lines across my forehead as well as hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck. YAY! I&#x27;ve never had severe acne but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it. I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING! I love the smell, the texture, how well it absorbs into my face without feeling oily or greasy, and it provides a nice glow instead of a shine. I&#x27;m using the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Sea Salt Face Wash&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Agave Nector Sea Salt Acne Solution&amp;#34; to treat my acne so I can&#x27;t testify as to whether or not this moisturizer is treating or preventing my acne on it&#x27;s own. But I can say that it hasn&#x27;t caused my acne to get any worse. I use this moisturizer day and night and it has stopped my skin from drying out. My makeup looks great on top of it. It lasts all day and I wake up feeling refreshed. I have seen no changes to my fine or deep lines on my forehead but since my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore they&#x27;re not nearly as noticeable.</li>
    <li> It smelled delicious...but as it claims I noticed no difference from any other lotion. BUT seeing as its all natural and home-made its great!</li>
    <li> sure makes me feel better :)</li>
    <li> I love mine and I can almost promise you that you would fall in love too. This cream is perfect thick but not heavy smells great and leaves you feeling silky soft</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the feel and smell of this cream . It leaves my face feeling silky and smooth . I have tried so many brands and finally found a face cream I love!</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s only good for dry skin... It is not good for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it is irritative. My skin goes a little bit red after applying it, so now I am afraid that I need to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is waste of money and I feel so sad.&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay another $20 to buy the lotion that I bought before. My wallet is feeling so sad.</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick and moisturizing but not greasy at all.  I don&#x27;t think it helped clear my breakouts but it didn&#x27;t cause any either.  The scent is subtle and nice.  I wish it would help with overall clarity and glow but that was missing.  I appreciate that it leaves you with a matte finish but a little glow would be nice too.  My makeup goes on nicely.  I like it but maybe not enough to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> The best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so rich but not too thick &amp; my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a teenager. It is brighter, tighter, and clear!!!!! Addicted for life.</li>
    <li> Smells edible. Rich and creamy but not oily. Absorbs into the skin immediately. Remarkable customer care!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and just had a baby so I&#x27;m in that lovely phase of life where wrinkles AND breakouts are a concern. Thanks, hormones! This stuff has been a lifesaver. It&#x27;s thick and luxurious but it sinks right in to your skin without any sort of residue or greasiness. It smells heavenly and it&#x27;s been incredibly effective and keeping both my wrinkles and my acne in check. I am obsessed with all of the Diva Stuff products, but this one is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> Recently just purchased my first Diva Stuff item last week, their Eyelash Conditioner. In addition to face and well packaged shipping, I was sent two samples. This was one of the samples. This morning, I decided why not try this moisturizer since I&#x27;ve been struggling with my other one, it&#x27;s worth a shot. I have very dry skin that doesn&#x27;t soak in alot of moisturizers well, so my skin ends up feeling greasy but still dry. At first I was skeptical. I&#x27;m only 19 so I don&#x27;t picture myself needing lifting and age prevention and firming. But after using it this morning, and looking in the mirror later just a few minutes ago, I am sickly obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is creamy, but not too thick or greasy. It has a refreshing effect and dries quickly, leaving skin feeling smooth. My skin is absolutely glowing. My main concern was layering make up over it. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of face make up, just a little concealer, powder and blush, but sometimes my skin doesn&#x27;t react well when I put moisturizer and make up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my skin looks flawless. My make up went on so perfectly on it! My skin is practically glistening through my make up. I&#x27;m obsessed. I just ordered two bottles of this dynamite!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days but I love it so far! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it&#x27;s non greasy. Usually when I switch products my skin will have a little break out party until it gets used to the new product, but to my amazement I have not broken out with this!! And the scent is light and pleasant, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers. It smells great and is very relaxing while also making my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new daily skin regime: Put on the Diva Stuff hibiscus lift moisturizer, then add a drop or two  of Diva stuff Venus&#x27; Venom, then add some Diva stuff red cherry aging skin serum. At night time, I do the same thing except I add Diva Stuff Nyx night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t explain the difference this has made to my skin! I was really freaking out over my forehead lines, particularly right where my eyebrows meet (my brow furrows or &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;s) and I felt as if the skin on my forehead was really dry. After using these products, my skin looks and feels refreshed and younger and I hardly notice the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;s after using this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product i will forever be a faithful customer!!!!!!!</li>
