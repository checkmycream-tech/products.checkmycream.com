### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>This stand is perfect.</li>
      <li>It worked perfect, Now that I can kinda used both arms</li>
      <li>The grip around the nozzle isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>LOVE it!!  </li>
      <li>My daughter loved mine</li>
      <li>and I wanted to do my own at home grooming.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to put together and very easy to put away when not In use.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>This thing has fallen on my foot so many times!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, I love mine.  </li>
      <li>Love this product as it helps in the process of blow drying ones hair.</li>
      <li>I just had elbow surgery, I wasnt able to use my arm at all</li>
      <li>I love this thing</li>
      <li>Kind of cheap.</li>
      <li>Best $15 I ever spent.</li>
      <li>Bought this and love it.hands free and easily attaches to my hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>This one goes up about 3 feet or so, and packs easily in a suit cast if you have to take it with you.</li>
      <li>Assembly really IS easy, but:&lt;br /&gt;Read.  </li>
      <li>My husband found screws to fit from his work bench...</li>
      <li>This holder could be great, but it has several flaws to it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>But with my hand in a cast it was a true god send</li>
      <li>Directs the hot air just where I want it, leaves both hands free to fluff-dry and style my hair, and allows me leave my blowdryer out on the Master Bath countertop without cords and clutter.  </li>
      <li>The blow dryer sits pretty securely in the clip with the double-sided Velcro tape wrapped around the handle.</li>
      <li>Works &#x27;bout as good as a wet noodle.  </li>
      <li>This stand cuts back on so much styling time and makes styling more enjoyable and efficient.</li>
      <li>It does take some getting used to to get the right angle, but once you do, styling is a piece of cake.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you might have some issues with maintaining the right angle with the bending arm.</li>
      <li>After the first grooming I knew I had to find something to keep up the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I would have eliminated so much styling frustration!</li>
      <li>My first try, everything LOOKED correct except that I couldn&#x27;t raise the height up.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have bought this earlier, I love it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to put it on a hard surface and not carpet so it will stand up better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for the money, and looks like it&#x27;s the same item that sells on Amazon and other sites for twice the money.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very stable with a normal hairdryer strapped to it.</li>
      <li>Even when I am able to get the blowdyer to not tip over this part still manages to bend down and doesn&#x27;t hold my blowdryer in place where I need it.</li>
      <li>The stand cannot really hold the dryer at all because it is too soft at the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My Helix by Hot Tools blow dryer is pretty lightweight though, so if you have a dryer that&#x27;s on the heavier side or has a long nozzle, or if you use attachments...</li>
      <li>I think it is a pretty standard size.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I recently got two new poodle puppies</li>
      <li>DO make sure you clamp the flexible neck of the stand onto the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; of the blowdryer, so to speak, so that the weight of the dryer and its cord hang BEHIND the stand, AWAY from you, and not in front.  </li>
      <li>That said, I&#x27;m keeping it because it&#x27;s better than nothing when you have a broken wrist.</li>
      <li>The bendy adjustable part (the black part seen on the picture) doesn&#x27;t hold up much weight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> LOVE it!!  Directs the hot air just where I want it, leaves both hands free to fluff-dry and style my hair, and allows me leave my blowdryer out on the Master Bath countertop without cords and clutter.  The base is sturdy, and once I put it together correctly, I had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key words:  ...\\&quot;once I put it together correctly.\\&quot;  Assembly really IS easy, but:&lt;br /&gt;Read.  The.  Instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t, and made 2 simple mistakes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Two \\&quot;poles\\&quot; or rods form the stand, one of which slides into the other to adjust the height of the stand.  My first try, everything LOOKED correct except that I couldn&#x27;t raise the height up.  No matter how much I twisted, as soon as I&#x27;d let go, KLUNK!  Frustrated, I started over from scratch, dug out the instructions (duh!) and discovered I had inserted the second pole upside-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  DO make sure you clamp the flexible neck of the stand onto the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; of the blowdryer, so to speak, so that the weight of the dryer and its cord hang BEHIND the stand, AWAY from you, and not in front.  I finally studied the photo on the box, adjusted accordingly, and the neck now holds my heaviest blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above MIGHT explain a few negatives this product has received.  Just sayin&#x27;s, all.  Bottom line, I love mine.  Best $15 I ever spent.</li>
    <li> I just had elbow surgery, I wasnt able to use my arm at all so I purchased the hair dryer stand. It worked perfect, Now that I can kinda used both arms its alot eaiser to dry my hair without any pain.</li>
    <li> Poor quality won&#x27;t hold weight of dryer and very hard to adjust too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I recently got two new poodle puppies and I wanted to do my own at home grooming. After the first grooming I knew I had to find something to keep up the hair dryer. This stand is perfect. Because the dogs move alot I do wish that when I tilted the dryer that It would stay in place batter, but I make it work.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of crap! I have a Conair 1875 blowdryer (weight 1.2lbs) that I assumed would be small and lightweight enough to work with this holder- nope. This holder could be great, but it has several flaws to it:&lt;br /&gt;1. The base is not very heavy, so if you have a heavy blowdryer it causes the whole unit to tip over. This thing has fallen on my foot so many times!&lt;br /&gt;2. The grip around the nozzle isn&#x27;t very good. When I turn my blowdryer on it, the pressure causes the blowdryer to start slipping out of the grip.&lt;br /&gt; 3. The bendy adjustable part (the black part seen on the picture) doesn&#x27;t hold up much weight. Even when I am able to get the blowdyer to not tip over this part still manages to bend down and doesn&#x27;t hold my blowdryer in place where I need it.</li>
    <li> Disappointing! Product arrived without the screws (2), is extremely cheap quality and difficult to assemble!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed that it arrived not functioning properly in that it will not extend up as it is supposed to. That said, I&#x27;m keeping it because it&#x27;s better than nothing when you have a broken wrist.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with screws. Kind of cheap. Does the job though. 3 stars it is.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and I wish I had bought one sooner...I would have eliminated so much styling frustration! I recently got my hair cut into an A line bob and getting the hang of styling it has been a feat. Juggling a blow dryer and different sized round brushes while trying to style the shortest lengths of my hair has been a misery. This stand cuts back on so much styling time and makes styling more enjoyable and efficient. It does take some getting used to to get the right angle, but once you do, styling is a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is weighted and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it falling over (and I have the bars full extended so my blow dryer points downward to eliminate frizz). The blow dryer sits pretty securely in the clip with the double-sided Velcro tape wrapped around the handle. My Helix by Hot Tools blow dryer is pretty lightweight though, so if you have a dryer that&#x27;s on the heavier side or has a long nozzle, or if you use attachments...you might have some issues with maintaining the right angle with the bending arm.</li>
    <li> Must reinforce with duct tape towards bottom  for my dryer. But with my hand in a cast it was a true god send</li>
    <li> The stand cannot really hold the dryer at all because it is too soft at the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; joint.  It cannot hold the weight of my dryer.  My dryer is Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer.  I think it is a pretty standard size.  Also, the hook and loop for the handle of the dryer is too unsteady to hold it.  Combining the two, it&#x27;s a useless product to me.</li>
    <li> Bought this and love it.hands free and easily attaches to my hair dryer.  My daughter loved mine so I ordered one;for her</li>
    <li> Love this product as it helps in the process of blow drying ones hair.</li>
    <li> I wrote a glowing review on my hair dryer stand.&lt;br /&gt;But oops this one wasn&#x27;t the one I meant.&lt;br /&gt;I returned this one and purchased a different one that had a flexible post to adjust positions.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to the readers that ordered this because of my review.</li>
    <li> Works &#x27;bout as good as a wet noodle.  What&#x27;s wrong with making it &amp;#34;stiffer&amp;#34; so that it would hold the pose?  Like that other thing I ordered that I couldn&#x27;t even bend......called the third hand?</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and was looking to purchase one of these for some time now.  I am glad I did. I can now easily dry and curl my hair with my brush without having to worry about holding the dryer.  It was very easy to put together and very easy to put away when not In use.</li>
    <li> I like this stand...it is sturdy and holds my hair dryer in place. Make sure to put it on a hard surface and not carpet so it will stand up better. I&#x27;ve always wanted one and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this earlier, I love it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she injured her shoulder and it was difficult to dry her hair. This does the trick. It&#x27;s a great deal for the money, and looks like it&#x27;s the same item that sells on Amazon and other sites for twice the money. Some of the others we looked at only extend 18 inches which is useless if you don&#x27;t site in front of mirror. This one goes up about 3 feet or so, and packs easily in a suit cast if you have to take it with you. The base is nice and heavy so it&#x27;s very stable with a normal hairdryer strapped to it.</li>
    <li> This product was needed for ability to dry my hair while recovering from broken shoulder.  The unit requires 2 screws not included....this is probably reason buyers had it falling apart.  My husband found screws to fit from his work bench...works well but frustrating since directions don&#x27;t mention the screws or include them!</li>
