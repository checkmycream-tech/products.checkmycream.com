      <li>But quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>Very cute headband</li>
      <li>I love this headband!</li>
      <li>Would have liked it to have a more relaxed elastic band.</li>
      <li>It looks really beautiful and feels high quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it is a cute headband.</li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s NOT plastic which I love.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it</li>
      <li>Very attractive piece, just a bit too tight.  </li>
      <li>Looks great though, definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this headband.</li>
      <li>While this is very pretty...</li>
      <li>so I kind of put it back together, but it seems like it should come</li>
      <li>Cute if your using it once, but it could probs break after one use if your not careful.</li>
      <li>Looks really pretty when we got it, but broke at one of the leaves the first time my daughter took it off her head.  </li>
      <li>Pretty.  </li>
      <li>Head band snapped after the first use.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is worth it for the cheap price.</li>
      <li>This falls apart, but you can pretty easily put it back together.</li>
      <li>It does look beautiful in your hair, it just takes a little extra time to be cautious as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
      <li>Must be fragile with it since it broke once but was easily fixable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Kind of heavy and tight</li>
      <li>Wish it was sturdier, but wasn&#x27;t surprised considering the low price.</li>
      <li>The clasp that attaches the black elastic to the gold leaves broke the first time I put it on.</li>
      <li>A little tight on my head when worn across my forehead, but when worn as an actual headband, it feels fine!</li>

<li> A little tight on my head when worn across my forehead, but when worn as an actual headband, it feels fine!</li>
<li> Came in the mail much earlier than expected.</li>
<li> I tried to fix it twice by using a pliers to open the clasp, put the black elastic back in, and then close the clasp, but it continued to break, so I threw it out.</li>
<li> Cute but very uncomfortable &amp; does not stay in place.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the first time I tried to put it on, a few of the connector links came apart and I was left with three pieces of a headband.</li>
<li> Taking this out at the end of the day was not fun.</li>
<li> Once it&#x27;s in, your hair is intertwined with all the leaves and if you try to adjust it in any way, you are in for a knotty mess.</li>
<li> Too tight &amp; it broke the 1st time I tried putting in on.</li>
<li> Haha this piece of crap broke after the 3rd use.</li>
<li> Too small.</li>
<li> My second concern was that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to adjust in your hair.</li>
<li> and it was broken.</li>
<li> One of the connecting links was broken.</li>
<li> Very small!</li>
<li> A little annoying, but not the end of the world.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when I got this product</li>

    <li> Cute but very uncomfortable &amp; does not stay in place. The leaf design stabs your head -___-</li>
    <li> Haha this piece of crap broke after the 3rd use. Cute if your using it once, but it could probs break after one use if your not careful.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I got this product and it was broken. One of the connecting links was broken. I needed it for a gift the next day so I kind of put it back together, but it seems like it should come unbroken!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it is a cute headband.</li>
    <li> A little tight on my head when worn across my forehead, but when worn as an actual headband, it feels fine!</li>
    <li> The pieces of the headband kept detaching off, but given the price I am not complaining. Looks great though, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Looks really pretty when we got it, but broke at one of the leaves the first time my daughter took it off her head.  Wish it was sturdier, but wasn&#x27;t surprised considering the low price.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail much earlier than expected. Must be fragile with it since it broke once but was easily fixable.</li>
    <li> This item broke.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Too small. Too tight &amp; it broke the 1st time I tried putting in on.</li>
    <li> Very cute headband, my niece loved it!</li>
    <li> Pretty.  This falls apart, but you can pretty easily put it back together.</li>
    <li> I love this headband! Speedy shipping as well.</li>
    <li> open the package and it broke as soon as I tried to put it on</li>
    <li> Very attractive piece, just a bit too tight.  Would have liked it to have a more relaxed elastic band.</li>
    <li> I would not re-purchase this. The clasp that attaches the black elastic to the gold leaves broke the first time I put it on. I tried to fix it twice by using a pliers to open the clasp, put the black elastic back in, and then close the clasp, but it continued to break, so I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this headband. It looks really beautiful and feels high quality. Unfortunately, the first time I tried to put it on, a few of the connector links came apart and I was left with three pieces of a headband. A little annoying, but not the end of the world. With some needle-nose pliers I put it back together and strengthened all of the links. My second concern was that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to adjust in your hair. Once it&#x27;s in, your hair is intertwined with all the leaves and if you try to adjust it in any way, you are in for a knotty mess. Taking this out at the end of the day was not fun. Overall, it is worth it for the cheap price. It does look beautiful in your hair, it just takes a little extra time to be cautious as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be. Heavier material- it&#x27;s NOT plastic which I love. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> While this is very pretty...it broke within hours.  I should had bought a more expensive piece that would last longer than 2 hours.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Kind of heavy and tight</li>
    <li> Beautiful! But quality isn&#x27;t that great. Head band snapped after the first use.</li>
    <li> Very small! I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it</li>
