<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this pomade.  the scent is nice and kind of reminds me of a sweet pipe tobacco blend I&#x27;ve smoked, but a nice masculine fragrance.  Some of the more trendy brands I&#x27;ve tried from local stores have a funky rancid smell.  They&#x27;ve been sitting on the shelf so long the oils have turned rancid.  This stuff smells nice and works as well as any good quality pomade.  I will definitely buys this again.</li>
    <li> epic hair product and smells great</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. It&#x27;s got a greasy texture it. The shine was more than I expected, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply. It seems like it washes out just fine, but I swear I can still smell it when my hair dries and I haven&#x27;t reapplied it yet. But that&#x27;s not a complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair in place all day, even at work (I work in a warehouse). It&#x27;s easy to restyle will wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sticky, so if you run your hands through your hair, your hands will be sticky for a while.</li>
    <li> Very good pomade. I&#x27;ve used some of the cheaper products you find in Target or Walmart and some of the higher end your barber recommends and this is definitely near the top of the list. I got my tin for $18 which isn&#x27;t necessarily cheap, but I&#x27;ve gotten tremendous value out of it. I have really thick hair and this product maintains a good hold for me throughout the day. Water-based too, so it washes right out with water and doesn&#x27;t give you a funky pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality stuff..my wife loves the smell (coconut/caramel mix) and it lets me do my slickback with no waxy residue.&lt;br /&gt;(Murrays &amp; all PB pomades do this unfortunately)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it weren&#x27;t this pricey but...hey its great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You want a easily removed water based pomade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it.</li>
    <li> First hair type: Thick with lots of cow-licks&lt;br /&gt;Hair Style: Skin-Fade, maybe 2.5 inches on the top that I comb forward, then the front, comb up, then gently push the top of that hair down and back, leaving still 1.5-2 inches of height in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Uppercut Deluxe  first, and I am currently trying out Layrite SuperHold - here is a comparison of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Hold: STRONG! It stays in place, even with my hair, never looks greasy, and it just looks awesome all day.&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to Layrite SuperHold - I find that I have to finic with my hair a lot more with Layrite as I am stying, as well as throughout the day. With Uppercut, I put it in, and come it in, and it stays where I want it to into the night with no stray hairs to worry about. Therefore, I rank Upercut better in Hold.&lt;br /&gt;**Shine: Uppercut has a good amout of shine that is not overbearing, and it lasts all day.  The layrite superhold has more of a wax-like sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;**Smell: Uppercut smells like Coconut - but its light and not heavy.  Layrite smells like Vanilla&lt;br /&gt;**Looks: Uppercut gives you that fresh shine all day, Layrite superhold is more like wax, and if you have hair like mine...It can look a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;**Washing:  Both Uppercut and Layrite wash out very easily, and your hair feels great afterwards.  I had some cheap stuff from Lor-real for men once that left my hair feeling like crap for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with Layrite Superhold, but I have an interview this week, and I plan to dig from the end  and sides of my can of Uppercut for it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Layright: 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Uppercut: 5 stars</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product, and I have to say I&#x27;m not particularly pleased.  The product leaves the hair greasy, and doesn&#x27;t provide much in the way of holding my hair.  Unfortunately, for \\&quot;Uppercut, I won&#x27;t be buying this product, again.  I will say the can has a cool \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; look to it, but that&#x27;s where it ends.</li>
    <li> First off I want to say this is not a bad product at all. The reason I give this only two stars is because it does in-fact act more like a gel than a pomade. If you style your hair in the morning you had better be happy with what you got. If you have longer, or thicker hair and need to use a decent amount of product its gonna harden up. I ride a motorcycle and need to restyle constantly. I was hopeful this product would have more petroleum qualities like the DAX High&amp;Tight that I am returning to.&lt;br /&gt;  Aside from that, it holds well and actually has pretty decent shine with no odor. I rock a side pomp and if you wanna avoid having to use degreaser to wash your hair and can handle the brittle feel, you can build a decent poof and still go to sleep without destroying your pillow. I will continue to stock this in my medicine cabinet, but for now it&#x27;ll only be a standby for times when I&#x27;m about to get a cut and will need to wash my hair out before hand.</li>
    <li> Glorious. Keeps my hair in place even with the thickness of my hair. I will always use this product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great for slick and retro styles.  Smells great.  Washes out like a gel.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Keeps my hair in place all day long and washes out easily at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of hair style products for men and bought this on a lark. It smells the best and holds on like a monkey to a cupcake! Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff! I&#x27;m on my 5th can and I plan on sticking with this brand for a while. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the tin and the smell is awesome. the hold is good but could be better. i need more</li>
    <li> The first can I bought lasted about 6 months. It does the job without feeling heavy or greasy. If you&#x27;re looking for a clean cut look, this works well. If you&#x27;re trying to spike your Mohawk, this probably isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
    <li> A classy clean product with a super strong hold,  will def purchase again...</li>
    <li> Smells great, and goes in easily, but dries solid and is hard to fix/reset during the day.  Adding water to soften it back up drastically reduces the hold.  Works, but not as versatile as the Layrite pomade.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly for my hair style.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there hands down!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but now that I have it and used it more than a couple of times a am a fan! the shine is not high unless your adding extreme doses to the hair to achieve that Mcfly look. And a plus is that the pomade is water soluable and is easily removed in the shower. You also achieve a great hold that has lasted me all day. One last PLUS is that the scent is a light vanilla which is sweet but not over the top.</li>
    <li> Great scent and the hold is excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is gel its gets the hair hard not letting it do what it likes to do</li>
    <li> Tried this pomade for a comb over look. Not too much shine and works wonderfully. Good light hold. Works well with some hair spray to finish it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It kind of smells like cookies.</li>
    <li> Decently strong hold, some shine as to be expected but lower than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I have a bad cowlick in my hair, and most brands don&#x27;t hold it down; it always ends up sticking up. This holds it down perfectly, and with little shine. I&#x27;d recommend this easily to anybody who wants a good pomade, and order the Uppercut Deluxe comb while you&#x27;re at it, it&#x27;s as good of quality as the pomade is. With the same retro look the Uppercut Deluxe logo goes for.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but not great. It works, but it makes some of my hair stiff and some of it not, I prefer it to not be stiff. I out it on about ten minutes after my shower, when my hair is still damp but not soaking wet, then I style it, and it holds well, it just stiffens in some spots but doesn&#x27;t in others</li>
    <li> great work guys, keep up the good work</li>
    <li> It smells absolutely amazing.  It keeps my hair in place.  It washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pomades and gels and have to say I like this the best. Good hold and washes out easily. It does not make my hair look stiff and smells great. You get a lot for your money as compared to other products.</li>
    <li> Easily holds hair in place all day and washes out effortlessly because it&#x27;s water-soluble. Restyling just requires a wet comb. Vanilla coconut scent is okay, not overpowering but not the most masculine of scents -- reminds me of putting on suntan lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, great hold and semi-wet look. Dries fast. Washes off with water. Doesn&#x27;t leave hands fealing sticky. I&#x27;ve worked with beauty supplies before and have tried a million products in my hair. This has been the best so far.</li>
    <li> Honestly, very stellar pomade. I LOVED the fact that it held well in my hair all day, yet easily came out when I took a shower. I&#x27;ve been searching for some time now for a pomade that had these qualities. I&#x27;ve used other non water soluble pomades and always hated that it took 2+ showers just to get it out of my hair. But with Uppercut, I never have to worry about that. Love the smell, love the quality, love the packaging! My only gripe is that I&#x27;m starting to run out!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing but I have very fine and thin hair so it is way too heavy and it just slicks down and I get little to no volume. Also it dries very quickly and is not able to be restyled.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best pomades I&#x27;ve tried. It smells great (I would describe the scent as a light coconut smell), it&#x27;s easy to apply and it provides an all day strong hold. I would say it works on both, long and short hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best water soluble pomades out there.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend it, you will get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good, and works great i used it to put up my Mohwak and it holds well. and It&#x27;s easy to rinse out.</li>
    <li> This is basically the best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used.  I usually just use it as a topper to keep a couple of out of control hairs in place after using groom &amp; clean or brylcreem.  When my hair gets pretty long I do use it by itself though and it&#x27;s really managable, and washes out FAR easier than any of the waxy pomades I&#x27;ve used.  Plus this stuff has a very pleasant scent that dies out quickly as to not interfere with any cologne or aftershave you may have on.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing!!!!! no other words can best describe this product. I like how you only need a small dap in your finger for the whole entire hair. i use tinny bits because i dont want my whole hair to be cover in full pomade. But i also tried a good amount to see how much hold it really has and it holds great and its shine is great too! (just so you know, i have a combover haircut and this product works AWESOME for this haircut!!) hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Fasts shipping and strong pomade.</li>
    <li> Best gel you can get from a white Italian Irish man. Thick kinky Curley hair. Shine is awesome last all day. NEVER flakes looks fresh and clean all day not stiff. Washes out easily. Not greasy. I am a freak about gel. I highly highly endurace this product. If I was famous I would do the commercial for free (well w a lifetime supply)</li>
    <li> This pomade fulfils two purposes, it brings my hair under control with a nice shine while also making my head smell like a delicious pastry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Crew Fiber in the past and still lean towards it when it comes to a matte look. However, since I&#x27;ve been wanting to explore something new I tried uppercut and it&#x27;s been very nice to use as an alternative with a much more classic gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It will slick your hair back but it takes a good amount. and it becomes matte very quickly</li>
    <li> Definitely love this product. I was using shiner&#x27;s gold but this is a bit more playful.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels in my hair but loses its hold after an hour or two</li>
    <li> Unique, but rather nice, smell, almost like a cupcake, but not cloying or overpowering. Strong hold, but doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into a helmet.</li>
    <li> Overall this is probably one of the best water based pomade I have used, and I have tried 10+ hair products. This product smells really nice, it leaves a vanilla &amp; caramel scent throughout the day. I personally like to apply a dime-sized onto my dry hair, however, it can be applied either wet or dry. It does not leave any residue and washes off right away since it is water based. One problem I run into is that towards the bottom of the product, I always get these yellow-ish dry crumbs when I apply it to my hair, this happens on everyone of my uppercut deluxe pomade. I am not aware of an expiration date and I am not sure whether this is caused by the hot and dry weather in Arizona.</li>
    <li> Classic, clean-cut look. Worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Love the coconut smell and does a great job holding.</li>
    <li> smell&#x27;s good, kind like icecream, my hair is hard and thick, and it&#x27;s holding just fine on the cloudy days, can soften my thick hair and make it style good, little bit easy to loose under moist weather or strong sunshine, but still, good stuff to have it around</li>
    <li> This is basically a thick gel that smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is probably one my favorite water-based pomades. Goes in smoothly, has a nice subtle scent, great shine, washes out easily. When it dries it can feel a little wirery - to the touch - but that only happens if my hair is too damp when applied. After drying - the pomade adds a little wave to my hair with a nice wet look. Re combs easily and a little wet combing does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to alternate this one every couple of days when I want to take a break from the greasier pomades. Also because of its consistency it&#x27;s easy to groom and run if you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome tin and Awesome Pomade. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells like vanilla, holds without getting hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect pomade for months. After reading the reviews I was super excited to receive this product; especially since the price is good. Unfortunately I was super disappointed. The smell is great but after applying it made my hair super crunchy which is not what I wanted at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why I had such a different experience than the other reviewers who said this pomade didn&#x27;t make their hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best water soluble pomade on the market. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Suavecito to Shiner Gold to Bona Fide Pomade, and nothing beats this. I have really thick and wavy hair, and it holds all day without any problems. For best results, apply to slightly damp hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives my hair a nice shine and holds it in place really well without looking like crusty gel. I also think it has a cool design. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Thins easily with a small amount of water and washes out without any problem.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the hubs - he was using that Crew Fibre stuff, but we wanted something non greasy. I have to say he really likes this stuff and it smells really good, like cookies! Yum. Doesn&#x27;t stain the pillow and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but when you apply it to your hair it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;If your into the side parts and pomps, this is bar none top shelf quality with even better price point! It&#x27;s got a great hold and super easy to wash out!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts long too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: this product is so cool, feels like your apart of a movement by owning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to wash out (literally just water)&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting both product wise and applied in hair&lt;br /&gt;-versatile product&lt;br /&gt;-super clean in black hair (no residue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-exclusiveness&lt;br /&gt;-everyone you know will be wearing it too once you recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Will most definatley buy it again! If you&#x27;re looking for a medium hold pomade then this is it.</li>
    <li> It takes a couple of trys to get the hang of this product put very good just start with a littel bit and add more product if need</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality product</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, holds the hair very well, all day. It is easy to wash out and has a slight sweet smell. It does have a slight greaser appearance to it, but you can regulate how much you want to use.</li>
    <li> I have been on a pomade/paste/wax/clay mission. My goals are simple.&lt;br /&gt;1 - be able to craft classic 20s-50s hair styles with a modern spin&lt;br /&gt;2 - find product(s) that do not smell awful&lt;br /&gt;3 -  find product(s) that wash out easy-ish&lt;br /&gt;4 - find products that if left in overnight do not feel overly tacky, greasy, brittle or stain the pillow&lt;br /&gt;5 - find products that resemble the feel and hold of real old school products (no &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34; that harden stiff like hair gel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah bottom line this is the BEST water based pomade I have tried (and I have tried a lot). Here are my point by point notes based on the goals above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - High and tight is the deal with this stuff. If I want to have a formal businessman pomp or slick gangster look this is my go to.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Smells like vanilla and caramel. It is a light and pleasing smell that my wife loves.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Washes out completely with regular shampoo. Had me worried as it goes in like a classic pomade but I assure you total wash out.&lt;br /&gt;4 - No grease, no tack, but it does get brittle if you put it in when your hair was wet and no pillow stain. I prefer to wash this out before bed.&lt;br /&gt;5 - Classic pomade look with a bit more brittle of a hold. Never feels like a gel though.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! A little goes a long way and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This made me super hard.</li>
    <li> I have only tried 2 pomades and they are imperial classic pomade and this uppercut pomade. This brand has a strong hold with a low to medium shine. I really like uppercut pomande more than the imperial because it gives a more natural look to my hair. Imperial pomade has more shine. Overall i prefer the uppercut pomade over imperial pomade because it has less shine to it which gives off a natural look.</li>
    <li> This is a spectacular pomade. The hold is more biased to the strong side than medium (which I why I knocked a star), but it&#x27;s easy to use, smells great (which matters more than I would have expected), and washes out clean. Unlike some other water-based pomades, Uppercut leaves no residue on my pillowcase at night. I don&#x27;t put it in my hair dry (unlike the directions suggest), however; I find it spreads much more evenly if my hair is still slightly damp from a shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my hair gel. The gel was very sticky and left my hair very hard after it dried which in turn made my scalp sore at the end of the day. This pomade allows my hair to hold its style without being as hard as concrete, thus keeping my scalp from being sore. I like the smell of the product also and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I got into pomade s a couple months ago after failing to find a gel that could control my thick wavy hair.  I tried Murrays, Layrite original, Layrite Super Hold, Suavecito Firme Hold, American Crew (sucks) and now Uppercut Deluxe and I can honestly say Uppercut is my favorite.  I pulled a small amount out rubbed it between my hands and straight combed it in and done, 1 minute.  The other pomades I had to keep combing to get it right and even after I did the hold would weaken ten minutes after.  Not this stuff the hair stayed exactly where I wanted with no fly always.  Take it from a guy who has dropped a couple bucks on pomeades this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Great hold, great smell, washes out easy.</li>
    <li> gives one that old Barbershop greased look.  Just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> I have insanely thick hair that gives even the strongest of gels a great deal of trouble, so when I decided to make the switch to pomade, this was the first product that caught my eye.  The hold is bonkers, and the scent is incredible.  I love how it washes out so easily, and can be restyled with a simple splash of water.  Will absolutely continue buying this</li>
    <li> Works great. Not much more needed</li>
    <li> Good, a bit expensive for the size.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the hold. I read in multiple places that the hold was amazing. Here is what I can say; if your hair is thin and soft (likely Caucasian or Indian hair), and your only issue is that without product, your hair falls on your forehead and you need something to keep it in place, this product is for you. But if you have thick wavy hair, and you need to put something in your hair while it&#x27;s damp that would not just keep your hair in place, but tame it and straighten out the waves, this product is too weak. I recommend American Crew&#x27;s Grooming Cream as a good alternative that means business.</li>
    <li> This stuff applies easily, holds well, and has a nice, light, coconutty smell. The only thing I dislike about it is that it dries a little hard, like a styling gel but not quite as crunchy-feeling.</li>
    <li> Always keeps my hair looking like a true hipster!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin, so he could use it for a wedding. He said it made his hair look spiffy and nice!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good hair product since my asian hair is too dark and thick for most cream/wax.  I also don&#x27;t like the feeling of glue or rough hair or too oil/shiny hair.  I&#x27;m picky let put it that way.  This product is just great for me.  Low shine, good hold, easy to style your hair.  I put my hair up as  mohawk and it stays the whole day while I was working. amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend for fellow asians with dark thick hair to use with.  havent tried it to make a slickback but will do</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that even my barber gives me a look of pity for. I tried Uppercut Deluxe based on his recommendations and have finally found my styling solution. I have tried all the store bought brands and none of them would hold unless I applied an insane amount of product. This lead to the dreaded crusty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is a learning curve to using UD (dry hands, dry hair is not a recommendation, but a requirement), it&#x27;s worth the effort to find your own sweet spot where the hold is perfect and the crustiness is held to the bare minim if any at all. If you&#x27;re a shower in the morning person, use a bit less than you think at first. If you are/or are willing to change to being a shower in the evening person, then apply the full amount in the morning, brush, and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy as that. Great product, great branding, and great shipping with Prime.</li>
    <li> This Pomade is amazing! I&#x27;ve used multiple pomades: Tres Flores, Suavecito, layrite, Axe, etc.. uppercut Deluxe is by far the best. I have thick hair that is wavey naturally. I use a Nickle sized amount of the product and it gives me a fantastic hold all day. I can shape my hair and make sure I don&#x27;t have waves in it! It also smells really well. Ladies like it. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using pomade for years and really wanted to try this brand. I got it for him to test out and he really liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;He says its got a nice firm hold for anyone who has think curly hair. He says its good but not the best although it is definitely a top shelf pomade.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I have hair that tends to stick up and fuzz out and short of a gel I can&#x27;t really lock it in place. Uppercut is a perfect medium since it doesn&#x27;t harden quite like a gel and flake out, and yet it&#x27;s strong enough to keep everything in place. Even after the gym, it held up quite nicely. The smell is great too (coconut), and for 18 bucks you get quite a bit. One finger-tip is enough for me, so the whole can should last at least 2 months, maybe longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! A friend of mine pick it up at an old school barber shop and let me try some. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Easy to work and it has a really nice vinella scent that my girl loves. If you ride and are forced to wear a lid, no worries. Pop your lid off, run your hand through your hair and it&#x27;s like you never had a lid on.</li>
    <li> My persinal choice for water based pomade. keeps your hold all day even if you only use a little bit.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s my go to water soluble. The hold is perfect and the scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love using uppercut. It last all day and had a really nice shine. It feels a little expensive, but my hair looks and smells great.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair !product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My husband and 7 year old son uses this to style their hair. It works great and easy to use. We will continue to buy this product even though it is a little on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> son used this, then switched to the matt clay.  Not sure if it was the product, or that he doesnt like pomade.</li>
    <li> Quality pomade. Smells like vanilla/coconut tan lotion. If you put it in wet, it will dry hard and somewhat glossy. I usually brush/comb through it after drying and it provides solide matte hold. Slightly stiffer than the Suavecito I was using. I would buy again</li>
    <li> As advertised, smells good holds very well will buy this pomade again and again</li>
    <li> On time delivery. Great scent and hold. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, holds my thick and unruly hair where I need it to stay.  I rock a pomp and this thing keeps it high for the whole day.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a super sticky residue in your hand and it washes off easily.  My only gripe is that it&#x27;s pretty expensive for how much you get.  It&#x27;s still worth it though, check it out!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even use this pomade because the scent made me want to throw up.</li>
    <li> So as I started to write this review I noticed that the reviews on Amazon apply to both the Deluxe and Monster Hold Pomades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not as strong as I wish it was, I love the Deluxe version. After it dries it leaves a crisp hold to it which keeps your hair where it needs to be but can be easily brushed out with your hand. I just wish it had a tiny bit more hold to it. The other thing I love with the Deluxe is that it&#x27;s completely water soluble and washes out VERY nicely, where as most other products I&#x27;ve used in the past (the ones with any noticeable hold) leave a residue even after a thorough washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so that said, the Monster Pomade is not to my liking. It has a very waxy feel to it, similar to the Hemp styling paste I used before when I had shorter hair (probably a better product for that hairstyle), and it DOES NOT wash out that easily. It definitely has a MUCH stronger hold than the Deluxe, but I really don&#x27;t like the rough waxy texture...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that review helps clarify some fine details about the Deluxe vs Monster Hold pomade by Uppercut - kinda wish I had known this before I ordered the Monster Hold.</li>
    <li> it works and the smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> Possibly the best pomade on the market. And the SMELL IS AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Holds hair and has a wonderful scent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Amazing hold for thicker hair which is a little longer than most. The smell is great but not overpowering like some others, and it spreads well, and moves evenly through your hair. Well worth a try.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite pomades! Great hold, great smell!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. The flexibility of the product give the consumer unlimited options, while managing to maintain it&#x27;s hold late into the evening.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Exactly as advertised!  Product is larger than expected, which is a big plus!  The product gives great hold, but is not sticky/tacky when applied nor does it result in helmet hair.  The scent is light/clean/fresh not overpowering.  I highlly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Is it supposed to be ironic that neither of the boxers pictured on the lid are actually throwing an uppercut?</li>
    <li> thick pomade so if your looking for a thinner hair product this may not be for you but it smells good and holds all day. Love it but will look for a thinner hair product</li>
    <li> Acts like a super hold hair gel. Dries hard and when you break it,  your hair is like straw.  Washes out easier than others say. Way too expensive for these results.  If I had to guess,  I would say the ingredients were: DEP hair gel,  vanilla extract for scent,  and brown food coloring for aesthetics. Cool tin can though.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Don&#x27;t need a lot and my hair stays in place all day. When I sweat it doesn&#x27;t bother me either. Will be getting again once I run out.</li>
    <li> great product, nice hold and just the right amount of shine</li>
    <li> Best pomade that I have ever used way better than layrite and suavecito. Its a super strong hold not medium which I like. It does not flake at all or leave any white residue like layrite superhold. I have thick coarse hair that&#x27;s hard to maintain. But this holds all dam day love this product. And it last longer than layrite cus I don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot.</li>
    <li> I was a Suavecito user for a while, and I enjoyed it while I had some, but I switched to Uppercut&#x27;s deluxe and monster hold.&lt;br /&gt;The Deluxe is water soluble, so if you want good hold, but something that can easily wash off without too much trouble, this is a great go-to brand.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me is that when it is applied and it&#x27;s hold kicks in, it makes your hair feel like it&#x27;s being held by gel—which I&#x27;m not a fan of. Being that my hair still has a mind of its own, it&#x27;s hard to adjust my hair without the hardened deluxe becoming undone.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get one little glob of Murray&#x27;s petroleum-based pomade in one hand, and a little glob of Uppercut in another and mix it together, that problem is solved to a certain degree. Overall it is amazing for what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> One of the best strong hold pomades I have used, and it smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> great product that washes off easily....</li>
    <li> Very good product, holds great, except when you play basketball and you begin to sweat. The thing that I really like about it is that it washes out completely with some warm/cold water</li>
    <li> Love it! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Love this prodcut!! great hold! nice neutral smell.</li>
    <li> works well and washes out with no problem</li>
    <li> Great hold, good smell and easily washed out.</li>
    <li> This pomade is great. It has a very strong hold, so I&#x27;m learning to use it and wind up with the result that I&#x27;m looking for. I tend to use more in the mornings to keep my hair within military regulations, then brush just a bit through my dry hair in the evenings just to get enough pomp to style my hair the way that I want. Definitely very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it smells GREAT. I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments in just the week that I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m certainly planning on buying another tin as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this product contains methylparaben. Parabens are under scrutiny right now for their role in stimulating the production of ESTROGEN, aging the skin it comes into contact with and also potentially a link to increased risk of cancer. All of which is a shame because it IS a good product. The potential pitfalls however are going to make me steer clear of this one until Uppercut rolls out Paraben free products.</li>
    <li> Medium to strong hold seems right and the smell is pretty good if not a tad strong.  It washed out easily too.  I was really hoping this would be my go to product, but it dries so quickly that I hadn&#x27;t finished styling my hair and it was already a bit crunchy.  I have straight hair and this product made it feel a bit harder than I hoped for and gave me the &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; feel.  It left my hair with a very slight sheen which I liked.  If my hair stayed more natural feeling I would have given it a higher rating.</li>
    <li> excellent product for longer hair</li>
    <li> in my opinion Imperial classic and uppercut deluxe are best pomade in the market. Why because hold great (wavy hair), smell amazing and washout so easy also I always get compliments on my hair........how about that....BOOM</li>
    <li> This is 80% God&#x27;s sweat and 20% sticky liquid gold and 10% of the Earth&#x27;s finest coconut. I have bought this pomade now for the second time and I don&#x27;t care if it is 20 dollars!? If you want to look like a grown up man, with a grown up pomade stop even questioning whether or not you need this... Go ahead and buy the shampoo and conditioner, unless you are too much of a little baby and too scared to reach that next level of manhood.... stop wasting time... JUST DO IT.. JUST DOOOOOO ITTTTTTT</li>
    <li> Does what it says! Period.</li>
    <li> Hold is great, nice sheen without being oily, and smells great. Not sure any pomade could beat it. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different pomades before and this one works great,has a good smell to it, really like the can too,</li>
    <li> This great product washes easily and smell like vanilla/Marshmallows the ladies love it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that leaves your hair feeling wirer-ry and has low shine. But other than that is great!</li>
    <li> Pretty good hold for my curly hair. Smells good and washes out easly.</li>
    <li> Good Pomade. Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I love this pomade! Even though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive compared to others, the quality is on point!</li>
    <li> This pomade feels like a top of the line product. The packaging is a high quality tin with excellent branding. The pomade itself is easy to apply, has a great smell and stays for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple. This just can in the mail. Opened it. Tried it. It&#x27;s my new favorite styling product. Damn I look good!</li>
    <li> My favorite pomade love the ingredients I don&#x27;t like products that contain alcohol and this doesn&#x27;t and washes right out with water only complaint is over time it starts to get harder in the can I don&#x27;t know why but when I first buy it it&#x27;s soft</li>
    <li> Good hair product for me</li>
    <li> This is the only product I put in my hair.  Fantastic product.  Only downside is you need to use it up quick once you are halfway done with the can.  It will dry out in the container quick.</li>
    <li> Used the whole tin and would consider buying another. Grew my hair out, but it&#x27;s unmanageible once it&#x27;s dry, so pomade seemed to be the ticket. Not as stiff as hairspray or gel and as long as you buy water-based like this, it washes out fairly easy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Smells great, sets up reasonably quickly, and holds as long as you need it to.</li>
    <li> stop trying to find a cheaper comparison. Just buy this. Grip it and slick it.</li>
    <li> I have hair that likes to stick straight up..sort of like I stuck my finger in a light socket.  I&#x27;ve tried a billion brands and while they worked to an extent, they either made my hair sticky or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uppercut is a water soluable pomade and it makes my hair stay put and not fluffy without being sticky or crunchy.  I can even use this while taking a ride on my scooter at 50+ mph without my hair becoming a frizzy fluffball.</li>
    <li> Better hold and shine than Layrite, Crew, and Mitch pomades. Smells great. I have a thick mane and this helps tame it. I&#x27;m on my second can.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using palmades so cant rait it against others.  But it smells awesome and holds all day.  Does what I need.</li>
    <li> Pretty good hold through out the day</li>
    <li> Hey for anyone who&#x27;s wondering this stuff works great. I looked around for some other pomades in local shops and what not but didn&#x27;t find anything quite with the scent or Water-Soluble aspects that this stuff has not to mention its hold! My hair is on the shorter side but it keeps it in shape all day with only a small application. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and there&#x27;s still plenty left, I imagine it will end up lasting around 3 months maybe a little more. It does lend itself well to re-combs throughout the day as well and its not like trying to comb through hairspray, gel or anything stupid like that. It does stiffen quickly and tends to have a medium hold, an awesome scent and a medium shine. If you have medium to long length hair you may want to go with the Monster Hold version. Worth the $25 for sure as it was shipped out free by amazon.</li>
    <li> GOOD SMELL, GOOD HOLD</li>
    <li> I bought this and Layrite together to compare.  This is a very good product.  My hair is straight as an arrow and is past my eyes. I sport a 50s style pomp and this will hold it up and over 2&amp;#34; high with no problem - all day.  It does have a slight vanilla smell but is not overpowering or lingering. It is completely different than a pomade.  It dries stiff which took getting used to versus all the other greasy pomades I had been using.  It does wash out with zero problem in one wash. Compared to Layrite it is very similar.  Layrite has the same smell but is more powerful.  Layrite has a little less stiffness and hold than the Uppercut but is still 5 stars good. Layrite gives 0.5 oz more in their jar than Uppercut.  On the two I think I like Uppercut slightly more than Layrite.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair in a traditional 1930&#x27;s barber style (think Boardwalk Empire) so I really needed a classic men&#x27;s grooming product. Uppercut hits so many great points for me. I&#x27;ve actually used it several different ways and found I can get different results. If I put it in my hair wet I get a hold that&#x27;s very strong and it remains where I put it with high shine. If I break up the product when it&#x27;s dry my hair has a cool matte texture with lots of texture. If I apply is to dry hair it holds the shape and doesn&#x27;t move throughout the day. The fact that it&#x27;s water soluble makes it super easy to get out of your hair. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great hold while keeping a wet look great for slick backs. i much prefer this to crew pomade</li>
    <li> Great. Smells fantastic, washed out clean, and holds strong but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue/make your hair crunchy or rough. My new favorite pomade. I used to use suavecito but this is better.</li>
    <li> Holds well and smells great. Washes out nice without having to wash multiple times. Some people will think its over priced. I would disagree with those people. Made to be used for slick backs and pomps but you can use this for pretty much any hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I normally use this other hair product (Japanese, pink container..) which is great but is matte and bunches hair together. However that product was very strong. I went for a retro undercut and wanted to get a pomade for a cleaner look with shine. It was difficult for me because I need a product with really strong hold otherwise my hair is a mess by noon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were good and pictures of people using the product looked great so I decided to try. It has an initial strong hold but there is something about the product that makes it hard to mold your hair. It doesn&#x27;t work so well on my thick coarse hair and tends to lose shape. Over a short time my hair became loose and the product felt like it wears out. Definitely not for you&#x27;re the type that runs your hand through your hair throughout the day. It might work if you have finer hair that is easier to manage. Smells nice (kinda fruity though). I&#x27;ve had better luck using it in combination with my softer pomade first, then applying a small amount of this pomade for a firmer hold.</li>
    <li> This is a great pomade overall. Great smell , great hold , medium shine , no flakes and easily washed out with water. This stuff is a little thicker than your  Layrite or Suavecito pomades (also which get 5 stars from me) . The only thing I&#x27;d change is the price, maybe -$5 would be perfect IMO.</li>
    <li> Love this pomade.  A little goes a long way and if you add a dab of water it really helps too.  Its water based and easy to wash out.  Smells great and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy shine, but gives you those comb-lines you are probably looking for.  Great product and seems to last quite a while so the cost really isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you want a matte look with a killer hold , but it&#x27;s pretty much just a really thick gel,it hardens and gets a bit crunchy after a while.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works amazing! Holds my hair the way I want with out making it feel oily.</li>
    <li> Great hold from Uppercut, really nice clean smell, kind of like a mild chocolate.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this and other pomades for over a year, Uppercut is my favorite water based. It&#x27;s hold is super tight it keeps my wavy hair straight.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It is light on the hair and I didn&#x27;t seem to need a lot of it to get the desired results. It makes a nice pompadour.  It washes out easily. The only drawback was that it didn&#x27;t hold up well in heat and humidity.  I don&#x27;t know if more is the answer, but I started mixing it with another product and it seemed to work better.</li>
    <li> The smell is bad. I HATE coconut butter smell.  I would  not buy itagain just Because Of it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend, he loves it</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve used. Its more of a gel but holds great even on the motorcycle. Will be buying again and again</li>
    <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s just a little too expensive.  I figured I would try it out, but it&#x27;s just ok for me.</li>
    <li> I buy mine through my barber, but hands down this is the best hair product for my needs.  I have hair that grows every which way and with my comb over cut it can be hard to control.  This stuff feels light, holds strong, smells good, applies easy and washes out quickly with normal shampoo or just water.  I must also note that it&#x27;s not a high sheen finish, which I think looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star product all the way.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out, and you get a lot for $18. My bangs are a bit long (so I can comb them back) and I find by mid-afternoon they start to fall out of place, so I might try Monster Hold next time. Also know, this stuff drys hard, so you&#x27;ll have to wet your hair if you need to re-style.</li>
    <li> I tend to try a lot of different pomades, I&#x27;d been looking at trying this one for quite some time, I finally got the nerve and bought a jar. It&#x27;s definitely a lot thicker than Suavecito (which is my pomade of choice most days), but it definitely has a stronger hold, although not as strong as the firme hold, which I appreciated, a nice middle ground. I&#x27;m still not completely sold on it, still figuring out how much I need to use and whether or not my hair should be completely dry or a little damp. I would overall say that I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pomade, saw this product on askmen.com. They usally always point me in the right direction. I love that it is water washes it off without an effert. I like the scent, and shine. I didnt expect it to feel like gel after it dries.</li>
    <li> More of a gel than anything, ill stick with oil based</li>
    <li> Best water based pomade I&#x27;ve tried so far, well worth the price, hold is excellent and the smell is fabulous</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s water soluable so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all gross like a lot of other pomades.</li>
    <li> To lead off with, I style an executive contour or a slight pomp.  I have middle of the road coarse hair.  Not fine and not coarse but it is pretty thick.  My length when combed forward is just passed the tip of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several pomades recently and have found Uppercut to offer the most consistent results.  The sent is pleasant and light vs similar products.  It has a clean coconut scent but is so subtle that you have to smell the tub itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold is pretty good but like most pomade, it depends on the amount used.  I tend to use as little as possible while holding my hair the way I like it.  If high winds do cause a mess, a wet comb reactivates the pomade and continues to offer hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine is decent but doesn&#x27;t compare to petro based pomades.  Several sources recommend adding the product to dry or nearly dry hair.  I find this reduces the shine considerably.  Adding the product to wet hair results in weighed down hair.  As a compromise, I add to barely dry hair and style.  Then follow with wet palms to add shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any trouble spots appear,  I take a blow dryer on high heat, low speed to loosen up the product a bit before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is my go to pomade until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to achieve the \\&quot;Mad Men\\&quot; look for about a year now and after trying MANY pomades, I can say with confidence this is my absolute favorite product. I have very thick, curly hair. As a result, most pomades are not strong enough to hold it in place, or the stronger pomades tend to pull out my hair while applying the product. This has the best of both worlds, being very easy to apply and style, but holding extremely solid!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the product is a little pricey for how much you get, I go through a tin in about 2-3 weeks with daily use. I would love for them to sell larger amounts. Otherwise, this is a FANTASTIC waterbase pomade that cannot be missed!</li>
    <li> best pomade ive ever used, only used 2 lol. however its really good</li>
    <li> Works great and smells even better</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and he had the following comments:  Holds my straight, average thickness, medium-length hair very well.  This was my first experience with pomade and overall I was impressed.  Following the directions, I work a nickel-sized amount into my palms and fingers, and then run it through my damp hair.  My style is straight back, with the front pushed forward a little to get some height, basically a classic pomp without using a comb.  Holds all day without being too stiff.  If it gets mussed up, I run my hands through water a couple times, wet my hair slightly and evenly, shape, and I am ready to rock once again.  Washes out pretty well, though I can still smell it a little, but I have a highly sensitive sense of smell.  Pillowcase is not greasy, stained, or reeking of Uppercut.  The smell is VERY pleasant.  A coconut/vanilla/light caramel smell that I loved getting a whiff of throughout the day.  I just ordered some Suavecito, but only for comparison purposes, if all things are equal, I will be getting the Uppercut again for all the reasons listed above.</li>
    <li> Not a bad pomade, bought this along with Imperial Barbers Classic Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*I do a pomp and a slick back and it works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;*Washes out with ease.&lt;br /&gt;*Smells great, a creamy caramel smell. Its addicting.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*It does fray a little through out the day, but that could just be my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;*it hardens up a little more than I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good product. Tops American Crew by far, their products are extremely overpriced. This is a go to for me. Good Pomade.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great aside from the price. I learned about this product from my barbershop, and I will be ordering more. Great hold, easy to work when hairs damp.</li>
    <li> Best pomade EVER!! Keeps hold even in the heat. Goes in smooth and minimal product needed for unruly hair. Great for all your pompadour needs! Beats out both Suavecito and Layrite hands down.. It&#x27;s a knockout!</li>
    <li> The best pomade so far, tried everything lay rite,suave, etc.......worth the price will order only this pomade here on out.....semi fine hair and can styple a dope pomp</li>
    <li> Smells good (coconut/vanilla), works in nicely, washes out like it was never there, holds my... let&#x27;s say 4.5&amp;#34; hair down in an alt-fashion undercut style pretty nicely. I will say that, living in Arizona, humidity or sweat will kind of undo what you did in the morning, but not in a way that you can&#x27;t pull off a more &amp;#34;effortless&amp;#34; style with it as the day progresses. I assume if you live in an area that doesn&#x27;t hit 110* on the daily you&#x27;ll be fine. My hair is thick as all hell, and pretty wavy, so this stuff does the trick pretty nicely. Doesn&#x27;t hold it straight necessarily, but I&#x27;m using a fingertips-worth of product. I bet if I went HAM on it, scooping out a solid three-finger glob, I&#x27;d be set. Get some!</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time, product works well.  Is it right for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to pomade, I&#x27;ve just made the switch from gel about a month ago.  This is a water based pomade and makes your hair very stiff when applied.  I&#x27;ve spoken to others who have used pomade for a while and supposedly there are oil based pomades out there that will make your hair not as stiff and more slick.  Overall great product, but I will be checking out an oil based pomade to experiment.</li>
    <li> This is great pomade, best I&#x27;ve ever found. It holds very well with a smooth finish and a great smell. Also it is water soluble so it rinses right out. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> For years I couldn&#x27;t find a hair product I liked. Recently, I had been going back between an Axe pomade, a Garnier Fructis gel, and an Old Spice pomade. I couldn&#x27;t find one I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try this one out. I hadn&#x27;t used any of the high-end hair products before, so the price was a serious concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this product for several weeks now, I can say with confidence that I love this product. Excellent holding and styling quality. Superb light vanilla smell. A large amount (larger than Axe and Old Spice at least). Great look to the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this item many more times, and would reccomend it to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance and it makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> best pomade out there.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.  Perfect shine if that is what you are looking for, also really easy to wash out.  If you are looking for a natural flow looking product this is not it.</li>
    <li> It works well especially for curly hair but it lacks flexibility of use and shine. It is not greasy like other product and is water based and washable.</li>
    <li> Great pomade with all day hold and medium shine. Looks I found my fav</li>
    <li> I just started using pomades and this stuff is absolutely amazing. It smells great and makes unruly hair easy to style.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  A little bit goes a long way and lasts all day.  Washes off hands and out of hair easily.  Cool looking can.</li>
    <li> Very workable. Amazing scent.  More people should buy this brand. I have used a few of their pomades/creames and they&#x27;re all great.</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used! Won&#x27;t sweat out but washes out easily. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be something that was super strong but its pretty average. I was pretty disappointed since its a top recommended product by barbers and stylists. It definitely gets the job if you are going for the Don Draper look, but if you have a few cowlicks or hair that isnt as cooperative and looking for a revolutionary product this is not it. Basically Murrays in a cooler container.</li>
    <li> Honestly this pomade is so damn good if your looking for superior hold an to style your hair anyway you want then this is the pomade for you defenitly buying this again</li>
    <li> I like collecting pomades, and this one is mos def my top...Only downsides I see with the pomade is one the price, and two not enough sheen, it just has a medium sheen. Overall I&#x27;m super happy with this product and it holds my hair in place all day, even with a high pomp. Try it out!!!</li>
    <li> The product smells great and I love the hold it gives to my hair.</li>
