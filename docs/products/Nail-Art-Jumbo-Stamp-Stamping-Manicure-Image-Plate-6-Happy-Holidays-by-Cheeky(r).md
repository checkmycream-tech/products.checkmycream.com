      <li>I gave it 3 stars because it arrived before the estimated delivery date and this plate is ok.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more .</li>
      <li>But neither do I want to leave them unprotected because they will easily become more scratched and unusable.</li>
      <li>I have bought other brand stamping plates and they were great!</li>
      <li>They are well etched and easy to stamp with.</li>
      <li>My favorite plate right now!</li>
      <li>and it is easy to use I really enjoy using</li>
      <li>The packaging seemed fine</li>
      <li>Insta-dry drug store brand worked fine.</li>
      <li>designs are cute, but nothing to extraordinary.</li>
      <li>Good clear images!</li>
      <li>I also use the Konad stamper, and have even had success with the cheap &amp;#34;Salon Expressions&amp;#34; nail stamping kit picking up the polish colors with the Sinful Colors polish!</li>
      <li>Fantastic plate.</li>
      <li>super easy to use.</li>
      <li>, so I was excited when I saw these jumbo plates.</li>
      <li>Love cheeky plates so pretty</li>
      <li>The images are crisp and clean as most of Cheeky plates are.</li>
      <li>Well the big stamp are ok and nice like always this brand do it</li>
      <li>Images stamp cleanly.</li>
      <li>Some images are etched too shallow and do not give a clear stamp, but otherwise a good product, most images work great.</li>
      <li>the small ones are not so great is ok</li>
      <li>Thanks :)</li>
      <li>thanks, I was just hoping they could provide me with MORE information.  </li>
      <li>They never fail to get me HUGE compliments on my fun nails while we are standing in line waiting to get into the Haunted Houses!  </li>
      <li>and you can use it with other image plates to get great ideas.</li>
      <li>With so many choices I get so many different looks</li>
      <li>quick and fun</li>
      <li>Will definitely be getting more plates!</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to getting this plate and had more ready to buy</li>
      <li>Many of the scratches are insignificant, but more than a few of the designs, mostly Christmas ones which were the ones I was most excited to use, have very deep scratches in the designs making them completely unusable.  </li>
      <li>These stamp extremely well, even the more detailed stamps like the witches on broomsticks pattern.  </li>
      <li>make the metal plate very sturdy!  </li>
      <li>Right now I am having an absolute blast with the Halloween stamps on this set because we are going to Halloween Horror Nites every week</li>
      <li>The engraving is deep enough you can get good color, and there&#x27;s a lot of designs.  </li>
      <li>I wish these big plates came in some kind of a protective case or that you can at least buy some kind of case to put them in after you buy them.</li>
      <li>Many times those types of stamps don&#x27;t work because the design is too small and detailed and the polish doesn&#x27;t  pick up.  </li>
      <li>and I liked that the designs were large enough to actually cover my whole thumb.  </li>
      <li>I will be able to get some use from this plate, but not nearly as much as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted the holiday edition one</li>
      <li>I really like the stamping plate though.</li>
      <li>Very versatile designs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really dissapointed with this plate.</li>
      <li>I really like the pueen 2013 collection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After one month, I politely inquired whether it was possible to get any information on where my package was since there was no tracking available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>But there are many patterns and singles for every other Holiday.  </li>
      <li>They are round little metal plates that fit perfectly in the konad stamping tool you can buy separately( or use alone like I learned to do)and after use you place them back in the nice little &amp;#34;wallet&amp;#34; they came in with each one individually protected in their own little pocket.</li>
      <li>Lots of fun, and easy to use (after a little practice).</li>
      <li>The designs are a perfect size for both larger nails (the whole nail design would cover your whole nail) and smaller nails (the individual designs are actually small enough to fit on your nails and not get cut off).</li>
      <li>I have Cheeky&#x27;s summer and vibrant collection</li>
      <li>Some are shallow requiring you to move more quickly.</li>
      <li>and I can recommend these highly.  </li>
      <li>This plate is awesome and covers basically every typical holiday except Thanksgiving, which is why I only Like it and not Love</li>
      <li>With the various stamping plates I own, I recommend a cheaper polish like Sinful Colors, as they have a huge array of colors, and are thick enough that the stamper picks up the thicker color.</li>
      <li>and I create new designs on my nails with these stamps every week.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so many damn St. Patrick&#x27;s day stamps, though.  </li>
      <li>The designs are clear and transfer crisply with my Konad double sided stamper.  </li>
      <li>Works like a charm and for once images are big enough to cover my full nail  </li>
      <li>large specific designs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it but did take a month to receive so that was very disappointing. But other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> My favorite plate right now! Very versatile designs. Check out my pictures. My Instagram to view more is @iDidMyNailArt. Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> This plate is awesome, love it, great designs. Have had good luck with stamping with it. nails look great. love it</li>
    <li> Love cheeky plates so pretty</li>
    <li> For the price this is a must have set to make your holiday manicures stand out. I don&#x27;t have to use stamping polish to make them work either. Insta-dry drug store brand worked fine.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. All plates I order from Cheeky are perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this plate!  I have tons of stamping plates as it has become quite a hobby of mine!  I am picky about my stamps and I can recommend these highly.  Right now I am having an absolute blast with the Halloween stamps on this set because we are going to Halloween Horror Nites every week and I create new designs on my nails with these stamps every week.  They never fail to get me HUGE compliments on my fun nails while we are standing in line waiting to get into the Haunted Houses!  These stamp extremely well, even the more detailed stamps like the witches on broomsticks pattern.  Many times those types of stamps don&#x27;t work because the design is too small and detailed and the polish doesn&#x27;t  pick up.  But this stamps like a charm.  I only wish that it had some single stamps for Halloween...this plate only has the whole nail patterns for Halloween.  But there are many patterns and singles for every other Holiday.  I am certain this will be one of my favorites for a long time!</li>
    <li> Some images are etched too shallow and do not give a clear stamp, but otherwise a good product, most images work great.</li>
    <li> I have Cheeky&#x27;s summer and vibrant collection and they&#x27;re great, so I was excited when I saw these jumbo plates. Glad I ordered the happy holidays jumbo plate...quick and fun mani&#x27;s for every holiday! Anyway, I&#x27;ve had no problems with this jumbo plate...perfect designs every time. I just ordered the musical nails jumbo plate and I can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as my other plates but still trying to to see if I can get it to work</li>
    <li> Good clear images! These images are just as good as konad! I have several Cheeky plates and I love them!</li>
    <li> I love these plates! This is my third cheeky plate I really wanted the holiday edition one and it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
    <li> The packaging seemed fine but the plate is curved. I tried to bend it back into shape but a lot of the images won&#x27;t pull up evenly.  Such a shame. This was a very cute plate.</li>
    <li> These plates are great! If you can&#x27;t get them to work, change the polish you are using, that was a big help for me. Will definitely be getting more plates!</li>
    <li> Well the big stamp are ok and nice like always this brand do it&lt;br /&gt;but the small ones are not so great is ok I think just for have diversity</li>
    <li> I received mine, one corner was slightly bent though. Otherwise the images are very cute, the details in some look very thin so I hope they come out clearly when I start stamping.</li>
    <li> Great Stamping Plate. Has all kinds of holiday images to work with lots of Christmas images.  I would recommend this and you can use it with other image plates to get great ideas.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this stamping plate til a month after i bought it and am sorry i did. The engraving is soo shallow that it doesn&#x27;t transfer the image at all. Now my return window has expired and i am stuck with something i paid for and doesn&#x27;t work. It is useless. I have bought other brand stamping plates and they were great! I will never buy cheeky products again!</li>
    <li> This is a great Nail art stamping plate- images are nice size-fill whole nail for the pattern designs-there are a lot of images to choose from- transfer is excellent to nail- easy storage and I love the plaid acrylic backing- make the metal plate very sturdy!  Shipping was well packaged and arrived in 2 wks from Asia.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun, and easy to use (after a little practice).</li>
    <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. large specific designs.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and for once images are big enough to cover my full nail  Will be buying more .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed with this plate. I was expecting something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was aweful. The plate arrived in a thin yellow envelope, with no extra protection for the plate than the blue film and some random protectors for the corners that weren&#x27;t doing their work. Despite the blue fil, the plate has some scratches that thankfuly doesn&#x27;t affect the images. The plate itself, despite the backing, it&#x27;s thing and fragile and mine was a little bit bent in some areas. I had to try and flatten it with my hands. The backing, also, is peeling off in some parts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are cute, but nothing to extraordinary. They aren&#x27;t that big and the fact that they have that curved shape at the bottom made them even smaller. For a &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; plate the images are really small. At least they cover my small and not-too-long nails with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Love it!! Love it!! The images are crisp and clean as most of Cheeky plates are. Glad I added it to my collection. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety of holidays you get on this plate. They are well etched and easy to stamp with. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> This plate is awesome and covers basically every typical holiday except Thanksgiving, which is why I only Like it and not Love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper than a lot of other plates but works just as well once you figure stamping out.</li>
    <li> Out of all the plates i have  this one is the worst. I was really looking forward to getting this plate and had more ready to buy but when I tried it the only image that picked up was the web. Needless to say I will not be ordering any more.</li>
    <li> Overall the images on this plate stamp well. Some are shallow requiring you to move more quickly. The designs are a perfect size for both larger nails (the whole nail design would cover your whole nail) and smaller nails (the individual designs are actually small enough to fit on your nails and not get cut off). Pleased with the plate</li>
    <li> Nice holiday plate.  Images stamp cleanly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product near the end of September.  They provided me with an estimated delivery of two months later.  I knew there was no way it would really take that long, they just put up an absurd over-estimate so that you are not even allowed to question anything for TWO WHOLE MONTHS after they have taken your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month, I politely inquired whether it was possible to get any information on where my package was since there was no tracking available on Amazon.  They were very rude to me and very defensive, unwilling to even listen to me since the estimated delivery window was still wide open.  In more than one email they implied I was incapable of reading the information provided to me by Amazon.  I read it all, thanks, I was just hoping they could provide me with MORE information.  The package ended up arriving two days later (because of course it was never going to take two months but they kept insisting it might!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two plates and they were in one bubble mailer.  The packaging seemed secure enough, so the only reason I can think that this plate would have arrived so scratched up is that it left the factory that way.  Many of the scratches are insignificant, but more than a few of the designs, mostly Christmas ones which were the ones I was most excited to use, have very deep scratches in the designs making them completely unusable.  I will be able to get some use from this plate, but not nearly as much as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had purchased one of these jumbo plates in the past and I liked that the designs were large enough to actually cover my whole thumb.  The two plates I just received do not have designs as big as my other one, and they do not fit across my whole thumb nail.  Very disappointing both in terms of service AND product.  I will be sticking with other stamping brands from now on and will be recommending the same to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my first plate, and I must say I&#x27;m addicted.  The designs are clear and transfer crisply with my Konad double sided stamper.  The engraving is deep enough you can get good color, and there&#x27;s a lot of designs.  I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so many damn St. Patrick&#x27;s day stamps, though.  That could have been space for other holidays (Thanksgiving, maybe? Which is totally not included...)  Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> With so many choices I get so many different looks love using this and it is easy to use I really enjoy using</li>
    <li> I would have given this a five because I love all the designs but both plates I ordered came with scratches on them and some of the designs were unusable because they were too scratched. I really like the pueen 2013 collection. They are round little metal plates that fit perfectly in the konad stamping tool you can buy separately( or use alone like I learned to do)and after use you place them back in the nice little &amp;#34;wallet&amp;#34; they came in with each one individually protected in their own little pocket. I wish these big plates came in some kind of a protective case or that you can at least buy some kind of case to put them in after you buy them. I&#x27;m not sure how to store these in a way that leaves them convenient to use yet doesnt look tacky(like wrapping tp or paper towel around them). But neither do I want to leave them unprotected because they will easily become more scratched and unusable. If you know of a protective case for these please reply to my review with the info because I would love to get one. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I just received the plate today. I gave it 3 stars because it arrived before the estimated delivery date and this plate is ok. But, I will not be purchasing any more plates.</li>
    <li> Came dented on an edge but after a bit of manipulation, I got the metal to lay flat and the dent does not affect the stamp. Maybe add a piece of cardboard to both sides of the stamping plate, so that when it ships, it is more protected. I really like the stamping plate though. With the various stamping plates I own, I recommend a cheaper polish like Sinful Colors, as they have a huge array of colors, and are thick enough that the stamper picks up the thicker color. I also use the Konad stamper, and have even had success with the cheap &amp;#34;Salon Expressions&amp;#34; nail stamping kit picking up the polish colors with the Sinful Colors polish!</li>
    <li> Fantastic plate. I love the fact that it includes all holidays.  Very sharp and defining images on the nail.  This is wonderful and I would buy from them again.  Very pleasant experience...Linda W</li>
    <li> These are amazing Plates. They work perfectly. 63 images per plate your sure to have lots of fun Mani&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;These stamp great. No issues or troubles.</li>
