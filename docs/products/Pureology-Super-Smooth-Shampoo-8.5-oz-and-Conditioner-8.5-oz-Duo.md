      <li>so it&#x27;s probably not an issue for most people.</li>
      <li>for the price the quantity should be more.  </li>

      <li>I never thought it would help to spend a lot more</li>
      <li>I like the volumizing shampoo from Pureology more...  </li>

      <li>Best shampoo &amp; conditioner so far for my hair, it smells great and leave my hair super smooth and straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love them. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t fade the color, as I change the color of my hair often so it&#x27;s a great thing. Love everything about this product.</li>
    <li> Pureology Shampoo is really great, does a good job cleaning and conditioning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone who needs a good conditioning.</li>
    <li> Great product, but a little pricy for the quantity. I would recommend this product if you received more for the money.</li>
    <li> I started using the serum and was very impressed.  I added the shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s even better.  I have thick hair so it smooths my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month, on thick, colored, frizzy hair. I also bought Argon oil and am using a Babybliss flat iron...and my hair is straight and wonderful. These products don&#x27;t leave a coating on my hair, like some other products. It is a little more drying than I want, but I have extremely dry hair so it&#x27;s probably not an issue for most people. My biggest issue with Pureology is the packaging. The shampoo and conditioner packages are identical, and the font is really small. So I am forever trying to figure out, in the shower, which one is the shampoo. Were it not for that, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my &amp;#34;the most weird and unmanageable hair&amp;#34; in the world. You need a little shampo only to apply. But for me more conditioner.</li>
    <li> i just finished a review of the super smooth cream, and i gave it 5 stars, and i am going to give these two products 5 stars as well. as i said in the other review i am not one to fuss over my hair too much. i just want products to work, and do as they state, and these products do. i was using the moisturizing product, and loved the way it smelled, very herbal, which some don&#x27;t like, but i decided that being in florida, where it is almost always humid, that adding moisture wasn&#x27;t what i needed, so i switched to super smooth, and there was a bad transition period for the first couple of times-totally surprised me, but if you use these products, and then the super smooth cream, and style your hair with a blow dryer and an iron, you will see your hair looking great, and it has a nice soft scent as well.</li>
    <li> Pureology is a great product! I have tried this and the origional kind and like them both. I have sensitive skin and for years have had scalp, neck and upper back reactions from hair products. Iv&#x27;e tried other so called \\&quot;organic\\&quot; products that became a total waste of money and my hair felt terrible. This is the ONLY product that gives me soft, shiny and healthy hair with no break outs! At all! In the past I used to get the store brand type products, they all caused a reaction. I never thought it would help to spend a lot more but sometimes you DO get what you pay for. I also not longer have frizzy hair, with out using any antifriz products. I guess the cheap stuff is just full of junk. This is my major splurge but it works!</li>
    <li> Pureology has not dissappointed me yet. This Super Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner smells soo nice. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell at first but after a couple uses it really grew on me. It smells like sweet sugary roses. But when it comes to quality of hair care it blew me away. It made my hair so manageable, soft, styleable, clean, and made my hair smell wonderful. I LOVE this s&amp;c combination.</li>
    <li> Leaves me with silky soft smooth hair and its VEGAN!!!</li>
    <li> I have natural black hair which is is very coarse. Regular use of Pureology super smooth will have made my hair soft, manageable, and has given my hair extreme moisture. I usually leave it on my hair for about an hour or two with a conditioning cap on. When I flat iron my hair out, it is so smooth- it looks like I have had a relaxer! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love that I found this on amazon!  I&#x27;ve used the curl shampoo and conditioner before by pureology and didn&#x27;t hate it, but didn&#x27;t love it either. For those of us with naturally curly hair I definately recommend using the pureology super smooth shampoo and conditioner to bring out hour best curl!!</li>
    <li> As always pureology is the best I only have to use half the amount I usually use with regular shampoo great buy great product</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing course or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the super smooth. Has helped with frizz due to humidity.</li>
    <li> The bottles appeared pink to me. I spent lot of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work well at all for me. I am very disappointed in this Shipping service was great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have a Brazilian Blowout and it sounded like it would be a good shampoo and conditioner for the treatment. I used the shampoo and conditioner and I have to say that my hair looked wonderful. Straight and silky without being greasy...however...the perfume smell is so pungent and overwhelming that it gave me a horrible migraine. I am sensitive to scent and this scent is absolutely overpowering. I had to wash my hair FOUR times with my old products to get the smell out. I hated to waste the money, but I had to throw the products away. There is no way I would use them again or recommend them until they correct the scent issue. I really liked the results, but I absolutely can&#x27;t get past that smell. If they reformulate it to either be unscented or toned down the amount of scent by about 95 percent, I would use it again, but unless they do that, I&#x27;ll never use this product again. If you are sensitive to artificial fragrance or strong odors, this is probably not a good product for you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure gold.  Never thought expensive shampoo was worth the price but this line is wonderful.  Helped tame my thick frizzy hair considerably</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to Pureology after a recommendation from my hair stylist and sister.  I usually don&#x27;t like spending this kind of money on shampoo/conitioners but I must admit that it has made a difference with my hair.  I have thick,course,wavy hair that I blow straight a couple times a week. The product does help to keep my hair staighter and smoother and less frizz. I still think it is extremly expensive, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but is better than the many other equally expensive and less shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners that I have tried.  Can&#x27;t say much yet about if it really helps with color fading.  My color had already faded when I started using it so I will have to wait until I color again.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for many years. My beautician used to sell them but not now. I am so glad Amazon does! These are great products for your hair. My hair shines using these. You only need a very small amount. The shampoo lasts a long time. I have used many of the Pureology products.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner by Pureology  not only made my hair feel great or smelled great also- I would recommend</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner, arrives early as what expected!&lt;br /&gt;But so expensive compare to the other shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had used another Pureology shampoo (moisturizer) and it left my hair amazingly soft, so I thought &amp;#34;super smooth&amp;#34;, you can&#x27;t go wrong with that! Well, it did. It doesn&#x27;t feel smooth AT ALL, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a nice smell... too bad, because it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap! Live and learn! Stick with what you know is good!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduce me to this product.  It smells great and I love how it makes my hair shine and not to mention soft!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this five stars because I just embarked on a quest to discover the best shampoo for me. Wish I could give 4.5 stars. I recently participated in a trial of a new shampoo and was amazed at how wonderful the shampoo and rinse out conditioner performed. Of course I can&#x27;t buy it or get any information, Reading the reviews for Pureology sounded like this was the one. The styling of my hair is not as great as it was with my unknown shampoo, but it is definitely the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Its funny the shampoo I received is white and the bottle I bought at  my salon is peach, feel it is not the real thing. I love the real Purelogy shampoo!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner on recommendation from Jennifer Scott (author of &amp;#34;Lessons From Madame Chic&amp;#34;).  It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but a very small amount goes a very long way.  Gentle and effective cleaning and conditioning for my fine, curly, highlighted hair.  I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite product until the protein strengthener came out (teal bottles)!&lt;br /&gt;Great for smoothing - but always felt I needed a little more condition in my conditioner!</li>
    <li> I knew how good this product from working in a salon. This was also a good price. Does wonders for naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> very unhappy.. bunch of fuzzy and not hydrated hair... i miss the old smell very much.. the idea of changing to mint to make the smell more unique did not work for me.. i wonder if the formula changed too...because the older one worked very well and i was happy with the results</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo and conditioner, since I really like other Pureology products. But this product is not for me. I have thick curly hair and this product does not make it smooth as I had hoped. Will go back to using the hydrate line.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but my hairdresser gave me a gift bag that was wonderful for my latest trip so I didn&#x27;t need to mess with mini containers.  I love their products, and my thick, curly hair is easier to comb out and soft, smooth and shiny.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product either.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo &amp; conditioner! It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way. My hair stylist says this is THE best shampoo to use for color retention if you color your hair. I also love the way it lathers. It&#x27;s more expensive than many shampoos but between color retention and lasting a long time, I&#x27;ve decided it actually saves me money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I like and use Pureology but not this particular one. It has a very strong scent. I was not able to see a difference in the smoothness on my hair as compared to other Pureology.</li>
    <li> Some might consider this shampoo and conditioner a bit pricey... myself included.  That said, however, my hair looks awesome since I started using them.  It&#x27;s got a fragrance that I think is wonderful, too -- and I like that the products are 100% vegan and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo and conditioner.  It only takes very little of both to do the job.  One bottle of each has lasted me almost a year and I have medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using these two products for several months, and I find this shampoo/conditioner combo is fantastic for helping to tame frizzy hair.  My hair is both weaved and color-treated,  PLUS very frizzy.  The combo seems very good for my hair, is safe for color treated hair, and does calm my kinky, frizzy locks.  But I would also add that the Super Smooth Cream by Pureology is the final touch and really locks in the smooth look when used as directed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for caring much past looking for a &amp;#34;natural ingredients&amp;#34; label on my shampoo bottles, but maybe I should start.  I&#x27;m able to use a very small amount of this shampoo and conditioner, and my hair feels softer and grows faster.  I love it, and it&#x27;s (surprisingly) well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel and look like no other. I will buy again and again in the future!</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo for tired lifeless hair.  Came quickly and beautifully packaged</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner - leaves my hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and conditioner that leaves your hair nice and smooth but too strong and overwhelming perfume-like smell that stays with you for at least a day</li>
    <li> I like this brand, but not this shampoo, it dries my hair (my hair is a bit fine and naturally wavy, frizzes easily) and I get a headache from the smell. It&#x27;s too floral and potent for me. Others would love it I&#x27;m sure, it&#x27;s just not a shampoo to try out unless you know what you are getting. I&#x27;ll stick to the Pureology in the purple bottle.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am not giving this product a 5/5 is because I have noticed my hair falls flatter towards the scalp. I have read reviews that say if you put the product too close to your scalp, it can weigh it down. Now that I&#x27;ve been avoiding the scalp it has gotten better. The smell alone is absolutely amazing and the texture it gives your hair is smooth, manageable, and soft. I have extremely thick, wavy, and curly hair. I normally have to use loads of product to weigh down the frizz and fight humidity, but with this shampoo and conditioner I can step right out of the shower, maybe place a tiny dab of oil on the ends, and let my hair naturally air dry- which has saved me time and money on hair cuts and hair product! Definitely worth the price and because a little goes a long way, it will last forever. I bought this set about 2 months ago and still have very full bottles (mind you I only wash my hair 1-2 times per week).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Less frizz, less static.  Hair smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> I purchased my original Pureology set from my hair stylist, but after looking at prices, found this to be 40% cheaper than what she was selling it for. I have extremely thick, curly long hair and I seriously use only a quarter size amount of both shampoo and conditioner and it effectively cleans and conditions.  Also, I found that I do not have to wash my hair as often by using this product, which is does wonders for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Pureology shampoo is the best. I have a sulfa allergy and this is the only shampoo I can use. It leaves you hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Wow, my hair without this stuff looks straggly and fried. I went to a hotel and used their shampoo instead of this. Big mistake. This stuff is lightyears ahead of the pack.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to these products and I was so happy to find them on Amazon for such a good price.  You use a very little of the shampoo and it lathers up so nicely.  These products last so much longer than others.  After purchasing from Amazon I checked out the general cost of other products at Target.  Doing this supported my purchase.  Very good products and the price could not be beat!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve placed this order and all three arrived very quickly.  The nice part is that it is true product and for the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  I will order this again and again as this shampoo is so good for my  hair and keeps my hair from falling out.  Just use a small amount about the size of a dime.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Despite the outstanding reviews, I found this product did not work for me. I have extremely thick, frizzy hair and it did not smooth the strands at all; if anything it made my hair frizzier. My hair can react to things weirdly, though, so maybe it was just me. However, the deal-breaker was the underlying chemical smell--it definitely reminded me of being at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note, this review was comparing this brand to Fekkai PRX. Since my hair is frequently color treated I needed to find something that ensures strong and healthy hair; the Fekkai line definitely works better for that.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for colored treated hair. My hair looks shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> use it daily, love it</li>
    <li> Whether I flat-iron my hair or go curly...not only the smell is TO DIE FOR but you don&#x27;t need to use that much either..the shampoo is strong, little goes a long way, lathers great &amp; conditions too...the conditioner is awesome..again you don&#x27;t need to much or it can feel heavy or like a film on your hair.  This helps with the frizzies &amp; fly-aways I often get when I go curly...and even better since its a smooth formula when I straighten my hair! Smell lasts throughout the day as well!</li>
    <li> Everyone has been complementing my hair since I started using pureology</li>
    <li> Neither the shampoo nor the conditioner worked. My hair feels the same, not a bit smoother. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a problem of the brand. I have used other pureology products and they have been awesome, so I am a little skeptical. Won&#x27;t be buying these again :(</li>
    <li> Pureology Smooth Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really keeps the fly-aways down! The only downside is I find my hair to get greasy quicker so I have to wash my hair more often. Also, The conditioner knots up my hair a bit. I need to find a detangler to remedy the issue. All in all though, my hair is super soft and smooth with still a lot of body.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner so far for my hair, it smells great and leave my hair super smooth and straight. The only down side is that after a day and a half my hair starts to look oily, but any way it&#x27;s better than looking dry like it used to be.</li>
    <li> My go to shampoo and conditioner.  Love it</li>
    <li> Not worth the price didn&#x27;t help my hair. Biolag shampoo and conditioner works much better Used for about a week didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner combo is great for anyone with course hair that is color treated.  My color lasts for weeks and my hair looks and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair weighted down. They must have changed the formula</li>
    <li> If you have color treated hair this needs to be your daily shampoo. Better price on Amazon than you will find at your hair salon.</li>
    <li> I have used the Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner previously, and wanted to give the Smooth a try because I have curly, frizzy hair. This product left my hair feeling grungy, and like I had a lot of styling product build up. I don not usually use hairspray or mouse, so it was not buildup. I will be switching back to the Hydrate.</li>
    <li> My hair feels and smells great. Although it&#x27;s expensive, every time I try to be more frugal and use less expensive hair products I end up disappointed with the look and the feel of my hair and I come back to pureology. I have never been disappointed by their products.</li>
    <li> came highly recommended by the salon. didn&#x27;t do much for my hair even with regular use. don&#x27;t plan on even finish using the bottles</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my dry winter New England hair... this was recommended to me by my cosmotologist.  Its fantastic and I will buy again - Shipping could have been better. A little slow.</li>
    <li> Love the Pureology products.  Leaves hair shiny and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Efficient delivery. Product itself is perfect for my hair, which needs the smoothing without creating heaviness. First time user and likely will stick with this product for some time.</li>
    <li> This is the best for color treated hair ! I love this!!! I keep coming back to order more</li>
    <li> This set is amazing. My hair is no longer frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Product is awesome...for the price the quantity should be more.  I would buy bigger bottles but that price it outrageous!</li>
    <li> This brand is a high quality hair product. Leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love the product my hair washes smoothly.</li>
    <li> A must have!! I was fortunate to receive samples from my long time hairdresser.  I have semi wavy hair and live on the Hawaiian Islands where humid is a hair factor. smell great too!</li>
    <li> I have tried every product line for frizzy hair.  I do not have pretty curls, just that constant frizz that seems to expand when exposed to the elements.  This shampoo and conditioner is awesome.  Since my hair is also color treated, I was very surprised when I was able to go a full 3 months between coloring.  This is a first in a very long time!  Purology products are wonderful.  Although I am not a fan of the price, I can say you pay for what you get here.  A little goes a very long way and your hair will reap the rewards for this small investment!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when my salon stopped carrying the Pureology line.  This is a fantastic product and lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and if I use this everyday it seems to make my hair very flat.  It&#x27;s nice to use at least twice a week for me.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from fading.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair healthy even with dying it almost Sharon Osborne Red and keeping up with the roots every 3 weeks.  Plus blowing it out 2-3 times a week, hot iron 4-5, and numerous ponytails, etc. The shampoo smells great and lathers up luxuriously!  I&#x27;ll never change.  Plus free shipping saves me a long car drive or shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I like the volumizing shampoo from Pureology more...  However, the pureology brand is definately the way to go versus other cheaper brand.  Worth the extra money because less of it is used each time you wash.</li>
    <li> SMALLER BOTTLES BUT GOOD PRICE. SMELLS CLEAN AND HELPS REDUCE FRIZZ</li>
    <li> I could feel my hair after one use getting softer and keeping the color longer. A very good product at a good price</li>
    <li> I have used the Pureology Hydrate (purple bottle) up until now because I have thick, frizzy hair.  It worked very well, but smells very minty.  I thought I would try this for the obvious claim of &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; properties.  The smell is much better, but the product makes my hair feel very heavy, weighted down.  I did not use too much, as that could cause that feeling, and actually tried using even less to see if it made a difference.  It did not.  I will not even use the rest of these bottles.  I will definitely be switching back to the Pureology Hydrate instead.</li>
    <li> high quality hair product</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I had tried using a much-publicized drug store brand, but it stripped the color out of my hair. My hair dresser uses this product in the salon and suggested I try it for everyday use. It leaves my hair soft, but not limp, and very shiny. And the color stays true for a full 6 weeks. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it if you subject your hair to any kind of processing.  It&#x27;s available at a deep discount on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My daughter got a lot of hair, so in the morning or after shower she complained about her hair.  When I use comb, the hair was&lt;br /&gt;stock...  But, after using this  I am totally satisfied with it.... It is really smooth and smells good....&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I love it.</li>
    <li> I received the bottle of conditioner spread over the package (empty). I do not expect a  refund.</li>
    <li> I like that my color stays in longer, does not fade and there is shine, instead of getting dule as time goes on.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible! The Conditioner is not much better...I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo tangle my hair so that I could not comb or brush it and instead pulled our hunks of hair. I bought a Pureology Shampoo / Conditioner set from a salon years ago and really liked it. All I can figure is this particular place I bought from may be selling bogus product. I am afraid to use what I have bought.</li>
    <li> I love pureology products.  Great for my thick, long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! It helps hold my keratin treatment for almost 2 years. Ultimately saves me money. Make sure, when washing your hair, to use lots of water and soak your hair then, a little product will go a long way.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Don&#x27;t need to use but a drop of either the conditioner or shampoo.  Very expensive but if you don&#x27;t waste the product, a good buy.</li>
