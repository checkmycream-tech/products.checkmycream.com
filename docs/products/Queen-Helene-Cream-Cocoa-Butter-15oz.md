      <li>I love this stuff I&#x27;ve been buying it for yrs</li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>

      <li>The more you use it the better your skin feels.</li>
      <li>Mostly mineral oil.</li>
      <li>Makes a pretty good massage oil, though.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a lotion that is easy to spread.</li>
      <li>The scent is fairly light and reminds me more of chai latte than cocoa.</li>
      <li>NOTHING works better to keep my skin smooth and supple than this product.</li>
      <li>I love how smooth it glides on and how it melts into my skin like butta.</li>
      <li>Cyclists, listen up: this is an excellent chamois cream at a fraction the cost of other balms.</li>
      <li>and since I easily break out, I stay away from oily lotions.</li>
      <li>has the usu cocoa butter smell but not too strong as to make it nauseating.</li>
      <li>It worked great in about three weeks of daily use.</li>
      <li>My skin was smooth every day.</li>
      <li>... doesn&#x27;t smell good either.. smells old...</li>
      <li>but it would be good in the winter most likely.</li>
      <li>works great on long bike rides.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use this cream before and it works great for my dry skin</li>
      <li>It leaves you with lovely hydrated skin and it gives you a lovely natural glow.</li>
      <li>Also great on healing dry patches of skin.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers have mentioned that this is too oily, however if you do apply too much then your skin won&#x27;t be able to take all of the nutrients into your skin hence, leaving an oily residue.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a giant tub of it for a good price.  </li>
      <li>It would be cool if it could take eliminate those issues as well&lt;</li>
      <li>use it to soften my heels and feet bottoms for wearing sandals and at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;After bathing or showers Queen Helene CB Cream makes your skin soft and lends it a nice cocoa butter scented glow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream is very useful for dry skin and smells good like tropical smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a no-frills moisturizer that soaks into your skin fairly quickly and smooths the itchy scales, but until it -does- soak in (perhaps 2-3 minutes)</li>
      <li>i used this product when I was pregnant with my daughter in 2009.</li>
      <li>excellent all your round particularly in the winter.</li>
      <li>Good to put on if your skin is very, very dry.</li>
      <li>I am able to apply this product liberally because it is so affordable compared to the specialty products available in bicycle stores.it also washes out of the bicycle short without a problem.</li>
      <li>I love this natural, emollient product.</li>
      <li>I was going to the store and buying several other lotions for who knows why because I had just tested the perfect scar-fading, skin smoothing/moisturizing lotion on the market.</li>
      <li>It was the perfect alternative to the basic training sunscreen they issued us that always melted and ran down your face like water to get in your eyes and burn like acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It works just as good if not better and is much, much cheaper!!!  </li>
      <li>It really keeps their skin in good condition and keeps it from being dry and flaky.</li>
      <li>Very mild natural fragrance.</li>
      <li>This cream is very reasonably priced, however, I didn&#x27;t like the creme itself.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I guess I should&#x27;ve read that this product is a creme.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is soothing and it stays with you a while.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great alternative to Butt Butter for bicycle touring or maybe racing ( I don&#x27;t race so can&#x27;t comment).   much less expensive  works great on long bike rides.  Wish there was a much smaller package to carry along on the bike ( the jar and creme weigh in at over a pound). I&#x27;m training for a 500+ mile adventure.  so far no chafe, no problems.</li>
    <li> I started to use this a while back and stopped, I regretted it!  I&#x27;m 26 years old and people tell me I still look like I&#x27;m in Highschool.... thank you Queen Ellen... and if you use it as a face cream it will last for months on end... Plus you can use it all over your body and leaves you feeling super soft.</li>
    <li> This cream is very reasonably priced, however, I didn&#x27;t like the creme itself.  It spread on nicely but it was very oily.  Didn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well.  Felt very greasy and I was afraid it might stain my clothes.  Good to put on if your skin is very, very dry.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Been using it for years!  Makes skin look beautiful and youthful.  Especially good for skin on aging hands.</li>
    <li> I love the cocoa butter.  If you have a boo-boo on you skin this creme heals it immediately!</li>
    <li> Its horribly oily. My wife would not use this. It gets her clothes all oily. After i help her rub the back, my hands are so greasy, i have wash my hands 3 times or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself seems to do the job hydrating. But no, there are way better options out there.</li>
    <li> I love this natural, emollient product. I have sensitive skin and this is my go-to moisturizer, especially right out of the shower.  Goes on creamy (slightly oily) but will absorb into the skin after a bit.  Very mild natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> A little too greasy for me to love it but it would be good in the winter most likely.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very concentrated. It works great on winter skin to prevent it from drying out. Also great on healing dry patches of skin. It made my skin feel smoother too. Great product and a little goes a long ways. Cheap price for how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene cocoa butter creme is the best! I have tried so may other cremes and none of them helped my dry skin problem. Thank goodness for Queen Helene cocoa butter creme!</li>
    <li> pro: really hydrate the body especially if your skin is really dry and great smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: it&#x27;s butter creme so it&#x27;s very oily. use before bed and not before you go out because you will feel like you&#x27;re covered in oil</li>
    <li> Cyclists, listen up: this is an excellent chamois cream at a fraction the cost of other balms. This is far superior to any of the half dozen or so cycling specific creams (I have tried) on the market - including one from a Swiss firm. Try it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> My foot was peeling and I read on the internet that cocoa butter could possibly help. It worked great in about three weeks of daily use.</li>
    <li> SUPER!!! It is the best lotion for face and body. Makes skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I&#x27;ve been buying it for yrs it keeps my skin super soft after showers and baths. I&#x27;ve recently turned my boyfriend into a believer! The smell is absolutely wonderful! I love how smooth it glides on and how it melts into my skin like butta. I&#x27;ve stocked up on it so I can have gorgeous skin all spring and summer!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it everywhere and it keeps my skin soft and hydrated. The more you use it the better your skin feels. This is the only lotion I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product on the market and consulted numerous dermatologists for dry skin. This is the best I have found and when discussing the product with doctors and nurses, they confirm that is the best I can do for my condition. The best part is that it is also the most modestly priced.</li>
    <li> I almost never buy the same stuff over and over because I enjoy trying different products out in the market and I will use the entire bottle, but never love it enough to buy it again, but when I saw how freaking cheap this cocoa butter cream is I decide to try it and ever since I have go back and buy it over and over again!!! I love this product, some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I think it&#x27;s quite pleasant. I also have eczema, therefore, my skin is easily irritated and this lotion does not bother me at all!!!</li>
    <li> Firstly, Walmart (Canada) carries this product, in case you wish to save shipping+handling fees (it is oddly placed in the corner of a hair dryer and straightener and hair dye aisle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size plastic container you get looks small at first but it lasts a very long time with daily usage (2-3 months it lasted me)! The cream is very thick and resembles pre-made cake frosting in containers -because of this, it takes a long time to absorb in my skin. The scent is fairly light and reminds me more of chai latte than cocoa. It left my skin noticeably smoother and softer than prior to usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major issue I have with this product, the sole reason I gave it a lower rating, and why I won&#x27;t be repurchasing it, is that it gave me a harsh rash all over the inside of my thighs as well as my lower legs. My skin on these areas is more sensitive than other areas of my body, so I should&#x27;ve expected it, but I have used body butters with more questionable ingredients in them and have had no issues. I was able to use this product on my arms, belly, and buttocks with no issues. The product claims you can use it on your face, but my skin on my face is extremely sensitive and prone to break outs, so I didn&#x27;t bother trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very decent product for the price tag, but not recommended if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is has a light and pleasant cocoa fragrance.  It&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but it really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Great when you need a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have come to expect a lot from my Queen Helene products. But when compared to other cocoa butter lotions this is one of my least favorites.  The formula is incredibly greasy and after using the lotion I have to wash my hands to remove the greasy film. Another dislike is the number of ingredients in the lotion and that the number one ingredient is mineral oil no doubt that is what is causing the unpleasant greasiness. I really wanted to use this on my dry face during the winter which is made worse by hard water but because this product has mineral oil in it I dare not use it on my face. I was hoping that Queen Helene&#x27;s Cocoa Butter creme would be a solution but unfortunately it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one use I do have for this product is as a foot creme to apply to my cracked heels but it doesn&#x27;t really help with that either.  This product is not moisturizing. I like the scent of the lotion but that&#x27;s the only enjoyment I have gotten from this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking all over the internet for an all natural body butter/creme that I could purchase at an inexpensive price. Although, this is not completely all natural because of some of the ingredients that some people might stray away from like the dyes it is however, an extremely moisturizing body butter/creme that is fairly inexpensive. Some reviewers have mentioned that this is too oily, however if you do apply too much then your skin won&#x27;t be able to take all of the nutrients into your skin hence, leaving an oily residue. You only need a small amount and massage it in your skin. It leaves you with lovely hydrated skin and it gives you a lovely natural glow. Compared to the other butters you can buy that are organic/vegan/natural at over $10/8oz tub this one definitely hits the mark! You won&#x27;t be disappointed by trying this Cocoa Butter Creme out.</li>
    <li> I had no idea of the size and quantity. I was pleasantly surprised that it was larger than I had anticipated. Great price.</li>
    <li> Its creamy and moisturizes your skin but made it itchy. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I thought it was a waste and threw away the jar.</li>
    <li> I have used Queen Helene Cocoa Butter for years.  This is a great product!  I recommend it, highly to my friends!  Anna</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to keep my belly moisturized. It helps minimize itching and stretch marks that comes with a growing stomach.</li>
    <li> Bleck. Mostly mineral oil. Was trying to help with stretch marks but far too oily to use daily. Makes a pretty good massage oil, though.</li>
    <li> This is more of a cream that other brands but is not easily absorbed when applied to the skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while, it&#x27;s not the most quality cream in the world but it&#x27;s a giant tub of it for a good price.  Good to slather on my stretch marks (I am 6&#x27;4 so I have plenty).  Over the past year of using has worked to slowly reduce their appearance. I think after another 3 or 4 years they might just be faintly visible.  Sometimes I put a tiny dot of it on my hands before my aftershave and it will keep my face moisturized on days that are very dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face without it being quite watered down though because it&#x27;s pretty sticky.</li>
    <li> Cocoa butter cream works well for me as a lubricant for use with bicycle shorts. Effectively prevents chapping and chafing of the area of the skin  above the bicycle short chamois and the bicycle seat. I am able to apply this product liberally because it is so affordable compared to the specialty products available in bicycle stores.it also washes out of the bicycle short without a problem.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene is one of the most effective and cheapest brands out there for permanent skin improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff but it is very thick.  Best for winter.  I tried what another reviewer did and used this and put knee highs over my feet.  It is rather uncomfortable and it will make grease marks in your clothes.  So I wore old, crappy socks and tanktops.  My skin was so soft after those nightly treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so thick, I alternate between this and their normal body lotion.  After a few months, I see improvement in the blemishes and scars in my skin that will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and truly does alleviate dry skin all day.</li>
    <li> very thick,was expecting it to be ligther with a bit of a moisturiser. has the usu cocoa butter smell but not too strong as to make it nauseating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this a bit off of it&#x27;s normal use.  I use it as shamy-butter for my biking shorts and it works great!  I had major sores on my legs where it was contacting my seat under my riding shorts and using this generously before each ride on the sore areas cleaned-up the sores and no new ones have developed!</li>
    <li> pleased with this product</li>
    <li> You have to rub a lot to get it to absorb into your skin, but it lasts through a couple washings. This stuff keeps my fingers from getting cracked like they used to.</li>
    <li> love this product &amp;#34;CREAMY&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love it.  Feels so good when you apply it.</li>
    <li> All right, so I&#x27;ve basic training tested this cream. When I went to Ft. Sill, OK for my basic, I bought this cream at the Post Exchange. For the 10 weeks I was in basic enduring the harsh elements for I went in the blazing, hellish summer mind you, my skin remained scar-free and burn-free. My skin was smooth every day. In basic, showers are often limited. You get nasty, dirty, and sweaty and my skin is very sensitive. If I let sweat linger and dry up on my skin, my skin will break out. It will flare up and break out into thousands of red bumps that take forever to go away. This cream worked like sunscreen for me. It was the perfect alternative to the basic training sunscreen they issued us that always melted and ran down your face like water to get in your eyes and burn like acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream every day and I mean &amp;#34;erreh&#x27; day.&amp;#34; In the morning after my first shower, and in the evening after my evening shower. When I graduated basic, I went away from it when I ran out of it. I didn&#x27;t go back for awhile. I was going to the store and buying several other lotions for who knows why because I had just tested the perfect scar-fading, skin smoothing/moisturizing lotion on the market. It&#x27;s like the hydrogen peroxide of skincare. It&#x27;s stupid cheap and works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone black, white, mixed, hispanic, asian, it doesn&#x27;t matter because Queen Helene will take care of you. Now, let me mention one last thing. This jar is different from the larger version. I don&#x27;t know why it is but the texture is different. The big bottle is a little more watery and weaker in texture. It also doesn&#x27;t work as effective as this jar. Why? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just telling you what I&#x27;ve tested. So I recommend using only this product even if you want to use it all over your body. It is really good and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought it again last month because I was getting menstrual bumps that were leaving ugly scars. I went back to my routine of applying this lotion two times a day after every shower, and those scars are gone. I will forever buy this product. Feel free to use it with other scar-removing oils and creams you purchase. It&#x27;ll just make the treatments more effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best cocoa butter on the market and I would walk 10 miles uphill in the snow to purchase it. NOTHING works better to keep my skin smooth and supple than this product.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed, hard to find</li>
    <li> Not for ladies only, my feet have so smoothed out that my lovely lady is after me to get one for her.</li>
    <li> We use this on our kids after baths and they love it. It is like a spa treatment. It really keeps their skin in good condition and keeps it from being dry and flaky. It smells awesome. It could be just a slight bit thicker but it works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Father of Quads.</li>
    <li> It is not 100% cocoa butter as the ingredients list implys.  It moisturizers nicely, however it smells odd somewhat medicinal and animalish.  It gave me a rash too. Therefore, I am no longer using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this cream before and it works great for my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But heres what happened, it didnt have a seal inside the container... so it leaked inside the shipping box... oil everywhere!!! I&#x27;ve used this cream before but this looks nothing like what i used... it looked like a big chunk of fat... and oil dripping like a bbq stake... its wasnt creamy at all... doesn&#x27;t smell good either.. smells old... I bought it because of the price.. and now my money just went down the drain... i cant use this... i rather drive to rite-aid and pay few dollar extra :-/</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona...our water is VERY HARD and drying.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful &#x27;summer scented&#x27; massage cream and more.&lt;br /&gt;My son has sensitive skin.  When his little hand&#x27;s starts peeling or cracking the cream at bedtime heals them up fast.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to soften my heels and feet bottoms for wearing sandals and at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;After bathing or showers Queen Helene CB Cream makes your skin soft and lends it a nice cocoa butter scented glow.&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite over the counter cure for post menopausal dryness.&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is this is a heavy duty cream and slightly greasy so put it on lightly and rub it in well unless you&#x27;re doing a heavy treatment.  A little goes a long way so the big tub lasts a long time..which is good because it is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Great cocoa butter smell.  It&#x27;s nice and thick and feels like it stays in your skin.  Like a day at the beach!</li>
    <li> this is the best cream</li>
    <li> Red spots appeared and my belly started to itch after I used this product for a week. Probably some ingredient in it is causing the allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I bought this to stave off winter dryness without resorting to pure petroleum jelly.  In that respects, this product is what I would consider a consumer reports style &#x27;best buy.&#x27;  For around $5 you&#x27;ve got a tub of moisturizer to slather on after a shower or before bed that will alleviate that sensation you have woken up and been transformed into a snakeskin handbag for 3 months of every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a no-frills moisturizer that soaks into your skin fairly quickly and smooths the itchy scales, but until it -does- soak in (perhaps 2-3 minutes) it will leave you with an oily residue.  DO NOT use it on your face!!!  It is far too heavy.  But DO use it on your lips to help rehydrate them before you hit them with lipstick or chapstick.  I slather it on my hands before bed at night, but not in the morning as I hate that greasy residue even though it is gone within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like cocoa butter because that is what it is.  Cocoa butter is not my favorite scent, but this cream works so effectively I have learned to live with it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell -bad- ... just cocoa-buttery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this product because, unlike the other products I have dished out gobs of money to buy which leave my skin dry or cause it to erupt in either a rash or pimples, this one does the job ... and for dirt cheap.  I spent $5.50 on skin cream this winter and never once did my hands or lips crack, whereas most other winters I have spent upwards of $40 or more and still been left with painful splits.  It&#x27;s a good, no-frills product for people like me with better things to do with our money.</li>
    <li> This is packaged well, Nice and creamy. Easy to apply and smells really good. I am shocked at the price, however, because I just bought this yesterday at my local dollar store for a dollar for the 4.8oz. size jar.</li>
    <li> It does soften rough skin, I mean my heels and moistures my body so well that I could not believe it costs so little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture is thick and appears a bit greasy but penetrates the skin and I could not find grease spots on my clothes, will update if find any.&lt;br /&gt;For my heels I put on socks after applying cream  and it took care of my rough feet in two nights. See it for yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says it relieves discomfort of itchy, stretched skin during and after pregnancy . I would not know from my experience, just heads up. It would be cool if it could take eliminate those issues as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
    <li> I use this in place of much more expense creams sold for cyclist (Assos Chamois Cream, Paceline Products Chamois Butt&#x27;r Creme and others).  It works just as good if not better and is much, much cheaper!!!  You can&#x27;t stick it in your travel bag to re-apply on long rides.... but it&#x27;s great for the start of the ride.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried vaseline and chamoisbuttr and while they worked, I really had to glob it on.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of petrochemicals in my vulva and with both I would get the sensation of &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; high in my urethra after use.  Never had that with Queen Helene.  Have only used up to a 3 hour ride though.  Very happy with the purchase and and results - no greasy feeling at ALL.  no residue in my shorts.  nothing leaking onto the saddle and amount needed is miniscule compared to Chamois buttr and vaseline.  I&#x27;m a convert.  I also use Enzo&#x27;s ButtonHole for longer rides.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and greasy but it works. If you need extra moisturization that doesn&#x27;t later make your skin even drier, then this is the product. I use it everywhere including my face. If it feels too greasy at first, simply pat a little off. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of face moisturizers and they always end up failing me in the end. I have to switch around a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used the Queen Helene Cocoa Butter lotion in the 32oz bottle and I love it!!!! I have used this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on your face, as well as, all over your body. I have been in the Cosmetology field for years and I have found that this product works better than most expensive salon products. It will not clog pores. It is non-greasy and you only need a very small amount to do a lot of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I am ordering the Creme in a jar.  I look forward to getting the same results as I did with the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed. I am ordering from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find this product in any of our local stores.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this for me. I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It works on my 65 year old skin. I am always getting compliments on how well my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/16/2013: I ordered the Creme and was a little disappointed. If I use a very small amount on my face and rub it in good and wait for awhile it is not too oily. However, I will continue to buy the lotion like I have for years. It isn&#x27;t oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am using the Creme on my feet and it makes your feet very soft. Put it on and then put on socks and go to bed. The next morning my feet are very soft. I have also used the Creme as a night creme when you want someting more moisturizing. On second thought, I may just continue to buy the creme for these uses.</li>
    <li> I have stopped using this cream due to the chemicals used.  I now make my own, with organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by an ENT doctor who was not certain it were still available..Amazon listed it and I tried it.  It helps not only my post surgery ear, but also my hands and face.  It is not greasy-just very creamy.  I think it smells slightly like coconut which is refreshing.</li>
    <li> i used this product when I was pregnant with my daughter in 2009. and it is thick and oily but worked very well on my expanding belly. it did not prevent stretch marks though. I still have alot. all though it comes with the package deal of being a mother. for some mothers anyway. and I am so happy I found this product on amazon. because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. and since me and my husband are trying to conceive again I will be needing this product once more. wish me luck everyone.</li>
    <li> I figure I do 50,000 pedal strokes per week on the bike.  Even with decent bicycling shorts this can cause a lot of chaffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sort of things to reduce this chaffing.  Some specialty biking products are very expensive, so I tend to skip or skimp on them; others are smelly, greasy or otherwise unpleasant.  The Cocoa Butter Creme works well, is inexpensive, has a mild, pleasant odor and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is not to like?</li>
    <li> Great product and great on skin in the winter!</li>
    <li> love it. This cream is very useful for dry skin and smells good like tropical smell. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I guess I should&#x27;ve read that this product is a creme. It&#x27;s more like a body butter than a lotion. I was hoping for more of a lotion that is easy to spread. The creme is thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily. It takes awhile to sink into the skin. However, once I&#x27;ve covered my legs and arms, I really like the moisture. I don&#x27;t use it for my way because it&#x27;s too thick for my face. I feel like I&#x27;m putting thick oil on my face and since I easily break out, I stay away from oily lotions. I really do like it. I just wish it was easier to spread.</li>
    <li> excellent all your round particularly in the winter. Melts right in and soothes dry cracked skin.Nice scent and no greasy residue.</li>
