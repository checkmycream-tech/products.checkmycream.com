      <li>I have already noticed improved skin texture and slightly better mobility in my knees if nothing else...</li>
      <li>I love this oil.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>Very clean product.</li>

      <li>Mild taste, and full of good stuff for my body.</li>
      <li>Love it see a huge difference in my skin and health will reorder shortyly as i use it alot.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference health wise.</li>
      <li>Its a magical oil you will feel body changes after the first couple of days!</li>
      <li>We use the 5 Seed Oil every day in our morning smoothie and really enjoy the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>Eighty-nine year old mother seems a bit more energetic and with it; our skin is beginning to appear more hydrated.  </li>
      <li>Having a Prime account saved me some significant shipping cash v/s Activation...</li>
      <li>was not sick when I began taking Panaseeda</li>
      <li>My skin, which is always  very dry during the winter has also improved greatly.  </li>
      <li>put that on its own line because I wanted to signify the profound importance and impact of that statement.  </li>
      <li>Not only do I feel better in many ways (including my joints), and see the difference in my skin</li>
      <li>Taste was okay which is a big deal for anything healthy.</li>
      <li>The very first time I took it, I could feel a difference from within.</li>
      <li>Heck, I was experiencing improvement the first week!  </li>
      <li>Thanks Activation Products for a good and solid product.</li>
      <li>Most of the products were through Amazon and a couple directly from Activation.  </li>
      <li>(smile),</li>
      <li>So simple, yet effective.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment, very well packaged.</li>
      <li>I combine all the products - except Ease in a couple of ounces of water and swallow fast!  </li>
      <li>I hope to see activation products work on a better auto ship program and hope they contact me back when they do.  </li>
      <li>The first bottle had a stronger taste and I noticed an immediate improvement in my energy and mood.  </li>
      <li>I love this product just ordered my fourth shipment.</li>
      <li>But for me, I cannot say that any actual &#x27;symptoms&#x27; have been alleviated.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle</li>
      <li>For the price I paid, I really wanted to believe!</li>
      <li>I use the Panaseeda 5 Oil Blend in so many different ways.  </li>
      <li>I am hopeful that by administering it properly I will get even better results.</li>
      <li>but after 1-2 days of this oil you will have moist skin and lips again, sleep better, and the taste is almost similar to a butter like a almond butter after taste, so</li>
      <li>Tried a few bottles and it tasted good but never noticed any benefits.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, kinda messy.</li>
      <li>Serves my purpose, taste good, felt improvement physically with my second bottle.</li>
      <li>It is somewhat high in price, but it is also worth it.</li>
      <li>Takes time to know what positive results are found.</li>
      <li>it!~~~I wanted to use the wonderful blue glass bottle for something else when I thought it was empty, but it had a LOT of sediment in there that I should have taken as part of my daily dose.</li>
      <li>In the past three weeks, I have ordered most of the Activation Products currently available:  </li>
      <li>lot of products don&#x27;t do what they claim they would, this product claims too little, it is nice to see a product deliver what it should.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now finally able to move forward in my life, a possibility that was a distant fantasy for me just a year ago.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now finally able to move forward in my life, a possibility that was a distant fantasy for me just a year ago.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just to taste this product you straight away get a psychic hit of euphoria communicates the depth of what this product is.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way this oil tastes and it&#x27;s a good way to consume healthy oil that is good for your health. I use it in my smoothies mmmm..</li>
    <li> Sorry, I have no idea how it&#x27;s benefitting me, but it tastes good.  I have 1 Tbsp of this oil (plus olive oil &amp; cider vinegar) on my salad daily.  Make sure you shake it well before pouring.  Sometimes there is &amp;#34;sludge&amp;#34; at the bottom of the &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
    <li> We use the 5 Seed Oil every day in our morning smoothie and really enjoy the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;We also use it often in our salad dressing with great results.</li>
    <li> I use the Panaseeda 5 Oil Blend in so many different ways.  I use it both externally and internally.  It has done wonders for my dry skin.  The little moles on my face are disappearing.  My skin has a nice glow to it.  It gives me good energy and clarity of mind.  I have Haschimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis and have found this product to be very helpful.  It is very potent.  It is pleasant tasting.  I never want to be without it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find one thing that I dislike about this oil.  Thanks Activation Products for a good and solid product.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I buy it by the carton. I take a tsp twice a day with food, plus I use it to make salad dressing. Mild taste, and full of good stuff for my body. Not cheap, but worth it -- you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Its a magical oil you will feel body changes after the first couple of days! I love it just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Nice light taste - I add it to my morning smoothie.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. The very first time I took it, I could feel a difference from within. It does so many things to help you with your personal problems that one would have to actually purchase it to see. It seems as if any problem you have, this product can help you to get better from it. It is somewhat high in price, but it is also worth it. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a (5) is because it taste so bad. (smile), never-the-less it works really well for whatever illness you have.</li>
    <li> In the past three weeks, I have ordered most of the Activation Products currently available:  Ease Magnesium, Ocean Alive, Panaseeda 5 Seed Oil Blend, Black Cumin Oil, Flax Seed Oil and Coriander Seed Oil.  Most of the products were through Amazon and a couple directly from Activation.  Having a Prime account saved me some significant shipping cash v/s Activation...huge plus!  Because I&#x27;ve had the products dribble in over the weeks and now have them all, it&#x27;s tough to determine which products are effective.  See the below photo - those are the products I use daily.  Maybe that&#x27;s overkill....just like to get done since they aren&#x27;t exactly delicious.  I combine all the products - except Ease in a couple of ounces of water and swallow fast!  It&#x27;s too early to evaluate the effectiveness of each individual product since they are combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease is wonderful...stops my foot pain and muscle pain for several hours.  I also use a few ounces in my bath for all over relief. I had coma type sleep for a few nights - sweet!  There&#x27;s a detoxing effect with this combination....liver, digestive system and lymphatic system that can be draining.  It&#x27;s probably best to take most of the products later in the day, or don&#x27;t ingest as many as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, at this point, I am impressed with the bottling and high quality ingredients Activation uses.  I expect to have more to say after longer term use.</li>
    <li> Doe seem to increase energy a bit</li>
    <li> Not sure how this will make me feel. Perhaps not consistent enough.</li>
    <li> Just to taste this product you straight away get a psychic hit of euphoria communicates the depth of what this product is.  I stir it in to morning smoothie &amp; use with lemon juice on salads.  Very clean product.</li>
    <li> This product is as good as it is advertised.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; smooth. Taste was okay which is a big deal for anything healthy. Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference health wise. But then I do a lot of things. This combo is an interesting one with many health benefits.</li>
    <li> This product does your body good, period.</li>
    <li> Helping my brother in his fight against stage 4 cancer.  We can really tell a difference in his energy when he takes this</li>
    <li> My wife and I are using this mixed with Oceans Alive 2.0. Not the greatest taste, but feeling more energy.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is good for digestive disorders. It helps heal the bowel.</li>
    <li> I feel great when I am taking this but unfortunately before delivery I have to pay  £25+ extra on extras which makes it very expensive for me,</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It tastes excellent.</li>
    <li> I found this the best oil ever. You can smell the purity and it tastes smooth and delicious. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be amazing for good health . Should be one of your first choices to maintain good health .</li>
    <li> purchase this on my uncle&#x27;s recommendation and he loves it.</li>
    <li> To early to pass judgement.  My first bottle</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with Chron&#x27;s Disease and I wasn&#x27;t getting any better then someone told me about this oil. About two weeks after I started the oil I had a colonoscopy the doctor could not explain all the healing that was occurring inside me. I have been slowly coming off all my medications and I&#x27;m still getting better. The doctors can&#x27;t explain it and will not admit that it is the oil.</li>
    <li> too soon to know if the 5 blend oil will help my health</li>
    <li> Love it see a huge difference in my skin and health will reorder shortyly as i use it alot.</li>
    <li> you will feel the difference, finally a product that works.  I also had to deal with the company&#x27;s customer service due to a failure of UPS and Amazon and was very pleased with dealing with Laura at activation products.  Laura is a cut above the rest when it comes to customer service and activation products is lucky to have her but their product seems to be top quality too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its cold here in my neck of the woods, and chapped lips are everywhere but after 1-2 days of this oil you will have moist skin and lips again, sleep better, and the taste is almost similar to a butter like a almond butter after taste, so quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of products don&#x27;t do what they claim they would, this product claims too little, it is nice to see a product deliver what it should.  My only complaint is probably your only hesitation and it is I wish we got a little more for the money or a price break or a better deal if you had auto ship each month.  I hope to see activation products work on a better auto ship program and hope they contact me back when they do.  At which time I will increase rating by another star.</li>
    <li> I have had a host of issues for over 10 years now; autonomic neuropathy manifesting with symptoms of chronic and often debilitating nausea, moderate to severe IBS, and atrial tachycardia (rapid heart rate) with accompanying heat/activity intolerance.  There is no cure and conventional medicines have done very little in the way of symptom management.  After trying just about anything and everything, I had all but given up on leading a normal life.  In one last ditch effort, I tried this against my better judgement, especially considering I&#x27;d fallen for many other &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products in my search for something to ease my suffering and nothing had made enough of a significant difference to justify the price-tag that accompanied it.  The only two things that even seemed to help at all were ginger caplets for the nausea and coconut oil for overall health.  Still, these alone were not making enough of an impact and I was desperate so I researched Panaseeda long and hard and found it promising enough to pay the price and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has changed my life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put that on its own line because I wanted to signify the profound importance and impact of that statement.  When I say that, I&#x27;m not exaggerating or sensationalizing.  I have no vested interest in the company that manufactures this product, nor am I getting paid to say it or even to leave a favorable review.  Plain and simple, if even one person can get the same results that I have and ease the pain and suffering they&#x27;re going through, then I would be shamefully remiss if I didn&#x27;t relate what this has meant for me.  It hasn&#x27;t just eased my issues, it has given me my life back!  In the span of 2 months, I went from feeling permanently ill and debilitated to only having occasional but very manageable complaints.  Heck, I was experiencing improvement the first week!  My digestive problems have vastly improved to just minor upsets and my heart rate has come down enough that mere daily activity doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling utterly wiped out.  I&#x27;m now finally able to move forward in my life, a possibility that was a distant fantasy for me just a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So are there any negatives?  I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it smells like pine tar and tastes what I imagine pine tar would taste like.  I pinch my nose to take it and wash it down with several mouthfuls of water, swishing each one to get the residual oil out of my mouth.  It&#x27;s gross, but that&#x27;s a very, very, very infinitesimal unpleasantness compared with the benefits and healing that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This together with a continued daily regiment of coconut oil and ginger capsules has given me back control over my life, and I pray they will continue to make it for the rest of my lifetime!ily activity doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling utterly wiped out.

It&#x27;s gross, but that&#x27;s a very, very, very infinitesimal unpleasantness compared with the benefits and healing that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This together with a continued daily regiment of coconut oil and ginger capsules has given me back control over my life, and I pray they will continue to make it for the rest of my lifetime!</li>
    <li> Love the oil.  The biggest notice I experienced is that my menopausal dryness is gone!  My skin, which is always  very dry during the winter has also improved greatly.  I will use this oil for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I like this.  So simple, yet effective.</li>
    <li> a little expensive product but if it does half of what the company claims,well worth it? time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this diligently since I got it, even set an alarm on my phone so I would not forget it and measure out the prescribed amount every 12 hours.  For the price I paid, I really wanted to believe! But after finishing the bottle, I have to admit, I feel nothing but ripped off.  While the taste is more than palatable, I can only say, the bottle is empty.  I realize the &#x27;promises&#x27; are actually quite vague, They state you will &#x27;feel so much better&#x27;...  but I was actually sold on the testimonials. But for me, I cannot say that any actual &#x27;symptoms&#x27; have been alleviated.  For me to buy any more, at this price, I would have to see something tangible.  I feel the same as when I started.</li>
    <li> Takes time to know what positive results are found.</li>
    <li> Andreas Seed Oil is certainly a Natural Seed Oil and does the purpose of natural healing.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for several months now and I LOVE IT.  Not only do I feel better in many ways (including my joints), and see the difference in my skin - i am also totally impressed with the freshness of the oil.  I have never had anything like it!  I HIGHLY recommend this product, both for the quality of the product and because of the integrity of the company itself.</li>
    <li> I love this product just ordered my fourth shipment. Serves my purpose, taste good, felt improvement physically with my second bottle. Will continue to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality. Quick shipment, very well packaged.</li>
    <li> OK.....BUT VERY...VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I just don&#x27;t like taking supplements twice a day. I just have not a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I know Andreas from Rawsome.  Thrilled to find he has been able to have a pressing process engineered that is producing this quality of oil.  Can scarce believe it does not become rancid at room temperature for up to two years!!  Love the therapeutic qualities, organic and non-GMO commitment of the Panaseeda blend.  Delicious and therapeutic.  Husband, mother and I are beginning our second bottle.  Husband&#x27;s chronic colitis has not recurred when taking the oil.  Hoping that continues.  Eighty-nine year old mother seems a bit more energetic and with it; our skin is beginning to appear more hydrated.  Eager to see overall benefits after a month or two.</li>
    <li> The first bottle had a stronger taste and I noticed an immediate improvement in my energy and mood.  This second bottle&#x27;s inside cap seal was not on tight and the oil does not taste the same.</li>
    <li> Love the taste of this oil and I&#x27;m pleased to be able to take healthy oils without fear of them going rancid and causing health issues.  Love to add them to salad dressing too.</li>
    <li> Tried a few bottles and it tasted good but never noticed any benefits. rather expensive.</li>
    <li> I just got my second bottle and thought I&#x27;d post my observations, some not mentioned in other reviews. I am really hopeful that it can have all the beneficial results mentioned so am giving it a chance. I have already noticed improved skin texture and slightly better mobility in my knees if nothing else...but there are environmental factors in my situation that can be contributing to that improvement as well, so I got another bottle to see what happens. ~~~VERY IMPORTANT~~~Really Shake it up vigorously every time you use it!~~~I wanted to use the wonderful blue glass bottle for something else when I thought it was empty, but it had a LOT of sediment in there that I should have taken as part of my daily dose. I was not shaking it vigorously enough.The first bottle of oil was transparent and brown &amp; rather bitter tasting. This 2nd bottle (after REALLY shaking it up) has opaque green colored oil in it and the taste is less unpleasant than the 1st bottle. I am hopeful that by administering it properly I will get even better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panaseeda for more than a year.  I put it in my morning protein shake and don&#x27;t taste it at all.  I also love to use it on my salad rather than conventional dressings and personally think it tastes fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I was not sick when I began taking Panaseeda so I can&#x27;t give a rave review of  deathbed to health.... I take this because of the healing properties and I want to STAY well.  I am 65 and have absolutely nothing wrong with my health which is amazing to others who take a myriad of prescriptions and have debilitating issues.  I believe it comes from avoiding processed and packaged foods,  sugars, breads etc. and also taking holistic natural products that enhance the body.  I am going to also try this companys Oceans Alive phytoplankton and will write a review when I have used it for a while.  PS...product is less expensive when purchased from manufacturer.  Look it up online.</li>
    <li> It is average not sure about benefits</li>
    <li> This Panaseeda 5 seed oil blend is very effective. I recommend that you try it.</li>
    <li> There was not enough infomation about what the product is suppose to do. It is different then other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from graying</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 days and I feel better already- just overall. I have more energy and feel great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing health and mood boost!</li>
    <li> Nice product taste good</li>
    <li> Good stuff, kinda messy. I store it on top of a plastic lid off a can of protein powder so it doesn&#x27;t make the shelf oily.</li>
    <li> Quality product and the taste is not offensive.</li>
