      <li>Product smells nice and leaves you clean and energized.</li>

      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t too much to rate, since it is just soap, but it smells nice and can be purchased via subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>Nothing special here.  </li>
      <li>All is good in his teenage</li>
      <li>As much as ive purchased you gotta know we love this.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is really cool.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find this in stores for some reason but thanks to the Amazon add-on program, I can get these conveniently now.</li>
      <li>its good enough to make me not smell like a s</li>
      <li>And the smell it gives the body lasts fairly enough for a day, which is good.</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh scent, all around clean</li>
      <li>Smells good and the odor lasts long</li>
      <li>My favorite soup so far</li>
      <li>It takes me some time to find the right shower gel for me.</li>
      <li>keep the skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The hot water will amplify the smell.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I am not a sports fan.</li>
      <li>My boys love not only the smell</li>
      <li>Great long lasting smell!  </li>
      <li>Also Im not a fan of the smell, i mean if you like lemony citrusy smells then this one is great, but I dont</li>
      <li>Great for tweens who are too old for the fruity smelling kids&#x27; body wash, but too young for the cologne baths that the other Axe products smell like.</li>
      <li>This shower gel is very good, especially for athletes or people with high performance everyday activities.</li>
      <li>As a shower gel, it&#x27;s great... has a sporty fresh scent (a bit artificial in nature, but not unpleasantly so)...</li>
      <li>This doesnt really work well as a body wash, doesn&#x27;t sud up</li>
      <li>and the scent is really nothing to be desired.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very itchy...</li>
      <li>My son really likes this because he can use it for his body and his hair.  </li>
      <li>practices at least three times per week with matches twice a week and often on weekends, so he uses a good bit of body wash (and also uses Axe shampoo) after matches...</li>
      <li>Our active teenage son is fairly picky about the shower products he uses, and he likes the way this body wash works and smells on</li>
      <li>I found the other AXE products more helpful.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the flavor is really unique, so I am planning on sending one of these to my brother back in Europe ^^</li>
      <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as my regular shampoo...</li>
      <li>definitely will but more in the future !</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>All the males in my household love to use it after an intense workout session or any other physical activity.</li>
      <li>Though they liked the scent and how it cleans, it is VERY THICK in viscosity.</li>
      <li>I use it regularly and it really makes you feel refreshed.</li>
      <li>So far no allergic reactions, breakout or anything else.</li>
      <li>However, if your skin is sensitive, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>Lather your head first and work your way down.</li>

<li> and i have used other axe body washes and they do, but this one for some reason does not that much in my opinion.. strange, and it even comes out the bottle a little slower and gets stuck in the cap and gets dry.. Had to clean it a few times...</li>
<li> All round a high quality product.</li>
<li> But the body washes dont seem to last as long as the sprays.</li>
<li> The issue here is that only a minimal amount came out since there wasn&#x27;t additional product above it (hear weight) to push the viscous product down.</li>
<li> I BUY THE DRY SPRAY</li>
<li> a small squirt about the size of a quarter is about all he needs, so this size bottle lasts a while -- even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> little bit goes a very long way...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I surprise my husband with the body wash he loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even think about using this. I had to go to a dermatologist after using this for a week. Just don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Our active teenage son is fairly picky about the shower products he uses, and he likes the way this body wash works and smells on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He practices at least three times per week with matches twice a week and often on weekends, so he uses a good bit of body wash (and also uses Axe shampoo) after matches... otherwise his mom won&#x27;t let him back in the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a very long way... a small squirt about the size of a quarter is about all he needs, so this size bottle lasts a while -- even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey - it&#x27;s his body wash and he likes how it works and also the fragrance of it, so I guess that is all that matters. No irritation and no dryness for him. All is good in his teenage world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our son definitely recommends this Axe Sports Blast Shower Gel based on his experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> shower and go.  great price.  keep the skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Like most of Axe&#x27;s smells, this shower gel has a good scent to it as well. My boyfriend loved it when I gave it to him.</li>
    <li> great scent! always like Axe, never let me down once! definitely will but more in the future !lol lol lol</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this body wash and was very happy to see it on Amazon! Delivery time was excellent!</li>
    <li> sports blast is actually a shower gel I do legitimately prefer over others.</li>
    <li> This Axe Shower Gel, Sports Blast smells real good, my son uses it as fast as it is brought in the house. So far no allergic reactions, breakout or anything else.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells wonderful and makes my hubby&#x27;s skin feel good.</li>
    <li> AXE Sport Blast 2-in-1 Shower Gel + Shampoo is one of the best shower gels out there for strenuous physical activity. All the males in my household love to use it after an intense workout session or any other physical activity. Not sure if this works as well as a shampoo though. I wasn&#x27;t able to find this in stores for some reason but thanks to the Amazon add-on program, I can get these conveniently now.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of shower gel in this bottle.  IT also has a nice smell to it so my husband smells nice.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting smell!  My boys love not only the smell but it helps them feel refreshed after using! They love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite soup so far</li>
    <li> This doesnt really work well as a body wash, doesn&#x27;t sud up and the scent is really nothing to be desired.  Look elsewhere for shower gel.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to rate, since it is just soap, but it smells nice and can be purchased via subscribe and save. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It takes me some time to find the right shower gel for me. I love the smell of this flavor and it lathers well.</li>
    <li> I love Axe, I even use my husbands own. Smells nice and lathers well, so I will be buying more</li>
    <li> This shower gel is very good, especially for athletes or people with high performance everyday activities. And the smell it gives the body lasts fairly enough for a day, which is good.

HOWEVER, the flavor is really unique, so I am planning on sending one of these to my brother back in Europe ^^</li>
    <li> As a shower gel, it&#x27;s great... has a sporty fresh scent (a bit artificial in nature, but not unpleasantly so)... but the shampoo aspect?  I was kind of underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as my regular shampoo... it left it feeling like it was coated in some sort of polymer protective housing or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll scrub my body grime with it any day.  Great stuff for that... and a great smell for washing after a work out.</li>
    <li> Needed one shower gel.......always used axe.....no time for choosing...and found this on and bought....its good enough to make me not smell like a s***!!!</li>
    <li> Great for tweens who are too old for the fruity smelling kids&#x27; body wash, but too young for the cologne baths that the other Axe products smell like.</li>
    <li> I Love Axe. Do not use this!! It&#x27;s bad for skin!! My has broke out it&#x27;s very itchy... I am not impressed with this product:(</li>
    <li> The product was great</li>
    <li> Good price for the size bottle.  The smell is great!  My son and husband use this daily and both like it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Then again most Axe products smell good. I recieved the product very quickly, and I am very satisfied. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and son used this. Though they liked the scent and how it cleans, it is VERY THICK in viscosity. That makes it difficult to get the end of the product out of the bottle. Both complained to me about it. When I say the end of the product I am talking about 1-to-2&amp;#34; of product at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we turned the bottles up-side down in the showers to let gravity help. The issue here is that only a minimal amount came out since there wasn&#x27;t additional product above it (hear weight) to push the viscous product down.</li>
    <li> Lather your head first and work your way down. Smells good. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this and it actually came with a broken cap, the grey part in the middle of the cap was missing and no where in the box, which means someone actually put it in the box knowing its state... I did write about it in the packaging/delivery feed back but no response as yet.. Pretty shocked that someone would do that. Also Im not a fan of the smell, i mean if you like lemony citrusy smells then this one is great, but I dont so that was the second problem, and the third problem is i like my body wash to foam up quite a bit and i have used other axe body washes and they do, but this one for some reason does not that much in my opinion.. strange, and it even comes out the bottle a little slower and gets stuck in the cap and gets dry.. Had to clean it a few times...Not my cup of tea...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am not a sports fan. I&#x27;m just not good at them. Because of this, this did not work out for me. I found the other AXE products more helpful. If you like sports, though, this is the thing for you!</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh scent, all around clean, what more could you want?  Recommend and would buy this shower gel again.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product, price, and professional staff. Shipment on time and on target!</li>
    <li> AXE is an outstanding product I use all there products.</li>
    <li> My son really likes this because he can use it for his body and his hair.  And the smell is not overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here.  No bone chilling blast, no great lather, no babes jumping all over me.  Seriously, just an average product, not great not bad.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again unless a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. It&#x27;s cheap, effective, and smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and refreshing fell after every shower. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I switched to Axe products about 1 ½ years ago because of a sale at Target.  That was it, I was hooked.  Even though since the brand was introduced I resisted because I used a cheaper product.  Now I would not go back.  I use the shower soaps, deodorant, and spray.  All round a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell. love it</li>
    <li> This was a great value and very good product, Gets the job done and very refreshing clean. Will Get more....</li>
    <li> smell good, easy to use. great for men who don&#x27;t want to carry a lot of things to the shower</li>
    <li> My son loves the scent</li>
    <li> In the shower it smells good. The hot water will amplify the smell. But the body washes dont seem to last as long as the sprays.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is really cool. It is one of best choice. I use it regularly and it really makes you feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> As much as ive purchased you gotta know we love this.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Shower gel that eliminates the need for both body wash and shampoo.  Have purchased on multiple occasions.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a good shampoo at all. Just an average body wash and your skin may break out a little. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> This product foams up with a great lather and cleans the ol body up good while making it smell good</li>
    <li> Perfect for efficient shower takers like myself. Works well on my hair and body</li>
    <li> I USE ALL THEIR PRODUCTS  I BUY THE DRY SPRAY IT DOES THE JOB I HAVE TO BUY MANY BECAUSE MY GRAND DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES  IT AND SHES 18 WHEN SHE VISITS SHE HIT MY RESERVES FROM SHAMPOOS TO BODY WASHS SHE A COLLEGE GIRL AND SHE SAY SHE BROKE LOL SEEMS WHAT I LIKE SHE ENJOYS ALL SO</li>
    <li> Smells good and the odor lasts long</li>
    <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the sent when I ordered it, but my husband and I both really liked it.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.... He likes it thank u he said it smells good smells like citrus he said</li>
    <li> Product smells nice and leaves you clean and energized. However, if your skin is sensitive, don&#x27;t buy it. Left my arms pimply and scaly. Not a good feel.</li>
    <li> What can I say - this one has the &amp;#34;Axe Effect&amp;#34; with my wife :)</li>
