      <li>They are so cute and PERFECT the only problem is that I can&#x27;t get my old one out and put these new ones in 😢</li>
      <li>They fit just right.</li>

      <li>but i lose them quick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got my order and was not pleased HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY THIS PURCHASE IS CRAP I WANT MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> Cool piercings.. Com in many random colors great for my lip piercing</li>
    <li> I got tongue rings instead of eyebrow rings...smdh</li>
    <li> I only got total 19 and 2of them had only one ball on it</li>
    <li> I love them. They came as expected and even though some were duplicates they are still worth it! I use them in my rook piercing not in my eyebrow but definitely worth the money! And they came three weeks ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> The balls are braking</li>
    <li> I ordered eyebrow rings and I received belly rings instead , not at all what I expected smh .</li>
    <li> I received them and they were not 16g they were super small</li>
    <li> i wish there was more designs i got a lot of them that were the same. but it was ok and priced good!</li>
    <li> Loved them!!! Great packaging and speedy delivery. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> These eyebrow rings are really cool! I got them for my uncle for Christmas and I just know he will love them. Lots of different designs and colors! Took a little to get here but not too long. It was def worth the wait. If you are looking to get these exact colors though you will be disappointed, they aren&#x27;t the same, but it&#x27;s okay. The ones they sent are even better than the ones in the picture! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Balls naturally split in half not sure if just a bad batch.</li>
    <li> All my balls have broke within 3 months of having them!</li>
    <li> Theses came a little sooner then I was expecting, and that was pretty great! Not a single ball has broken since I&#x27;ve gotten them, and it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve had then, I got a bunch of great colors and patterns too!! Overall they are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I ordered these less than a week ago and was surprised that they were delivered so fast. I love them they are so cute.</li>
    <li> They were much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> most of mine were pot leaf or skulls not a fan but their cheep and work great no problems :)</li>
    <li> They were in way to fat touch ring size</li>
    <li> So I got 20 eyebrow rings, but they were not the same colors... The ones in the picture are wayy cooler... &#x3D;( mine are dumb and I&#x27;m not happy with them. Well actually I like 2 of them...</li>
    <li> Happy with order nice mix and colors , i havent really used them since im so used to bigger size balls for my snake eyes now but only if they came a bit bigger . But nice 👏</li>
    <li> Most of the balls were striped out. They kept falling out. Not very happy with them at all..&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;  Amanda Harris</li>
    <li> Good deal but I didn&#x27;t get none pictured. Mine were stripped and solid colors none of the &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; ones. And got doubles and triples of same one</li>
    <li> Was so happy when I found these and even happier when I got them. I love the bright colors and the size is perfect. The balls fit perfect on my starter barbell which is awesome as I didn&#x27;t like the plain ones. So perfect can&#x27;t wait to order more!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the colors, and some of them glow in black light!!! :D Awesome! Not too expensive, but they took a little while to get here.</li>
    <li> work good, no problems. shipping to u.s. takes 2-3 weeks. usually the balls are stripped or fall off while im sleeping but not these...ive had them for three months now n still working good.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed, when I received them there was only 17 in the package, and they were all different colors then shown. Then the balls on the barbells were much bigger, as if it was for a belly button piercing. And the barbells were much longer then they were supposed to be. I will NOT be telling people to get these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my eyebrow. I liked what I saw from the pics but when it arrived I got all navel rings. NOWHERE does it say anything about navel and no pictures! Very disappointed! If I would have known I was gonna get these I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered them cause I don&#x27;t have that pierced!</li>
    <li> The only reason I ordered this was because of the Rasta one and the ones next to it. I like the colors but I really wanted the Rasta one and it didn&#x27;t come with the package :(</li>
    <li> Not all the piercing shown on the picture showed up. The ones that did show up are in good condition.</li>
    <li> mine were great! came in early and got all different colors/styles. The only reason i give it a 4 is because it came with 18 instead of 20 and one of the balls was missing from one of them.</li>
    <li> Cute eyebrow rings but I didn&#x27;t get any from the picture! Not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed I didn&#x27;t get any of the colors shown in the picture and I waited over 2 months to get them. The rings I got are all dull and dark colored and I wanted the light bright colored rings. Sucks</li>
    <li> First of all I place my order on june 30th. it gave me an expected delivery date of july 25th to august 12th. i jsut recieved my package and it is july 10th. way earlier than i was expecting it to be delivered. so that made me super happy. also the size of these r very nice. not too big and the colors are vivid. i was very happy when each one was different. no duplicates. this is worth every penny and i would buy from this seller again. thank you</li>
    <li> the balls are smaller than normal. but other than that they are great  if you like bigger  balls  these are not for you but  they are vibrant</li>
    <li> My girl says she is good with this.</li>
    <li> Got all 20pcs. Just a lot of them are the same style and color.</li>
    <li> came quicker than I thought, and got some great colors and different styles, like balls, spikes and curved bell bars. love all the colors! Didn&#x27;t get two of the same either</li>
    <li> The eyebrow ring variety is nice but very cheaply made and the balls break in half for no reason. I could be screwing on one of the ends and the ball will just break apart even though I&#x27;m gently screwing on the end. I have already lost four rings because of that so I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t look anything like the picture and some of the balls broke very easily</li>
    <li> There very beautiful and good quality highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying changing the different color balls:) they arrived quicker than I thought they would! No complaints here!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can change the ends to match my outfit</li>
    <li> I havent put them in but they was perfectly wrapped and the rings are so cute! Cant wait to pierce my tragus so i can put them in.</li>
    <li> First off, I only got 19 pieces of jewelry when the title clearly says &amp;#34;20 pcs.&amp;#34; Some of the balls get stripped out so easy that they wont stay on the bar. The ONLY reason I gave this two stars is because it got here before the estimated delivery.</li>
    <li> The silver part is too long so I had to put the balls on a smaller part. Also there were many of the same color.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know they was all gonna be practically the same.. waste of money. The only good thing is the shipping..</li>
    <li> These eyebrow rings are awesome and the best part was the price. They&#x27;re shorter than my original barbell so I just changed the ends off to have a different look everyday.</li>
    <li> Hmm I decided i needed to share my opinion, Altho I only received one actual ring shown, there othere were cute the balls are small than i thought but there cute anyways. I got three sets of three that were the same two sets of two a horse shoe which i didnt expect..and soem ones with spikes different colors alot of clear ones too as in white clear not clear color. BUT Im giving this a high rating because i wanted the triples I have three on one side and i like to match. AND really 5 bucks? who is complaining? plus i got 21 lol it was nice sense the horseshoe is to small to go in my lip or nose its not useful to me so it was like a free trial lol I think for 5 bucks...come on lets not get picky</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. There are a lot of different colors. The only problem is that I put one in and now I can&#x27;t remove the ball to get it out. It&#x27;s stuck</li>
    <li> I got my eyebrow piercings and they were really small and didn&#x27;t fit in my eyebrow and the balls broke when I tried taking them off I give this a 1 star</li>
    <li> AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. No other words can describe this except AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Received quick and is exactly what I wanted. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety and quality. Will recommend to all my friends! Easy doing business with.</li>
    <li> I loved these! for the quantity, price and appearance this was an amazing deal! About to order another to have on hand</li>
    <li> I ordered eyebrow rings and ended up getting tongue rings. I decided to keep them because they are pretty and now I&#x27;m debating on getting my tongue done.</li>
    <li> This was the best buy i could of ever bought they are so pretty perfect size nice colors a good mixture came early also so dont doubt this its the best offer !!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my tongue web and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They fit just right. The colors that were sent to me are super cute I got a lot of neon pinks, greens, yellows. You can&#x27;t beat this price and I got them in about 3 days (i live in colorado).  I will happily be buying from this company again!</li>
    <li> They break so easily , waste of money honestly</li>
    <li> They were awesome came fast but the balls break easy so becareful not to screw them on to tight</li>
    <li> They are so cute and PERFECT the only problem is that I can&#x27;t get my old one out and put these new ones in 😢</li>
    <li> They Are Super Tiny And Most Of Them Are the same!! They Look Nothing Like The Picture and one of the rings came with only one ball. There&#x27;s only 3 rings that aren&#x27;t the same!</li>
    <li> Got a lot of doubles but i lose them quick. I liked the designs and colors a lot. Worth it to buy!</li>
    <li> Adorable. Cute small balls. Bought them for my sister. She&#x27;s still thanking me, enough said.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Arrived on time also</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this item</li>
    <li> Great assortment. Never have to spend anymore money on eye brow jewelry again.</li>
    <li> I ordered eye brow rings,  waited a month to get them, and got belly rings.  Is this a joke?  :(</li>
    <li> Loved this product!!! It came with more that I expected more colors and different designs!!! I 💜 this!</li>
    <li> best looking  eye rings i have</li>
    <li> Overall I am pleased. They came on time and are very cute. Have had no problems so far. My only complaint would be that the variety of colors shown in the picture doesn&#x27;t match the actual product. A lot of the rings are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Love them a little smaller than I wanted but my fault still trying to learn the gauge sizes.  Have 2 of each color that&#x27;s good in case I lose a ball.</li>
    <li> I just got them they are pretty colorful kinda small the balls may brake easy cause they are plastic but other than that i love them</li>
    <li> These are cheap pieces of garbage that aren&#x27;t worth the money. The variety is a nice assortment, but the balls split in half every time you so much as touch it. You can go through at least 5 balls per earring just trying to put it in! I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend these too anyone</li>
    <li> Balls kept breaking off when I twisted them on. I didn&#x27;t like that but I really liked the length of the barbell.</li>
    <li> DagonPad 20pcs colorful stainless steel ball, I love them, wish they was all the same size. some are longer than others, and those one are too long for my eye brow. thank you</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for my brother he liked them all he gave the pink ones to his girlfriend</li>
    <li> I got two sets of triplets, but for $5 I can&#x27;t complain. Some really cute ones like a bob marley colored one.</li>
    <li> I love all of these pieces and the colors/designs they came in. I got what I was expecting and more.</li>
    <li> These are soo cute!! I got them a few days before expected and they came in an envelope with a little baggie that had the eyebrow rings in it. The colors of mine were mostly the same as in the picture. One of them was missing a ball and on one of them, the balls would not screw onto the ball. But the rest of them are great. I don&#x27;t have my eyebrow pierced but I use these for my tongue web piercing and i also use them in my ears because the back doesn&#x27;t stab me when i sleep :p they are 16g. Overall these are AMAZING and I LOVE THEM!!!!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re hard to screw on because the balls are so small and where my peircing is.. its hard to twist them  (i use them for my tongue web peircing!) but other than that i love them great price and good variety!</li>
    <li> I would recommend you buy these especially for the price they came within only a week and it said it could have been a month i had to wait. They&#x27;re 16G which is average size but the balls are small so if you don&#x27;t like that these aren&#x27;t for you. I got a variety of different ones which is nice, there was one that was a dud because it wouldn&#x27;t screw into any of the bars it was to uneven of a ball but the rest were fine so i will be repurchasing when i need more. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> great variety. spikes are always easier on tho!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Exactly what the ad said.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier! :-) They are not  cheap like others I have bought.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Loved the earrings.  It did take a while to get here though.</li>
    <li> They  don&#x27;t really come in all the cute colors as shown in the image. I didn&#x27;t really like most of them, but they are good quality though c: that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> not as picture will not buy from this company again</li>
    <li> CAME FAST AND HAD A VERITY OF USUAL COLORS .</li>
    <li> Not to satisfied..balls did not match the picture</li>
    <li> I Absolutely DO NOT recommend these piercings. They break and do not stay screwed! They are not AT ALL cute or like the ones in the picture and the description is incorrect. Do Not Order This Product.</li>
    <li> I received the earrings way early. Which was nice. Also, they were all in good condition, nothing missing or broken.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re super tiny and the balls break easily but the colors are nice and you get a bunch so if you lose them like I do it was a good investment</li>
</ol>
