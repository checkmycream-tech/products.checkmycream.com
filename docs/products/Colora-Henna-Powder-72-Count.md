      <li>This is very easy to use and a good alternative, especially when pregnant, to hair dye products with lots of chemicals in.</li>
      <li>I get a rich color, and it is organic</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna on my hair for years and this is my absolute favorite brand.  </li>
      <li>quick shipping</li>
      <li>use two rounded teaspoons added to 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup warm water.  </li>
      <li>The consistency of the henna was different, more smooth and no seeds.</li>
      <li>Plus you know it comes out nice when people constantly comment on your hair and its color.  </li>
      <li>completely applied I cover my head with plastic wrap, and then with a towel over top of that.</li>
      <li>I love being able to purchase on amazon, and the price is less.  </li>
      <li>He loved the Sunset Glo and introduced me to it years ago, and now we&#x27;re both liking the Red Sunset (so far).</li>
      <li>Colora Henna - Redsnet (Red Sunset) seems to be a very good match to this other product.</li>
      <li>The trick is to mix a tablespoon or two of conditioner in when mixing with hot water.  </li>
      <li>Natural looking, rich color.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this lightened my hair.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and it always arrives very fresh and stays that way since I order several boxes for myself at one time.  </li>
      <li>The color is just right for me since I am a natural redhead.</li>
      <li>It is actually better than the previous brand that I used as the color comes out nicer</li>
      <li>(Hence I purchased several more Red Sunset Colora.)    </li>
      <li>This is a great product that I usually purchase at Whole Foods Market, or some other natural health food store.  </li>
      <li>I use a full box of light brown and a half box of the sunset red...gives my grey hair a copper highlight and my brown</li>
      <li>I tried this henna out because I&#x27;m pregnant and wanted something natural to use to cover my 40% grey head of hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but have already purchased several more boxes to use over the next 6 - 8 months.</li>
      <li>Like I said, about 40% of my hairs are grey, and the rest is brown, and this henna gives a rich red color to all of my hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as some other brands and although it can be hard to rinse out (I recommend using copious amounts of inexpensive conditioner to speed the process along), the beautiful, natural and long lasting results are worth the extra trouble.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a gentle rinse to bring out my red and cover the gray.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural redhead and this seems to do the trick fof the gray hairs so far.</li>
      <li>I have dark hair and when I add this product my gray hair turns into light red.</li>
      <li>Very natural colour, brings out all the red in your hair.</li>
      <li>I used the Red Sunset and Natural Henna on my red haired clients and the hair looks perfectly natural.  </li>
      <li>I use a whole box of this color and a third of a box of apricot gold, and get terrific results- people often tell me they wish they had my color hair, and of course the henna only adds to the condition.  </li>
      <li>Gives a very natural multitone to the hair and covered up the grey, while also providing deep conditioning.  </li>
      <li>are a few dying tips for anyone interested: The day you&#x27;re going to dye your hair, wash it that morning.</li>

<li> I was afraid this shade would be too dark (and it probably would be if I left it on longer), but I have my recipe tweaked and my method figured out.  </li>
<li> (my mixture always sits for at least 8 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I tie it up and cover with a plastic bag for approximately 15-20 minutes, then rinse and condition.  </li>

    <li> This is very easy to use and a good alternative, especially when pregnant, to hair dye products with lots of chemicals in. Very natural colour, brings out all the red in your hair.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and left the product on my hair for an hour.  I went from a dark brown/black to a ridiculous orange color.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this lightened my hair.  I just wanted brighter red overtones.</li>
    <li> Great product to cover my gray hair. I have dark hair and when I add this product my gray hair turns into light red. They look like highlights instead of horribles gray hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I usually purchase at Whole Foods Market, or some other natural health food store.  I love being able to purchase on amazon, and the price is less.  Henna is great for the hair.  It does not effec the color of my hair because it is dark.  However in the sunlight it you can notice the effect of henna for darker hair (a good excuse for going to the beach lol).  But overall  henna is great for coating the hair with a protective barrier that helps give the hair a shinny glow and a healthy appearance.  And this product is great for doing just that.</li>
    <li> I used to use a different henna which is apparently no longer being sold.  I found this to be just as good and offers many more color choices.  Gives a very natural multitone to the hair and covered up the grey, while also providing deep conditioning.  Good fast service from this Amazon affiliate.</li>
    <li> Henna is a great way to color hair.  I used the Red Sunset and Natural Henna on my red haired clients and the hair looks perfectly natural.  Also great for the hair.</li>
    <li> This hair color product is amzaing! It adds shiney red highlights to my hair. It smalls like pond mud, but the smell washes away with the guck.</li>
    <li> For more than 10 years I used a product called Sunset Glo. I loved it and could pick it up locally. However, as many of you already know, this product line has been discontinued.    Colora Henna - Redsnet (Red Sunset) seems to be a very good match to this other product. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but have already purchased several more boxes to use over the next 6 - 8 months. You see, when I was out of the Glo and before finding Colora Henna, I tried a third product and now, unfortunately, have to wait to grow that mess out. However, the Colora Henna seems to be making the third product look better, and is covering my outgrowth nicely the way the Glo use to. (Hence I purchased several more Red Sunset Colora.)    Colora Red Sunset dry product looks the same as the discontinued one and mixes up about the same - however, is grittier like others have said. And I leave it on about the same amount of time as I did for the Glo. Also, my hairstylist seems to like this product too. He loved the Sunset Glo and introduced me to it years ago, and now we&#x27;re both liking the Red Sunset (so far).</li>
    <li> This is as close to the now discontinued Hennalucent Sunset Glo as I have found.  The trick is to mix a tablespoon or two of conditioner in when mixing with hot water.  This will ensure that it stays creamy and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Once again, very happy with this product. Been ordering now for over two years, and it never lets me down.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended through amazon- best price and very speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I use a full box of light brown and a half box of the sunset red...gives my grey hair a copper highlight and my brown a beautiful shine..I like that as it fades my grow out isn&#x27;t so obvious!</li>
    <li> I tried this henna out because I&#x27;m pregnant and wanted something natural to use to cover my 40% grey head of hair. It really works wonderfully. Like I said, about 40% of my hairs are grey, and the rest is brown, and this henna gives a rich red color to all of my hair. I&#x27;d recommend you do some google research for tips on how to dye with henna, as it helped me to use this product properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few dying tips for anyone interested: The day you&#x27;re going to dye your hair, wash it that morning. Mix the henna powder with lemon juice (the acidity is supposed to help the dying process) in a metal or glass bowl until it&#x27;s a nice, muddy consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for a few hours (my mixture always sits for at least 8 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In preparing to dye your hair, lay down some old towels to catch any messy henna that might fall to the ground. Wear clothes you don&#x27;t care about getting dyed either, or cover yourself with a trash bag that you&#x27;ve cut a hole into so that your head fits through (later you can tear yourself out of the trash bag so you don&#x27;t have to pull it over your head), or just invest in a rain poncho or one of the covers they&#x27;d put on you at a salon if you know you&#x27;re going to be dying every 3-4 weeks or so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I apply vaseline around my hair line (forehead, down and around and on the ears, and onto the back of the neck). Have a roll of plastic wrap nearby, and gloves for your hands. I use clips to section my hair, and luckily my husband is just patient enough to help cover my roots with the henna to start, then I take over applying the henna to the rest of my long thick hair (btw, I need at least 2 boxes of this henna, or a total of 4 oz for my thick hair that goes a few inches past my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once completely applied I cover my head with plastic wrap, and then with a towel over top of that. For my own hair I&#x27;ve found through trial and error that the henna should sit for about 2 hoursbefore I rinse it out. So I make a night of it and have a movie to watch while the henna does it&#x27;s job. You can do a patch test on some strands of your hair that you&#x27;ve collected from a brush or after you comb it to better determine what amount of time will work for your hair type/color.</li>
    <li> Natural looking, rich color.  Easy to follow directions.  Long lasting.  The Red Sunset is perfect for me.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used henna on my red hair for 10 years and this was the darkest it&#x27;s ever been. The consistency of the henna was different, more smooth and no seeds. My hair was burgundy! I had to use color oops to fade the color to red sunset.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna on my hair for years and this is my absolute favorite brand.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as some other brands and although it can be hard to rinse out (I recommend using copious amounts of inexpensive conditioner to speed the process along), the beautiful, natural and long lasting results are worth the extra trouble.  I use a whole box of this color and a third of a box of apricot gold, and get terrific results- people often tell me they wish they had my color hair, and of course the henna only adds to the condition.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the Colora Henna and have used it ever since the Hennaluscent brand discontinued my color.  It is actually better than the previous brand that I used as the color comes out nicer and it always arrives very fresh and stays that way since I order several boxes for myself at one time.  Plus you know it comes out nice when people constantly comment on your hair and its color.  Plus the prep is very easy which is always an added benefit.  I would and do recommend it often.</li>
    <li> Great color for the price.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have lost my money and my time. This product did not work for my really short and grey hair. I do not recommend this product, despite the good reviews. Luz.</li>
    <li> It is just the perfect product. I love it.  The color is just right for me since I am a natural redhead.</li>
    <li> hena is a wonderful product for your hair gives color and shine without damage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde with a few red highlights, and a few grays.  I wanted a gentle rinse to bring out my red and cover the gray.  I use red wine vinegar once a week between shampoo and conditioner, so I was looking for a powdered henna to add to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER* I don&#x27;t use according to package directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two rounded teaspoons added to 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup warm water.  I shampoo, then work my henna/ vinegar rinse through my (very long) hair.  I tie it up and cover with a plastic bag for approximately 15-20 minutes, then rinse and condition.  It leaves my hair soft and silky, and the color is just perfect.  I was afraid this shade would be too dark (and it probably would be if I left it on longer), but I have my recipe tweaked and my method figured out.  My hair emerges as a beautiful strawberry shade, with golden highlights (like a sunset!) and no gray.  This powder leaves my hair shiny and undamaged, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I just reordered my second box!</li>
    <li> I use a box of the Hennaluscent Neutral and mix it with 1/2 box of Colora Henna Red Sunset to cover my gray hairs.  I used to use hennaluscent Sunset Glo, but they have discontinued selling it for some reason?????  I am a natural redhead and this seems to do the trick fof the gray hairs so far. It is inexpensive, does not damage my hair and it looks great!</li>
    <li> all good.  product as advertised.  quick shipping</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I like to color my hair with. I used to use a different brand and bought it in Sally Beauty Supply, but cannot find it anywhere anymore. This is great. I get a rich color, and it is organic so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair.</li>
