      <li>My hair is a frizzy mess, but once I add this, it is smooth and skinny.  </li>
      <li>Surprised that Tigi go made this product.</li>

<li> I am editing my original review because after using this a few times it left my thick, but fine hair limp and lifeless.</li>
<li> I have wavy hair and this allows me to wear it straight with the help of a round brush and flat iron.  </li>
<li> I use it on my wet hair and let my curls air dry for shiny soft curls without frizz.  </li>
<li> But does not last to fight the frizz all day long.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron anymore!</li>
<li> My hair is permed, not naturally curly, so</li>
<li> I also use it on my dry hair to resoften,  shine and reshape my curls without worrying about my hair getting greasy.  </li>
<li> I even use it on dry hair!  </li>
<li> It spent make your hair greedy looking.  </li>
<li> I like this product a lot because it helps fight frizz and flyaways without a heavy or oily texture left on your hair.  </li>
<li> if I don&#x27;t scrunch my hair after using it, it&#x27;ll make it a little flat, but it helps hold the curl and eliminate frizz if I scrunch while applying to wet hair.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
<li> My only complaint!</li>
<li> I had tried to find other products that did the same thing, because TIGI is so expensive, but nothing works as well.</li>
<li> It is not amazing</li>
<li> I would recommend to every one with thin or thick hair!</li>
<li> I have been using this sparingly, because it&#x27;s so darn expensive.</li>
<li> Usually their products are horrible!</li>
