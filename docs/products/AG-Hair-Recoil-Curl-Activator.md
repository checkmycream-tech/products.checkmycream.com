      <li>Love this Product, have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely pleased about the free shipping I received from Timeless Beauty (seller).</li>
      <li>This is Hands Down, the BEST curl gel/activator on the market...</li>
      <li>This curl activator is great to use to get my hair tighten back up with curls.  </li>
      <li>I had a head full of super cute curls.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and the product was shipped right away thank you</li>
      <li>I have not found another product that keeps my super curly hair from becoming a brillo pad.  </li>
      <li>My curls are fine but super twisty and are prone to humidity frizz.</li>
      <li>Worth the price you pay.!</li>
      <li>, I wish I would have found this sooner because this makes my curls look amazing and really soft!</li>
      <li>The smell is mildly like vanilla frosting.  </li>
      <li>This seller has competitive pricing, quick shipping, and sends product that is fresh.</li>
      <li>It works really great, forget those over the counter gels, and stiff holding products.  </li>
      <li>A friend recommended it and she was right.</li>
      <li>smoosh it around, and i&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
      <li>But it gets 4 curls because in moderate weather conditions, I can go 2 or 3 days with minimal touch-ups and my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m left with nice, soft frizz-free curls/waves.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;activate\\&quot; any curls in my wavy hair but certainly did eliminate frizz and gave my hair the beachy, touseled effect as promised.</li>
      <li>Use too much, and you&#x27;ll get crunchy hair, but scrunch a bit</li>
      <li>A very lightweight curl creme with some hold.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>My stylist (who has very curly hair</li>
      <li>I really like recoil.</li>
      <li>I do not know of any other product better for curry hair.</li>
      <li>Like most curly haired women, I have a storage closet full of failure to contain my curl products.</li>
      <li>My hair is very frizzy and this helps to calm it and get it back in shape.</li>
      <li>It does define particular strands of hair, but leaves them a bit crunchy.</li>
      <li>(my curly hair was dryer &amp; not as manageable) &amp; continued to use the same product I purchased from a local saloon with better results.</li>
      <li>This product came highly recommended by my stylist who specializes in curly hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a lotion for my hair, then a clear gel over it or other product over it.</li>
      <li>Oh, and this is not like a normal cream for me, where it&#x27;s so moisturizing</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a local salon and sure enough the texture was very different.</li>
      <li>Use a small dime size amount and make sure to distribute it VERY evenly throughout your entire head of hair.</li>
      <li>I follow with a lightweight gel and then diffuse to help my curls become soft and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really makes my perm last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair or any sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>I stand near boiling water and my hair frizzes.  </li>
      <li>I use it on wet, freshly washed hair OR on follow-up days, on my hair after dampening it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Styling Cream as a base (wonderful for hair breakage, hydration,</li>
      <li>I have thick, fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Much better than any of the other gels marketed towards Black hair IMO...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with naturally curly hair for several years.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s back to being soft.  </li>
      <li>I have natural wavy hair and get a spiral perm only once a year.  </li>
      <li>put a pump or two in my hands and spread it on like lotion (all over the fingers), flip hair to one side, gently scrunch it in utilizing my fingers to ring around the curls, then flip to other side and repeat.</li>
      <li>It keeps the curls together (not frizzy) and as long as its spread out hair stays soft.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I let it dry naturally.  </li>

<li> Not too heavy so that it weighs down my fine frizz nor does it get too stiff</li>
<li> and for my long curly hair that has a tendency to get big, this doesn&#x27;t hold up in humidity, even fog in the winter, as well as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> Once its dry, it is, in fact, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, but I just run my fingers through it.  </li>
<li> I put a dime size amount in my hair when wet, scrunch it, pseudo style it, let it dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps keep my heavy curly hair in order on humid days. Helps reduce frizz, though not 100%, but I&#x27;m not sure there is a product out there that will.</li>
    <li> A very lightweight curl creme with some hold. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t require a lot per application. My stylist (who has very curly hair like I do) recommended it and it&#x27;s the only thing that has tamed my curls consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I put a pump or two in my hands and spread it on like lotion (all over the fingers), flip hair to one side, gently scrunch it in utilizing my fingers to ring around the curls, then flip to other side and repeat. I follow with a lightweight gel and then diffuse to help my curls become soft and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I have thick dark brown hair that goes a little below the shoulders. Tight curls in the front, and looser curls in the back. I also have a scalp condition which prevents me from using shampoos and this product does not aggravate it.*</li>
    <li> AG Re:Coil products have been my HG for a few years now for my ultra-thick Type 2C/3A curls. I use the Curl Activator as part of a cocktail with BioSilk Rock Hard Gelee and Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper. A little goes a long way! This seller has competitive pricing, quick shipping, and sends product that is fresh.</li>
    <li> The AG Recoil Curl Activator is awesome.  I have curly hair that turns frizzy very easily.  This is the only product I have found that can define the curl and keep the frizz at bay.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used. Like most curly haired women, I have a storage closet full of failure to contain my curl products. My curls are fine but super twisty and are prone to humidity frizz. This product is indispensable for me as it defines my curls, reduces frizz and smells great. A few things I&#x27;ve noticed is that if I defuse dry my hair with a dryer or I curl plop, I do not get the crunchiness noted by other reviewers. I also noticed that if I hair spray my hair with a touchable hold spray and use this product it lasts for several days without washing.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product out there, and this is one of the best. Defines the curls all day, though leaves a slight crunch. I pair this with curl junkie curls in a bottle</li>
    <li> too expensive, I can obtain the same results using other products</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I put a dime size amount in my hair when wet, scrunch it, pseudo style it, let it dry. Then I scrunch again with my hands to take out the crunch....and it&#x27;s perfect. No frizz, good hold, shiny curls.</li>
    <li> I ordered Recoil based on my stylists&#x27; recommendation. I was extremely pleased about the free shipping I received from Timeless Beauty (seller). I thought that this option would come with the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; of slow delivery but was pleasantly surprised that it was delivered promptly - within two days! The product is great - It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;activate\\&quot; any curls in my wavy hair but certainly did eliminate frizz and gave my hair the beachy, touseled effect as promised.</li>
    <li> I have not found another product that keeps my super curly hair from becoming a brillo pad.  People stop me on the street to compliment my curls.</li>
    <li> best I&#x27;ve found for curly/wavy hair</li>
    <li> Excellent for defining curls</li>
    <li> AG was used on my course curly hair at the salon and worked well so bought some.  Only thing missing is the a little shine for the hair without all the harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love AG products.  My hairdresser introduced me to several of their products.  This curl activator is great to use to get my hair tighten back up with curls.  I have natural wavy hair and get a spiral perm only once a year.  This really makes my perm last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair or any sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I did just what it said.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market to define curls!  Must have for curly tops!  It&#x27;s expensive and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every curly hair product you could find.  This works best - not too sticky, right amount of hold, not greasy. Gives definition without weighing curls down.  I sometimes mix it with gel or leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses it on my hair. Now I do too. Great for curls. Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;to leave hair stuff or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with naturally curly hair for several years.  Works well - allows for definition yet movement, isn&#x27;t crunchy when dries.  I start with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Styling Cream as a base (wonderful for hair breakage, hydration, builds strength, helps with humidity control, all around great product), and use this on the ends/scrunched in.  AG Recoil Curl Activator works great by itself, but layer because I had hair breakage and dryness, and I don&#x27;t condition otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product for my 2c curly hair. I use a light hold gel on top of it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Love this Product, have used it for years.  And, being able to just sit at my computer and get it.  Makes it really good.  Cause b4 I d have to have my hair stylist buy it for me at a Beauty Supply Store.  And, now I can do it myself.  It works really great, forget those over the counter gels, and stiff holding products.  Buy this, YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Did not recoil my curls at all</li>
    <li> It does define particular strands of hair, but leaves them a bit crunchy. Decline in frizz. I think, though it did define my waves, it may have left them a bit straighter, heavier and flatter than usual. Use a small dime size amount and make sure to distribute it VERY evenly throughout your entire head of hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My perm that I had over a year ago came back to life with just a dime of product on my fingers. Really great stuff. Worth the price you pay.!</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a &amp;#34;trial gift&amp;#34;!  She was correct, it is an awesome product.  I have thick, fine, naturally curly hair.  After shampoo and condiitoner, I wait about 10 minutes and then apply about dime-to quarter size (hair is just below ears) and usually let air dry another ten if I am going to use hair dryer.. Otherwise, I let it dry naturally.  smoosh it around, and i&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
    <li> After using this for a few weeks (I have been using this same product for 3+ years now) I noticed the product seemed watered down. I bought this product at a local salon and sure enough the texture was very different. I had to throw it away (my curly hair was dryer &amp; not as manageable) &amp; continued to use the same product I purchased from a local saloon with better results. I won&#x27;t be purchasing from this on-line company. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> very stiff and sticky</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve always had curly hair and have been fighting it since middle school, I wish I would have found this sooner because this makes my curls look amazing and really soft! I put a quarter size amount in my palm then scrunch into my hair, I concentrate on the ends usually and then blow dry with a diffuser. It always looks amazing! Very happy with this product and I don&#x27;t think the cost is bad at all considering I use to spend WAY more on multiple products that would make my hair look terrible compared to this.</li>
    <li> this works great for restoring curls.  My hair is very frizzy and this helps to calm it and get it back in shape.</li>
    <li> I do not know of any other product better for curry hair. It keeps the curls together (not frizzy) and as long as its spread out hair stays soft. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just pricey-- and for my long curly hair that has a tendency to get big, this doesn&#x27;t hold up in humidity, even fog in the winter, as well as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  But it gets 4 curls because in moderate weather conditions, I can go 2 or 3 days with minimal touch-ups and my hair looks great.  This doesn&#x27;t enhance my curls though-- if anything I think it makes my hair look a bit more wavy than spirally, but I like the look a lot.  The smell is mildly like vanilla frosting.  Does not irritate my asthma/allergies/eczema.  *Oh, and this is not like a normal cream for me, where it&#x27;s so moisturizing I don&#x27;t need to leave in any of my conditioner.  I do have to leave some in or I get crispy, stringy hair with this.*  So, if you get bad results, try it again with some conditioner underneath as you would for a gel.</li>
    <li> This is Hands Down, the BEST curl gel/activator on the market...and I have tried Many.  I have coarse 3b/c curls that tend to get frizzy...but not with this!  Just a small amount, and I had a head full of super cute curls.  Use too much, and you&#x27;ll get crunchy hair, but scrunch a bit and it&#x27;s back to being soft.  Much better than any of the other gels marketed towards Black hair IMO...this is a Staple!</li>
    <li> I did not find it to do what I wanted it to do. I have semi-fine wavy hair. I could not get a curl. Probably works great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the product was shipped right away thank you</li>
    <li> Love, love this product! Excellent for curly hair or wavy ...,,</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by my stylist who specializes in curly hair. I ALWAYS get compliments on how great my hair smells. haha, which is a bonus to it looking great as well. It&#x27;s more like a lotion for my hair, then a clear gel over it or other product over it.</li>
    <li> Then this product is for you! No matter how much, or how little, of the product I put in my hair, my curls come out flat, and almost limp-looking. They are ALWAYS crunchy too. I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it on wet, freshly washed hair OR on follow-up days, on my hair after dampening it.  It helps my wacky curls form and my frizz stay under control.  Not too heavy so that it weighs down my fine frizz nor does it get too stiff, it keeps my curls nice all day.</li>
    <li> I really like recoil. A friend recommended it and she was right. It gives me great curl definition without crunch.</li>
    <li> does wonders to my hair! loving this product! A little sticky till it dries off but then my hair looks great. Awesome company based in Vancouver BC! gluten free product and not tested on animals! GREAT!</li>
    <li> I stand near boiling water and my hair frizzes.  This product is great.  I put in wet hair, scrunch it in, let it dry.  Once its dry, it is, in fact, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, but I just run my fingers through it.  That breaks up the crunchy feel and I&#x27;m left with nice, soft frizz-free curls/waves.</li>
