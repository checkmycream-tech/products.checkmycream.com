      <li>/&gt;It was alright! :D</li>
      <li>I think it is the best product on the market...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not its perfect....</li>
      <li>Happy!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s GREAT!!</li>
      <li>Packaging is beautiful, as is with any Skinfood product!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>The scent is great-- nothing too overbearing or girly.</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>It covers everything, easy to apply and looks so great!!!</li>
      <li>Good coverage without looking caked on&lt;br</li>
      <li>Darker than advertised but good sunscreen</li>
      <li>The coverage was good, but because it was a matte finish</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have fair skin just a reference for others.</li>
      <li>I will never need to search for that perfect light foundation/ full coverage and perfect match plus sunscreen ever again!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>Nice product with good coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this BB cream!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would say this has excellent coverage and is more like a true foundation.</li>
      <li>After 10 minutes or so the product settles and has a nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, but it didn&#x27;t give great coverage</li>
      <li>Love it, love it!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the consistency of the BB cream is very unique and it&#x27;s a very good one at that - you just have to find the right shade.</li>
      <li>BB Cream offers SPF 45 and is PA+++, which is excellent in terms of sun protection for the face.</li>
      <li>Super excited!!!</li>
      <li>This BB cream from Skin Food is very light.</li>
      <li>Covers better than foundation</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My skin just feels genrtally better with it on.  </li>
      <li>My complexion is better because of this.</li>
      <li>I like the Missha better.</li>
      <li>I found the BB cream made my skin tone more even and did not look like a foundation.</li>
      <li>Even better, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up.</li>
      <li>have problematic skin, but since I replaced my foundation with this it has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I love this bb..</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Not only does it look great on my skin, it also protects it!  </li>
      <li>Covers up blemishes and matches my Asian skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>the most is because the company \\&quot;Skin Food\\&quot; is a cruelty-free cosmetics brand, and the product works</li>
      <li>I love the pump bottle and the label</li>
      <li>just very clean..</li>
      <li>I love &amp;#34;skinfood platinum grape cell&amp;#34; my skin is so smooth and glow.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, good product</li>
      <li>Pretty and lovely!</li>
      <li>The seller shipped the product very quickly considering it had to come all the way from Korea.  </li>
      <li>it make my makeup stay on all day  at work where I sweat a lot so that pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>covers almost everything and has a great undertone for my asian complexion .  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel gross and it smells great</li>
      <li>so for someone with good skin naturally</li>
      <li>However, I was shcoked to discover that this shade (&amp;#34;Light Beige&amp;#34;) is extremely light and thus the color doesn&#x27;t quite match up with my skin - leading me to have to use more product in order to blend my hairline, jawline, and neck into the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice coverage- not too light, but not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overrall, it&#x27;s a really nice product - especially when considered that most of its ingredients come from grape extract.</li>
      <li>It also has a fragrance similar to Skin79&#x27;s BB creams which is pleasant but not overbearing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little light when you first apply it, so let it sit on your skin and sink in before using setting powder, perfect shade!</li>
      <li>It is the perfect neutral shade for me, neither too pink, too gray, or too yellow, as so many BB creams and foundations tend to be.</li>
      <li>I also really like that this BB cream is lighter and many others.  </li>
      <li>this might actually be full coverage for you.....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good at concealing freckles and acne related blotches whilst maintaining a natural look.</li>
      <li>Super quick shipping from Korea.</li>
      <li>if you have normal or oily skin, this might be better for you o3o</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>I have pretty light skin</li>
      <li>It has a good very light scent that I can&#x27;t even small</li>
      <li>i would recommend this to anyone who would like to substitute foundation for something lighter and better coverage that lasts long :)</li>
      <li>coverage was more than I expected way better than other BB creams, smells great too.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, including Clinique, Bobbie Brown, Boscia and Dr. Jart+.</li>
      <li>Well, it really is quite light.</li>
      <li>My favorite Dr. Jart+ BB cream is Dis-A-Pore both for the formula and because of all the Dr. Jart+ creams, it offers the lightest shade.</li>
      <li>but t is worth it.</li>
      <li>Just be aware of how light &amp;#34;Light Beige&amp;#34; really is!</li>
      <li>just as well as similar popular BB</li>
      <li>Appears oily at first but settles quickly</li>
      <li>My go-to everyday bb, the smell is also very nice</li>
      <li>it seems to provide the right amount of moisture yet civers well.</li>
      <li>; look, it has sunscreen, and it&#x27;s good (or at least not bad!)</li>
      <li>very fast shipping and with freebies</li>
      <li>Even the much-vaunted L&#x27;Oreal True Match products don&#x27;t get this quite right (for me at least) with their Warm, Cool and Neutral offerings.</li>
      <li>It made my skin look fresh, clean and natural - not cakey.</li>
      <li>This BB cream has a nice natural-looking finish, especially considering the high amount of skin protection.  </li>
      <li>better than my last (SKIN79) which I used to like very much, until now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems like it works well on a variety of skin tones, it makes your skin look pretty without that &amp;#34;heavy make-up&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It offers light to medium coverage.</li>
      <li>It covers pretty well without being cakey.</li>
      <li>Overall, extremely satisfied.</li>
      <li>The scent is lol...but even if u don&#x27;t where foundation the smell with only last for a very short time and if u don&#x27;t have a good sense of smell u won&#x27;t smell it anyways!!</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty well, too.</li>
      <li>I also really love how it leaves my skin looking fresh and moist (not greasy), and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s not full-coverage, it does do a good job of concealing imperfections like blotchiness, acne scars, small zits, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pale white girl (porcelain-beige skin, naturally blond hair) with goldish undertones, and this product is the perfect tone.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Very natural and fresh appearence</li>
      <li>The quality is very high end.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend both this product and this seller!</li>
      <li>My skin likes this cream and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all, which is great.  </li>
      <li>Very neat dispenser, really sanitary.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently began using this BB cream as one of my first forays into utilizing Korean beauty products, particularly the Skinfood brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather pale skin and usually always take the lightest or near-lightest shades in foundation and BB creams. However, I was shcoked to discover that this shade (&amp;#34;Light Beige&amp;#34;) is extremely light and thus the color doesn&#x27;t quite match up with my skin - leading me to have to use more product in order to blend my hairline, jawline, and neck into the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the consistency of the BB cream is very unique and it&#x27;s a very good one at that - you just have to find the right shade. It&#x27;s thicker in consistency to other BB creams - but it also has a more dewy and silky finish. It&#x27;s quite satiny and leaves your face looking illuminated, but not greasy - which a lot of other BB creams are guilty of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overrall, it&#x27;s a really nice product - especially when considered that most of its ingredients come from grape extract. Just be aware of how light &amp;#34;Light Beige&amp;#34; really is!</li>
    <li> This BB cream has a nice natural-looking finish, especially considering the high amount of skin protection.  This color, #1 Light Beige, is definitely very light...unless you are a pale girl, you will probably want a darker shade.  My skin likes this cream and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all, which is great.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this BB cream!  The seller shipped the product very quickly considering it had to come all the way from Korea.  It only took about 2 weeks.  I highly recommend both this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, including Clinique, Bobbie Brown, Boscia and Dr. Jart+. My favorite Dr. Jart+ BB cream is Dis-A-Pore both for the formula and because of all the Dr. Jart+ creams, it offers the lightest shade. This Skinfood BB cream has it beat though, as far as price (it almost half the price), shade and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this has excellent coverage and is more like a true foundation. I read all the reviews before I ordered, afraid that the lightest Skinfood shade, called #1 Light Beige, would be too deep for me. I was skeptical even though a few reviews said that is very light. Well, it really is quite light. It is the perfect neutral shade for me, neither too pink, too gray, or too yellow, as so many BB creams and foundations tend to be. If anything it skews ever so slightly pink. The lightest foundation shade in most lines is usually a little too light/white for me, while the second lightest shade is usually a touch too deep/yellow. Even the much-vaunted L&#x27;Oreal True Match products don&#x27;t get this quite right (for me at least) with their Warm, Cool and Neutral offerings. This is right in between a touch too light and a touch too dark and it just makes your skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s a little rich and very creamy and I do get a little shiny with it--probably it would not be good for truly oily skin--but I like a little bit of a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish as opposed to a very matte finish, which once you&#x27;re much past 30, can be aging IMO. It lasts pretty well, too. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Korean and I&#x27;ve been searching for a BB cream that will both cover up blemishes and not turn my face pink. This is it! Covers up blemishes and matches my Asian skin tone perfectly. Packaging is beautiful, as is with any Skinfood product! Very neat dispenser, really sanitary. The scent is great-- nothing too overbearing or girly. It&#x27;s a little light when you first apply it, so let it sit on your skin and sink in before using setting powder, perfect shade! Overall, extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and order it regularly every several months so I can ensure it arrives before my last bottle runs out. The shipping is slow since it comes from Korea, but the planning ahead is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pale white girl (porcelain-beige skin, naturally blond hair) with goldish undertones, and this product is the perfect tone. It covers pretty well without being cakey. While it&#x27;s not full-coverage, it does do a good job of concealing imperfections like blotchiness, acne scars, small zits, etc. Even better, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up. It just looks luminous and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problematic skin, but since I replaced my foundation with this it has never looked better. In the past, I have done multiple courses of Accutane and tried every skin treatment out there. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I only get a few hormonal zits (at most) near my period. I probably cannot credit the change entirely to this product, because I also made other changes like eliminating soda, getting regular facials, etc. That said, this bb cream definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt! Sometimes I even get lazy and forget to wash my face before bed, and it doesn&#x27;t do any damage. With other products (even other bb creams), I would immediately see my skin looking worse the next day, and suffer a breakout not soon after. This cream gives me the freedom to occasionally just pass out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it works well on a variety of skin tones, it makes your skin look pretty without that &amp;#34;heavy make-up&amp;#34; look, it has sunscreen, and it&#x27;s good (or at least not bad!) for your skin. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
    <li> I had this BB cream several months ago and finished it.&lt;br /&gt;It was alright! :D The coverage was good, but because it was a matte finish and I have dry skin, it left my face flaking after awhile! &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, I would say to pass on this BB cream~&lt;br /&gt;But if you have normal or oily skin, this might be better for you o3o</li>
    <li> Very good product. Love it. Highly recommend. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I could have given it 6 stars if i could.... I think it is the best product on the market... It covers everything, easy to apply and looks so great!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a replacement for the Missha BB cream and didn&#x27;t like it all that much.  The scent is mild, but it didn&#x27;t give great coverage and I did develop acne from it. I like the Missha better.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping from Korea. Nice product with good coverage.</li>
    <li> In the past year I&#x27;ve tried out a couple American BB&#x27;s, but they really can&#x27;t compete with the Korean formulations of their overseas competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB Cream offers SPF 45 and is PA+++, which is excellent in terms of sun protection for the face. I normally do not wear foundation and will opt instead for a thin layer of moisturizer/sunscreen and a BB cream. The grape cell BB has a light grape scent when applying and initially will go on a little gray but correct color imbalance once blended. It offers light to medium coverage. But the coverage is actually visible unlike US &amp;#34;tinted moisturizers&amp;#34; which claim &#x27;light coverage&#x27; but actually have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Skinfood&#x27;s lightly scented formulas of BB creams and have tried a few other Korean brands (including Missha, HERA and Etude House). I usually come back to Skinfood for affordability and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what I expected. Happy!</li>
    <li> I love this bb.. better than my last (SKIN79) which I used to like very much, until now. It&#x27;s very similar, only I feel this bb is less thick and easier to apply with the same amount if not more coverage (which is build-able to medium.) I also really love how it leaves my skin looking fresh and moist (not greasy), and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all. My go-to everyday bb, the smell is also very nice and if you&#x27;re not a fan of scents (it&#x27;s a grape scent) than don&#x27;t worry because it only lasts for less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage- not too light, but not heavy at all. Stays on me over 12 hours, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and no irritations!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is neat.</li>
    <li> great product.  covers almost everything and has a great undertone for my asian complexion .  i would recommend this to anyone who would like to substitute foundation for something lighter and better coverage that lasts long :)</li>
    <li> This BB cream from Skin Food is very light. It applies on your face well, but at first seems very oily and shines a little. After 10 minutes or so the product settles and has a nice matte finish. It&#x27;s very good at concealing freckles and acne related blotches whilst maintaining a natural look. I found the BB cream made my skin tone more even and did not look like a foundation. It made my skin look fresh, clean and natural - not cakey. In fact my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, but said I looked healthier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very freckley skin and the BB cream visibly reduced the appearence of the freckles on the first application (although I suppose I would need a heavy foundation to completely cover them), which is good as I like to maintain a natural look. It also has a fragrance similar to Skin79&#x27;s BB creams which is pleasant but not overbearing. Other BB creams and foundations sometimes give me itchy skin, but this one (so far) hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like this BB cream the most is because the company \\&quot;Skin Food\\&quot; is a cruelty-free cosmetics brand, and the product works just as well as similar popular BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutshell review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cruelty-free brand&lt;br /&gt;- Good coverage without looking caked on&lt;br /&gt;- Appears oily at first but settles quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Very natural and fresh appearence</li>
    <li> My complexion is better because of this. My skin loves it. I also really like that this BB cream is lighter and many others.  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Super excited!!! I hope it is around forever!!! I will never need to search for that perfect light foundation/ full coverage and perfect match plus sunscreen ever again!!! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this Skinfood!!!</li>
    <li> very fast shipping and with freebies</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone! Ordered during the holidays and it still came in before the estimated delivery date! Works beautifully! Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel gross and it smells great</li>
    <li> Love it, love it!  Covers better than foundation, this is a MUST HAVE.  Not only does it look great on my skin, it also protects it!  Sunscreen and coverage that does not make me break out?  Customer for life.</li>
    <li> Prompt Delivery, Item as Described. Product is high quality. No Problem at All. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this. Great coverage. goes on a little thin though but i dont use heavy makeup anyways. this is my third bottle purchased.</li>
    <li> I noticed after the application of the BB cream my imperfection and discoloration was not noticeable and provides hydration throughout the day.  I would highly recommend this BB cream.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from seoulglamour with my order and I tried it on my vacation for 4 days even though I packed lioele beyond locution, missha signature &amp; holika holika tea tree ... This one outperformed them all!!! I was quite surprised because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.  Ths bb cream blends and melts into your skin but brightens, tightens, and set your face for the next step.  The quality is very high end.  It is quite a bit more expensive thn other bb creams but t is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I am middle aged living in Florida and this BB cream works well with my skin. it seems to provide the right amount of moisture yet civers well. My skin just feels genrtally better with it on.  The aroma of this product is divine!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! This is the lightest color so I was thinking it would be light WHITE but it&#x27;s not its perfect....I have pretty light skin but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have fair skin just a reference for others. I&#x27;d say it has medium coverge and I wear it under my foundation....it make my makeup stay on all day  at work where I sweat a lot so that pretty amazing. I love the pump bottle and the label lol. It has a good very light scent that I can&#x27;t even small once I out foundation on...I can&#x27;t explain the smell but it&#x27;s not a makeup smell just very clean..I wish I had a perfume in w.e. The scent is lol...but even if u don&#x27;t where foundation the smell with only last for a very short time and if u don&#x27;t have a good sense of smell u won&#x27;t smell it anyways!! If I was not going around people ik I&#x27;d wear it alone with a primer and I have acne so for someone with good skin naturally this might actually be full coverage for you.....it&#x27;s GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I love &amp;#34;skinfood platinum grape cell&amp;#34; my skin is so smooth and glow.  Pretty and lovely!</li>
    <li> Darker than advertised but good sunscreen</li>
    <li> coverage was more than I expected way better than other BB creams, smells great too.</li>
