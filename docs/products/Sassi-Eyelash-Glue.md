      <li>Best glue I&#x27;ve come across!!!!</li>
      <li>:D</li>
      <li>This is the best glue I&#x27;ve come across</li>
      <li>It works perfectly and when your done the glue rolls off without any hassle.</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>This glue is great and you don&#x27;t have to wait minutes for it to get &#x27;tacky&#x27; either.  </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>I give it a 4 because I haven&#x27;t patiently tried it and looking for a permanent stick but good glue.</li>
      <li>Good thing is I ordered on the 19th and arrived on the 23rd</li>
      <li>If your looking for a good /cheap Eyelash Glue</li>
      <li>I love this glue</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great and comes off really easy when you are ready to take your eye lashes</li>
      <li>Use a towel to clean your face.</li>
      <li>I will try a full set with this glue and see it&#x27;s durable.</li>
      <li>The lashes are ready to be applied in a few seconds and they hold up great!</li>
      <li>If you use it properly you get amazing results.</li>
      <li>Hope others enjoy as much as I do.</li>
      <li>This glue is salon quality and is well worth buying.</li>
      <li>Doesnt stick much...</li>
      <li>it dries fast</li>
      <li>Once you apply glue to the lash, it&#x27;s ready to apply to your eyes in about 2 seconds.</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>glue is also a nice, bold black color that adds a nice rim to your eyes in addition to the false lashes.</li>
      <li>The texture has a bit of a rubber dry feel (like weave glue but not crusty) and can come off your skin by rubbing lightly.</li>
      <li>it dries sooooo quick and definitely holds falsies in place.</li>
      <li>So again, not sure if it&#x27;s for a more permanent stay or just temporary for a couple days.</li>
      <li>:) I tried it for a minute with an individual lash and it stayed on (when trying to pull off,feels like a pinch) but haven&#x27;t tried letting it sit for a few hrs or longer.</li>
      <li>Ladies, this eyelash glue is strong but it will not damage your lashes as long as you are gentle taking off your fake lashes.</li>

<li> They hold the lashes on so well that it&#x27;s crazy and it&#x27;s very easy to take off.</li>

<li> Was dried out when i received it.</li>
<li> Been using for a few months now.</li>
<li> Waste</li>

<li> I never put on fake eye lashes before in my life, until i bought this.&lt;br</li>
<li> It works, but it smells really really bad</li>

    <li> Barley holds anything, terrible lash glue</li>
    <li> This is the best glue I&#x27;ve come across</li>
    <li> They hold the lashes on so well that it&#x27;s crazy and it&#x27;s very easy to take off. I&#x27;ve been reading the reviews and it depends on how you use it. If you use it properly you get amazing results. You aren&#x27;t supposed to wash your face with eyelashes glued on. The eyelashes will clump and the glue will start to feel a little watery. Use a towel to clean your face.</li>
    <li> it dries sooooo quick and definitely holds falsies in place. Great!</li>

    <li> If your looking for a good /cheap Eyelash Glue this is the one you should get!</li>
    <li> Best glue I&#x27;ve come across!!!! Does not irritate my eyes at all. Once you apply glue to the lash, it&#x27;s ready to apply to your eyes in about 2 seconds. This glue is salon quality and is well worth buying. I won&#x27;t go back to any other glue. Hope others enjoy as much as I do. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Doesnt stick much...as soon as i went outside my eyelash flew off</li>
    <li> I never put on fake eye lashes before in my life, until i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;It works great and comes off really easy when you are ready to take your eye lashes off.&lt;br /&gt;I would deff recommend this!</li>
    <li> Ladies, this eyelash glue is strong but it will not damage your lashes as long as you are gentle taking off your fake lashes.

I promise that they won&#x27;t fall with this glue. I never have had problems.</li>
    <li> Good thing is I ordered on the 19th and arrived on the 23rd (was to arrive feb 25th- mar 2nd). :) I tried it for a minute with an individual lash and it stayed on (when trying to pull off,feels like a pinch) but haven&#x27;t tried letting it sit for a few hrs or longer. The texture has a bit of a rubber dry feel (like weave glue but not crusty) and can come off your skin by rubbing lightly.

Wait a few seconds to get tacky and doesn&#x27;t sting (smells a bit funky but gone when dry). Hope this helped. :D I give it a 4 because I haven&#x27;t patiently tried it and looking for a permanent stick but good glue.</li>
