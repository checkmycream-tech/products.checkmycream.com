<li> It was not authentic Benefit product.  </li>
<li> Not authentic.</li>
<li> All of Benefit cosmetics are hard to remove no matter how hard you scrub.</li>
<li> I gave this product 4*s because it is INCREDIBLY HARD TO REMOVE.</li>
<li> It does not clump as the bristles are hard and act as a comb for your lashes.</li>
<li> They say that, when using it, 90% of users saw base-to-tip curl; 94% saw visible lift and dramatic length and volume; 100% saw long-wearing results.</li>
<li> but it is tough to get off!  </li>
<li> When I took the wand out of the tube it had this nasty looking stringy, ropey looking black gel-ish like stuff coming out of the tube attached to the end of the wand!</li>
<li> I hope this helps someone else not get disappointed?</li>
<li> /&gt;Their suggested use: position wand horizontally and wiggle from side to side, base to tip of the lash to achieve maximum volume, length and lift.  </li>
<li> Awful!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is a very good mascara, does everything as advertised. My only issue is that I did not purchase a waterproof mascara, this works just as if it were waterproof..... let me just say, if you think that it can be washed off by your standard face wash guess again. This puppy stayed stuck on my eyelashes.. It took me forever to get it off and it even took off some of my lashes. So, its too great of a product, if you can understand where I&#x27;m coming from:) Happy lashing.... LOL</li>
    <li> This is another of those &amp;#34;failed attempts&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve experienced lately.&lt;br /&gt;First off when I got it and I opened it....well yuk! When I took the wand out of the tube it had this nasty looking stringy, ropey looking black gel-ish like stuff coming out of the tube attached to the end of the wand! Not only was it stringy, but it sprang back to the opening of the tube once I got the wand far enough away. Call me nuts, but I figured maybe it was suppose to look like that, so I went ahead and tried it, going by the directions. This stuff didn&#x27;t do for me what the package claims. And I know I did it right because there&#x27;s only one way to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK So let&#x27;s move on to the removal of this stuff. I absolutely DID NOT need to use anything to remove this mascara from my lashes! All I did was to rub my eyes with my fingers and every bit of it just rolled off like sloughing skin. I absolutely swear that I&#x27;m telling you folks the honest unbiased truth. That was the easiest most messes removal of mascara that I have ever had in my entire lifetime, and I&#x27;m not a kid. This was amazing to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work as it claimed? NO!&lt;br /&gt;Is it a waste of both time and money? YES!&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this again? NO!&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend anyone else buying it? NO!&lt;br /&gt;Do I hope this helps someone else not get disappointed? OH GOD, I REALLY DO!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  The last time I bought it I got it from Macy&#x27;s.  This is the same quality, comes in legit packaging.  I love it!  It lasts a loooong time too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this mascara so I bought it to try it out. I work in the hair and makeup industry and this mascara didn&#x27;t impress me. When I opened the package from the mail, the box that held the mascara looked like it had been opened, therefore probably tampered with. The mascara smells like acrylic paint. I do hope I&#x27;m not putting acrylic paint on my eyelashes... From now on I will only buy in store.</li>
    <li> I got the mascara as a gift and I love it. It definitely makes my lashes longer and thicker. I did an online search for the product because I wanted to make sure I could find a source for it and the search brought me here. Now I know where to buy it when the tube runs out.</li>
    <li> This mascara is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought. It does not clump as the bristles are hard and act as a comb for your lashes. I used to use Maybelline Full &amp; Soft, but this is my brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite mascara, and Amazon has a good price on it. Will order it again;)</li>
    <li> I only apply make up once a day....and this mascara does not flake or give me black eyes ..woo hoo</li>
    <li> Feels nothing like the mascara I bought at sephora. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal! It&#x27;s an imposter! I&#x27;ve used this mascara and purchased many tubes from Sephora. This stuff does not come close. Benefits Cosmetics should take legal action!</li>
    <li> Not authentic. Very sticky.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does everything it says. It seems a bit clumpy but really isn&#x27;t.  Not waterproof as stated previously but it is tough to get off!  Will definately be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; mascara everytime!</li>
    <li> Omg!  Best mascara ever!!</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and I absolutely love what it does to my lashes. Makes it look long and thick. Love this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect. The item came as described.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  Will definitely buy it again!  Makes lashes long and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Benefit Cosmetics They&#x27;re Real! Mascara (BLACK) 8.5g, from Aviance. The manufacturers of this mascara promise a jet-black mascara that lengthens, curls, volumizes, lifts and separates lashes.  They say that, when using it, 90% of users saw base-to-tip curl; 94% saw visible lift and dramatic length and volume; 100% saw long-wearing results. They add that their specially designed brush features staggered bristles that will grab close to the root of the lash, and the custom-domed tip uses precision bristles to lift, define, and curl even the tiniest lashes.  They add that it is a glossy long-wearing formula that won&#x27;t smudge, clump, or dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their suggested use: position wand horizontally and wiggle from side to side, base to tip of the lash to achieve maximum volume, length and lift.  Hold wand vertically and stroke upward to curl and separate.  Layer generously as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a younger woman, I had a 25-year long nervous habit of pulling out my eyelashes; my lids were usually bare.  I’ve had some regrowth since then, but my eyelashes are still sparse.  So when this product was recommended to me by my beauty salon, and I saw that the cosmetologists working there had great looking lashes, I had to try it.  I do think it makes more of what eyelashes I have than other mascaras I have tried, but I wish it came in shades other than jet black.</li>
    <li> This mascara does everything as described. I have really curly lashes and it does separate and defines for volume making them look thicker a longer like I like them to be. I can finally reach my tiny lashes in my inner eye. I gave this product 4*s because it is INCREDIBLY HARD TO REMOVE. In order to take it off your buring your eye with some removing chemical or soap or lashes will fall out. All of Benefit cosmetics are hard to remove no matter how hard you scrub. The perfect eyeliner...fah getta bout it!!</li>
    <li> In not sure if this was a real brand name or not.  The mascara was very dry when I opened it, and there wasn&#x27;t a lot coming out of tube.  I won&#x27;t by again from here. It was probably old.</li>
    <li> It was not authentic Benefit product.  I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a true &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34;.  I have purchased numerous tubes at Ulta and have never had a problem until now.  This one had a purple tube and silver top.  The brush was so soft and limp, I could hardly get it on my eyelashes.  Also, the mascara was SO stringy that each time I put it in the tube and pulled it out, I had about 2 inches of literal &amp;#34;string&amp;#34;.  Awful!!  Now I&#x27;m worried that it may have been a demonstrator and hope I don&#x27;t get an infection.</li>
    <li> have tried so many mascaras, this one is my favorite, definitely gives a bold lash!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted and at a great price! Arrived quickly and packed very well. Thanks for saving me a trip to ulta.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I asked my husband to buy this product for me...one of the best if not the best mascara in the market, much better that any 3d expensive fiber one it really gives you pretty longer and fuller eyelashes !fast PRIME shipping is included in the price 2-3 days! Highly recommended. Cheapest They&#x27;re real mascara on amazon just so you know;)</li>
