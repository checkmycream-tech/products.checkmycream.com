<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are well made but the opening of the cutting blades is very small and does not allow a curved nail into the cutting site without much difficulty. They don&#x27;t work as well as the $1.68 clippers my wife buys from Walmart.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when I got these clippers, my nails were recently clipped using an inferior product, so I couldn&#x27;t leave this review immediately. But I have now possessed these for for several weeks, and I&#x27;ve successfully tested the clippers on 18 of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands:&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs (both left and right): These were the easiest by far. Like a hot knife through something kinda buttery.&lt;br /&gt;Pointer fingers (both left and right): This was a little more difficult. I had really let my pointer fingernails go, and required soaking my fingers in a solution of vinegar, lemon, and bacon fat before I felt comfortable bringing anything metal close to them.&lt;br /&gt;Middle fingers (both left and right): I was able to use these clippers to mold my middle fingernails to beautiful works of art, if I do say so myself. My left fingernail is sculpted to resemble the great an a TIE-Fighter from Star Wars. My right fingernail has been crafted in the likeness of my ex. I haven&#x27;t shown her yet.&lt;br /&gt;Ring finger (right): Successful test, but I found the ambient screaming a bit distracting.&lt;br /&gt;Ring finger (Left): I never tested this finger, I decided to let my nail continue to grow. I have my reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Pinky finger (both left and right): It went OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet:&lt;br /&gt;Toes (most of them): I found the experience to be similar to taking a really sharp machete through dense jungle undergrowth. These experience does not really reflect upon the quality of the clippers, however. They&#x27;re just great.&lt;br /&gt;Large Toe, Left foot: DO NOT USE THE CLIPPERS ON THIS TOE! I was halfway done before I realized. I was careless and failed to understand. Please make sure you do not.</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy clippers!  I hate paying a gazillion dollars for a pair of clippers and get home and they are flimsy and dull - these are great!  I would definitely purchase them again - as I know I will have too since my teenagers always seem to misplace them, ugh.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this clippers. They worked great.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had! It&#x27;s sharp, sleek, durable, and works great! The smaller one is perfect for travel or on the little ones! I will most definitely purchase for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> They are nail clippers... What more can I say lol Although I did find the built in emery board works better than most.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers, work great, easy-to-use, and has a built in file, as well as a keyhole for keychain.</li>
    <li> We seem to be always losing our clippers so I bought some just with the intention of using them as a backup.  Little did I know that they would become my favorite instead.  I love these! They clip well and I have no issues with them.  I highly recommend them.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> nice and sharp!!! have not had a problem with them since i recieved them!</li>
    <li> These work great and are great quality!</li>
    <li> Nice finger nail clippers. Very sturdy and cut nicely.</li>
    <li> The clippers are sharp, and the design of the handle and fulcrum provides plenty of leverage for even the toughest nails.</li>
    <li> Very well built, have stood up against a large family. Great for all ages.</li>
    <li> These clippers are really nicely made made..And work just wonderful when clipping your nails...a very sturdy product..</li>
    <li> Smooth and sharp.  Test of time will tell whether they will stand up to rigorous use and cleaning.</li>
    <li> What can I say? These work. Very sharp so be careful.</li>
    <li> sturdy clippers-cut easily</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, very satisfied with the item, nothing beats 1$.</li>
    <li> I love these. They work perfect.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome set.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with these clippers</li>
    <li> I love it and I used only once , it seems working very well for me</li>
    <li> Wonderful clippers! Clean cut without nail splitting, don&#x27;t require a lot of force to work.leave nice edge to nail &amp; glad I purchased them!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used the large clippers, they spring and broke into 3 pieces. Junk</li>
    <li> Love these clippers.  Easy to use design.  I love the curved handle.  Perfect for my fat fingers.</li>
    <li> I like that they&#x27;re solidly constructed out of stainless steel, fit comfortably in one hand. It cut your nails fast &amp; easy, &amp; i got it with the great promotional price.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t the least expensive clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought, but far and away the best.</li>
    <li> Yep, best clippers I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Not Impressed. I was expecting a better function after reading the reviews. The form and grip are excellent but I was disappointed  in the leverage and cutting action. I have a basic set from the 1960s made in the USA that I&#x27;ve had for over 35 years now that actually out perform these. I might be inclined to try one of the less expensive clippers sets and I&#x27;m guessing that other than the traction from the inlay on these I might be just as happy with the leverage and cut.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Way better than the common drugstore variety. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST clippers I have ever used -- and I&#x27;m 72 yrs. old!!</li>
    <li> Love the curving to the handle. Easier to hold. It also has a file attached to the back of the clipper. Really like that part. Wouldn&#x27;t trade these for anything.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  In contrast to some clippers found elsewhere and reviewed on Amazon (made in China), the clippers are designed and manufactured to actually close.  Also, the clippers are sharp and made of good quality steel.  Where are they made?  In the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> Over my entire life I have never trimmed my nails with anything but a $2 nail clipper bought at the local department store.  This was fine for me because I had no idea there could be anything better.  Nail clippers are nail clippers right?  Well, I don&#x27;t feel that way anymore after using these MoxyCut clippers.  The cut is so precise and true and clean.  Before, with lesser quality clippers, I would often not get them to cut all the way through.  I would then have to either make another cut (or two) or try to pull the nail off (not recommended) where that last tiny piece was hanging to remove the clipping.  I think cleanup of clippings is easier with the Moxy too because with the precise cuts you get less and larger clippings to dispose.</li>
    <li> The toenail clipper broke on one of the first few times I tried to use it. The metal snapped cleanly off where the lever handle presses against the body. I&#x27;ve never had a pair of nail clippers break so easily before, even ones that cost a quarter of these. These are definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that if you buy these from Five Star Quality, they&#x27;ll spam you to beg for 5 star reviews. That&#x27;s my only guess as to why these have such a high rating.</li>
    <li> I actually got these at a low promotional price. I was asked to leave my honest feedback, but wasn&#x27;t told what to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I tried these, I threw my old clippers away. Easy to grip, the stainless steel makes clipping nails no problem. Don&#x27;t have issues with it not cutting all the way through like other sets. Plus, it&#x27;s not super loud when clip your thicker nails (thumbs).</li>
    <li> Receieved this product to review. Very sturdy! Love having both sizes. Great product to have!</li>
    <li> Finally decided to buy a good set of clippers after breaking cheap ones and finding those sometimes ineffective on tougher toenails.  This set met my needs and expectation.  They are very sturdy and effective.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These clippers seriously are amazing. They sre sharp. I had to order another set cause everybody in the house wants some. I love how on the inside it has s little nail file. These clippers are the best ive ever used.</li>
    <li> These clippers work just like all the others except these clippers cut smoothly with little effort even on the toughest of nails.</li>
    <li> I got these for a great promotional price and I was surprised at how well made they look and feel. They are sharp  which is great..I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I only use the toe clippers; both for my toes and my fingers. I find a get a better clip that way. I like these clippers and find them better made and more effective than the normal commercial clippers. My only complaint is that the file (they call it an emory board, but I call it a file) is a little small. It should be used in one direction only, they tell me.</li>
    <li> Very well made and effective compared to others I have used. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sharp enough to cut nails</li>
    <li> they are clippers, made in the usa, dont feel cheap, they are pretty nice.</li>
    <li> Great grip and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great. I don&#x27;t have to use much fore to clip my nails. They don&#x27;t slip out of my hand as well.</li>
    <li> These Nail clippers by MoxyCut are a quality set to own for grooming both fingernails and toe nails. We purchased the set in&lt;br /&gt;a promotion for personal use, honest evaluation and review purposes. They are nice and sharp, and do a great job clipping thick&lt;br /&gt;toenails, cutting through effortlessly.  The stainless steel construction is sturdy, and made to last.  Nice clippers at a reasonable&lt;br /&gt;advertised sale price.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Loved them, they are very sturdy</li>
    <li> The clippers work great.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews, so many people were saying how great these clippers were, so I bought them.  First thing I noticed was the plastic insert inside the flip handle looks cheap and the nail file is placed right in the center which makes it almost completely useless.  I began trying to cut my little toe nails with the smaller clipper and had trouble getting the edge under my nail, when I clipped it, it cut it shorter, way too short.  I have never cut my nails so inaccurately, as I&#x27;m even a licensed manicurist and have cut many toe nails in my life.  When I compared the design of these next to a regular clipper, I could see the edge was at a different angle, thicker...sharp, but worthless to me.</li>
    <li> these are great!!!! i love the grips too...use all the time</li>
    <li> Great product! Very sturdy, I believe these nail clippers will last forever! Or as long as we can keep up with them.</li>
    <li> When I first saw these, they looked like they would be easier to hold !! And when I picked them up, and could feel and see how well they were made, I tried them out !! And I took my time to see how they were going to work. Because I have trouble feeling things in my hands, I was always picking up my other clippers, after they slipped out of my hands !! And after two months of using the MoxyCut clippers,  I have not dropped them once !! They are so easy to hold and use!! I&#x27;m ordering another set !! These are so well made, it may be the last time I have to buy !!</li>
    <li> Unique design. Sharp, sturdy construction. Built in emery board is nice too. Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> The small nail clippers work great on finger nails, but the large clippers do not open wide enough to cut my toe nails. Holding the clippers next to each other, you can see that the cutter gap on the large clipper is smaller than the gap on the small clippers. This could be a manufacturing problem.</li>
    <li> I like them. Nice and sharp, cutting cleanly. The only thin I miss is not having a flip out file on the toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> The toenail clipper stood up to very hard and thick nails without breaking as others have.  However, the opening was too narrow to easily cut some of the very curved nails.  All in all a decent set.</li>
    <li> Both pairs work great and both pairs easily work great on the fingernails.</li>
    <li> Best part is that my husband can put this on his key ring so they won&#x27;t be lost! Clippers work great!</li>
    <li> They are quite a bit smaller than I thought they would be. Quality seems to be very good, but I will probably get something a little larger for my hands.</li>
    <li> Strudy and easy to use</li>
    <li> Great clippers. A couple of times, it did not seem to clip. So, did some squeezing like the instructions said without trying to actually clip. Then they worked great. Like the nail file on each clipper.</li>
    <li> Sharp with a nice size opening.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp. Very easy to use. My boyfriend&#x27;s toenails are really thick. I have broken many clippers cutting them. it was not a challenge for these babies. Clip clip done!!! And they are still in one piece,</li>
    <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;MoxyCut Best Nail Clipper - Stainless Steel&amp;#34; set as a gift for my father.  He said they are the best nail clippers he has EVER used (and he&#x27;s 83 years old!) - it was really kind of funny that he got so excited over them.  So, I must definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> good quality nice and sharp</li>
    <li> Dull after a shorter period of time than another brand, plus there is no inner nail cleaner part.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and sharp.Cuts very clean and perfectly.The big one can easily cut my stubborn toe nail without any additional effort.Two clipper does give the benefit of using large one on toe nail and small one for small fingersPerfect for messy person like me who doesn&#x27;t remember where I kept clipper after using it last time so having additional clipper comes handy.I like to keep small one in my hand bag so that I can trip my chipped nail even when I am outside.I loved the grip and non slippery padding.I got this at discounted price as a part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great set of nail clippers!  Good design, sleek handles, thick metal and sharp blades -- what else could you ask for?  Good choice, and I like the smaller set to use on my son! :)</li>
    <li> These are high quality and heavily made clippers. Very Sharp..hope they stay tat way...burt really most clippers are only good for a year for me.</li>
    <li> They get the job done...</li>
    <li> These clippers are firm to the grip, I give it that. But it has a tendency to also clip some skin on the periphery, something my old clippers never did to me. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain why this happens. Maybe it&#x27;s the curvature of the clipper where it&#x27;s too wide or not curved enough. It does clip my nails pretty good though, but I can&#x27;t throw away my old ones because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get tired of this set clipping a little skin off all the time that I might resort back to my old clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t have the swiveling metal file my old clipper does, I miss that.</li>
    <li> I give these a 4 star.   The first pair broke when I used them but the company quickly reshipped a new set and refunded half the cost.  I have used the new ones many times and they work really well</li>
    <li> very poor cutting quality</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8caa08f37ad5875d2e9647bf9a93af7b]]I have purchased a lot of fingernail and toenail clippers of varying brands, but never realized how poor those were until I tried these MoxyCut clippers.  They are one of the best quality clippers I&#x27;ve used.  Of course, I&#x27;m used to cheap drugstore clippers and these don&#x27;t even compare.  They not only cut better, but they look better, last longer and are easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my video review, I show exactly how these look and how they compare to typical clippers.  If this video was helpful, please click on &#x27;yes&#x27; below.  Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> These are a nice set of clippers. I just used them and they are very sharp which made them easy to use. Also liked the raised bumps in the handles which makes them easier to grip.</li>
    <li> good cutters fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product! Clips my nails perfectly! Would recommend to anyone to use!</li>
    <li> I love that they are sturdy, and in 2 different sizes. One is perfect for me, the other one is perfect for my daughter. The handle, when you flip it, has a white plastic to help you grip, and a little strip to file the nail, which is really handy. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used love them!!</li>
    <li> Cut through nails with no issues. Stylish,  and easy to use</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  Very sharp, with a clean cut.  Solidly built.</li>
    <li> I have used these nail clippers a few times and I have only one word to describe them...Legit!</li>
    <li> Small built in nail file on handle too. Great quality</li>
    <li> Love them!!! They smoothly cut through even my son&#x27;s super thick nails!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These clippers have a really nice feel to them, they clip so smoothly as well. The sharpness makes it a quick clip, no issues what so ever</li>
    <li> Works great! Well made.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> Used toe nail clippers one time and they broke!  I mean, the very first clip!  The fingernail clippers are still good!  Such a shame, as I really liked the shape and sleekness of these clippers.  They sent me a replace set right away.  No issues with current set.</li>
    <li> I finally have a pair of nail clippers that are sharp to the point. Cutting nails can really be a task for us ladies. I get all worked up cutting my right hand nails with my left hand because if the nail cutter is not sharp enough then I just cant do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail clippers are sharp and durable. It trims the nails easily and the small clipper gives great precision. The clipper has a nail file too so you can have nicely groomed nails at all times. Totally recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Broke the large one clipping my nails the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They contacted me and stated that some had a manufacturing defect. Sent me a new pair that works great.</li>
    <li> Great clippers - and good looking, too.  Love the built-in file.</li>
    <li> Good clippers - easy to use, and stayed sharp.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about their claims of working better than normal nail clippers.  It&#x27;s true!  They ar much easier to squeeze and they are sharper and cut easier than other nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Toe nail clippers should not be designed with a curved cutting edge</li>
    <li> Great product. Fair price not over priced, Would and will buy again if the need ever happens again.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, these clippers are some nice gear!  They cut with little effort, and leave a clean cut.  The built in file works well too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could get this excited about a set of clippers, but these are really the bomb.  Why? They are simply the sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using. I unwrapped them as soon as they arrived and tested them out via an overdue (long winter!) home mani-pedi, and I was shocked at how easy it was to trim even the stubbornest big toenail. When you have the right tool for the job, suddenly the job is easy!  Very cool design, and very functional clippers.</li>
    <li> this is literally the best and i think last pair of nail clippers i own and will ever buy, definitely recommend them to friends, family, and strangers alike :P it even has nail files built in to the handle to make the entire process that much easier.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of clippers.  Nice feel in the hands.</li>
    <li> These work great. Very sharp, so they cut through my nails easily. The nail file doesn&#x27;t swing out like most nail clippers, it&#x27;s mounted under the main handle. The kind that swing out always annoy me. Also, the handle doesn&#x27;t risk slipping, because the fulcrum is very well designed. Already sent a few out as gifts.</li>
    <li> Extremely sturdy and precise!&lt;br /&gt;I threw out all my other nail clippers, these are a thousand times better.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty clippers with built in nail file, pretty cool</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with these... they aren&#x27;t super strong, I feel like they can get warped very easily.  They&#x27;re effective for now tho.  Thank you for exchanging your product for my review.</li>
    <li> So my husband considers himself a nail clipper connoisseur. In fact he walks around every where with a set of nail clippers in his pocket to clip whenever he wants to. So I gave him these clippers to him to try out. He was very pleased with them and commented on how sturdy and sharp they were. All the nail edges were smoothly and neatly trimmed by these clippers. My husband will now be replacing the name brand clippers in his pocket with the Moxycut clippers to carry around all day and trim edges as he needs to.</li>
    <li> I received this clipper set for a VERY good deal and I am so happy that I got them! They are phenomenal! My husband has super thick toenails and one of his toenails has a callous underneath it. I have no idea why either. Anyway, I digress... Most of the time it takes forever to get his toenails clipped, but with these clippers, he got them clipped really quick. They are very sharp and make nail clipping a complete breeze. On top of that, they look really cool. My husband and I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> Got these and they work perfect. I love that they cut so smooth!</li>
    <li> These work great. My hubby has very thick toenails and it was jo problem at all with these.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers!! Well made and easy to use. I love the fact that each pair has a small file. And they look so fancy :)</li>
    <li> Great quality! Sharp and durable, sure to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers. made from quality materials. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should write a review because I thought all clippers are the same how can you possibly say anything that would make a difference; but then my fiance used them and he has &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; toe nails but these clippers cleanly snipped through his toe nails like butter. Will never buy another pair of clippers again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these. Very durable clippers, I received the MoxyCut Fingernail and Toenail Clippers at a promotional discount for review purposes. All thought and opinions are my own and are not influenced by anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me and my kids... awesome !</li>
    <li> These work great.  Good value</li>
    <li> I got these for a great promotional price and I was surprised at how well made they look and feel. They are sharp and cut nails quick and easy, which is great when you have to do they quick with kids. I liked that the inside had the white plastic with a built in nail file, it just made them more unique to me. Great product!</li>
    <li> These are very well made. They are strong and sharp. There is a nail clipper and a toe nail clipper. Where the rounded part is there is a nail file under it on both clippers. These are safe/strong enough to clip infants nails.</li>
    <li> Got these for a steal and I&#x27;m so proud of them! They are super sharp so they clip effortlessly. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I received them a few days back and think its great how there are 2, 1 for your fingernails and 1 for your toenails. They are extremely durable, not at all like the flimsy ones I have picked up from the grocery store in the past. They just feel so solid! They are strong too! They cut the nail quickly and don&#x27;t leave any jagged edges. I am fond of these already!</li>
    <li> First impression, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the packaging. The clippers themselves are also a bit smaller than clippers I have purchased in the past. Overall, they seem to be good quality, solid stainless steel and are sharp enough to make cutting your nails not difficult. I really like the enamel/grip built into the thing you push down on on top. It helps so that your fingers aren&#x27;t sliding all over the place as you cut it. However, I do have one major problem with the big clipper. The space between the clip part where you put your nail is way too narrow. I compared it with my old faithful clipper and its about half the height. Since its so narrow, you have to be accurate about putting your nail in, and if your toenails aren&#x27;t straight out each side but are curved down on the sides, it will be difficult to get the clippers over that space. Just my honest unbiased experience.</li>
    <li> Great product; delivered fast</li>
    <li> Use the small clippers on my toddlers nails. Love the grip on the handle to get a better hold while he squirms!</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. These are heavy and sturdy and are an excellent made product. Would recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> The instruments are a little small and as a result don&#x27;t give as much leverage as some others.  They are very sharp and the issue my be my learning curve.  With most clippers I tend to break the nail while clipping.  My nails are brittle and I was hoping the sharp cutting blade would give me a clean cut that can be filed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try a multi-cut approach to see if I can get the results I want.</li>
    <li> Great elegant set of clippers. Contacted the seller who was very helpful. I especially like the rounded tops so when they are stored there are no sharp edges. When opened the flat side has very nice non-slip material. Great to have two different sized clippers covering all finger/toe sizes in a family.</li>
    <li> Quality product, attractive packaging, sharp edge and easy to use.  I am actually upset that my nails don&#x27;t grow faster so I could use this product more often.</li>
    <li> Product was awesome and easy to use.  So much precision that I can use them on my 4 year old.  I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love these. They are easy to handle and clip smoothly</li>
    <li> I was extremely impressed with these! They are very durable and fit comfortably in your hand. Thinking of ordering another pair to hide in my beauty kit!</li>
    <li> Great product! I was shocked by the great quality!</li>
    <li> I have received this product without charge/discount price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own Thanks love these very picky on my clippers but I really like these nice clean cut!</li>
    <li> This clippers are excellent! really good quality...Shipping fast...I recommend this product. Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great quality</li>
