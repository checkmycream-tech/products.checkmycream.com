      <li>It makes you feel very clean.  </li>
      <li>its pretty good</li>

      <li>But make sure you use a moisturizer - it&#x27;s very drying!</li>
      <li>This is soap and it cleans you just like soap should, but I guess I was thinking it&#x27;d have a more interesting fragrance or that it would be a real super exfoliating soap or extra moisturizing or something.  </li>

      <li>It made my skin itch at first, but then it was okay on my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been well reviewed so I&#x27;ll only cover a few points. This is fantastic soap for all ethnicities. To me the scent is quite mild and my girlfriend likes it. A few reviewers have mentioned that it dried their skin, though this has not been my experience. Of all the soaps I have used this has done the best in not drying my skin at all, which is usually the case.&lt;br /&gt;  As others have mentioned this soap will stain a white washcloth so use a dark brown or black cloth. Also I did get a little on a white towel once when I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t rinse off as well as I should have, but otherwise have had no problems with residual soap staining towels. Just rinse off as usual an you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues. The soap will leave some dark runoff in the tub but it&#x27;s easily washed away with a little water.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I use it on my face and it helps to clear acne. But make sure you use a moisturizer - it&#x27;s very drying!</li>
    <li> My daughter started using African black soap for her complexion, and found that it helped.  Then she found out her neighbor has used it for years and swears by it, too. She was always careful to buy free trade brands.  I don&#x27;t know about this brand, but I just got my first order.  I LOVE the smell, and it lathers instantly and lavishly.  Although it won&#x27;t stain your shower or tub, it does melt easily and can leave brown drips. She always kept hers in a plastic dish on the side of the tub, which I think is a helpful idea. It may look a little untidy, but it cleans up fine.    I was actually thinking about giving some as gifts. An exotic bath bar like this you can&#x27;t find just anywhere!</li>
    <li> Have been using this brand of black soap for three+ years now. Multiple purchases thru Amazon... and last time I purchased a dozen.  Will last a long time.  Love this soap. I keep the bar of soap out of the spray of the shower and it stays solid (see picture).</li>
    <li> I love this product! I live in Northern Maine with very long winters that dry my skin out. I always had flakes and peeling skin. Other products were too harsh and burned my skin. This does the trick and leaves my skin smooth &amp; clean. Once a week with an apricot scrub and my skin is radiant and flake-free. I finally have no red blotches, scales or flakes.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the unintentionally hilarious name, you will find a wonderful soap. I purchased Dud-osun as the latest addition to my eczema fighting arsenal.   Pros  Nicely priced  No powerful or lingering smell(great for us sensitive skinned folks)  The soap seems to last a long time and it lathers wonderfully  Cons  This soap is brown to the core! It you leave it on a bathroom window sill(like me) it will drip brown streaks until it dries. Leave it in a white loofah mitt at night, in the morning you will find a mitt that looks like someone wiped their butt with it.  The ingredients could spend a little more time in the mortar and pestle. I once aimlessly used the soap sans loofah mitt, and ended up giving myself a 5 inch long burning scratch across my chest. I was horrified to find a sharp little twig embedded in the soap.  I will recommend this soap only as a TEMPORARY fix. When my eczema was in the angry, weepy stage, the DO soap helped to heal it. Once my skin returned to normal, I found this soap to be very drying and a little harsh on the face. Also I suggest keeping this soap in a dish, lest you end up with brown puddles everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
    <li> Saw this on a YouTube video and I was like it&#x27;s not that expensive so why not waste the money. The reason I purchased was because I&#x27;ve been having breakouts a lot lately and wanted to see if this would help. Well it started off helping and I could swear I think my face looks a lot better. Like BRIGHTER OR SOMETHING. the breakouts are still coming but are minimal compared to what it was.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap with hopes of soothing excema on my foot and maybe clearing some acne on my face. This stuff is STRONG and INTENSE. It burned my face after just a few seconds, but was okay on my feet. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, so if you do, stay away.I didn&#x27;t notice a real difference in the excema, but it did clean nicely and smells pretty good. I would not give this another try.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks and leaves the shower stinking of it&#x27;s aroma.  Also, I find my skin still itchy and dry.  This stuff is supposed to have all of these wonderful ingredients to help with itching and dry skin.  Does it really help?  Not with me.  Good luck.  Also, soap bar $1.90 shipping $4.50.  Never again......</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because it came recommended for people with eczema. I&#x27;ve used it for the past week or so-- it works great as soap-- my only complaint is that it runs all over the place leaving brown streaks everywhere when it&#x27;s wet. I keep it in a ziplock bag now when I&#x27;m not using it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was weary of this soap at first, because I had been using only coconut oil for the past 6 months. When I switched, I didn&#x27;t notice any change! It&#x27;s amazing and smells nice! I would advice keeping it in some sort of container though.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, great alternative to medicated acne soaps. Just remember to keep it in a travel soap dish!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything amazing about the soap. works well and smells good! guess it&#x27;s just a preference kind of thing.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it for my face my hair and my body. it really cleans off the oils but can be drying so I use virgin coconut oil to moisturize afterwards. will repurchase</li>
    <li> I heard about this soap thru a vlogger and I ordered it! It was great and all but it did dry my skin even though I have oily/combo skin. Be sure to use a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> only use it for body wash .. pretty clean , but besides that nothing so special .maybe i just use for few weeks</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the intent to even my skin tone. After the first day of use, I was getting compliments about my skin. And it was literally glowing, my face looked even and toned. After a week more of continued use, I started to notice that I was looking sweaty all the time. Not only that,  but I could rub my face and have enough oil to lotion my hands. My sister had the same results. It was great for a week but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this soap as a body wash and it works great. My skin is very sensitive and this soap didn&#x27;t break me out. It arrived very, very quickly, as well! My skin did dry up a little bit but that could just be because I moved to where it is more dry.</li>
    <li> We have a Great Dane who needed a soap that would not only help his skin but make him shine, feel good and keep that skin healthy. What a wonderful African tree soap. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister  who has dry skin. She mentioned the dis coloring of the shower where the soap would melt. But that is a easy remedy. She said the soap was worth it</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and after reading the reviews decided it was worth a try.  DO NOT BUY if you have eczema.  After taking it out of the carton all I could smell was the perfume ordor coming from this.  I tried the soap instead of giving it to my son and it irrated my hands where I had a slight outbreak of eczema.  We threw it out.</li>
    <li> Great soap and I keep ordering it..I love it..naturally I feel better because its natural. It was less expensive too..I will order it again.  I wish I had more  ...I run out fast..</li>
    <li> Love this soap! By far my  favorite. Skin looks much better. This is not magic but I like this much better than any other I I&#x27;ve ever tried. I do not think a bar lasts long though. Maybe a month to month and a half. it&#x27;s natural and becomes soft and dissolves easily try to keep it dry after using to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> This soap cleans, for sure! I&#x27;m not so sure about all the reviews that say that it clears acne or blemishes. I only used one bar so it may not be a fair assessment but, it did not win me over. It does dry your skin like some other reviews say and I can&#x27;t remember how i felt about the smell, I think it just smells clean to me. It does make a mess in the soap dish, that doesn&#x27;t bother me terribly. It just did not do what I wanted or perform the way the reviews led me to believe.</li>
    <li> It was just ok. I have rosacea, and this did not help. Besides that, on my white washcloths, it would leave a darkish brown residue, that did not all wash out after laundry after repeated use. Thankfully, I used some old washcloths for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I didnt love this product at all. :-(</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have suffered with acne for years. I started using this as my daily face wash and boom, no acne!! I stopped for a week and switched to a different wash, almost instantly I started to break out again. Switched back and it dried everything up! Side note: Make sure you use a tray to store it on though or it will leave a funky black mark on your sink.</li>
    <li> No.1 : I&#x27;m a DIE HARD Amazon fan... But DO NOT buy this soap on Amazon.. You get it at &#x27;whole foods/or any other grocery store at a cheaper price(?!) leave alone the shipping cost and Add-on item drama here.&lt;br /&gt;No. 2: Other reviewers here and elsewhere claimed about 3 main effects of this product:&lt;br /&gt;  a). All Natural products (Oh yeah., that is true and you sure do get a tropical forest effect in your bathroom..Hmmm Smells Herbal)&lt;br /&gt;  b). Skin lightening effect (Are you kidding me?! My brown skin was much more healthier and radiant before using this  product)&lt;br /&gt;  c). soothing effect to mild Eczema (NOOOOOO WAY... You just got to jump into a moisturizer pile if you ever get to take bath in this soap)&lt;br /&gt;No. 3: Will i recommend this product? Should you really read this point?! Woah...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my acne..nothing has worked until I purchased this! Cleared up my skin without drying it out too much. First soap I&#x27;ve used where my skin actually feels clean afterwards!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap to see if it would help my acne. It didn&#x27;t.  Since it has some type of dark, mud like component it left a \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; mess of my shower and kept oozing for quite awhile.   Despite my habit of using every bit of a soap bar, I just had to toss this one out after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this soap in January, rarely does my skin ever break out. My breakouts have literally stopped. One bar lasts nearly forever because it lathers so good. As far as clearing up dark marks, nothing dramatic but there is some improvement, although I attribute that to this combined with daily exfoliation and ambi. I used to use all types of different products, proactiv, clean and clear advantage, clearasil, everything but I don&#x27;t use any anymore, accept clean and clear scrub. Over, it&#x27;s a fantastic product, it eliminates acne and it does have an impact on the marks eventually.</li>
    <li> Great soap, works wonderfully. Love the fact that it is a natural. I had no allergic reactions from this soap, and I am allergic to many soaps. The only reason I probably will not purchase in the future is the scent. It is not a bad scent, just not quite what I enjoy.</li>
    <li> face seemed dry despite</li>
    <li> The first thing that I noticed about Du Du Osun was the smell. This soap has a very unique earthy sweet grass smell, very pleasant on the skin, not over powering at all, just lightly scented enough so that you will find yourself wanting to soap and soap all the time. This soap upon first using, I noticed that it made my skin lighter and helped with the acne on my back. I use it on my face and body, it is gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Although Du Du Osun is not drying, it isn&#x27;t super moisturizing either, you might want to apply lotion afterwords. Another thing you will notice if you choose to use this is that the water washes black, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, it wont stain your skin or bathtub at all. One warning though, this soap has bits of exfoliating pieces, so make sure there isn&#x27;t a sharp piece when using this on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I recommend this to everyone and I think it would make great gifts for friends and family.</li>
    <li> great soap - refreshing, nice texture, i like the color.  I have used it for years and recommend it. Yes</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It makes you feel very clean.  And the price is not too outrageous.  The smell is refreshing too.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have not had any problems with the soap. It has helped me clear my skin up.</li>
    <li> I didi&#x27;t see this product do what&#x27;s its suppose to do...I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> It made my skin itch at first, but then it was okay on my skin. I might get more soon.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, but it&#x27;s too harsh for family members and dissolves very quickly. Perhaps because the one we got was nearly out of date when it arrived?</li>
    <li> Clears up acne super fast</li>
    <li> This soap is what I have been searching for. I tend to break out in black spots on my cheeks. I used Cetaphil, Clean &amp; Clear, and Ambi and none of those did what this inexpensive soap did for me. I am not kidding you, I am addicted to this stuff. Also you can use it and make a mask, which gives better/quicker results.</li>
    <li> This is a totally unique product and I find it WONDERFUL as a face soap.  I have mild breakouts etc. and this cleared my forehead up in 1 day.  1 day.  1 day.  Love the way it makes my face feel and I am a believer.  I have somewhat oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have had some dry skin patches on my abdomen for several years and the medication my doctor prescribed wouldn&#x27;t take it away.  After using Dudu-Osun, my dry skin patch disorder went away.  What a relief!  I was so impressed that I bought a whole case of the Dudu-Osun to have on-hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap as I read multiple reviews and claims of how wonderful it cleaned most peoples skin but for me not sure the soap is doing what others claim but I love to bathe with it. I feel refresh. I am not sure I would recommend it to friends though.</li>
    <li> This soap is not the best for oily skin.  There are two other soaps I can think of which do the job much better.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Doesn&#x27;t stink, cleans well, lasts a long time, have already bought more. Would recommend, very nice lather too.</li>
    <li> I only brought one bar, now I wish I brought more.it left my skin soft and clean feeling. great buy.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received my black soap which is on the 9th of this Month, April. I wash my face and twice that day. It is now the 12th and I am seeing AMAZING results. I have suffered with acne and blemishes since my teenage years. I&#x27;m 42 years of age and have tried everything from Proactive, vitamin e oil, prescribe acne medication etc and nothing seem to work. My blemishes are already lightening and my acne bumps has dried up, gone. The only complaint I have with this AMAZING soap is that it does dry out my skin. I have ordered a jar of Shea Butter from Afrikan  Republic and hope that this butter does AMAZING things for my skin as DuDu-Osun soap.</li>
    <li> The soap was okay. It had a good smell but really did not help with any of the things it was touted as helping.</li>
    <li> I fell in LOVE with this soap. When it first arrived, I could smell the aroma of the soap through the package. Once I started using it, I loved the way it makes my skin feel. Very fresh and very clean. Ive also noticed that its fading my old acne scars. I cant wait to order more. The only drawback is that it will leave your skin dry. So when using this soap, its best to use a well hydrating lotion, or the BEST option is to use extra virgin coconut oil to condition and bring back the elasticity to your skin, which I use because Im using more herbal, more natural products on my body.</li>
    <li> I used this soap for over a month...its very drying to the skin and caused breakouts. I will NOT be buying this soap again!!!</li>
    <li> My face feels fabulous after washing with this soap and it has a very pleasant smell. My skin texture has definitely improved after about three weeks of regular usage. Personally I found that it is just a little too drying to use every day or more than once a day, so I now alternate with an oil cleanser and it works great.  Watch out -- it will drip brown everywhere, and make sure you rinse thoroughly before using white towels, etc.</li>
    <li> I guess when I saw a big bar of black tropical ingedients soap I figured it&#x27;d be especially good at something.  But really it&#x27;s just a regular bar of soap.  It lathers up well and all, the smell is generically soapy.  It doesn&#x27;t last super long, considering the size of the bar.  This is soap and it cleans you just like soap should, but I guess I was thinking it&#x27;d have a more interesting fragrance or that it would be a real super exfoliating soap or extra moisturizing or something.  But really it&#x27;s just regular.</li>
    <li> I ordered one bar about 2 months ago to give it a go...I still have more than half a bar and I use it all over twice a day. I have noticed it leaves your skin literally squeaky clean &amp; tight, feeling soft to the touch, it has been slowly healing my scars, and speeding recovery of cuts and abrasions caused from work. The ONLY problem I have encountered is it starts to sting if you have it on one area for too long. I love this product and will be stocking up! Oh and it smells like a tropical beach</li>
    <li> As promised, and quick as well.</li>
    <li> Do not use this if you have eczema. Invest in some high quality, real african black soap that is made without FRAGRANCE. The fragrances added to this soap is so, so irritating for people with sensitive skin. It made my eczema worse, unlike the natural, unscented african soap that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed after reading and hearing so many reviews about this. It didn&#x27;t really do anything at all for my skin and acne. On top of that, it was so messy to keep because there would just be so many puddles of black soap water everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I keep coming back to it again and again. I consider it a disinfectant soap. I help to heal and cuts or soars on the skin..Please be award it might sting a little. Just a good soap to have a round to clean wounds.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin even drrrrry!! Didn&#x27;t like this product at all, and one star goes for its smell only. Seriously I won&#x27;t order this product anymore!</li>
    <li> it gotten rid of allot of my ance/pimples. not good for black heads but it does work. its pretty good and im defiantly gonna buy some more after im done with this bad</li>
    <li> Great soap but it went too fast</li>
    <li> Recovery..Recovery.. Recovery.. Recovery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing and suitable for oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for bathing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this beautiful soap</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order. I ordered from someone else on July 5th and it still hasn&#x27;t arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from you on July 19th and it&#x27;s here today.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to save a buck isn&#x27;t always the smart thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you sooo much!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of black soap, it keeps my fast clean and keep my bumps away i wash my face with this soap than i moisturize my face with my sweet almond oil</li>
