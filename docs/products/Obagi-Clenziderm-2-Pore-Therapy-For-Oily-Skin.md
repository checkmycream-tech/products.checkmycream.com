      <li>I started using it right away.</li>
      <li>and i feel like it really does clean your face.</li>
      <li>He has very oily skin, just like me!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin with a cooling and clean effect, minimizes pores, decreases oily skin and helps to clear my acne out breaks.  </li>
      <li>This will clear your skin quickly, and your skin will glow.</li>
      <li>I buy it here on Amazon as it is much cheaper than buying it from a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>Coming from a person with very oily/acne</li>
      <li>I bought the set of three from a doctor and now come on to Amazon to buy them because they&#x27;re so much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Thanks to my hormone, I still do break-out during PMS but not as servere.</li>
      <li>REALLY FAST SHIPPING,</li>
      <li>The seal was a little peel top, of course when i first received it i opened it to smell it.</li>
      <li>I find that if you don&#x27;t use them all together the outcome is far less amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kept my skin almost 100% clear since I started using it (which is really unusual for me), and it&#x27;s really helped with blackheads and reducing pore size.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
      <li>BRAND NEW</li>
      <li>This product arrived brand new and sealed as promised.</li>
      <li>This product keeps my face from looking oily and keeps it very clear.  </li>
      <li>At this point, it&#x27;s much better than any of the product that I&#x27;d tried in the past.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
      <li>I am 28 and have struggled with adult acne since I was 20...</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that has a bit of acne.</li>
      <li>prone/ sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My pores appear smaller and my skin has a much smoother softer appearance.</li>
      <li>He uses all 3 products in the Clenziderm acne line and it has completely cleared his skin in just a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything and nothing seemed to clear up my skin COMPLETELY.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, and use this product twice daily.  </li>
      <li>I orginally ordered the whole acne kit, but only like the Pore Therapy.</li>
      <li>The peeling eventually will calm down.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the entire Obagi Clenziderm line for acne sufferers of all ages because it actually works!</li>

<li> I have chronic adult acne that keeps comming back in cycle, especially during PMS.</li>
<li> I bought this item for my 13 year old son who was experiencing typical teenage acne, especially on his forehead and nose.</li>
<li> It does make your face a bit stiff and shiny afterwards, but it really does get down into the pores</li>
<li> But because i realized this toner left my skin a little dried the next day, i started using this toner on my neck and chest</li>
<li> alittle dried the next day.</li>
<li> I never experienced the peeling from this, but the doctor says it is common but not a bad thing.</li>
<li> Just skip step three to every other night.</li>
<li> My products arrived faster than expected too!</li>
<li> This was not sealed like other Obagi products that I have ordered here and at a Doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
<li> In the winter, I use the #2 pore Therapy every other day.(every day</li>
<li> I get a little dry in places)</li>
<li> So I think this is not for sensitive skin for thin skin.</li>
<li> It does not have a bad odor or smell strong and it helps get the little bit of make up you leave on your skin.    </li>
<li> If you ever tried Pro Active and hated it, then this is the right face medicine for you.</li>
<li> Scary what is still left behind after lathering up.</li>
<li> I like the long-lasting minty sensation that it leaves behind.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this product.  </li>

    <li> I use this every morning and night.  My adult acne is finally under control, it even works on cystic acne!!  I can&#x27;t imagine my beauty routine without this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Monday and it was delivered on a Thursday. I started using it right away. By Sunday I saw a HUGE improvement in my skin. I am 33 years old and after my 3rd child my skin went out of control. I have tried everything and nothing seemed to clear up my skin COMPLETELY. I found this product on Amazon and it is AMAZING!!! I use the cleanser in the morning and then i use a milder salicylic acid wash in the evening (St. Ives) with the OBAJI POre Therapy. Once a Day is plenty enough for me. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin tonic.  Works great especially when combined with the cleanser.</li>
    <li> Obagi pore therapy is the best product I have ever used. Over the years I have tried hundreds of products.  Pore Therapy is fantastic.  It leaves my skin with a cooling and clean effect, minimizes pores, decreases oily skin and helps to clear my acne out breaks.  You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this product.  I find the best price for this product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was not sealed like other Obagi products that I have ordered here and at a Doctor&#x27;s office.  The seal was a little peel top, of course when i first received it i opened it to smell it. When I read the return instructions it said return unopened product within 14 days. Oh well i learned another lesson.</li>
    <li> This toner is great to be used in conjunction with the Cleanser from the Clenziderm line.... I have sensitive skin that has a bit of acne. This will clear your skin quickly, and your skin will glow. I use this every day, and my skin is GREAT! In the winter, I use the #2 pore Therapy every other day.(every day I get a little dry in places) In the summer, it&#x27;s EVERY day..... This system is really wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this skin product, it&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s my second purchase and I&#x27;m satisfied. I would recommend this product to everyone, who has moderate oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The price is amazing! I received the product in record time!! Love it, and will buy from them again!</li>
    <li> Received product promptly and in good condition.  I have very oily skin, and use this product twice daily.  My pores appear smaller and my skin has a much smoother softer appearance. Great product</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Have been using fo ryers. It takes stuff off your face even after I have scrubdbed my face clean. Scary what is still left behind after lathering up.</li>
    <li> I bought the set of three from a doctor and now come on to Amazon to buy them because they&#x27;re so much cheaper. This product in particular is great. I find that if you don&#x27;t use them all together the outcome is far less amazing. It does not have a bad odor or smell strong and it helps get the little bit of make up you leave on your skin.

It&#x27;s a well worth process.     If you ever tried Pro Active and hated it, then this is the right face medicine for you.</li>
    <li> I applied this on my nose for a couple of times, not even on my face, but it hurts. So I think this is not for sensitive skin for thin skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my 13 year old son who was experiencing typical teenage acne, especially on his forehead and nose. He has very oily skin, just like me! The pore therapy is excellent for eliminating oiliness. He uses all 3 products in the Clenziderm acne line and it has completely cleared his skin in just a couple weeks. I would highly recommend the entire Obagi Clenziderm line for acne sufferers of all ages because it actually works! I buy it here on Amazon as it is much cheaper than buying it from a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have chronic adult acne that keeps comming back in cycle, especially during PMS. I orginally ordered the whole acne kit, but only like the Pore Therapy. I currently use it in the morning under my make up. I like the long-lasting minty sensation that it leaves behind. I can definately see that it helps control the break-out around my chin and makes my pore seems smaller. Thanks to my hormone, I still do break-out during PMS but not as servere. I see it as insulin to diabetic. At this point, it&#x27;s much better than any of the product that I&#x27;d tried in the past. If you don&#x27;t have a chronic problem like I do, maybe this product will work better on you.</li>
    <li> Obaji Clenziderm products are excellent for deep cystic acne! Very pleased! I will continue to purchase these products in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works really great for my skin.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the Obagi Clenziderm products.  I use the one for \\&quot;oily skin\\&quot;.  Great products that actually keep my face clear.  I am 28 and have struggled with adult acne since I was 20...until then I was acne free.  This product keeps my face from looking oily and keeps it very clear.  I recommend it all the time to ANYONE with this issue!</li>
    <li> I have used Obagi products for five years. My outbreaks are few,if any. I highly recommend Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
    <li> This product arrived brand new and sealed as promised. Being able to purchase Obaji products for much more reasonable prices from this seller has made it possible for me to continue using it! I will be back to order more! My products arrived faster than expected too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi Pore Therapy once a day for about 5 days now and I&#x27;m already seeing an improvement. It&#x27;s kept my skin almost 100% clear since I started using it (which is really unusual for me), and it&#x27;s really helped with blackheads and reducing pore size.  Another great effect it&#x27;s had is making my skin really smooth and soft.  The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that it is somewhat drying -- moisturizer is a must when using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for clogged pores. Used on a daily basis with the Obagi toner you will love this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> This is really good and i feel like it really does clean your face. It does make your face a bit stiff and shiny afterwards, but it really does get down into the pores</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST SHIPPING, EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER. BRAND NEW AS DESCRIBED. LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Coming from a person with very oily/acne prone/ sensitive skin, this is a great toner because it cleans my pores so well but it leaves my skin alittle dried the next day. But after i use this toner on my face, i have a habit of looking at the cotton pads to see how effective the toner is and with this toner the pads are ALWAYS a brownish color. I wash my face twice a day, steam 3xs a week, exfoliate with glycolic acid once a wk, and use bentonite clay and STILL this toner gets every last bit of gunk off of my face. But because i realized this toner left my skin a little dried the next day, i started using this toner on my neck and chest and I still got the same results. Lastly, this toner does an excellent job of getting rid of ingrown hairs and drying out razor bumps and keeping anywhere on your body clean.</li>
