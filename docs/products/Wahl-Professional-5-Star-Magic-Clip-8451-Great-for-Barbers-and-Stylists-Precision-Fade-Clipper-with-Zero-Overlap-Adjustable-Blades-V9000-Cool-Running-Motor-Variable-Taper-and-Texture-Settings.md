<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with this.  It&#x27;s very powerful and gets the job done quick.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m writing this review from my wife account but I&#x60;m a barber have been for many years now and have use just about every clipper out there and by far these are the best clippers on the market, they&#x60;re better than the 5 star seniors in my opinion, same clipper only difference in the two seniors have a metal housing magic clip have a plastic housing absolute everything else the same except the look and price. The reason I choose the magic clip is because I cut hair all day and the seniors get hot after a few cuts when the magic clip can go as long as you can cut also it&#x60;s lighter in my hand while cutting when the seniors is heavy and your wrist starts to feel fatigue after a while and you absolutely can&#x60;t beat the price of these over the seniors. I&#x60;ve had mine for 3 yrs now and still amazed at how they cut like new after so many haircuts just do your preventive maintenence  on them like cleaning and oiling your blade after each use and they are ready to go. IF anybody have anything negative to say about these clippers they don&#x60;t know about clippers.</li>
    <li> Purchased these yesterday after trying out and returning a brand new set of Oster fast feeds. After all the glowing reviews of the fast feeds I figured seems like what I&#x27;m looking for. The fast feeds sucked I had to make way too many passes on my head like 3or 4 and that was the first cut. I know the Oster is a slower moving blade but I expected more. So I returned them got my money back and purchased the Wahls which by the way I wanted the 5star seniors but the salesperson showed me the only difference between the 5*and the magic was the casing. They are the same clipper same blade and same v9000 motor. Plus the magic was cheaper so I was sold. Got em home and man long story short. These slayed the Osters in every way cut way cleaner cut every hair evenly on one stroke build quality was better and motor. Oh yeah cheaper too but don&#x27;t let the price fool you these are good clippers and can be 0 gapped. Clean fades and tapers just great all round. Don&#x27;t hesitate buy these if you&#x27;re a beginner or pro don&#x27;t matter they should be in your arsenal now.</li>
    <li> Excellant! These clippers are perfect. I would refer any one to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;thank you @;)</li>
    <li> These are the best deal in the Pro lineup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have the strong V9000 motor&lt;br /&gt;They come with a good set of attachments. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;They come with a case (albeit a cheap one)&lt;br /&gt;Has the zero overlap adjustable blade&lt;br /&gt;Works on all hair types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the attachments from other full size clippers including the regular consumer brand type. They fit just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip, you can adjust the blade by using the RED guard as a line up device..&lt;br /&gt;Just loosen the blade screws (with the guard in place) and slide toward the guard and tighten up again. Might need a few tries but it works OK</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son, for his Birthday.  The blades were broken or damaged in some fashion. Amazingly, he wants to try it again! I hope the next one that I just ordered, comes intact!</li>
    <li> It is not what  I expected.  I already have a Wahl product but I bought if I got this &amp;#34;Magic Professional&amp;#34; clipper because I thought it would be smoother and have less vibration.  Not so.  So, I need to return it ASAP, but a return slip did not come with the pkg.  Please advise.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> i like the clipper but unfortunately the clipper does not work with the kind of light or voltage we have in Nigeria. what can I do to get it working so that my son can enjoy using it</li>
    <li> I use to buy the department store clippers and they were cheep and did not last that long. These look like they will be the last I will need to buy. They are well made and Made in the USA!</li>
    <li> so happy with the clipper made my to get them right on time too. for any one looking for clippers can&#x27;t go wrong with a pair wahl professional clippers.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who is in the Army and cuts his hair every week after his other one what starting to act funny. It arrived and was very well made but when he went to cut his hair it was so loud! To the point that he couldnt hear me talking to him right beside him. I&#x27;m not sure if this is an issue with them all or if ours was just broken but we ended up returning it. The size blades were different colors and that was really nice. Bummed it did not work out.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. I have straight, asian hair and I just use this to cut my own hair and do fades. Clips like a beast, doesn&#x27;t get caught. I never ran it for 30 mins straight, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll heat up or not, but as long as you just turn it off while you&#x27;re not using it then I think it&#x27;ll be fine. These are just smooth and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, work a lot better than the ones you can find at walmart or target.</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper, but I personally prefer the extended range of the Wahl Legend</li>
    <li> Does a great job, plenty of power and a lot of accessories. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned, save for one issue - the included combs don&#x27;t cover the typical sizes - lots of extra short sizes, but there was no #5 or #7. Annoying. You&#x27;ll need to purchase those separately.</li>
    <li> Replaced my standard Wahl hair clippers with this.  I wanted more power without breaking the bank.  I guess I expected more power, because it cuts better than my standard clippers, but not like butter as I thought.  Guess for that, you need to spend more money on the Oster Classic 76??  Anyways for the price, this is great!</li>
    <li> The clippers arrived quickly, but the case that they are in was damaged, probably because it was shipped in an envelope instead of a box.</li>
    <li> I finished my son hair cut and my self and this Five Star Magic does not get hot like the others I had tried.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> High quality clippers with good assortment of combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong clippers.  Solid feel in hands.</li>
    <li> Well made ,works great. Love  um.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, very good service</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this product.Carrying case keeps everything organized and safe. The guards keeps my hair at the length I prefer without mistakes.Love my clippers!</li>
    <li> My second set of clippers and by far the best ive owned yet, delivery was early cut my hair cut my sons hair fades came out just how i expected</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers for work since my last pair decided to break in the cord. I am extremely happy as to how quick amazon delivered my package especially on a Sunday which is hard to find. A girl at work has had great luck with her pair that she just bought and recommend that I try. I could not be happier with the serivce and the clippers. The blades run smoothly and the fading is amazing.</li>
    <li> This works well.  It doesn&#x27;t cut hair perfectly, but it is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it doesn&#x27;t come with a case!  That was very frustrating!</li>
    <li> Much higher quality than I expected. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting it to cut.</li>
    <li> CUTS LIKE A PROFESSIONAL BARBER! I CUT A DARK FADE AND A BLOW OUT WITH PROFESSIONAL RESULTS</li>
    <li> PERFECT, much better then my older clippers. and also they include a 1 1/12 guard for better fades !</li>
    <li> Best clipper I bought so far. The motor provides good amount of power and the blades are quite sharp.</li>
    <li> Obviously better than the $15-20 kind from walmart but not any difference in relation to shaving length. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 10 years and have always bought the cheaper kind from walmart, until about two years ago when I bough a $30-35 Andis brand clippers from walmart. The difference between Andis and the other kinds is night and day. After reading the description and the reviews of the Wahl five star I was expecting a closer shave than Andis but they are not even close to being comparable, Andis gives a much much closer shave. The Wahl 5 star has a great weight and you know right away that it&#x27;s well made but DOES NOT give a close shave.</li>
    <li> When my clippers arrived they had a V9000 motor sticker on the box. I could not find any information on the internet so I called Wahl and they told me it is a new more powerful motor -- the website just has not been updated yet.    These clippers are just perfect for our family needs. My oldest son&#x27;s hair is so thick the &#x27;home&#x27; products just could not handle it very nicely. The Magic Clip&#x27;s handle his hair with ease. These clippers are tight and powerful in every way. Sharp, quiet, cool running and precise. Dollar for dollar I could not have done any better.    BONUS: The NEW V9000 motor is 50% more powerful than the V5000. More power is usually a good thing IMHO.    If you buy these clippers you will be very satisfied with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Wahl professional models are excellent. I got a great deal on the 5 star magic clippers through Amazon.  The motor is extremely fast. Cuts any hair like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful, professional results. Great price. I feel like this will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this once I read another review that it now comes with the V5000 motor. I can also verify that statement.     I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 10+ years now. Like the majority I started with Wahl products and eventually worked my way to Oster and the higher brands. This is just as good for half the price. Very satisfied. I had to adjust the motor a little so it didnt pull my hair but it works great now.     Some of the attachments are a bit lose but not enough to sway my opinion on it.     Overall I&#x27;m very happy for the price I paid</li>
    <li> Bought these based on reviews and research. Much nice clipper than I expected. cuts clean and even.  Very well constructed and better motor that my other Wahls. overall good by for my needs.</li>
    <li> Solid, fits well in your hand,works like a dream.Get one and see if it doesn&#x27;t work better than the cheapo products .</li>
    <li> I use this clipper to trim my beard. It cuts smoothly and quietly through my coarse beard hair without tugging or pulling. I&#x27;ve been using it for bi-weekly trims for about 6 months and been very happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package includes length combs, a little brush for cleaning, and oil for the blades.</li>
    <li> It came in a very well packed box and it was shipped very quickly and there was no damage at all</li>
    <li> forever whal! These are really good, not too heavy for their kind, heats a little but seen worse, cant beat the quality/price.</li>
    <li> I use it to buzz cut my own hair, saving $$, time and hassle of getting to the barber, works great on 46 year old crop of finely laid, close cropped graying hair follicles interspersed with bald patches, yeah I know sucks getting old but it beats the alternative.</li>
    <li> Durable, strong clippers, easy to clean, easy to plug in, long chord, lots of extension sizes that work great.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. cuts hair well. the fact that it plugs in is great, since my other wahl trimmer with a rechargable battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after the first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black man, and this set of clippers is decent, but it isn&#x27;t exceptional. I bought this because I have the 5-star Detail Trimmer and shaver, and I love both. These clippers work well like any other that I ever owned. I used to have an Andis Ultra that was about half the price, and it performed pretty much the same, except it was way quieter. These clippers are extremely loud, but if you can get pass that, they will do the job. I just find that I have to make many passes to get all of the hairs on my head and beard down to the same level when I&#x27;m using one of the guard combs. I figured for the added price, and the fact it was part of the 5 star series that I wouldn&#x27;t have that problem. Like I said, it&#x27;s ok for the price, but you could save a few bucks, and buy the andis ultra and get the same results.</li>
    <li> Great clippers love em</li>
    <li> Once I got these clippers in , I felt the quality of the clipper. It is a very high quality clipper. I love it. Iv been using it for about a month and still going like the first time I used it. If you want to do bald fades you may need to adjust it a little closer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber.  I cut my son&#x27;s hair and my nephew&#x27;s.  I used to use the Wahl you could get at Walmart.  I got pretty good with it and could give good fades, but got tired of how many times I had to go over the hair to get it cut.  Did a lot of research on the internet and decided to go with the 5 star Magic (although I got them at Atlanta Barber).  These clippers are GREAT, and do exactly what I want them to.  The motor is very powerful and they cut extremely accurate.  And they are less than $50 !!!!!  You can&#x27;t find a better clipper for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using them for about 4 months now and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Does what it should---cuts hair decisively (without too much noise).  I&#x27;ve had noisy models from lesser brands, but there is a hard-to-describe vibe of quality with this clipper. Besides, I&#x27;m told Wahl is one of the very few brands for which you can buy parts or have any prayer of repairing by yourself if the unit develops a problem out of warranty.  I&#x27;ve had too many budget clippers (corded and cordless) that just die or get dull or sound like a low-flying airplane next to your ear as it yanks-instead-of-cuts your hair.  With the V9000 motor, this model cuts every doggone follicle you put it to in the very first first swipe.  Great way for aging fellas like myself to face male pattern baldness head on!  ;^)  Just cut it way short, and you hardly notice.  And it makes shaving your head a breeze (no pun intended) if that&#x27;s your druthers.  Yup, you can even get other models by Wahl for half the money, but this clipper seems made to last.  And, heck, saving myself $15 (w/o tip) every time I skip the barber shop, it pays for itself totally in less than *three* hair cuts.  No frugal Joe is complete without one!  ;^)  True buy-it-once-in-your-life-type consumers *might* prefer the one particular Wahl Senior model that has the metal housing, but this plastic housing seems durable and (for what little it matters) attractive.  The Senior metal model seems to cost a fair bit more.  BTW: Amazon pricing blew the doors off every bricks-and-mortar source I could find, as well as coming in beneath every retailer online that seemed even halfway-reputable.  Small criticism: the hard plastic storage box mine came in was a little dinged up (didn&#x27;t appear to be a recent shipping wound) which may explain how/why the seller offloads these for so cheap.  Unit itself was untouched and worked perfectly as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut hair how I wanted them too. When using them they would only trim a little of the hair and not the wanted and they did a horrible job packaging these clippers</li>
    <li> For the quality and price doesnt get any better cut amooth and are quiet .</li>
    <li> its good but not as sharp as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Very High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to cut entire head full of thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lots of extras and a case to put it all in.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best clippers I have ever used. it does not get hot, it looks great, it feels great in your hands and the price was great,</li>
    <li> Rock solid, SHARP cutting blades, much better than the cheapo shears that are sold at your local drugstore or mart.  I mainly use them to keep my fuzzy beard nicely trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;There are probably &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; clippers out there, but these have to be at the top of the price per performance ratio.</li>
    <li> So far the 5 Star Magic Clip Cippers are the best I&#x27;ve used. It has a nice Taper level quality. It&#x27;s very easy to work with. Especially when comes to fading. This clipper does live up to it&#x27;s name. Just becareful with the blade because it&#x27;s super sharp. I cut myself a couple of times. All in all I recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good product for a very good price.</li>
    <li> used it twice so far.  It works great.  My wife says it makes her hand vibrate a little when cutting my hair.  But it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Even the amateur can cut hair with this clipper.  Can handle the thickest of hair and provides a nice, even cut.</li>
    <li> I love my WAHL clippers.  It works quietly and cuts cleanly.  In using it, however, I forgot to put one of the safety guards back on and took out a patch of hair in back of my head.  No problem!  My hair is growing back nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Was also pleased with the price and how fast it was shipped.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal for top notch clippers. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> no directionss,  hair on it as if used</li>
    <li> I liked the strength of the motor and the job the machine does on uniform clipping. I noticed 2 drawbacks though. One was that the 1\\&quot; comb did not fit into place at all (all other sizes were just fine). I&#x27;d return it for another set of combs if I weren&#x27;t too lazy. Another issue was that the edges of the bottom blade were too sharp on the outsides and it makes it uncomfortable if you&#x27;re trying to clip your stubble or trim around your ears. I was more satisfied with my old German Mozer in this sense.</li>
    <li> Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper...&lt;br /&gt;Wahl Professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised... good value</li>
    <li> Ive used it 3 times, its very powerful, very smooth to used. Buy this one and you&#x27;ll never buy another one for a long time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those cheap once. This maybe cost $20 plus more, but its all worth it.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Quite and lite.</li>
    <li> I was beyond disappointed with this product. I have 2 kids one with wavy hair and the other has straight hair with a slight curl and my husband&#x27;s hair is straight (all African American). Well this thing was just annoying. I have had 2 pair of Wahls clippers in the past and one set of Andis and they all have worked well but this one just didn&#x27;t cut it. So for the wavy hair child it left patches all over the place (my husband have been cutting their hair for 6 years). I had to go back to dull clippers just to fix it. On the other kid&#x27;s head, it cut much lower than the guard claimed it would (we always use the same size on him). On my husbands hair it seemed as if the clippers were just too dull. I found that they did get hot, they would get stuck and they were louder than all the other clippers before it. They have been a pain. I&#x27;m not a fan. I&#x27;m just gonna buy new blades for the old clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a great working professional product, far superior to any of the dept store options I have purchased in the past. Amazingly fast  shipment. A great deal!</li>
    <li> Just gave my first hair cut with it and it was awesome!  My nephew has THICK hair, full of cowlicks and this thing cut it like it a pro. I had him done in less than 10 minutes, and I have never been to hair school. For someone who gives lots of at-home hair cuts, this is perfect. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good strong running clippers</li>
    <li> Been cutting hair for 20 years. Everyone likes the name of Oster. Prefer the shape of the Wahl blades over the rest.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I ever had, hands down. Very sharp blades and powerful motor. Zero gap and your good to go. Great for fades and all-around cutting.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper last week and today It came in. Arrival date was today and sure enough it did. I&#x27;m a beginner and this is one of my first clippers, I got a client today and it&#x27;s a great clipper. Lots of power and it&#x27;s worth the price !</li>
    <li> Good clippers.  Only problem was the number 8 guard was broke upon arrival.  Still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The day I got these clippers I used them to test them out. They were very good, nice fine cut and only had to go over twice to get hair I might have missed. I don&#x27;t use them for another month or so and when I pulled them out, rust started to develop on the back of the blade. I don&#x27;t know much about hair clippers but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not supposed to happen. Da FAQ.</li>
    <li> Love these! That v9000 motor has a lot of power, cuts thru any type of hair like butter.... Out of the box however they didn&#x27;t cut that great for me, I had to adjust them</li>
    <li> Great device. Use it all the time but not much different than clippers worth $25 less.</li>
    <li> Pros:  1. Looks nice.  2. You can feel the more powerful motor.  3. Comes with a ton of blade guards.  4. Cool comb.  5. Nice cut.    Cons:  1. No scissors - if you want to say something is five stars, include a set of scissors.  2. Gets too hot for skin if you use continuously. I cut probably two to three people at a time, and it does get too hot for their skin after a while.  3. The 1/2 guards (.5, 1.5) feel cheap and do not properly mount on blade.  4. No case - this is unbelievable, do not ship a five star product without a case, especially when the cheaper alternative made by the same company comes with a case AND scissors.    I want to give this clipper a shining review, but I cannot. They advertise this clipper as the epitome of professional clippers, but fail to provide basic hair cutting necessities along with it (case, scissors). It&#x27;s almost like Wahl made this affordable by cutting costs through skimping on the things people expect to come with it (case, scissors), as well as quality (.5 and 1.5 are s*** guards).</li>
    <li> They cut very good. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  These clipper allowed me to craft a more precise cut and fade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a pro but read the reviews from people who seemed like one. All gave great marks so I ordered it. I cut both my sons hair and it does a great job. Only starts getting warm by the time I&#x27;m finishing up my 2nd one. Good solid feel and the guards that come with it cover all lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> Sorry. I can&#x27;t recommend these clippers. In all honesty I haven&#x27;t used them and am returning them. The clippers come with limited VERY CONFUSING instructions, There is no info AT ALL on the different blade guards and which one to use for different hair lengths. In addition the unit itself is very noisy and very heavy. I have cut my own hair for 20 years.It usually takes me 30 minutes.There is no way I could hold these heavyweight clippers for that long without resting my hand several times.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my 20 year old Remington clippers that I got at Walmart for $8.00</li>
    <li> cuts fast, barely gets hot at all. beats the stuff they sell at walmart. this is quality. went from 20mins shaving my head to 5 mins</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 5 star series &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; clippers about a month ago and so far so good! I cut a lot of heads but it handles the heavy duty jobs perfectly and are great for all around fades and styles. It will heat up slightly after a few cuts (roughly 4-6 ppl) but most clippers do so no biggie. Just add A few drops of oil and its cools. Excellent precision, powerful quite motor and easy to handle! Great Price too!!</li>
    <li> This one is a good clipper. It is fast, powerful but...not quiet. Even though a lot of people says that is quiet, I really don&#x27;t think so. Adjusting the blades can be a bei tricky, but one you have adjusted them, then they can go to 0 ... Real zero!</li>
    <li> This is one my favorite clippers. Nice smooth cut and even with the fade. The motor is not that loud and you get a bunch of attachments. I would definitely purchase this again but I take such good care of the one I have, I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy another one, lol.</li>
    <li> Just shaved my head. Did a wonderful job. This thing is the John Deere of hair.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time. I have zero experience using clippers and i did pretty darn good. It was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hi all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had these clippers for one year now and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. They work perfectly. I use them to cut my own hair but I cheat and just do a buzz cut as I travel in my RV a lot and can&#x27;t be bothered with shampooing my hair and I threw away my combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the supplied oil I just blow the clippers off with my compressor and spritz the cutters with WD40 after every use. This is a fine product at a give-away price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JIM</li>
    <li> These are fantastic clippers.  I can do my kids hair (#3 fade) in about 5 minutes.  Very strong motor, heavy duty, comes with all the usual attachments, some oil, blade brush, and comb.  A bit heavy for the weak though.</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers!  Also got the 5 star trimmers and they are amazing! My son loves the way they fade his hair.</li>
    <li> These are quality, hefty feeling clippers. They run very smooth, cut well. Puppy gets hot even with a couple oilings, but I was learning to cut my own hair, and was running it longer than normal. Built in USA and feels like it, which is nice in todays culture of cheap feeling construction. A good balance of paying a little more for quality, but being within a non professionals budget.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair. Originally we bought a set of Wahl brand clippers at Walmart for like $20 or so. After using them for something like 4 years they were pretty dull so we tossed them and ordered these. They are a little nicer than the one we got fro Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to pay for a hair cut when this is the only thing you need?</li>
    <li> Seems nice, lots of power compared to cheaper options, can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d expect this product to do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is pretty crispy, has a loud CLICK when the switch goes from on or off. Not a bad thing, just unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of wish it came with a nice carrying bag and longer combs but this has nothing to do with the product itself and it is clearly labeled as to what it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to older cheapy wahls that I have that are kind of dying is pretty night and day, this clipper is clearly superior to it&#x27;s cheaper and possibly dying kin.</li>
    <li> I bought these for home hair cuts since I cut my own hair. These are perfect. Powerful motor, don&#x27;t get hot, comfortable in your hands... Good buy overall.</li>
    <li> I do about 300 haircuts a month, with some of the thickest hair imaginable.  These have done just as well as my senior wahls so far. Half the price too.</li>
    <li> Jury is out. Feels more solid in hand than my last professional Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But 4 out of 5 times that I turn it on, there&#x27;s a loud snapping sound. This is dramatically different from the old ones. Couldn&#x27;t attach video, but put up on YouTube. http://youtu.be/xUPYO7gF0E4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious if other owners have this, or not. If not, will ask Amazon to exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will revise my review ince this is sorted out.</li>
    <li> Used the Wahl Chrome Pro for years, was starting to feel dull, so wanted new and upgraded to this. Doesn&#x27;t feel any different. I shave with 1/8 attachment and  it has been pulling hair.  This never happened with Chrome Pro. Save yourself $20. Get the Chrome Pro.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair since 2005 about twice a month. I had been using a Forfex Professional cutter with great results. Earlier this year it started acting up so I bought this Wahl clipper. The wahl clipper is is able to give you a closer cut but it is difficult to avoid nicks and cuts. After a couple of months i became so frustrated that I went and bought another forfex, (Babyliss Pro Fx686 Forfex Professional Pivot Motor Clipper with Ceramic Blade Set)  I am extremely satisfied with this Forfex. the only negative thing is that the teeth on the plastic comb guard breaks easily.</li>
    <li> Works well but it is a bit loud and it vibrates a lot.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.... expecially for the price.. this is my 2nd pair😉</li>
    <li> Great clippers but the product description wasn&#x27;t clear about guide combs being included. They ARE included in this item. Unnecessarily I ordered the supplemental Wahl guide combs and thus had to return them.</li>
    <li> clippers work great, some guides are not included, some guides wont stay on clipper they fall off when clipper is turned on, had some old guides from older wahl clipper they work fine, no storage case</li>
    <li> Have used cheap clippers from local chain store in the past which did not last long or cut well for about the same price. These are a joy to use.</li>
    <li> Going to have to return this to Amazon.  Plugged in and it was very loud and after about 30 seconds it started smoking and basically the motor burned up.  smoke coming out everywhere.  Not good.  Hopefully Amazon will send me another and hopefully this one won&#x27;t burn up.</li>
    <li> came in in brand new condition and it came quickly. going to buy another pair right now! superb clipper, excellent for fading due to the fade blade and it does not get too hot too fast</li>
    <li> Works better than store bought Wahl models. Seems to have more power and smoother operation than the $30 models commonly sold in stores.</li>
    <li> Had to return. Kept overheating and smelling the first time we used it ! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Saving bucks by doing my own hair - I need a mirror to do so, however this does the job in between times that the professional barber will take care of - excellent quality - lots of extras, oil, cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> cuts hair like a breeze, had it for about a year now and it works just as well as day 1. used this to replace a cheaper set of clippers and it has been a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought the same Five Star Magic clipper in 2005 for around $50 and used it on and off including buzzing my head for the past 10 years.  It was well made, had good heft and had a decent motor. I re-ordered when the old one started to miss cuts and didn&#x27;t improve after replacing the blades.  Out of the box the new one ($40) has fewer guards, sharp plastic edges in the handle and a razor guide that feels cheap in my hand. I didn&#x27;t bother plugging it in.  Just sending it back. I am left to wonder if Wahl sells knockoff goods on Amazon or if they just dumbed this model down for a lower price point.</li>
    <li> This replaced my older Wahl that I purchased from Walmart 3 years ago. That one held up very well and I can only expect even better things from this one.</li>
    <li> I love this! Better power than a normal &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; clipper. My sons and husband have thick coarse hair, and it cut fast and clean without pulling. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are the worst clippers I have ever used.  I have been cutting my own hair for over 15 years.  I have been using Andis Clipper for the past 7 years and tried these due to good reviews.  It took multiple multiple multiple passes to cut my hair evenly, and had to finish up with a pair of trimmers to get an even cut.  Needless to say I have already ordered a new pair of Andis clippers after one use of the Wahls</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3a2ffdc7a6686ba6b3431cc1b869ac69]] the machine makes a loud noise that it can not be used! this is normal? anyone else had this problem? sound so loud that I had a headache!</li>
    <li> I already used it for a couple of times and it was very good. The shipping was fast too. Much better than anything I had before.</li>
    <li> Received it super quick.  Used it today for the first time........ FANTASTIC cut.  Comes with several combs but I just use the the blade with no garden, super close cut, love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair. This works well. Cuts well and weight is okay. For the price, good buy.</li>
    <li> Overall - the clippers cut well. I have to make far fewer passes than with my old box store clipper set. However, the guards and body of the clippers are a much cheaper plastic material than expected for the price. I&#x27;ve used them a handful of times, so durability remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> Hair Clipper was delivered four days earlier than scheduled. The motor is so powerful and is the best of the available product.</li>
    <li> The Wahl five star professional hair clipper model 8451 arrived quickly.  It is a very fine instrument which cuts professionally&lt;br /&gt;with no tugging or pulling on the hair.  It is much different than the cheap clippers we have been using to cut my husband&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;hair.  He is able to cut his own hair and I trim up the hair line.  We liked the way the clippers cut.  I did not think that it was&lt;br /&gt;that loud as some others have said.  Great clilppers!</li>
    <li> When I bought this one and I was expected to receive the machine as strong as v9000 as descripted on the product and reviewed by customer but the fact of the matter is just v5000; NOT v9000. I am currently have had used my wahl supper taper is stronger than this one that&#x27;s why - reason I only vote 3 stars. Anyway, not too bad and I will keep this one for a spare one but for the buyer: do not expect this one is strong like v9000, NOT NOT NOT.</li>
    <li> Cuts smooth, no snagging and does not over heat.....Great set of clippers, have had for approx 4 months and they are perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Nice piece of equipment!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a high powered buzzer that gets a close shave for a while, this one fits the bill. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a pro buzzer at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a really big fan of the Wahl products. I&#x27;ve been using them just over ten years now. I plugged it in and it was crazy loud, I adjusted it with the adjustment screw, it didn&#x27;t improve much. Needless to say in the middle of the Haircut it died, it started smoking really bad. The package it came in was cheap, the case was broken.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a closer shave. With no attachments, it still left me like i used the 1\\&quot; in. Attachment. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Buzzer is great.&lt;br /&gt;Use it for blending and fades.&lt;br /&gt;Buzzer fits perfectly in your hand and not to heavy.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well. Needed clippers for my new hair style - very closely cropped - and these were a fine bargain, good functionality, solid feel. I hesitate to give out 5 stars to any product but this is as close as you can get!</li>
    <li> This will be my 2nd pair of clippers from Wahl and im very stoked to have these 5 star ones the motor sounds really strong. The on/off switch is bigger and  makes it easier to turn on and off with wet or oily hands. And the package got to me in 3 days..</li>
    <li> when I plugged in to the power and turned on, it is burning itself and I see smoke comes out. in brief I cannot use it at all.</li>
    <li> works well cuts hair quickly with no pulling</li>
    <li> Horrible!! Got it and it was already used with hair in it!! Also pieces missing!</li>
    <li> My wife been a hairdresser for 30 years, cuts like clippers you would pay $100.00 or more&lt;br /&gt;Great value.</li>
    <li> bought these clippers about a month ago. i work in a salon and do alot of clipper cuts and so far this clipper works great cuts through hair with no prob.  think its a great buy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a month, but I do hair so I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of milage out of them already. I really like them.  They&#x27;re not too loud, don&#x27;t over heat, smooth cut, even cut, nice assortment of attachments and working great! I&#x27;d like to see bigger oil bottles with them though.</li>
    <li> Great also fast shipment ordered three items all came at the same time and new.</li>
    <li> Only $40.. this has been a good choice so far. I have been cutting hair for about 6 years and i can recomend this machine for both, professional use and domestic use.</li>
    <li> These work great and cut down on time needed for a hair cut. Much better than the cheap ones. I recommend  them.</li>
    <li> works great for at home haircuts, nice quality and stays cool, nice long cord and comes with a full range of comb length attachments.</li>
    <li> a little heavy and could be less loud blade are sharpe and cut vary well in total is precise on cut</li>
    <li> Very powerful model - gets job done quickly and evenly.  But I have only used it twice - so if it still works good next year, we go to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly. The clippers allow even an amateur to cut like an experienced barber. Low noise and sharp cuts. Overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers, I have cut my hair a couple of times with them. they are right on time. I am not a professional barber, but these guys are used in the barber shop I &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; to go to, now when I cut my hair, it looks like a professional did it....</li>
    <li> Great tool and clippers and great price&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful and runs cool, also have a very good gripe and is precise</li>
    <li> turn on mechanism broke after like 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Easy to use. Feels like the name professional fits very well. I&#x27;ve had very good luck with WAHL Products before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on Wahl trimmers.  This one has all the guides you need to do your kids hair, your beard, and even if you desire, your eyebrows.  Now, I always have a neat trimmed beard.</li>
    <li> Well made product with great performance. Previous reviewers were spot on when claiming it cuts like a hot knife through butter! I would definitely recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> I used this set of clippers for the first time, and they work so much better than the personal use clippers I bought from the same manufacturer some years ago.  Well worth the extra $20 for this pair.  I did not use the fade handle and don&#x27;t plan to in the future, so can&#x27;t give any feedback about that.</li>
    <li> I received these beatiful clippers today. I gave them a try and they work like a charm. These clippers scream out professional. When I took it out of the box they were light well built and slick looking. I had the clippers on for over 20 minutes and it was almost cool to the touch. They are equipped with a V9000 motor. Compared to the common Wallmart Whal clippers these are like the Cadallac of the Whal model line up. The clippers are well balanced in the hand they are not heavy what so ever and they cut like no other clippers I have tried. I paid $40 at the time of this purchase and I thought that was very cheap considering the ones you buy at your local Wallmart are around $30. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I used to have a very basic Wahl that I bought from a drug store a few years back. Sure it was only $16, but after a few haircuts, it started to get stuck just about every time it went through more than a few hairs at once. This greatly increased the time it took to get the job done. Once my fiance started helping me with the job, we often would get frustrated with each other about how difficult the process of starting a cut, clearing the blades, and continuing a cut would become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product. It laughs in the face of puny hairs, hundreds at a time. It also makes a much more pleasant sound, and the whole process is done much more quickly and with less drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save time, save money, save you and your cutting partners&#x27; sanity. Get these clippers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted to quit spending so much at the barber shop with 3 boys getting haircuts every month. They love it, and two of the three cut their own hair!</li>
    <li> Great price, great function. The included trimmer levels are good for my needs. I do not appreciate that it is &#x27;loud&#x27; as other reviewers do. Does it make noise, of course! Though I do not think it is worse, maybe even better, than trimmers at many barber shops. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and feel it is good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several pairs of clippers through the years considering I started cutting my own hair 39 years ago.These by far are very best clippers I&#x27;ve ever own.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clipper. I use this to cut my own hair now and it&#x27;s already paid for itself after just a few haircuts instead of going to the barber.</li>
    <li> For upgrading from the basic blue and white Wahl clippers that I used for 6 years I have absolutely zero complaints. I only cut my own hair every two weeks. Every now and then I cut hair for two other people. Each head takes me about 20 to thirty minutes. Each hair cut is a number 1 or 1/2 even all around or fade. So the power and quality is perfect especially for the price. If one is cutting hair for multiple people on a regular basis I recommend spending the extra money and getting something professional grade with a stronger motor. Making the job much easier by cutting the time at least by 1/3 on each head. Also giving less of a chance for the motor to malfunction when being on for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up for Wahls investing in their quality and low prices!</li>
    <li> SHOULD OF BOUGHT A 5 STAR PAIR YEARS AGO. FOR BEING ONLY $10 MORE THEN A CHEAP PAIR FROM WALLY WORLD, THEY ARE A FAR BETTER CLIPPER. JUST ZEROED GAPPED THE BLADE AND THEY ARE GOOD TO GO.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be better than the cheaper wahl clippers I bought.  Unfortunately, the same uneven cut occurs no matter how well I maintain the clippers and how many times I go over an area.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Love this machine!  It&#x27;s extremely powerful!  I had the wahl designer and this bad boy out performs it by 10 times.  It cuts fast and cuts my hair cut time in half.  Plus, it&#x27;s also great for fading / tapers.</li>
    <li> My husband has been doing his own hair for several years, and we have gone through many types of shavers. He keeps telling me how much better these are than any others we have had in the past.  No pulling, not loud</li>
    <li> This clipper is what I would expect from Wahl which is to say it is a good clipper.  I think I expected a little more for the price however; especially since it does not come with any sort of case or holder.  So you either store the clipper and accessories loose in a drawer or repack it each time in the thin cardboard box in which it arrives.  Also, it seems rather louder/rattlier than our previous Wahl clipper.  It does a good job cutting hair.</li>
    <li> product was shipped on time, was well packaged and was of the quality I as expecting. I will definitely do more business with these people in the future! and recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> The Wahl hair clippers are easy to use; they are light and easy to use for a female and very smooth and quiet.</li>
    <li> The clippers work very well. Does not require multiple passes as the cheaper models do. Rather loud and heavy but that is to be expected. There is a lever that changes the &amp;#34;variable taper and texture&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t figure out the purpose. Even my wife&#x27;s hairdresser doesn&#x27;t know. Would rather have paid a few dollars less and left out the useless control.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but these clippers are awesome.  I normally cut my 2 boys and husband&#x27;s hair back to back to back and halfway through the second cut, other clippers start giving out.  These didn&#x27;t show any sign of doing so.  They cut quickly and efficiently.  I would buy over and over.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper Model 8451 is an excellent buy for those that want to save some money by cutting/fading their own hair. The build quality is decent, blades are sharp, the sound is not bad at all (little noise) and runs very smooth. 8 different guide comb attachments are also included.1/2, #1, #1-1/2, #2, #3, #4, #6, #8 attachment, along with a guard attachment and comb.  I had to order a #10 Wahl guide comb as I like my bangs a little longer. All in all the Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper is well worth 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever owned! I&#x27;ve had a few duds in the past. I found this after going on a barber&#x27;s forum and they recommended it. Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time choosing these as I am drawn  to wahl&#x27;s clippers. They are powerful and quiet, but precision cutting for professional looking cuts.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. .. did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. However it does get very hott. Not sure if that will become a problem.</li>
    <li> I like this clipper. I just use it to trim beard and cut my hair. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> A little heavier that I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a good product and I&#x27;ve been able to consistently get pretty good results cutting with this. The reason this is 4 stars rather than 5 is that I noticed whenever I have the clippers in OPEN position, and there&#x27;s enough pressure being put onto it, it doesn&#x27;t stay locked on open and actually closes up when I don&#x27;t want it to. The plastic guards also are only okay quality, but I&#x27;m not reviewing those guards. (If I were, I&#x27;d give them 3/5 stars). But the clippers themselves, apart from this gripe, are great. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the case with every clipper, but it gets annoying when I need to keep readjusting the blades back to open.</li>
    <li> Well, plain and simple this bas boy is the real deal. I have very thick hair, enough so that I just buy and replace a set of cheap clippers every year when the motor burns out, but damn I was very impressed at the ease of which these clippers brought my locks to the desired shortened state.</li>
    <li> All I can say is Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no barber,  but this is a great price for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this kit for home use and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this has the V9000 motor,  it still heats up if you&#x27;re using it consistently for about 45 mins. Nothing unexpected from a machine with a motor,  so it&#x27;s definitely not a con.&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are  that Wahl didn&#x27;t include numbers 7 and 5 blade guards. There was no case either. And I&#x27;ve seen video reviews in which customers recieved a hard plastic storage case with the contents of this package inside.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your blades oiled and clean,  don&#x27;t bend your cord,  and get those two guards.&lt;br /&gt;Great Clipper!</li>
    <li> This item arrived missing most of the accessories (I only received two cutting guides) and there were fingerprints all over it as if it&#x27;s been handled. I will be returning this...</li>
    <li> This works great! I just got this two nights ago and went to cut my hair. A friend told me to use the lowest guard (I believe it was the 1/16) and my hair is close to bald. I really like the feel of the clippers, I did have to go over my head a few times but I hadn&#x27;t cut my hair for over a month. By the time I finished it seemed like they were starting to get a little warm but I had been using them for a while. They weren&#x27;t loud, I know that thats a common concern for clippers but they didn&#x27;t seem loud to me. All in all I really like them and I just ordered the Wahl detailers because of my satisfaction with the Magic clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that I was spending $20 (with tip) every two weeks to get my hair buzzed.  Now I can do it myself, and the clippers only cost as much as two professional hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these clipper once so far but was happy with the results. Very even and clean cut. The only downside is not the product itself but the cheap cardboard box it comes in. They could have at least provided a plastic storage container like my old pair. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers, they cut extremely well. I called WAHL and I was told that these are the same as the Wahl Senior, the only difference is the shell. The Magic is plastic, while the Senior is metal. Other than that I was told they were the same clippers.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. They were a gift and are being enjoyed. They cut well. Also bought the colored guides. Great choice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. One thing though, it doesn&#x27;t give very close cut.</li>
    <li> Great for do it yourself clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cut is professional quality, weight is perfect and exudes quality feel, adjustable blade, various clip ons for fading, comb included, small amount of oil for blade oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These easily are clippers you would find a professional using and you won&#x27;t be disappointed by quality, use and cut. Weight is balanced and won&#x27;t make your hands tired for extended use, vibration is on par with professional quality clippers. My advice is invest in these vs. lesser quality clippers because these will last the average users for years and the professional as well.</li>
    <li> Great product being using their brands for years and has never let me down.</li>
    <li> This really makes fading simple!!!! You won&#x27;t believe the confidence that these clippers will give you once you use them on your next bald fade.  Love em</li>
    <li> I have been a barber for some years now, and always preferred to have andis master clippers, wanted to try out the wahl brand and give it a shot have had the product going on a week and the magic clip is really impressive cuts thru hair very easily and gives great bald fades when properly adjusted correctly to your desire., is a great back up to your hair clipper arsenal if you ever w old decide for a different course of brand would reffer this product to anyone who would like to try this wahl product .</li>
    <li> With these clippers my taper comes out so good and I&#x27;m a novice, my taper came out close to the professional Barbers tapers but not as good but close, there light and they look good and cut good and cheap, and I have seen many great Barbers like Ron Legend and Vick the barber use these on their YouTube videos. There nice and worth every penny and more</li>
    <li> I bought this hair cutting kit because the one I currently use is a little old and beginning to lose power. Plus, they no longer make replacement blades for it. Anyway, the first time I used this trimmer and detachable guides I was over the moon impressed. It gave me the best cut and fade that I have ever done. It looked so much for professional than my old haircuts people were asking me who I started to go to because they wanted the same thing. When the time came for my 2nd haircut I noticed that the blades were pulling my hair beyond belief. Now I am an amateur barber and have been cutting my own hair and friends hair for over 10 years now. I have a military style crew cut that I fade high and tight on the sides. I know how to clean a pair of clippers but even after the cleaning they still pulled my hair and made it impossible to get through an entire haircut. Even after another thorough cleaning and oiling the product got no better; in fact it started to make a rattling sound every time I turned it on. I couldn&#x27;t get through a third haircut and had to return it. I went back to using my old one for the time being until I find something else.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent clipper.  In fact, the fade blade on it and the smoothness of the cut feels better than the Andis master clipper with the fade blade.  They even feel smoother than my first pair of professional clippers, the Wahl Senior V5000. The blades are very sharp, so sharp I can&#x27;t use it to shave with, only cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase was well worth it, only paying $38.00 and some change for a professional pair of clippers.  I wish I had purchased these earlier.  I bought a cheap pair of Conair clippers when my Andis master&#x27;s stop working after about 14.5 years with weekly use.  The Conair cause keloids and bumps in the head, so I had to use tea tree oil every time I used them as a preventative measure to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair clippers fell apart with just under 2.5 years.  Not bad, I had a pair to last six months once.  You get what you pay for!  I only hope the build quality of the Magic Clipper is as good as the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, two things: It is too early to tell whether the adjustment lever is not flawed like the Wahl Senior V5000 model, which became loose shortly after purchase and was not able to be repaired by tightening the adjustment lever screw.  This was a nuisance, because I was actually using them to barber on others at that time. Now I only cut my own hair.  Secondly, the heat was too much while cutting for a long duration, I had to allow the clippers to cool. For those two reasons, that is why I got the Andis Master Clipper as backup clipper, which became my primary clipper. From my research, Wahl was supposed to have corrected these two flaws in the later V9000 professional models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!</li>
    <li> This has proven to be an excellent purchase. I have used these many times and always have a good, clean cut. Easy to clean and all the attachments I should ever need. The motor sounds strong unlike the tinny sounding motors of other products.</li>
    <li> I bought it for My son and since day one He loved it. It trims so well and smoothly, we even use it to cut my 7 year old grandson&#x27;s hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at least 5 years ago. I am a father of 3 boys and I wanted to try a \\&quot;better\\&quot; clipper to cut their hair with. I previously used a store bought Wahl that was adequate but I noticed the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; razor my barber was using had a different kind of humming sound. I found this razor and read it had a \\&quot;V5000\\&quot; motor that was more powerful that the consumer model. I have been using this product to cut my own hair (whatever is left of it!) and my kids have been cutting each others hair for years. This product is great and is very durable. It has a strong motor that makes the job a lot easier.    Be careful of using the bare blade to trim your neck. Make sure you move the black bar adjustment towards the middle, or you can cut yourself, as I have a few times. It is actually quite easy to cut your own hair once you get the hang of it!</li>
    <li> The only complain I have about these hair clippers, is that they heat up quick. Every single hair cutting device is going to heat up one way or another, that&#x27;s a fact. This pair heats up quick, that&#x27;s the only reason why I rated it 4 stars. Other than that it&#x27;s awesome to work with. it&#x27;s got the 1/2 inch guard for the extra precision on the fades. Highly recommended. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;home-use&amp;#34; shavers on the market, this Wahl Professional set does a great job.  The motor is stronger than other models and these clippers cut smoothly and evenly the first time around.  I personally have super thick hair and this is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that handles my head without a problem....and I&#x27;ve been through dozens of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to replace an holder Wahl unit I had for some time. This clipper is much more powerful and quiet. They cut without much noise and with ease. Just make sure you keep it oiled before each use.</li>
    <li> Well first of amazon sent me bad product, upon contacting them they sent me another one which was good but the guards were broken which I usually use #2 and 1/2 both but I was in luck the old Wahl clippers I had which I replaced with this one I had guards for that one I just use those. Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty solid clipper set. Powerful.</li>
    <li> Broke after couple weeks use.</li>
    <li> As advertised, great transaction.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for cutting hair. I&#x27;ve had it for over 5 months and have enjoyed  every moment i&#x27;ve had with it. It feels smooth and cuts perfectly every time. Buy it now !</li>
    <li> Great buy. Very happy with it. Nice and quite. Cuts hair with ease. Well made, was missing couple of attachments but no complains. I can do without.</li>
    <li> Works well good product.</li>
    <li> worth the buy very powerful motor cuts great everything you need is included when you start it there is a very rough jerk but these are quality and definitely worth the price i would buy them again</li>
    <li> Good quality strong sharp cutter.</li>
    <li> What can I say, no complaints here. The guards fit much better than they did on my old (cheap) Wahl clippers. No buzzing from the guards fitting loosely and vibrating up against the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair once every 6 or 7 days, high and tight style. Works great!</li>
    <li> cuts nice.  can&#x27;t complain.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> best set we&#x60;ve had so far</li>
    <li> i use this to cut my hair once a week. thank you wahl for making a quality product that is useful. it cuts well, i dont have to go over same parts of my hair over and over. i go skin, up to size two.</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl Clippers before and expect no issues with this product, I will update if there is.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to grip and handle. It&#x27;s not loud and does not get hot. I hope you sell extra blade as this unit will have a long life.</li>
    <li> Just like what others said, it&#x27;s as easy and smooth as cutting soft butter. I love its solid feeling in hand, and a non-professional person like me can still cut nice hair with it. I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and it works perfectly. It does get hot after some time of use but it&#x27;s not that hot. I use it continuously for 20min and it&#x27;s still ok. I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper Wahl clipper 20pc set but this one feels much better. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> works great! gets hot but thats expected. love using my new clipper. great for fades and buzz cuts. nice clipper</li>
    <li> my boyfriend absolutely loved the clippers.great product</li>
    <li> It cuts my hair in half the time with no bogging down. It does NOT come with a hinged case like other people are saying but still a very nice set of clippers. I have noticed these are sold at a popular online auction site with a hinged case but this particular sale from Amazon does not come with a hinged case. My aluminum snap-on blade guard or hair length comb or what-ever-it-is-called that I purchased a few years ago from an online barber shop supply company fit the blade perfectly and will not move when cutting hair. Fits in my old hinged case from my old clippers perfectly. I am extremely happy with this purchase and you will be too!</li>
    <li> Long story short, this one really works. I bought the Wahl 8110 Balding Clipper one time and it still pulled hairs at times which made me very mad. But this one has a more powerful motor, and felt like true barber shop quality, and it just did not pull any hair when using it. Now I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair.  I read many reviews on Amazon before buying this last week. I wish I had bought something else.  This gets really hot and burns my hand depending on how I hold it.  Plus the clippers weren&#x27;t aligned which I found out after my 1st cut. Had to get a screwdriver out.  Also the one white attachment bent.  I was hoping to see a difference from the $25 Wahl&#x27;s clipper I purchased (the white one with all the color attachments) but I can&#x27;t say I see a difference.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  Try Andis master.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going with next.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these clippers to any barber just starting out that doesn&#x27;t have the money for the Wahl Seniors or Andis Masters.  They have a plastic casing and don&#x27;t get hot too quickly.  Cuts clean and smooth.  The V9000 motor gives great power and is light years above the department store clippers.  Great for fading/tapering/even all over cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Wahl clippers but never liked the guards they provide.  Andis makes a set of single magnetic guards that have the rare earth magnet in the center of the guard.  They work great with these and other Wahl 2 screw hole blades and don&#x27;t jump or pop off while you&#x27;re cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are an excellent investment for a family barber doing haircuts at home and a solid 1st pro set for the beginning barber.  I also recommend getting Andis Cool Care spray, Andis Blade wash, and clipper oil when purchasing this machine to ensure your blades are clean oiled and disinfected properly.  Regular maintenance is the key to long lasting and high performing clippers/trimmers.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased these clippers on February 2013 and have been using them once a week since. They were very well built and cut extremely closely without nicking or cutting my skin. I have had zero issues with them so I decided to purchase a second set for my father since I&#x27;ve started to cut his hair too. Two years later, I am disappointed to see that cost cutting has hit this product HARD! This was apparent from the moment I opened to packaging to find that it no longer came with a hard plastic storage case, instead the clippers are now just packed in a molded plastic insert with the items underneath. Upon examining the clippers themselves, I found that the plastic panels are misaligned, unevenly secured, and gaps in multiple spots. The taper adjustment lever also catches on the misaligned panels everytime I move it. I will be returning this 2015 version and trying a different model and hoping this isn&#x27;t the norm across the entire line.</li>
    <li> Much better than other clippers I have used, sharp doesn&#x27;t pull hair and cuts very close almost as close as a blade. Buying the  Professional model definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for. I thought it was Warehouse Deal scratchNdent; it was a used returned item. I doublechecked after it arrived and I opened the taped shut box. It came dirty and no combs or accessories at all. I cleaned it up, and it does run very quiet and does cut hair... I sort of held a different clipper comb onto it and mowed my better half&#x27;s hair. It was warm after ten or so minutes but not excessively. I gave it three stars because it did run and cut hair a lot better than the one I had. I will go and purchase a set of aftermarket combs for it and keep it. READ DESCRIPTIONS CAREFULLY. It was not rusty or missing teeth or I would have sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN EDIT.... a person in my household had opened it and tossed some of the packaging and stuck the tape back on it; I didn&#x27;t know that when I CUT not peeled the tape and got into it. In the recycling I did find the hair comb and a package still sealed of the clip on combs. I did add one more star, making it four; that I did get most of what I should have. (and had a talk with some of the rest of my household about doing stuff like that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still was a used item, but it wasn&#x27;t abused, filthy, or rusty. I did have to clean some hairchop out of it, and used my own light machine oil and a cleaner brush to give it a maintenance session before using. It has done one beard and three heads now, including my own, and I can say that it is very quiet, firm in hand, doesn&#x27;t vibrate and make my hand &#x27;buzz&#x27; for awhile after using it. And it has some serious cord, more than I&#x27;m used to on the last trimmer I had.</li>
    <li> Good clipped for the price I use everyday. Mostly tapers and fading the wahl sysop blade is official its all in the angle of the hand with that flat blade its worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> Performance of these cliplers when they were working was average. I was using this to trim my beard about 2x per week. However, the lever that adusts the blade length (regrettably made of plastic) just broke, which caused the blade to completely separate from the unit. Not the quality I was expecting at all from these. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does give you a close shave but nothing like a razor...</li>
    <li> I use the #1 guard to cut my own hair and these clippers cut my hair with just one pass unlike my cheaper con air clippers. They have a good weight to them and a thick quality cord. I highly recommend these if your looking for a quality set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Amazon is to blame for this one. I&#x27;m not commenting on the clippers, as I didn&#x27;t even take a chance on using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews about people receiving used clippers, I was immediately suspicious when I saw the Wahl packaging had been resealed with a few strips of packing tape. After opening the box, I discovered that ALL of the accessories were missing. Nothing was in the box except the clippers. Upon further investigation, I noticed finger prints on the chrome plating and other markings on the clipper body. Basically, I think that someone opened the box took and used what they wanted and shipped it back to Amazon for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am pretty disappointed with Amazon and will be sending these back. It&#x27;s a little baffling to me that Amazon didn&#x27;t bothering to check the contents of this obviously used/returned item. Instead, they simply shipped it out to the next buyer (me). Hopefully, this doesn&#x27;t happen to you, too!</li>
    <li> best one I had so far. totally quiet and smooth shaving. stays cooler and more powerful then the old one I had! highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer and my last one was a consumer model that lasted for 6 years.  I fully expect this one to last me at least as long.</li>
    <li> good power, better model than previous purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl&#x27;s in the past but they were the kind you can get at CVS for $20. They always broke on me within a year. These are the best clippers I have ever had, I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to me that they do not care about their customers.  When I had an issue with a different product (Amazon&#x27;s fault-defective product) I contacted Amazon and they refused to make it right.  After I emailed them (seven times!) I never once heard back from them.  What a TERRIBLE way to treat your customers!!!  Beware!  If you can, always try and buy items from the companies who make them directly...DO NOT go through Amazon.  They do not deserve the money when they disregard their customers so terribly!</li>
    <li> In was expecting this to be a commercial grade set of clippers, but instead if feels identical to the set we bought for $25 a couple years ago. The motor may be more powerful, but I wouldn&#x27;t know as I have a buzz cut. Still has the plastic cheap feel, sharp edges, same quality blades, etc. If you really want a quality clipper do what I shoulda done and get the Classic 76 by Oscar.</li>
    <li> This model feels cheaply made. Blades shifts they don&#x27;t line up. I&#x27;m always having to tighten the screws. The motor is quite and it&#x27;s is lighter in weight. Poor quality. I&#x27;m returning it and getting the designer model.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Made in USA Wahl clipper.&lt;br /&gt;A bit of water/moisture left on the blade  and in a few days it was all rusty... Quite unbelievable...&lt;br /&gt;Never had blades to go rusty that soon, after just one use. 10$ clippers that I never dried were lasting few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, these guys know there is plenty of sheep wanting to buy Made in USA stuff, so they don&#x27;t even try. They simply know they are able to sell any crap with the proper sticker. It&#x27;s a pure marketing research where somebody concluded a sticker can do better job than a good product - especially since these are coming very good from China for around 40$ so it&#x27;s not worth even trying making it good.&lt;br /&gt;Never buy Made in USA low-end electronics.</li>
    <li> I purchased to use at home to cut my husband and toddlers hair. My husband usually cuts his own hair (high and tight). It works  well for both an adult and wiggly toddler. Exceptional hair cuts that looks professional. Significant difference from the cheaper models. Money well spent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really do like Wahl clippers.  These do have the v5000 motor in them which is good.  Newer versions of these and other Wahl clippers have the new v9000 which I guess is better.  All and all I can&#x27;t complain because these are more than adequate.</li>
    <li> This was a real struggle for me to make this purchase/choice.  So many reviews and they are all over the map.  I have used cheaper Wahl models and other over the years and could kick myself for not going this way earlier.  I am older and have fine as well as thinning hair.  These cut very well, are smooth to operate, quiet and feel like quality in your hand.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t have enough hair or these cut so well it does not take me too long because I have experienced no problem at all with heat build up.  Yes, they get warm but nothing I would call unusual or excessive in any way.  It is an electric motor - it warms up a bit....good grief.</li>
    <li> I lost my money..............the hair clipper was broken at the reception, great deception.</li>
    <li> The unit met and surpassed my expectations.  Running, it was surprisingly quite.  All the att: snapped on and off with ease and the cutting head moved through my hair without hesitation.  I would buy the clipper set for a friend, it was a pleasure to use...Mike G.</li>
    <li> Cuts all my sons hair well but gets pretty hot after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Really like the clippers</li>
    <li> A fine piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for professional use or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AngeloTheBarber89</li>
    <li> Came to me rusty and the blade was backwards and unadjusted... very unhappy</li>
    <li> Even if this device didn&#x27;t do anything, I&#x27;d hang it from the family room ceiling as a conversation piece.  However, it does in fact work--almost too well.  I&#x27;m not sure one person should have this much power.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and this just wasn&#x27;t up to par.....leaves long hairs and gets pretty hot. I should have sent it back but I really needed something for work.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these to replace my wahl chrome pro as I needed a stronger motor to cut my thick hair. There is nothing wrong with my chrome pro but these five star magic absolutely blow them out the water. You can feel the difference when you hold them and the clippers cut like a hot knife through butter. Very glad I purchased these in additional to my other clippers. If you want a sturdy and thorough haircut I highly recommend you give these a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, these also came with the 1 1/2 guard which I was going to purchase separately for my chrome pro so that is definitely an added bonus</li>
    <li> FIRST TIME BUYER AND IS VERY DISAPPOINTED ,WORSE YET I BOUGHT THIS CLIPPER FROM AMAZON ITSELF,&lt;br /&gt;UNFORTUNATELY ON MY FIRST USE THE CLIPPER WAS KICKING LIKE IT HAD SOME ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND UPON MY SECOND USE A COUPLE WEKS LATER I NOTICED THE BLADE WAS SLANTED WHICH CAUSED IT TO BITE WITHOUT THE GUARD AND IT WAS RUSTING . KNOWING I USED THE CLIPPER WITH CARE AND CLEANED IT PROPERLY AFTER MY FIRST USE.  AMAZON WONT SEND ME A NEW ONE CUZ THE RETURN TIME HAS EXPIRED SO DEPRESSING.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  My son is bi-racial so he has very thick hard to cut hair.  Before I was using a cheap pair of clippers and it was a nightmare to get him to let me cut his hair.  They pulled and took forever!  These clippers have been a miracle!!!!  They glide right through his thick hair with no effort or snagging!!!  Smooth, quick cut and have made this moms life much easier!!!</li>
    <li> Husband purchased as he cuts his own hair. He feels this clipper is quality made. Fair bit of &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to operate. Sound of clippers when being operated isn&#x27;t too loud, but not quiet either. He&#x27;s happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cute with ease, just don&#x27;t like the #3 guard. It&#x27;s very flexible which gets loose and came off a few times while I was cutting my hair! Other than that the machine itself is great especially for blow outs.</li>
    <li> These are my go to&#x27;s! Probably one of the most versatile tools in the Wahl 5-star line up! Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Work better than the typical Walmart clippers. I&#x27;ll revise to five stars if they last longer than 6 months</li>
    <li> Fast blade, strong engine, great for home-cuts, buzzes, clipper fades, etc.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CLIPPER FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem that much better compared to previous lower end model I had. Still pretty noisy, and doesn&#x27;t cut through hair much easier. Clip guards are still a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> I picked these because they were a little cheaper than the balding clippers. I should have bought the balding clippers. Nice set, but no close shaves. I&#x27;ve adjusted far cheaper Wahl&#x27;s to cut better than these, yet the motor is awesome.</li>
    <li> ...and I freakin&#x27; love &#x27;em! My first day using them, I did 8 clipper cuts in a row, keeping them running for roughly five consecutive hours, and they barely heated up. The arm extends the guard over the moving blade a lot tighter than my old clippers, meaning I can get really sweet skin fades without using attachments. They&#x27;re a tad heavy (like all clippers), but I can&#x27;t see myself using anything else for a long while.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper was exactly what I hoped it would be - powerful, sturdy, versatile, and a professional cut every time. I did a ton of research on clippers before getting this one. I had the Wahl Deluxe Chrome Pro (Bought at Walmart, and had 2 pairs over the last 4 years because the first pair fell and cracked) but I was just not satisfied with it after realizing it didn&#x27;t give me nearly as clean a cut as at the barbershop. So after reading about this one, I took a chance. The price was surprisingly low for a &#x27;professional&#x27; clipper, but it didn&#x27;t disappoint! I cut my hair every 3 weeks or so and it&#x27;s already paid for itself twice over! One of the first things I noticed, just as stated in another review I initially read, was that I only had to do one pass and almost all the hair was gone. No more pulling at the hair and tugging, leaving an uneven finish. With this clipper, I could even get the tough back lower sides that always seemed to be a bit darker and not even with the rest of my hair. This clipper took it all right down. I use a 1/8 guard and the guards clip on snug and stay on. It&#x27;s quiet too! Overall, I give this clipper a 9 out of 10, just because I think nothing&#x27;s perfect, but this darn well comes close! One of my best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year! Happy shopping!!</li>
    <li> Not a bad beginner clipper. But If you&#x27;re a professional barber or stylist, you might want to buck up for a better clipper. I recommend the andis master or the Wahl reflections.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is good for a at-home barber.  But if you cut 7days a week,I&#x27;d buck up.</li>
    <li> Excellent doesn&#x27;t run hot that&#x27;s a plus</li>
    <li> Bought it in the hope of using it to clip my dog&#x27;s fur.  Does not cut at all unless the power screw is turned to the point where the thing sounds like a jet engine.  Completely useless - it&#x27;s even too loud to cut my husband&#x27;s hair without giving us both a headache.</li>
    <li> works very well, bought to replace a 12 year old Wahl model purchased at w-mart. This new model is build almost identical to the old model, sounds the same, and it is very sharp. I have to slow down with this new one because it cuts so much better than the old dull one. Hope it holds up to using it for myself and 4 boys! The accessories from the old model fit as well, which is good because the new one did not include a No.5 guide</li>
    <li> Bought this buzzer because of it&#x27;s review. Overall, for the price I was pretty satisfied. The only reason why I gave it a 3 star was because it does heat up quite a bit even though it was advertised as emitting less heat. I also wished it came with a better comb and brush to brush off the excess hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and recieved it within 4 days of the initial order. It did go through FedEx smartpost which many people seem to ahve a problem with but i recived my package just fine. When i received it the case was a cracked but the product was unharmed. It comes with 1/2 guard all the way to 8 guard, IT DOES NOT COME WITH 5 AND 6. The cosmetics were a little dis colored in some areas but the product works great. I have cut a few heads with this and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it started making a lot of noise really fast and it never cut that good</li>
    <li> I have to say it lived up to its name --at last I have a clipper set that will cut through the thick hair of my teen age grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;I have given 4 haircuts, one after the other and the 5 star clippers performed flawlessly . They warm up a bit , but that&#x27;s normal !&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied !!</li>
    <li> By far the best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve owned a few basic home Wahl and Andis clippers in the past. I not only cut my two boys hair at home but my Basset hound/Blue Heeler dog. My previous criteria for selecting new clippers were how many guards were included and if scissors or combs were also included. For this purchase I thought id do a little research. A lot of the Wahl professional grade clippers are close to the same. Some have a plastic backing vs a metal to allegedly dissipate heat quicker. Thats the only difference. Some have a v5000 motor vs. a v9000. I knew this time around I wanted a powerful motor. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how strong the cheap Wahl &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; clippers are. Since the motor info isn&#x27;t listed under the home Wahl site, I imagine it&#x27;s neither a 5000 or 9000. All I know is when cutting my dogs hair, it gets bogged down at times and sometimes stop. So this time a gambled and decided on professional grade. I couldn&#x27;t decide on the 5 Star Senior or the 5 Star Magic Clip. I eventually went with the Magic Clip due to cutting military style haircuts for my boys. It comes with the V9000 for power and a 1/2, 1, and 1 1/2 guards for that perfect fade. I&#x27;m so happy with this clipper. It doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch when operating for a while and my fade cuts have no lines for where a blended in the hair with the different guards. Do yourself a favor spend the extra few bucks on the professional grade Wahl clippers. By professional I mean used by professional barbers and the professional line not the cheap Wahl clippers that have the word &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; thrown in the title.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a great improvement over the power, frequency and overall performance of my cordless clippers, for which no vacuum adapter existed on the internet. So I searched for the nicest vacuum adapter I could find, then paired it with my purchase of this clipper upgrade. Since I&#x27;ve read this and that about comb sizes let me set the record straight. My WA8451 here came with the following number sizes of clipper combs: 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1+1/2, 1, 1/2, which are respectively 1\\&quot;, 3/4\\&quot;, 1/2\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot;,1/4\\&quot;, 3/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot;, 1/16\\&quot;, which are respectively 25, 19, 13, 10, 6, 4.5, 3, 1.5 mm. Plus a realistically sized black plastic carry case, comb, Wahl clipper oil, cleaning brush, and instructions.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my brother and he likes them a lot. He said they worked perfect. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers for the money.</li>
    <li> I like the clippers.  Cuts close (not completely bald) but close and quick. Stays cooler than most of  the past clippers</li>
    <li> So far so good. Love this little machine. Cuts hair like a professional. i cut my own hair and its a breeze with this little guy! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> Still working great, 5 years later!</li>
    <li> Does the job...can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> this clipper gives me all the power I need with out the heat</li>
    <li> Updated 4/2014: After using these a few times, they are a _dramatic_ improvement over the super-cheap ConAir (cordless) clipper that my wife has been using on me for years.  I received the V9000 model and it cuts my relatively thick, wavy Caucasian hair effortlessly.  The guides that came with the ConAir actually fit this one, so I saved the odd numbers (e.g. 5 and 7) that didn&#x27;t come with this one.  The charger for my beard trimmer gave out recently, so I&#x27;ve started using this with a size 1 comb (from my ConAir set, I think) to keep my facial air in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the body is plastic, this is probably the best value in Wahl clippers.  To be able to get a professional quality one for the price of two men&#x27;s haircuts is a bargain.  Buy one for yourself; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> the most clipper  finishes profesional</li>
    <li> Have gone through 2-3 cheap $20-$30 over 20 years and these are by far the best clippers I have owned/used. They cut so cleanly and you can definitely tell the difference in motor strength. Glad to pay the extra money and get a better quality clipper. Wife uses these for my hair and i cut my 6 year old son&#x27;s hair. A++</li>
    <li> It does the job I need it to do.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you would expect it to do.  It&#x27;s not loud and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS TRIMMER FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. WORKS GREAT, VERY HEAVY DUTY. KEEP BLADE OILED AND CLEAN AND MAKE SURE ONCE GETS DULL TO CHANGE OUT NEW BLADE. VERY GOOD PRODUCT. LOOKS TO SEEM IT WILL LAST VERY LONG.</li>
    <li> My haircut is a simple shave at one setting and I got tired of payng a barber to do it every few weeks.  I got this and started doing it myself, works well and gives a nice quality cut.  Now I just visit a barber every 4-5 months for a cleanup and detailing that I can&#x27;t do myself...</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is the best I have come across since the last five I have purchased in my lifetime. This worked so smooth and never build up to even jam like my other models I purchased.</li>
    <li> I got the trimmers just to add to my workstation. When I say they get the job done I mean it. Great for fading and all even cuts. They do not get hot fast and they feel good in your hands. If you looking at them buy them you will be very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. No chance of cutting your skin with adjustable blades. Well made.</li>
    <li> Long story short. For all barbers put these in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to know about clippers.&lt;br /&gt;1.They all can get hot.&lt;br /&gt;2.They all can cut uneven.&lt;br /&gt;3. All of them can break.&lt;br /&gt;Depends on who&#x27;s using them.</li>
    <li> The clipper works well but is more noisy than I expected.  Overall it does a good job and seems to have good power.</li>
    <li> Good clipper with various sizes. I like the 0.5 and 1.5 guides, good for fading short hair.</li>
    <li> Works great plenty of power and blade are the sharpest I ve seen. Best one I have ever owned. Would reccomend to any one who cuts hair</li>
    <li> Sharp cuts the way I need it to since I&#x27;m always on the go and don&#x27;t have time to wait for a barber to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Sharp way to cut hair!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Feels heavy duty and well made. I would definitely recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> As someone said in a review, these clippers are classy!  Also, they are shorter and much better looking than my previous clippers. And, I like the fact that they are easier to cut on and off.  Of course, a big difference, but they are like comparing a honda to a jaguar. They just feel good and look nice in your hands and make you feel better about having to cut your own hair.  Ever since a barber decided to cut more off than I told him to, which also happened with a few others, I have been cutting my own hair. But, thanks to father time, I have less to cut now.  The only monies I spend extra is on newspapers for the sink and plastic bags to put over me instead of the capes. I take care of my clippers by vacuuming any hairs off them and keeping them oiled.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers works better than my old wahl clippers. Great product highly recommend for a professional look. Buy these clippers</li>
    <li> perfect for what i need</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift, he loves it.</li>
    <li> get them right the way dont think twice</li>
    <li> Like a hot knife through butter is the best way to describe how these cut</li>
    <li> Just used it in my son and worked awesome! Much better than the cheaper ones. I only do my son and husbands hair but for the price this is only the cost of 4 salon cuts and will last a long time. Cut great and seems very good quality!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and easy love these clippers</li>
    <li> Honestly, I Was expecting more. But hey whatever. Decent clipper</li>
    <li> these hair cloppers are wonderfoll</li>
    <li> Bought them last week and they shipped pretty quickly. The cut these clippers give is just as smooth as its sleek looking design (the picture online is much less attractive than it is in person). The clippers stayed cool during a 45 min session (approximately 32 mins of actual cutting including breaks for trimming, cleaning, and brushing my hair). I absolutely love this purchase and feel like I capitalized on an exceptionally great deal.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes an excellent clipper. Only reason I gave it less than the 5 stars is the case is not metal and so may not be as durable in the long run</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve brought about 4 clippers under $50.. because I myself need a almost daily clipper.. My next one is going to be a oster pro clipper.. I spent all together the same amount as on professional .. I had one before and it&#x27;s worth it.. Thought by paying a little less/ lot less I may get at least some of the same quality I would from  a professional clipper.. Not at all.. This clipper is only for someone that only needs it once a week or bi weekly.. Or even monthly.. As of right now fr the time of purchase.. One of the attachments don&#x27;t hold on any longer ..</li>
    <li> The usual Wahl quality...does the job for which it is intended.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this model (with the V5000 motor) via an old hair-stylist friend of mine that had a &amp;#34;connection&amp;#34; at the local beauty supply shop. She helped me pick out a good all-arounder for hair and beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been more satisfied with a product in my life!&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair cut pretty short and probably do a clean up trim every 4-6 weeks. For 20 years. I have kept the blades oiled with mineral oil after every use, as recommended and I have never had to replace the blade. It still cuts perfectly fine to this day. These clippers are a true &amp;#34;workhorse&amp;#34; that never fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model with the V9000 motor is actually a bit &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; running than my older model. The improved motor generates much less vibration, but don&#x27;t be fooled. This is a heavy-duty clipper intended for professional use. It&#x27;s a bit weighty &amp; you definitely feel the power coming out of this thing. That being said, I would liken it to a good chef&#x27;s knife. You don&#x27;t want it to be to light in your hands, otherwise you lose touch with the tool. This clipper has a good balance and a solid feel to it. (Which I would not say about many consumer-grade clippers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I replace my old clippers?&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to replace after I got tired of my old clippers being held together with duct tape. I know what you&#x27;re thinking, but hold on. The reason for the duct tape is that about 10 years into my ownership of the original model, I knocked the clippers off of my bathroom counter and they fell about four feet, landing hard on the tile floor. Unfortunately, this cracked the casing right down the middle. They still worked just fine, so I did what any god-fearing American would do. I fixed it with duct tape. They have held together for all this time (and still work &#x27;til this day). I all but forgot about replacing them, until these magically appeared in my Amazon &amp;#34;Recommended for you&amp;#34; carousel. I plunked down my $40 (which, I&#x27;m pretty sure is the same price I paid for these things 20 years ago?!) and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if everyone in the world had a pair of these clippers, there would be no more war, no more hunger, and everyone would have amazing looking hair? Buy a pair for yourself and find out.</li>
    <li> Using It for almost 2 years no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers sharp but will not cut you I would recommend these these too all my friends and family</li>
    <li> works great !  taper heaven</li>
    <li> wish the instructions were a little better</li>
    <li> Purchased these for personal use and I absolutely love these clippers! These replaced a cheap pair that I bought at Walmart and those constantly nicked me, and with these five stars I haven&#x27;t had any issue with that happening!</li>
    <li> I ordered these after much deliberation over whether to get these or the Andis Sonic+ as a backup for my Andis Improved Masters.  Ultimately, I couldn&#x27;t get as much information as I would have liked to have gotten for the Andis Sonic+ clippers so I went with these because they were tried and true.  I cut my own hair and I already own a pair of Masters so I wanted a good but more reasonably priced alternative.  These have the V9000 motor which is supposed to be twice a powerful as the V5000 motor these once were manufactured with.  I really liked how they cut.  These are some very good clippers.  I don&#x27;t think they are as good as my Masters and understandably so but these are a good choice and hold up quite well.  Out of the box they weren&#x27;t 0 gapped so I had to get them as close as I could.  I liked the fact that I could close them all the way without chewing the guards which happens with my Masters. These also came with a nice set of guards so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any universal guards if you don&#x27;t want to.  They were also pretty light and ran cool.  All in all, I&#x27;m glad I got them.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but it is heavy.</li>
    <li> My husband got this to replace our old clipper. This cuts hair nicely and does not pull his hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> 4-29-13  Prescott AZ&lt;br /&gt;Wow!!!  This thing is sharp  !!  I have never owned a better clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed.  Easy to hold.  Maneuvers well. Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts very close ( I sort of shave my head with them).  Seems to&lt;br /&gt;need little maintenance  ---  I do not oil these every time&lt;br /&gt;I use them.  Thanks Wahl.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. I have used one of this brand for at least the past 25 years and the cord frayed. Time to buy a new one, this functions great when my wife cuts my hair. This one will probably outlast the first one. I love it.</li>
    <li> have 7 boys and love these.  precise cut and not loud.</li>
    <li> Great razor, great price! Cuts hair of any length, gives a pretty close shave if you need it to (no straight razor obviously).  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and it&#x27;s still buzzing away.  Comes with guards, oil, plastic comb, and a tiny hair brush for cleaning it. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit of a tight fit to get all the guards in the plastic box with the razor. If I were to buy one today I would go wireless but I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old Wahl clipper died after many years. So far I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but its working out pretty well. It seems to be a little sharper than the old Wahl I had (it was one of the cheaper ones). Build quality feels solid, so hopefully this will last just as long as the old one did.</li>
    <li> I initially brought this more for the way it looks and just hoped for the best in quality. However it does cut and shave well too. It is sharp as some have mentioned so you don&#x27;t have to pull out the screw driver like some of us do to adjust new clippers. The size of it also looks and feels smaller but it&#x27;s mostly due to the way it&#x27;s designed.</li>
    <li> Works great, my boyfriend loves it! I recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality product that works well.</li>
    <li> Works great! I only trust wahl.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 25 years, and after replacing cheap sets over and over, as well as getting a poor cut,&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find these are a professional set, at a great price, and with easily replaceable blades.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would like to see is the cord is a little stiff and shorter than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;I would have been willing to pay a little more for a lighter cord.&lt;br /&gt;Overall Great Value!!</li>
    <li> This clipper is the best you can get. Other clippers (even other Wahl clippers) get hot with use.  These are cool, quiet, and sharp.  I also purchased the vacuum attachment... it fit perfectly. I use it to trim my body hair, mustache, and beard. With the vacuum attachment, no mess.</li>
    <li> perfect Vvery fine product, its works perfectly, is exactly were i spected good conditions very weel nice deal thanks you at all</li>
    <li> Clippers work great used it a couple times already to cut my own hair and others. I really like the lightweight of it and how it cuts. They work great for fades also, there are a few clippers for fades out there that are better but alot more expensive. I think for the price its a great product and worth it.</li>
    <li> I like how quiet the motor is. It is much quiter than an older Wahl I have. Sometime the lack of noise seems like it may not have enough power, but it does a great job so far.</li>
    <li> This clippers are junk compared to my old cheap clippers i got from walmart years ago.  They cut so uneven, even after attempting to adjust and make it right.  Ill stick with my old faithfuls until i feel the urge to try another pair of over-priced clippers.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I think it&#x27;s exactly what I want. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good clipper.</li>
    <li> Feels great, sharp solid feel, attractive design, use it mainly to trim my beard and hair. Worth the money my second walk trimmer</li>
    <li> Good price for such a good product, no jam and cut easily. The only thing I feel a little bit not so good is it kind of noisy.</li>
    <li> I love it !! It came with everything  it says it comes with and just today I did 26 haircuts and it did not over heat or pull hair . I recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and quiet. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Would recommend getting the Wahl vacuum attachment if you are planning to use this on a regular basis especially for kids haircuts.</li>
    <li> It works great and does what I wanted to do with it!!</li>
    <li> Expected this to cut a lot smoother over the less powered version, but I didn&#x27;t see a clear difference. Also, surprised it did not come in any kind of case, like the cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> I was one of those people that use to buy cheap clippers. But recently I decided to spend a little extra money on clippers. These 5 star Magic are wonderful; they cut so easy and never get hot. It also is great for fades, tapers, and 360 cuts. I love them. I&#x27;d prefer to use Wahl Blade Ice spray than wahl clipper oil.</li>
    <li> received promptly, looks nice but it is a Christmas present for my son, so we haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> Much better than what you can get from Costco. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Arrived quick and seems to work fine. Price as good as you will find.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  The fading and tapering features are amazing. They&#x27;re sharp and I can cut fast with them. Nice and powerful clipper</li>
    <li> Wahl makes great products.  This one is an upgrade from my previous Wahl which I had for 10 years.  It was still working.</li>
    <li> not as advertised! doesn&#x27;t get my chin hair off completely. this is a big scum and scandalous advert. please avoid this kind of sellers</li>
    <li> I love it!  Have been cutting my husbands hair for 20 years and didn&#x27;t know the difference between and good and bad clippers until now.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have to buy another for &amp;#34;Up North&amp;#34; since we are snowbirds and I can&#x27;t take it with me.</li>
    <li> got these today! I was so excited! i opened them and better than I expected.. now i cant wait to chop up some hair..</li>
    <li> Solid, professional feel, and easy to use. I&#x27;ve been using it for many months now, and am thoroughly satisfied. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My son uses these clippers every week.  As a Marine he needs a weekly cut.  He loves them and has saved hundreds of dollars by having his own.</li>
    <li> Well, so far, I have no idea how the clippers work because I cannot seem to get a set that actually has all of the pieces. I have now returned this product twice in a row. I have not decided yet if I&#x27;ll give it a third try.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. These things cut through hair like butter. The noise is minimal compared to some of the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; clippers I have used. If you would like a good set of clippers that should last a lifetime and still affordable these are it.</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly. I was able to give myself a military haircut in only a few minutes. The price was awesome, by the time I use it 3 times it will have paid for itself. I don&#x27;t know why people were complaining about the weight. It&#x27;s not too heavy for me to use, and the little girls in the barber shop were able to use it all day without a problem. Anyway, I would buy from this company again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Solid clippers for the money. They don&#x27;t work as well as some of the $100+ clippers but they come close.</li>
    <li> they are amazing clippers Ive had two other people use them to cut my hair and both said \\&quot;wow its so smooth\\&quot; it glides right threw your hair thick long short all of it. highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair for over 3 years and have used almost everything, This is BY FAR your best clipper for the price. I cut 15-25 heads a day and havent touched my other clippers much since I got this. The v9000 motor is amazing and allows you to cut fast with crisp cutting, unlike many wahl clippers. Compared to the Wahl seniors but half the proce and Andis masters but half the weight and price! A must have if your a serious cutter :)</li>
    <li> This clipper is really well-built, works extremely well and is really a very complete product. It even comes in a reusable plastic storage box.  While the documentation on what is included isn&#x27;t overly detailed, it does actually come with a ton of combs and everything you need to be up and functional with the product right away - even including a small bottle of oil and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.  This thing will pay for itself in just a couple skipped trips to the barber.</li>
    <li> i been using this product for four years and it cuts great and it is super sharp be careful i cut myself more then a few times.overall great product i love wahl clippers anyway i been using wahl overall for 21 years now,i still got my old yellow pair from 1992 lol.my skin is super senistive to razors that&#x27;s why i have to cut with clippers,i cut my hairs facial and head bald.</li>
    <li> This sucker cuts great! 1 pass and it is as low as it can go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On length it will go almost bald but with a very short stubble on the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trade off  is it is nearly impossible to cut yourself! I have used this front and back and from every direction imaginable shaving my head and only cut myself once which was around the lips and I don&#x27;t really count that. In the wild west people always grew those awful handlebar mustaches because it is nearly impossible to shave around the lip without cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By combining this with my crappy old razor that would go totally bald (In about 40 minutes and 16 passes) I can get myself bald in 5 minutes with just 1 pass of this followed by 1 pass of my horrible razor which doesn&#x27;t even have a chance to do any of the things that used to make me hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the non-baldies this is a great razor and for the baldies just combine this with any trimmer and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This clipper works perfectly and offers a wide variety of options. It is very well built and sturdy, and silent enough. As a matter of fact it is not cordless, but it means it will last longer.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law loves thbis clipper.  He&#x27;s been using a cheaper brand from Wahl.  He finds this product to do a superior job on his hair.</li>
    <li> THE FIRST SET OF CLIPPERS WERE NOT WORKING PROPERLY I.E. A VERY LOUD NOISE WHEN I TURN IT ON AND IT WAS BLUNT.  THEY WER E KIND ENOUGH TO REPLACE IT FOR ME AND IT IS NOW WORKING PERFECTLY. VERY SMOOTH AND PRECISE</li>
    <li> Works very well! I stay busy all day and it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. Great clipper for your work day.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice n I can bet u it works like magic, its so easy to use n I cut my hair by  myself. its so easy to handle. A visit to the babar in my area is 20 dollars plus tips; I got this wonderful machine for less than 40 dollars; I save 20 dollars wen ever I do it myself! I only need 4 more hair cuts to make a 100% profit on my purchase n from the way this wonderful piece is running I know its going to be working all year long!!</li>
    <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned! Comfortable ergonomics and doesn&#x27;t heat up as quickly. I purchased them for personal use and must admit its the best cut I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this some time not and am very satisfied with the hair clipper in all aspects.  It cuts real well.  It is not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;This was a good purchase.  I am sure i chose the right model to buy.</li>
    <li> I recommend the 5 Star series clippers to all upcoming and established barbers in the industry.  There is no competition for the surgical blades they possess!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the hair clippers to cut me and my son&#x27;s hair. I made a good decision choosing the Wahl clippers. The clippers cuts great and runs smooth. I recommended this product!!!</li>
    <li> Clipper is so smooth and not too much vibration when I cut their hair.  Like the guide that helps cut close without pulling the skin.</li>
    <li> Am in a country where 220-240v is used pls what is the voltage en watts of this product. Urgent pls</li>
    <li> I have other Wahl hair clippers--but have had to start at the biggest attachment to the smallest to do my son&#x27;s hair as it is SO thick.  This one whizzes through--in less than 20 minutes I have his hair done.  There&#x27;s not much vibration and the best feature is the small attachment that protects the blade when a close shave is given.  I&#x27;d recommend this hair clipper.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I was under the impression that the casing was a high quality metal-like casing, rather than the plastic used.  Color scheme aside, it looks and feels like the $25 wahl clipper I replaced it with, but under the hood it has the faster, quieter motor.  For the novice that I am, I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference all that much.  First impressions: It cuts with relative ease, cord seems heavy duty, but doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional grade clippers when held in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I can&#x27;t see how you would go wrong with this purchase though.  Wahl is the standard for the home, and my relatively cheap, abused, never oiled wahl clippers that this one replaced lasted about 8 years, and still runs to this day.  The 8-10x&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve already used has more than covered the purchase price.  Yes I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These clippers do exactly what they are designed to.  They aren&#x27;t any louder than other clippers I have used in the past.  A clean cut with no hair pulling.  I like that they came with a good range of shorter guides (from 1/4&amp;#34; down to 1/16&amp;#34;), since we will be gradually shortening my partner&#x27;s hair over the spring months.</li>
    <li> great powerful plug them in and just go. i really love these clippers i have had a couple different brands and even wahl clippers before but these are by far the best pair i have purchased they are the best thing u can possibly get for the money u are spending i would recommend these to all my friends and family</li>
    <li> great quality for great price</li>
    <li> These are great clippers. You get the better motor in these clippers too. Always oil the blades before and after you use them and they will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> After going the cheap route and wasting my money on cheaper, under powered clippers that pull your hair out, these clippers work like a champ.  Save your money and spend a little more to have something that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 Wahl clippers. The first were from one of the kits you can get at the drugstore. I was 19 and sick of Great Clips crappy cuts. It worked great for 5 years, but I didn&#x27;t really take good care if it and some of the teeth on the shank broke. I didn&#x27;t know any better so I replaced it with a Super Taper II. It works great to 000 buzz my balding head, but I wanted a closer cut, so I got a Wahl Detailer. That gives a great 00000 buzz, but I grew a beard and wanted to be able to trim and blend that and I&#x27;m older now, so I wanted to get rid of the additional unsightly body/back hair. However, motors get hot no matter how powerful they are, so I got this as a second to my STII. It&#x27;s a great clipper and works great! Bonus is that it comes with the 1/2 and 1-1/2 or 1/16&amp;#34; and 3/16&amp;#34; attachments which make smooth, seamless fading easy. I cut my son&#x27;s hair with it now and after watching a few YT tutorials, I can give him a professional quality cut for no money at all.</li>
    <li> The increased motor size makes the difference. One pass is all it takes. It has power, but it is quiet and does not overheat like other models. More than satisfied!</li>
    <li> This Pro Clipper works great. (The fact that it is replacing one bought at the PX 53 years ago might be coloring my assessment.) Did my hair the first night.  Gonna do the boys&#x27; hair tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Yes I would recommend this product. Sturdy, reliable and professional product. Seller was fast on shipment. Easy to take care of. Comes with special oil. Be mindful that this is a long lasting apparatus as long as you take care of it, clean, and maintain. The manufacturer is worthy of praise too, when it comes to customer service. They answered questions and helped on some inquiries.</li>
    <li> Best hair clipper set I&#x27;ve ever owned, super tight fade close and even powerful and smooth.. Very very nice. penty of attachments..</li>
    <li> Clipper is pretty much a cheap pair of the seniors... Clipper was fine the first couple days but then it started pulling hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item</li>
    <li> Looooooove these! Great product! I do bald fades and many high and tight cuts and these do the job amazingly!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good set of clippers to start cutting my hair at home.  My wife worked in a beauty supply store and mentioned that this model sold very well.  I tried it out and it did do a good job.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. Wahl has a great workhorse clipper here.Have gotten several of the clippers.Wonderful workhorse of my shop.</li>
    <li> Love them light and powerful been using them every day at the shop</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no problems with these clippers. The medium size and weight makes them easy to handle and maneuver; the surgical blade cuts the hair fast and clean; the v9000 motor gets the job done in no time; and they take a while before they even start to feel warm. Very cool running clippers. I recommend these for anyone, whether just starting outout or professional. Plus they even look cool! Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Really nice product! It&#x27;s a professional clipper, but it&#x27;s easy to use. My boyfriend loves it, and his beard looks awesome. :)</li>
    <li> These are just flat down... amazing. I am a curious 16 yr old who works in a barbershop as a hair sweaper, but dont be fooled. While at work i observe the barbers in their natural habitat and watch the way they flick their wrist and glide the clippers. I bought these bc i wanted to cut my feiends hair for fun. When i started i searched long and hard for the perfect clippers, nothing expensive, just to get the job done. I bought these well crafted clippers and was amazed at how they looked in person. The burgandy/red car-like paint with a metal/chrome finish. They felt super comfortable in my hands and apparently proffesional on the head according to my client. The cut leaves no scratching or pulling just perfection. I posted a pic after the cut and showed my barber friends and they were just astonished by how well I did. At first they doubted me and that only got me to push more. As long as you mantain your clippers using disinfectant And a small amount of oil you should be more than fine. Well good luck!</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers. These feel and work like a professional tool.  I especially like the heavy cord. The previous clippers I have owned have all failed due to a cheap flimsy cord. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Some products are designed to do what they do, and when they do it well, we appreciate them for just being reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what this is. Replaced a 10 year old (or more) version which finally gave up.</li>
    <li> This is great it does a great job and fun and easy to use and I never had to leave my work to look for one I love on line shopping fast easy cheap and so much fun I will never stop amazon is number one.  Lots of  cool stuff and never have to see inside a store yaaaaaaaaaaaaa</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Easy on wrist precise cutting action</li>
    <li> Very useful item in our household</li>
    <li> You do not need to buy any other clippers. Stop right here! You get everything you need with these set of clippers. If you want a shaver for the closest bald fade, that&#x27;s another issue, but the ability to zero out these specific clippers is awesome. Plus they&#x27;re adjustable. You can never go wrong owning a set of these</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair. It is really a pleasure to use this clipper, works really great.</li>
    <li> Very great clippers, iv owned a few wahl brands before an this is my favorite an best pair iv owned. It is quiet easy to do tapers an fades with these zero blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of clippers before. I&#x27;ve bought a pair of 5 star Wahls and will never buy another brand. This is my 2nd pair. My last pair lasted over 10 years.</li>
    <li> A very well made clipper. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product. Ive been cutting my own hair for years and these clippers do an awesome job.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Powerful operating motor, comes with a lot of guards, great for fades! Great price for the money on these clippers!</li>
    <li> not fit for what i needed... heavy and cut inconsistently</li>
    <li> i have the total opposite of ethnic hair and although these clips are meant for ethic hair types i cut my own and all my other buddies that have non-ethnic hair with no problems i pull off some sick fades without a hitch! comes in a case w/ a comb, lube and attachments. so far these clips have operated nice and smooth and the v9000 motor is awesome its strong and runs cool. the blades are nice and sharp they dont snag or pull and they have a nice taper to them. i make sure to clean and lube em after every use for smooth reliable use. in conclusion a great quality product w/ awesome value. helps me provide the pro like results you want when you get a fresh crispy cut!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty professional style clippers.  I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is a professional cosmetologist and has years of experience cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;She loves these clippers. This model has the V9000 motor and handles problem haircut conditions that required more care and multiple passes with other clippers. Not significantly more money than the less powerful models and well worth the difference, it seems.</li>
    <li> Mine came in used even though I&#x27;m pretty sure the order was placed as new. Whatever. It still works amazingly. First time hair cutter here so I have nothing to compare to, but the blades are sharp, no snags (I cut my hair short from 1/2 to 3). I have to go over the spot a few times to get 99% of the hairs and more than 10 for 100%,  but I think that&#x27;s normal. My barber does it, I do it. It does get to its hottest after, lets say, 40 minutes. I didn&#x27;t time it, but it was a long time I was cutting my own hair non-stop. Its doesn&#x27;t get unbearably hot though. After a couple months and a few hair cuts (about six), it still works strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some problems or annoyances are with only ONE of the hair cutter guides. The white 1 1/2 is the flimsiest. The sides don&#x27;t line up with the edges of the clipper to well, and the fins, I guess to call them that, seem too flexible. I think the top of the fins are supposed to lock into the top of the clipper, but frequently they slip out and into another groove and look crooked. If the sides slip out you get a noticeably louder vibration sound from the plastic vibrating against the clipper. Fixable by just pushing it back in its place. Yeah, thats the only thing I would change. Still a fantastic clipper.</li>
    <li> The item makes more noise than freight train. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend to buy the item</li>
    <li> This is our 2nd set of Wahl clippers.  The first set lasted at least 5 years before they got dull and started to pull as much as they cut.  This new set is a little more noisy but they do a good job cutting hair.  They also didn&#x27;t come with the ear taper guards so I give them a 4.  Luckily we had some from our previous Wahl clipper set.</li>
    <li> very smooth machine. clips are nice and firm for skin fades. would recommend to a friend. always impressed by WAHL  products.</li>
    <li> Clippers are very sharp and can adjust to cut almost completely bald. Plenty of power.</li>
    <li> The clipper blade was badly off of alignment upon receipt. Spent some time looking up blade alignment videos on Youtube. I understand I can unscrew and realign the blade, but it&#x27;s disappointing to receive a brand new product that needs fixing before even being used. Please do better by the consumer next time.</li>
    <li> pros&lt;br /&gt;powerful stuff. the buzz on this thing is super noticeable&lt;br /&gt;free sliding adjustment, instead of increments, for more gradual change&lt;br /&gt;lots of good guards, variety of clip sizes.&lt;br /&gt;good for fades, short hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;unnecessary. my 20$ con air did the job for me, but those didn&#x27;t have free sliding adjustment&lt;br /&gt;very strong reverbation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;notes:dont trim downstairs without a guard, these are prone to cutting skin</li>
    <li> After reseaching a number of other hair clippers, decided to purchase this one as a gift for Father-in-law.  He loves it and says it works very well.  Great hair cut every time.  Good buy &amp; highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 2 pairs in 2 years! They keep cracking where the screw is on the front and the clippers and when that happens you have to replace!</li>
    <li> Great clipper, especially for fades. High power motor is really nice. Very worth buying. The only very minor drawback is because the motor is more powerful, it vibrates a little more, just takes a few days to get your hand used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few hair clippers over the years but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s built solid, has good weight and balance in the hands and has a strong motor. I expect many years out of these clippers!</li>
    <li> Normal, do the job very well.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Works perfectly so far. Appears to be well built, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I will not use, regret</li>
    <li> My house is full of five guys and we all have been using these hair clippers for about 3 months now and they are still very powerful and quiet. We have had Wahl clippers before that were cheap and they burned up very soon. Highly recommend these</li>
    <li> Product as described AAA+++ Excellent Transaction</li>
    <li> Way more powerful than the 5000 motor from the Wahl I had before. Goes through hair like butter.</li>
    <li> very very useful. Helps out alot. Really is worth it.</li>
    <li> it works great and does excellent job that&#x27;s all I can say don&#x27;t have anything else to say about it</li>
    <li> Caveat: I&#x27;ve only used these clippers once, so keep that in mind with my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my haircut at home off/on for many years and have used a variety of clippers. I have medium thick, caucasian hair and only a few brands/models would pull it. The cheaper Wahls tended to do that so I decided that I would need to upgrade to a more professional model. After doing some significant research and balancing performance, accessories and price, the 5 star series Magic Clippers seemed to be the best deal overall. They have Wahl&#x27;s V9000 motor, near 0 guard and were under $40. I certainly wasn&#x27;t opposed to spending more, but this one seemed to have all the features I was looking for at nearly half the price of some of the other models. That made me a little hesitant to try them, but I went for it anyway. Objectively, they seemed just like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in, checked the blade alignment, oiled them and went to it. They did a great job, didn&#x27;t pull once, never heated up more than just warm and they were on a long time. This was the first time my wife cut my hair, so we took it slow. Very slow. And they did well. I bought another set of guards that included the around-the-ear combs as well as #10 and #12 combs directly from Wahl. They were cheaper than anywhere else I could find and offered free shipping. The cord length was appropriate, the noise was not quiet, but certainly not loud and overall they performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers came in a compact plastic case (nothing fancy) with about 8 combs (no ear guards), a small vial of lubricating oil and some instructions. Seemed pretty standard fare, definitely geared to those who keep a very short haircut, or do a lot of fading. As mentioned before, I&#x27;ve only used the clippers once, but if my experience changes, I&#x27;ll be sure to update.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair so shaving was a bit annoying when I had to make a lot of passes.. If you have average hair thickness, it should be fine :-)</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair for years!! Tried many, many types of store bought clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These suckers kicked my hairs A$$. Fast, Clean, Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive to buy and work great! I did not have to go over my head several times like I am use to.&lt;br /&gt;One pass per section just like mowing a lawn. I recommend these clippers for sure!</li>
    <li> I like it. I have to say, I am not a professional. I use this for personal / family use. For my needs it is excellent. The kit is also excellent. The combs are plastic and there is a good selection of them. A professional may want metal combs, but for me, I am very happy with this set. It is a little heavy which to me indicates it is built to last. It is very comfortable in my hands.</li>
    <li> Works well. Powerful. gets hot....</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, a solid and powerful motor.  So many other clippers (such as the other Wahl clipper I had) were cheap, never worked well, and stopped working too quickly.</li>
    <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet motor so you don&#x27;t disturb neighbours in adjoining apartment.&lt;br /&gt;No tugging at the hair so it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Nice low cut, any lower and it would be a trimmer - I have no use for the attachments (I&#x27;m Black/Afro-Caribbean and keep my hair low)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes - None so far but I&#x27;ve only had it for one month</li>
    <li> I started looking for a clipper after receiving one too many shoddy, overpriced haircuts from the chain locations. I also hadn&#x27;t had much luck with local places where I live, so I decided to start cutting my own hair.  I looked around at a few other clippers, comparing Wahls to Osters, etc. I constantly found that people were recommending models that were 100$+ dollars. If you are like me, and just wanting a simple haircut, this is way overboard in the price department. At the same time, I was skeptical of the cheap generic style clippers that you&#x27;d find at any big-box store. While I didn&#x27;t need a gold-lined clipper of Olympus, I didn&#x27;t want something that was going to scalp me either. After some searching, I finally decided on this relatively obscure model, largely because of the price.  The Pros: -The price is very good for what you get. Many more expensive models appear to actually be of lower quality. -The V9000 motor (Which this model has) is a noticeable upgrade over the V5000. (I have a close friend who owns a model with that motor). It has NEVER snagged or tugged, or anything on me, and I have exceptionally thick hair. -Comes with 8 attachments, a bottle of oil, a comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying box [More on these in a second] -Is surprisingly not-loud. I wouldn&#x27;t say its quiet, but its not nearly as bad as some clippers. -Has a balanced weight, I have no problems using it and the clippers are neither fore, or rear heavy -Tapper adjustment is smooth  Cons: -It does get hot. This might be because I am still slow, but after a while it really warms up. -The plastic attachments are pretty &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; feeling. I&#x27;ll likely end up trading them out for a better set. But they are a good start and haven&#x27;t broke or gave me uneven cuts. -The comb and brush are pretty low end -The plastic carrying box is a joke. The first time I recieved this, the box was shattered. The second time it was cracked in three spaces. I kept it and just duct-taped it. I know this isn&#x27;t a huge issue, but really, that is why I can only give four stars. The box is literally trash. -The included oil bottle is prone to leaking -The clipper does not come at max power, you need to manually adjust it (Which thankfully is fairly easy)  Final Verdict: As you can see, most of my cons are about the accessories or deal with minor issues. I&#x27;d say the clipper&#x27;s heat is my only real complaint. The V9000 motor is a real improvement over the V5000, it&#x27;s not just marketing. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this model. Just don&#x27;t expect much out of the accessories, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I chose this clipper by reading the reviews and this one was one of the most highly rated.  I&#x27;m very happy with it, and it most certainly has not disappointed me.  I defer to others when it comes to some of it&#x27;s functionality, as I just use it for simple trims.  It feels premium in my hand, with a strong sturdy cord and I believe I will get years of use out of this clipper.  5 stars from me for not disappointing.</li>
    <li> Not sure where the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; part comes in but it does the job. I buzz my hair every two weeks and have been doing so for years. These do no better or worse in my opinion than their cheaper counterparts which I have also used... for years. My usual reason for replacement is the blades get dull and rather than bother with replacing I just buy a new cheap one. So, it was time and I chose this one because it had a supposedly had a better motor which I thought would equate to a better cut by not having to do repeat &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; across my head. After about 8 cuts I can say that in my opinion, there is no difference compared to the $20 Wahls! It does look cool though! Still you might want to save yourself a couple of bucks and buy the cheaper ones? I know I will.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great! I received them fast, and they were just what I wanted. They come with all the attachments you need for a good haircut!</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t heat up much. Feels really solid in my hand. Not too loud.</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper and good value for the money.  The unit is not flimsy but substantial.  The performance is good.  The attachments and extra fine tuning with the thumb tab should allow one to achieve almost any cut desired.  I cut my own hair with it with no problem.  It works well on the beard as well.</li>
    <li> Bought to cut my hair and couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was cutting until the clippings dropped on the floor.  I&#x27;m not used to it not pulling when cutting.  Very smooth operation.</li>
    <li> very great clippers I love them.</li>
    <li> It works great as advertised. Great value.</li>
    <li> Did a nice job on my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> Use this thing every week.  Very well made.  Powerful moter</li>
    <li> I have super thick curly hair.  Cheap trimmers would bogg down and pull my hair.  It used to take like 12 minutes to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This this is so powerful it only takes like 2 minutes to shave my whole head.  NO hair pulled at all.</li>
    <li> I had a less expensive Wahl that had a very annoying buzz. This one is relatively quiet - same noise level that you get in a barber shop chair. The nice surprise though is how well these clippers cut. No snags, no missed hairs. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Thought this clipper would be better with all the good reviews.  The adjustment on the side seems to be very loose after one year of use.  Not sure if I am still pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> Heavy duty clippers, good for all types and lengths of hair. The reason for the 4 star not the 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t come with tapers.</li>
    <li> Definitely higher quality than my chrome set. The blade is much better. I cut my own hair, this makes it so much easier.</li>
    <li> I am a home user who uses clippers to shave my head at the 0 setting once a week. previous to this i had been using a chrome pro set (MC2) without any problems for many years (also great clippers by the way). I got these because I wanted a second pair for a second home and because i was curious to see if there&#x27;s a significant difference between the two. My conclusion: probably not a big difference, but this is a great set of clippers to get regardless (price difference is small anyway). NOTE: this is the same as the Wahl Five Star Senior but with a plastic instead of &#x27;metallic&#x27; casing. It is not the same as the Wahl Senior (not Five star) which is the original model and not zero-gappable (ie you can&#x27;t bring the blades to near complete alignment to get a closer cut).&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap for professional clippers&lt;br /&gt;- Extensive guide set included&lt;br /&gt;- can be zero-gapped relatively easily&lt;br /&gt;- Light and easy to handle, even when cutting my own hair&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Even though zero-gappable, doesn&#x27;t provide a skin-close cut. I expected it to (maybe wrongly). I think it&#x27;s fine for most people since most aren&#x27;t looking for that look, but was hoping for a closer cut (not Mr Clean close but a very light stubble). For that purpose, maybe the Wahl balding clippers would&#x27;ve been better. I know that the Wahl shaver can get it skin close (had a barber use it on me once).&lt;br /&gt;- my chrome pro set came with a hard case box, which is nicer than the cardboard this comes in</li>
    <li> I use this for home-use, as I only cut hair for my husband and son.  Nice heavy-duty clipper, comes with a variety of combs.  Easy to use, nice long cord (I had a cordless one, hated it).  The cutting blade is adjustable, a nice feature.  Heavy in the hand, which I mention since all the past ones I have used have all been pretty &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling.  I am getting much better cutting results with this clipper, even the guys noticed their hair looks better.  Better blades, better cut?  I think so.&lt;br /&gt;If this breaks, I will order it again.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This machine approaches the professional class, equal to the best.</li>
    <li> Based on the recommendation of barber stylist, I bought this as a gift to replace the previous theses he previously owned by my friend.. He loves them and uses them weekly. Great choice.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received the product. I love the fact how it is really smooth. Not much of an issue if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of loudness. Compared to the Five Star Super Taper it&#x27;s a bit louder. I guess with a stronger motor that is what you expect. I would give this a five star but I finally figured out that the blade needed to be readjusted. When opening from factory made the blades open way to far that it just wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair. Overall, I would recommend this product to my friends,</li>
    <li> These replaced an older Wahl clipper that I had. This one is definitely more powerful, seem more solidly built, and seems to cut closer than the last clippers. I actually use these as my razor for my face and also my head. I don&#x27;t use any attachment, just the bare blade on the shortest setting. It works awesome……..for me at least. I keep the slightly scruffy look. AND I clip about once a week. They probably wouldn&#x27;t work for daily clipping.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t call them 5 star for nothing. I&#x27;m a barber and I&#x27;m  impressed with the magic clips</li>
    <li> Pros:  Powerful, not too loud, seems sturdy, great price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not cordless, but that comes with the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl cut my hair cut time in half vs. my previous clipper.  (I won&#x27;t name the brand as they were a generation older and thus not a fair comparison.)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing clipper. You can tell the difference between a V5000 to this V9000 motor. Very strong, looks great, doesn&#x27;t over heat as fast as other clippers, comes with 1/2, 1, 1-1/2, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 attachment, a guard attachment, a nice comb, a cleaning brush and clipper oil, and a box (which is cheap and fragile, but good for storing attachments). 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Got these and right out of the box I might have messed around and did one of the best blowout fades ever.  If you are a skilled barber and know what your doing with the clippers these are perfect. I was worried that the blade would be to sharp because I ordered blades for my seniors before and couldnt use it without it pulling skin.  These blades are perfect I even zero gapped them. v9000 motor is very powerful, clippers are awesome highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clipper  . it&#x27;s a must buy  for the &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; ,,easy to use and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt; the motor is very quiet and heat is very minimal  .. and make sure to  add  a 4oz oil with  this purchase</li>
