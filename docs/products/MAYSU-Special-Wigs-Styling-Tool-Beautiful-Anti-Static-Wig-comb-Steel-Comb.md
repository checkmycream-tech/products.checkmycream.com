    <li> really nice and sturdy</li>
    <li> So far i love it with no complaints. Can&#x27;t remember how long it really took to get to me but i love how loose but not loose the teeth are. If that makes sense lol it really helps with Untangling and combing the wigs the teeth cant really get stuck cuz they wiggle!! My first wig comb and i dont think i need any other. Good job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for what I paid for it but it feels a bit unsturdy</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had the issues that others have had (like it breaking to pieces) ... but i wouldn&#x27;t say this is a magical wig brush. gets the tangles out, and its pink like the picture... so yay for that i suppose.</li>
    <li> very cheap, not well made.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the way the the bristles o the comb spun around made it hard to brush my wigs . I&#x27;m going to try other wig combs.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly and it was exactly what I was wanting. The quality was great and the price was nice. I wanted a special wig brush because I ordered a wig for an upcoming Comic-con. I didn&#x27;t realize that there were special wig brushes. The company even emailed me to make sure I was completely satisfied with their product. I probably won&#x27;t need a brush for a while, but I would recommend this product and I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Yes yes I love how it detangles my hair without pulling my hair out it feels very good on my  scalp I&#x27;m in love with this comb and will buy another it works well it was delivered on time I have had no problems I&#x27;m loving this item</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s doll hair.</li>
    <li> The package seemed to be slightly open for some reason, but otherwise this is a great tool for wigs.</li>
    <li> Thi comb broke into a million pieces within the first week of use. Very useless</li>
    <li> The comb is a little wobbly not that great for synthetic wigs. I use it as a comb for my yorkie puppy, works fine for him</li>
    <li> Loving this comb, got it Thursday, September 4th, ordered it on my birthday, August 8th. I actually got a super cute star pattern on my handle. For long winfs with tangles, this comb is not the best fit. I had loads more shedding than expected and the hair got all frizzy. It&#x27;s already got stress fractures in the comb where the teeth lay and my biggest is is that they wete a least glued in place for some hold and grip on knots. I&#x27;m happy for $2.50</li>
    <li> As a stocking stuffer for a friend who has extremely not coarse but wavy hair this is just right. It appears as if it will not damage the hair.</li>
    <li> I used this comb once on a long haired wig and 3 teeth fell off within the first 10 strokes or so, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.. then again its only $2.50 so I guess it could be expected somewhat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t remember receiving this one.</li>
    <li> Does what I purchased it for and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast despite the projected 28 day maximum wait time for shipping. I actually don&#x27;t mind waiting forever for things when I order online whether it was free s&amp;h or not.&lt;br /&gt;I got this because it&#x27;s what I needed aside from my other wig comb. It works well for what I need it for. Portable and static-free. I&#x27;d rather not set off a spark at the gas station :P.&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;As an aside I loved the happy faces in the contact messages. It was nice seeing the fun side ^_^.</li>
    <li> the steel teeth move around a bit, but it does its job as a wig comb. Worth the money.</li>
