      <li>It is very light, absorbs easily,&lt;br /&gt;Oil -free, yet feels</li>
      <li>easy to give this 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Just the product our dermatologist friend strongly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I am very fair complected so the same may not be true for darker skin tones.</li>

      <li>LOVE the product, but for the first time, I purchased a two pack, and one of the pumps did not work at all.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased my first Elta MD at my dermatologist and it cost much more than the company Amazon used.  </li>
      <li>Not much smell and great protection.</li>
      <li>the Rosacea has cleared and my skin is no longer bright red.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is the only sunscreen that wont make me break out (and I&#x27;m 59 y.o.).  Goes well under makeup.  You only need a small amount for your face.  Because of the price, I ONLY use it on my face.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen lotion ever</li>
    <li> Good product for us guys.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?  My dermatologist keeps product testers in her examination rooms, so I shamelessly tried --but didn&#x27;t buy at her elevated prices---every single Elta MD  tester she had. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any sunscreen in this line. They&#x27;re all weightless, non-greasy, and amazing. I wear a serum, sunscreen, and powder everyday, and sometimes also foundation.  This sunscreen (as well as the tinted version) keep my face from feeling spackled with all the layers of products.</li>
    <li> This sunscreens feels great.  It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended Elta MD UV Clear Screen Lotion.  It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use now.  Will buy again through Amazon, which had the best price when I made my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Elta MD UV Clear is the only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Thus it&#x27;s the only sunblock I use.</li>
    <li> Love it, great for acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> The best facial sunscreen ever. No breakouts.</li>
    <li> This came as a two pack but I could only get product out of one bottle.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my rosacea and hyper-pigmentation. Love this product. Does not clog pores or leave a whitish hue.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and a little goes a long way.  We keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Purchase this and both of these were old and yellow.  They had an odor and the pump will not work so I am basically out $45 because I stocked up and when I went to use it was past the 30 days.  NEVER AGAIN!  I have heard of this and ordered this product so many times from other sellers with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  It&#x27;s thin and covers so well under makeup.  I&#x27;ll keep using it forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. I suffered from extreme post-inflammatory erythema after some terrible bouts of cystic acne. Thus, my face was covered in red dots for months, despite the fact that my acne had healed. This is a terrible fate after dealing with acne for so long; it&#x27;s almooost just as bad as the acne because despite your progress, it&#x27;s invisible to the naked eye. A tattoo of your struggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This magical sunscreen not only protected my red spots from darkening in the sunlight, but it actually healed and reversed the pigmentation in my skin. I literally saw drastic results within a week of use. I believe it&#x27;s due to the high concentration of niacinamide, a potent anti-inflammatory. Something else I noticed is that acne was less likely to crop up when using this sunscreen religiously, so I believe that it also helps to prevent my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, for being a partial physical block, this formula is quite cosmetically elegant. It rubs in clear, and is weightless on my skin. Keep in mind that I am very fair complected so the same may not be true for darker skin tones. I also don&#x27;t experience balling, as others have complained; I think it is due to using a moisturizer immediately before. It also wears well over makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this Sunscreen. It works very well for people with Acne prone skin. My Dr. sold it to me and I have been buying it on Amazon.com  since for a better price</li>
    <li> This product does not feel like you have any protection on.  Works great all day.  Even on the golf course.  I little goes a long way.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I sweat. It&#x27;s also been wonderful for daughter with incredibly sensitive skin. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes which is great. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks so can&#x27;t say much other than it is very light on the skin and while it has a scent going on that dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Great products,love it</li>
    <li> Works but for the price you can get a lot more of other brands that work just as well.  See a recent report in a leading consumer magazine for why I am saying this.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these and after finishing the first found that the pump mechanism of the second is broken. Now too late to return so I&#x27;m stuck with a broken bottle full of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen a lot - not at all greasy on my face.  However, the second bottle has a faulty pump.  I had to force the top off to use it.  The top is clearly not meant to come off, so this very expensive sunscreen went flying everywhere.  I&#x27;m very disgusted at this waste, and it&#x27;s now too late to return it.</li>
    <li> Yes, this sunscreen is on the expensive side, and it is completely worth the money. It applies with nary a white cast or grease, leaving my skin dewy and protected. Since using it, the niacinamide has decreased my redness and hyper pigmentation. My skin doesn&#x27;t flush when I apply, as it did when I used plain old neutrogena dry touch. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this sunscreen, get it. Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen at a great price.</li>
    <li> First sunscreen I&#x27;ve had that seemed to make my skin clearer rather than worse. Light and comfortable, no running into my eyes or make me feel clogged. I use this everyday, rain or shine. Works. My Dermatologist recommended it. Can&#x27;t recommend it more myself.</li>
    <li> Every dermatologist Ive ever seen recommends this sunscreen.  What I like about it most is that it blends in instantaneously and is super light.  Non greasy.  Not sure what special ingredients it may have but it says its for skin prone to acne, rosacea and hyper pigmentation.  And the SPF is higher than you find in most sunscreens or most makeup with sunscreens included.  Dermatologists suggest you wear it every day as you can even get damaging rays through cars or windows just sitting at home</li>
    <li> I love the way Elta MD UV clear screen lotion feels on my face. It is not greasy and smells good. Most importantly, it protects me from the Florida sun as I walk 5 miles daily.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that does not break me out despite the fact that I use it every day. It goes on a bit pale but it quickly turns clear/invisible. It has a very light feel. I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen given my oily, acne prone skin.  It is much more expensive when bought at the doctor&#x27;s office, well priced on Amazon.  I use this daily on my face and neck under my makeup and could not be more pleased.  This is the first sunscreen product that I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and works well under makeup.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> LOVE the product, but for the first time, I purchased a two pack, and one of the pumps did not work at all.I tried pumping it for at least 50 times.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to pry it open and save the contents in another light-proof container. Any advice on getting the pump to work before I have to break it apart will be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Non-greasy and quickly absorbed.  A little pricey!</li>
    <li> Always does a great job of protecting my face!</li>
    <li> Feels smooth and clear. Not think or what you may think about a typical sunscreen. Really does block the rays.</li>
    <li> Excellent for ultra-sensitive skin. Goes on smoothly and is not sticky. One of the few products I&#x27;ve depended on for years. Better price here than the facial surgeon.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite sunscreen, and I recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I can apply every 2 hours and still have perfect skin.  It&#x27;s not waterproof which stinks, but for everyday use, it&#x27;s very lightweight and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Lotion all it claims to be. Recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Having very sensitive &amp; fair skin, it&#x27;s always been a challenge to find a sunscreen I can use, especially for my face. I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of Elta MD lotion (spf46) because it works so well. I am very happy with the purchases and so are my wife and children who have stolen my supply. I will be reordering soon. It is greaseless so very easy to apply and wear to work. No problems with skin irritation. easy to give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use.  I hate anything that feels oily or heavy, this is neither.  I have oily skin to begin with.</li>
    <li> As a redhead - sunscreen is important.  This one is unscented so has no annoying smell.  It goes on well and blends in so there is no white residue.  It hasn&#x27;t stung the heck out of my eyes when I sweat, and so far it has not caused my skin to break out as so many other sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the sellers shipped quickly and offered a great price.  It is not white/chalky, is good for sensitive skin, and has a high SPF (46).  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using tretionin for a few months and this product is a MUST. It is lightweight, non greasy, and very very effective against the sun. I put it on my face, neck and the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Just received the 2 pack today from Texas Beauty Company and it was nice to also get a discount card for my next purchase and 2 tinted 46 spf moisturizer samples.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dematologist...non-greasy and convenient. Works great!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite sunblock for the face.  I have combination skin and even though I&#x27;m in my 40s, I still get acne.  This lotion does not block your pores, feels light and greaseless.  The only thing that would be better would be a larger and cheaper bottle!</li>
    <li> Just the product our dermatologist friend strongly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in our household young and old use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great and recommended by dermatologists. Not much smell and great protection. It&#x27;s the only kind I use. Cannot stand all the stinky suncreens. Contains zinc.</li>
    <li> great product with sunscreen built in!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Elta when I complained about other sunscreens I&#x27;d tried and found to be too greasy, too eye-irritating, insufficiently protective, etc.  She was spot-on with her recommendation.  Having used Elta daily for more than 6 months, I, in turn, have no qualms about recommending Elta to others.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended the product for my rosacea. I use it twice a day.  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Lightweight- non reflective, perfect for sensitive and acne probe skin. I am afflicted with hormonal acne and also need products that will hydrate and be compatible with my other facial products. You will not be disappointed. Most of the time I can find a better deal on Amazon than I can through my dermatologists office. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> feels great on my skin</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  I use it on my face and neck.  It is clear, not greasy and goes on well under my makeup.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told this is the best sunscreen on the market.  I use it only on my face since it is expensive.  It seems to prevent burning, though who knows if it is actually preventing sun damage. It is not oily but,  like all other sunscreens, it makes my face break out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Does not sting on my face even near my eyes.  I&#x27;m not out in the sun that much but since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer once I&#x27;m very careful.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  It goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I will use on my face.  It is very light, absorbs easily,&lt;br /&gt;Oil -free, yet feels moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Calms and protects acne-prone skin and skin prone to Rosacea and hyper-pigmentation, etc</li>
    <li> Sun protection without  ruining clothing.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Exceptional price for 2 bottles. Best product for my sensitive skin, protects from sun and also makes skin look rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> the best lotion for preventing sun damage you can get!  It&#x27;s thin, goes on clear and has zinc.</li>
    <li> Works as a perfect base underneath make up</li>
    <li> This was to replenish a supply.  The product goes on smoothly and for me does not interfer with other make-up products.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. This is not available in regular retail stores...and pricey to buy at the dermatologist office. This is the best price I have found (and even a bit better pricing to buy the 2 count vs the 1 count).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. My choice for everyday.</li>
    <li> Works great for my teenaged son. The only one I&#x27;ve been able to get him use consistently. Doesn&#x27;t aggravate acne.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not greasy and dries clear!  Very important</li>
    <li> One of the cleanest sun screen - even my dermatologist recommended this</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens for use under makeup.  Relatively matte finish--doesn&#x27;t negatively impact application of makeup--doesn&#x27;t pill up under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that after a few minutes you can&#x27;t feel it on your face.  I have had several skin cancer scares and wear it every day under makeup and without.  Already purchased 5 bottles.</li>
    <li> The best,my pick for &amp;#34;can&#x27;t do without&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Despite what some of the reviews have said, I received 2 individually boxed sunscreens as the picture indicates. Just make sure your order is shipped and sold by Amazon. Bottles expire in around 23 months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 for 40 is the best price I&#x27;ve found at a major online retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sunscreen itself, it&#x27;s great for sensitive/acne prone skin. The high niacinamide content helps to mitigate acne and red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably already like the stuff if you&#x27;re buying 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve tried makes my skin break out with either acne or a rash or both.  This caused some itching at first but it doesn&#x27;t after using for a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a year now without problem.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Excellent products.  Can&#x27;t live without them anymore.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it says LOT OF TWO thinking that I would get 2 bottles for $40.  BUT, only received one bottle.  Customer service confirmed that it is only one bottle per order.  The rep said she will forward the issue to the marketing team to change the description.  So better to get the one bottle for $20 something rather than this for $40!</li>
    <li> I have many skin problems.  I have had skin cancer and have been treated with prescription for Rosacea for three years.  After a few weeks on Elta MD the Rosacea has cleared and my skin is no longer bright red.  It goes on so smoothly and you can put make-up on shortly after applying.  I have used up to over 100 Broad-Spectrum and still I burned.  I have not burnt while using Elta MD.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this from my Dermatologist and absolutely LOVE it! My skin has improved in texture and only one small pimple in a blue moon which I can live with. No parabens which is great. Happy Amazon has it at the price if offers and I got 2 for $40! Great product!! Looking into moisturizers and cleansers next.</li>
    <li> Only sun screen to date that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! :) Recommended by my Derm and I don&#x27;t have to go into the office to purchase, thanks to Amazon!! xoxo</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nearly every day since January 25th, 2014 and I am still on my first bottle. I have extremely sensitive, break-out prone skin that is finally becoming smooth and clear! I owe it all to this product and prescription Differin lotion. This sunscreen moisturizes my skin without being too greasy or ghostly-white and I think it may be fading some of my acne scars. Anyway when I saw the great price for the two pack I decided to order them even though my original bottle from January has plenty left. This stuff is so good I&#x27;m going to hoard it!! The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it is NOT waterproof and it BURNS if you sweat or go in the pool and it gets in your eyes. Aside from that, this is an amazing product and I purchased the two pack at an unbelievable price!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product - non-greasy and light. It is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> To be clear and fair to other vendors, this review applies to the item as sold by Amazon, which at the time I write this is not listed.  Since it&#x27;s not listed, they are &amp;#34;unable&amp;#34; to correct the shipment.  I do not know how the listing is handled by the other vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this order without any invoice/shipping paperwork in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered TWO &amp;#34;lots of two&amp;#34; for a total of FOUR bottles.  Just in case the meaning of &amp;#34;lot of two&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t clear, it was clarified in the question and answer provided by Amazon in the product listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By chat, the chat agent simply offered a refund for ONE lot, so that I could order again by the current available best price, which is 50% more.  I called to try to reach a more reasonable resolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the phone representative actually had the audacity to tell me that &amp;#34;lot of two&amp;#34; means the sunscreen is double strength not that I would receive 2 bottles or a larger bottle.  Sorry, dear, but it is still SPF 46, not 92!!!!!  How stupid does Amazon think their customers are?  From the previous review listed today, I&#x27;m not the only one that received this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been issued a partial refund, but this does NOT solve my problem.  I need the product in the next few days and it is not sold locally.  The listings that were next lowest in price are now backordered.  And Amazon absolutely WILL NOT expend the funds to fulfill the order from one of their other Prime vendors.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome. Recommended by my Dermatologist. Received it quickly and was exactly as pictured. This was the best price I found on amazon.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased my first Elta MD at my dermatologist and it cost much more than the company Amazon used.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this sunscreen is so expensive, but I don&#x27;t care! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t worsen acne&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t feel oily&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t smelly&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are the price, and that the airless pump can sometimes get stuck. I find if you give it a soft tap on the counter, that it fixes it.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunblock that I use is not greasy for your face,  last all day!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Two dermatologists recommended this sun screen. The titanium is an important ingredient. I have noticed that I have broken out occasionally since using this product, but pimples in my senior years are better than skin cancer. It goes on nicely. It leaves a slight white film that disappears almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good service.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I live in FL and both my spouse and I use this during the day and have no complaints.  It provides great coverage and protection. It isn&#x27;t greasy and provides &amp;#34;unseen&amp;#34; coverage...especially for men.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on easily and hardly burns your eyes.  Do not apply to forehead if it bothers you.</li>
    <li> So light. I use it daily. I have acne and it does not make it worse. It is non-greasy and lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is great for the summer time, very light with good SPF.</li>
    <li> This sun screen is recommended by our dermatologist. It does not leave a greasy feeling or build up and the price here is very reasonable. Great product, will be buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> This works very well under makeup. I have oily skin and it works well for me. I will buy again.</li>
