      <li>Great product!!!</li>
      <li>And the reusable one by Carbona may be the best bet.  </li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s my laundry&#x27;s perfect security blanket!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>[An excellent product.</li>
      <li>and it looked great.</li>
      <li>These are great for keeping colored clothes bright</li>
      <li>Good for keeping dyed items from bleeding onto lighter colored items.</li>
      <li>but I have heard good results with this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it for myself</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>Love these and can be used till they turn brown!</li>
      <li>Best way around this is to put the color catcher in a washing net, the kind women wash their stockings in.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>At first I loved the Shout Color Catcher.  </li>
      <li>it worked great, but when I put two to three sheets in with new quilts</li>
      <li>Does a good job with clothes didn&#x27;t work with our new quilts.</li>
      <li>Pretty ingenious.  </li>
      <li>I bought for college dorm student with new clothes and doing own laundry.</li>
      <li>to use to clean my  brushes while I paint (acrylics paintings not walls)</li>
      <li>Great for a small load with both darks and lights :)</li>
      <li>Make sure you use the whole sheet.  </li>
      <li>We washed it again with the color catcher in with a full load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found it&#x27;s a good idea to use a color catcher for the first several loads that include bath towels that are deeply-colored.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the concept of throwing out yet another thing so often, but was willing to do so to save my clothes from runs.  </li>
      <li>Everything was just as I expected and I am pleased with the service</li>
      <li>It really seemed to work well.  </li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell you how many  t-shirts, pants, button down shirts, sheets,</li>
      <li>It was highly recommended by my quilt group.</li>
      <li>At any rate, I rarely do laundry without using this or a similar product.</li>
      <li>I always wait until a new dark colored item has been washed twice on its own before I wash it with the mixed load.</li>
      <li>If it catches color, I would not know, because the sheet comes out of the washer exactly the same color as when I put it in.  </li>
      <li>I cut mine in 1/2 for smaller loads but bigger loads you need a whole sheet.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;d give the product 5 stars in general, but</li>
      <li>The Color Catcher is a lovely pale pink, but so is the white shirt.  </li>
      <li>Love getting this on a regular basis - less expensive and always available.</li>
      <li>My husband had a new blue and white striped shirt he had washed the week before</li>
      <li>If you are concerned about the possibility of ruining  your clothes then use the product, but I am not sure it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I especially like using worth work out clothes that usually go in one load.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it in every load, but I do use them when I&#x27;m laundering a new garment and don&#x27;t know whether it will &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; onto other items.</li>

<li> I purchase the same 24 count product at the grocery store and at Walmart for less than $4.00 a box</li>
<li> I am a quilter and will not even risk washing a single quilt for the first time without at least 2 of these little pieces of heaven in the washer!</li>
<li> I always like to have these around for when I do mixed loads--which is not very often--but when I do want to do a mixed load, at least I know I have them.  </li>
<li> I use these every week to wash my dress clothes all in one load - black pants and light tops washed in cold water.</li>
<li> I think I prefer the other brand by Carbona  </li>
<li> It does as it says, it absorbs color released into the water to keep it off other color fabrics.</li>
<li> The squares did not bleed into each other though.</li>
<li> I was skeptical that Color Catchers would really work, but it DOES work well!</li>
<li> /&gt;that have been rescued by these little sheets.</li>
<li> so I was a little scared to try washing it with these sheets.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk breaking your machine.</li>
<li> /&gt;We were both shocked when he took the shirt out of the washer and the blue was pulled off the white stripes.</li>
<li> I bought for my daughter away in college years ago, because those college kids usually wash all their things together</li>
<li> Since I started using this product a few years ago, I have saved countless items from being ruined from random color in the water settling on a defenseless piece of clothing.  </li>
<li> and I only use it in my cold washes.  </li>
<li> I found two of the suckers in my filter completley blogged.    </li>
<li> $7.00 for a box, plus over $6 shipping is ridiculous highway robbery.     </li>
<li> seriously.  </li>
<li> Will be sad when they are gone</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We bought these yesterday. My husband had a new blue and white striped shirt he had washed the week before and the blue had bled onto the white parts. We washed it again with the color catcher in with a full load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both shocked when he took the shirt out of the washer and the blue was pulled off the white stripes. We both thought the shirt was ruined. Will use this every time!</li>
    <li> seriously.  Since I started using this product a few years ago, I have saved countless items from being ruined from random color in the water settling on a defenseless piece of clothing.  I wouldn&#x27;t wash my clothing without it--please don&#x27;t EVER discontinue this item--it&#x27;s my laundry&#x27;s perfect security blanket!</li>
    <li> Love getting this on a regular basis - less expensive and always available. I was skeptical that Color Catchers would really work, but it DOES work well!</li>
    <li> [An excellent product. No running of colors.I&#x27;m a quilter and use it for all my fabrics.    [ASIN:B0012H31YM Shout Color Catcher]]</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It really works.  I have been using it for years.  Amazon is too pricey.  I purchase the same 24 count product at the grocery store and at Walmart for less than $4.00 a box and I am not paying for shipping.  $12.13 plus shipping is way to pricey.</li>
    <li> Using color catcher is the fastest way to clogg your machines outlet pipe or filter.  I found two of the suckers in my filter completley blogged.    Best way around this is to put the color catcher in a washing net, the kind women wash their stockings in.</li>
    <li> I have been using  Shout color catchers since they came out.(I&#x27;m 41)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many  t-shirts, pants, button down shirts, sheets, you name it,&lt;br /&gt;that have been rescued by these little sheets. I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store either.&lt;br /&gt;Please Amazon don&#x27;t drop these! Also by putting them in the dryer, I have colored paper to use&lt;br /&gt; in my multi media art projects or to use to clean my  brushes while I paint (acrylics paintings not walls)</li>
    <li> If it catches color, I would not know, because the sheet comes out of the washer exactly the same color as when I put it in.  I still use it &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; a darker color should leach onto a lighter color and I only use it in my cold washes.  If you are concerned about the possibility of ruining  your clothes then use the product, but I am not sure it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this price.  You can get the same product of 24 sheets for $4.49.  What is with this price?</li>
    <li> Good for keeping dyed items from bleeding onto lighter colored items. I don&#x27;t use it in every load, but I do use them when I&#x27;m laundering a new garment and don&#x27;t know whether it will &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; onto other items. I have found it&#x27;s a good idea to use a color catcher for the first several loads that include bath towels that are deeply-colored.</li>
    <li> At first I loved the Shout Color Catcher.  It really seemed to work well.  I didn&#x27;t like the concept of throwing out yet another thing so often, but was willing to do so to save my clothes from runs.  However, when one of these got stuck somehow in my washing machine&#x27;s pipes, I was horrified.  After hours of moving wet clothes, draining water by hand, taking the machine apart, and discovering one sole dye grabbing cloth wedged in the pipe (preventing the water from draining out), I vowed to never again purchase these sheets.  I found a terry cloth from Carbona Dye Grabbers, which(though a bit more expensive and harder to find) won&#x27;t cause that problem (and can be re-used for a cleaning rag after the 30 uses.)  Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk breaking your machine.</li>
    <li> I use this product in every wash load (though I usually cut the sheets in half, unless I&#x27;m washing something new, and they still work very well).    However, you can get a box of Shout Color Catcher Sheets for approximately $3.59 at Target, and less than $4.00 at most at any store in the U.S.A. that carries them.  $7.00 for a box, plus over $6 shipping is ridiculous highway robbery.     So I&#x27;d give the product 5 stars in general, but at this price? It gets one.</li>
    <li> This product is made by SC Johnson-not J&amp;J&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product tho. I don&#x27;t wash colors without it!</li>
    <li> These are great for keeping colored clothes bright</li>
    <li> I always like to have these around for when I do mixed loads--which is not very often--but when I do want to do a mixed load, at least I know I have them.  I bought for my daughter away in college years ago, because those college kids usually wash all their things together--they don&#x27;t care about mixing the colors.</li>
    <li> I made a baby quilt and then washed it and it looked great.I did not wash the material ahead of time so I was a little scared to try washing it with these sheets. Great product!!! It was highly recommended by my quilt group.</li>
    <li> Everything was just as I expected and I am pleased with the service</li>
    <li> Love these! I never have to worry about clothes running! Great for a small load with both darks and lights :)</li>
    <li> This WORKS!  Make sure you use the whole sheet.  I cut mine in 1/2 for smaller loads but bigger loads you need a whole sheet.  Pretty ingenious.  Saves energy, water, time and money!</li>
    <li> I use it as needed when I mix colors in the same wash load. It does as it says, it absorbs color released into the water to keep it off other color fabrics. Usually when the clothing is new. Or you forget and add colors to white. I don&#x27;t even want to try that. I bought for college dorm student with new clothes and doing own laundry. It works.</li>
    <li> Love these and can be used till they turn brown! I usually have 4 or more going at different shades and got quite a few people to start using them too!</li>
    <li> I did a couple of test loads with lesser clothes and red items recently.  I thought the Color Catchers worked.  Today I made a mixed load with some red socks that have been washed dozens of times over years!  I am now struggling to get the pink out of a quality white shirt.  The Color Catcher is a lovely pale pink, but so is the white shirt.  DO NOT DEPEND ON SHOUT COLOR CATCHERS TO PROTECT YOUR WHITES!!!</li>
    <li> I think I prefer the other brand by Carbona  that does the same job.  And the reusable one by Carbona may be the best bet.  At any rate, I rarely do laundry without using this or a similar product.</li>
    <li> Why did they discontinue this product?  I dibt get it. I see the colors on the product not the clothes. I especially like using worth work out clothes that usually go in one load. Love it.  Will be sad when they are gone</li>
    <li> sent a box of these with my son as he left for college. He washes every clothing item in one cycle. The color catchers prevent him from having to wear &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; undershirts.</li>
    <li> I use these every week to wash my dress clothes all in one load - black pants and light tops washed in cold water. I have not had any problems with color transfer. I always wait until a new dark colored item has been washed twice on its own before I wash it with the mixed load.</li>
    <li> I am a quilter and will not even risk washing a single quilt for the first time without at least 2 of these little pieces of heaven in the washer! Love these. Also helps when hubby does the laundry.......</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but I have heard good results with this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it for myself</li>
    <li> Does a good job with clothes didn&#x27;t work with our new quilts. I had two quilters recommend this product to me and when I used it with a shirt that was constantly bleeding it worked great, but when I put two to three sheets in with new quilts the white tag of those quilts stained. The squares did not bleed into each other though.</li>
