      <li>Love this for hair care and cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I love having these reviews to read, which help me make the most informed and accurate buying decisions.  </li>
      <li>I love the size of the bottle as it is easy to store on the countertop or in the cabinet.</li>
      <li>You would think this would be an easy task, but unfortunately most bottles do not seem to have that function.  </li>
      <li>They are all still working perfectly fine, although I probably treat them nicer than most people.</li>
      <li>The ones I use most often, kept inside, are still working fine.</li>
      <li>These have been working great so far.  </li>
      <li>These are much better than the cheap bottles you can get at 99 cent stores or at beauty supply stores.  </li>
      <li>It sprays well and most importantly it does not leak around the neck.</li>
      <li>They really work well, surprisingly.</li>
      <li>Easy to fix:  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t plan to use these for like a cleaning business then they are fine.</li>
      <li>There is NO option for fine mist.  </li>
      <li>However, lighter mixes do not come out in a fine, light mist with this</li>
      <li>5 stars, excellent little squirt bottle.  </li>
      <li>The spray is nice and focused and works very well.</li>
      <li>These produce a nice spray, or a heavier stream depending on how much you turn the nozzle.</li>
      <li>These spray bottles are great for my alcohol essential oils mix for a body spray shower in a bottle.</li>
      <li>I bought these to use as miniature misting bottles and they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
      <li>-Adjustable from a super fine mist to a stream that reaches 15 feet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally purchased these to hold homemade cleaning products and air fresheners.  </li>
      <li>Fast and easy!</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a fine mist from these spray bottles, but they&#x27;re more like a regular spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>The bottles come individually wrapped so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>My kids take them to their sports activities in the summer to keep cool, and now my daughter uses one for her hair.</li>
      <li>(that touches the bottom of the bottle when installed), then take regular scissors and cut 0.25\\&quot; to 0.5\\&quot; off the end of the straw, replace the removable tip, and you are good to go.  </li>
      <li>Very fine mist, not to big of a bottle for easy carry on a cycling commute.</li>
      <li>Very even and fine mist</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really great little mister bottles.</li>
      <li>These little spray bottles work great.  </li>
      <li>The small size is simply awesome for portability and making chores a breeze since you can carry a couple bottles in normal pockets (not skinny jean pockets!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that they do have a fine mist or a nice jet spray.</li>
      <li>These are small but do a great job.</li>
      <li>These bottles, when turned most of the way closed, shoot out a fine mist.  </li>
      <li>The size is great for this use and, although I have only used these for a few weeks, they work well, spray evenly and are easy to grip and use.  </li>
      <li>It was way too easy to use up all 6 of them, and I will be needing to order more in the near future.</li>
      <li>These little bottles come with adjustable sprayers and are really pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>So, for me, it still works because the lowest mist setting does exactly what I need it to do with the thicker scalp moisturizers I use.</li>
      <li>[Update Jan 2015] Back for more today.  </li>
      <li>I have also found that we can carry more types of products in a smaller area.</li>
      <li>and they hold exactly the amount that I need.</li>
      <li>exactly the size and shape</li>
      <li>Seem kinda cheap for professional use, though.</li>
      <li>Still works overall, for most of my needs.  </li>
      <li>They work great when they work as long as you are looking for a tiny spray bottle.</li>
      <li>They are a great size for small batches of home-made cleaning products!  </li>
      <li>These spray bottles can be adjusted from a pretty strong stream all the way down to a fine mist.</li>
      <li>They seem really well made and do not leak.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to empty the bottle of water and put it in your suitcase or carry-on.  </li>
      <li>It works very well for both uses.</li>
      <li>I consider it a very durable product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These have been working great so far.  Great value.  Been using these to spray essential oils, homemade cleansers, water for plants, etc.</li>
    <li> Some sprayers don&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> Not a very fine mist at all. Pretty much the only reason why I ordered these was to get one with an actual fine mist</li>
    <li> exactly the size and shape I was looking for. Made my own mixture of yoga mat spray and gave away as gifts.</li>
    <li> These spray bottles can be adjusted from a pretty strong stream all the way down to a fine mist. Perfect for what I was looking for and a great price too.</li>
    <li> These bottles are of good value. I use my set to spray leave in conditioner in my clients hair. I love the fact that it has measurement increments on the side being that sometimes I may want to mix a concoction of some sort. It sprays well and most importantly it does not leak around the neck. I consider it a very durable product.</li>
    <li> love these spray bottles, last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I use these for my car detailing chemicals.  Work great.</li>
    <li> I have only had these Soft &#x27;N Style Fine Mist Spray Bottles for about a month.  I use them for waters, alcohols, and oils.  They seem really well made and do not leak.  I will purchase more of these.</li>
    <li> Afraid of cheap? Don&#x27;t be! These spray bottles are great for my alcohol essential oils mix for a body spray shower in a bottle. Very fine mist, not to big of a bottle for easy carry on a cycling commute.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars because I just like it I don&#x27;t love it...for  I didn&#x27;t realize how little 8 oz was...thinking of returning...but might just keep it and give some away to family....don&#x27;t purchase if you really do not know what 8 oz is going to provide for you. Other than that it sprays a mist and stream and works as advertised,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Review  1/22/14&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy and great quality for the price. If you want to spray a mist of anything else but a water based product...it will only stream....</li>
    <li> These little bottles come with adjustable sprayers and are really pretty good quality. I use them for the car detailing solutions we carry around in our trunk bags. The 8 ounce size is plenty big enough and takes up much less space than 12 or 16 ounce bottles. Best of all, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> It took weeks to ship then wasn&#x27;t as advertised. It&#x27;s not a fine mist at all. It&#x27;s a solid single jet stream of liquid that the nozzle puts out</li>
    <li> I like these - but pack of six?  I opened the box to see only a pack of three. Am I missing something?</li>
    <li> After wasting vehicle detailing product in larger 32oz sprayers it was time to try something. Purchased these and found they are a great answer. They have a great adjustable nozzle. Owning a high end seasonal detailing company I need a small efficient mister/sprayer. We push Pro Wax detailing products through these with no problem. I have also found that we can carry more types of products in a smaller area. Get a medium $1 funnel at a box store and your all set. By the way, we don&#x27;t use hazardous liquids. So if you do I&#x27;m not sure if these are designed for that. We fill these more often but don&#x27;t waste any product ! Saves money...</li>
    <li> I bought these spray bottles to hold cleaning products in our 5th wheel travel trailer.  The size is great for this use and, although I have only used these for a few weeks, they work well, spray evenly and are easy to grip and use.  I have just purchased another set to use in the house.</li>
    <li> Bought these for two purposes: to use when ironing to mist my clothes and to fill with bleach to clean the toilets and sanitize sinks. It works very well for both uses.</li>
    <li> I use this bottle for my homeade hair mists. They will sometimes contain oil, conditioner, water, aloe vera juice, or even shea butter. This bottle is very strong the nozzle does not get clogged even with thick liquids. I love the size of the bottle as it is easy to store on the countertop or in the cabinet. The lever is big enough so that my busy 1 year old can&#x27;t inadvertantly spray everything if she gets her hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the variability of the flow is not pronounced enough. At the lowest setting, a mist does come out but it is still a very strong mist. And, at the highest setting, the stream is extremely forceful. So, for me, it still works because the lowest mist setting does exactly what I need it to do with the thicker scalp moisturizers I use. However, lighter mixes do not come out in a fine, light mist with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if for anyone who mixes liquids at home. It is reliable and has a great price point.</li>
    <li> These are for household cleaners, NOT personal beauty liquids or lotions.  The mist is NOT Fine, but a blast.  Very disappointed with them.</li>
    <li> they work well, serve their purpose. i use them to put in my homemade household cleaners. i recommend them. thanks.</li>
    <li> about half of them don&#x27;t spray properly.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again though, some are already in the trash</li>
    <li> I use these bottles for water and cleaning, and they have never leaked regardless of spray setting. The size is great because they don&#x27;t take much room. I now keep small bottles of each cleaning solution we need in the kitchen and both bathrooms. Fast and easy! Actually found so many uses that I just placed a second order.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, you must buy a pack of 6, so I gave some to friends.  This bottle seems to work well, but it&#x27;s small, so you will need to fill up more often.  I haven&#x27;t used them for long, so will have to see if they work over time, but so far they are fine.</li>
    <li> There is NO option for fine mist.  It delivers a straight line of fluid - PERIOD!  The name is a flat out lie!</li>
    <li> These little spray bottles work great.  The plastic is a bit thin (my cat has punctured two of them), but for the price I am surprised that the nozzles are so effective. I hate spray bottles that either won&#x27;t mist or won&#x27;t jet or get too much air in the hose when you are trying to spray.  These work just like a spray bottle should and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased these to hold homemade cleaning products and air fresheners.  However, in moments of desperation I have also used them to hold more caustic agents like 25% bleach solution.  After 5 months they have held up to the abuse, and the sprayers still work perfectly!  These are much better than the cheap bottles you can get at 99 cent stores or at beauty supply stores.  Bottom Line: Would recommend these for anything for which you need just a small amount of product (8 oz is approximately one fluid cup).</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  Bought them for the kids to use outside.  You can tighten the nozzle to have either spray or stream.</li>
    <li> These sprayers produce a fine mist with a good volume and no spatters.  They can also be adjusted to shoot a solid stream of water up to about 12 feet, handy if you have cats.  Well constructed, thick plastic.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade bug spray and a perfect size to put in a backpack.  Nice fine mist. Good packaging</li>
    <li> These are small but do a great job. I&#x27;ve used them on my hair, around the house for cleaning and they rock.</li>
    <li> They work well. I only gave it four stars because one of the bottles had a leak. Other than that they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These produce a nice spray, or a heavier stream depending on how much you turn the nozzle. Very easy to use for homemade body sprays, etc.</li>
    <li> Great water spray bottle. Use it for lots of stuff. It does run out fast since it is pretty small. Great for terrariums.</li>
    <li> They work great when they work as long as you are looking for a tiny spray bottle. Some of them stopped working shortly after I got them though and will no longer spray. Other than that they do have a fine mist or a nice jet spray.</li>
    <li> [Update Jan 2015] Back for more today.  Sadly, I&#x27;ve left a few behind in hotels, but at this price, I don&#x27;t sweat it.      I find myself using these at home quite often.  Just so much less effort than ironing.    ----------  These are excellent spray bottles.  They do (despite some of the other reviews) adjust their spray type, from a direct jet to a very fine mist.  The nozzle screws to make this adjustment.  Tighten it all the way and you&#x27;ve locked it (cannot spray).  Loosen it just a bit more and you get the mist.  Loosen all the way and you get the direct jet.    Two tips:  1. The \\&quot;straw\\&quot; that extends into the bottle is just a bit too long for the bottle.  Easy to fix:  Just pull the removable tip at the bottom of the straw (that touches the bottom of the bottle when installed), then take regular scissors and cut 0.25\\&quot; to 0.5\\&quot; off the end of the straw, replace the removable tip, and you are good to go.  2. I travel a lot for business, and this has become an essential part of my suitcase.  Make sure to empty the bottle of water and put it in your suitcase or carry-on.  Then, once at the hotel, grab your wrinkled clothes for the next day out of the suitcase, mist them on all sides, then hang them up.  By the morning, they will be dry and wrinkle free.  Much less effort than ironing! :-)    Great product and price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. The bottles come individually wrapped so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> 5 stars, excellent little squirt bottle.  I bought 6.  None have failed yet, which normally happens to the nozzle or pump mechanism on plastic spray bottles.  So far i&#x27;ve filled bottles with windex, rust remover, simple green solution, and plain water.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> The caps that regulate the sorry came off soon after using the bottle. Love the size. Love the way it sprays. But the bottle is of no use without the cap to regulate the spray</li>
    <li> i shopped for a long time to try to find a FINE MIST spray bottle to use to infuse essential oils into the air......WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY ARE ONLY LABELED 8 OZ SPRAY BOTTLE.....AND THEY HAVE A SPRAY AS ANY OTHER SPRAY BOTTLE......I HATE MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENTS AND WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN FOR THAT VERY REASON.......</li>
    <li> The spray of these bottles easily makes it across a decent size room - perfect for a cat deterrent. The spray is nice and focused and works very well.</li>
    <li> It does what the description says it does. You can adjust the nozzle for a single stream of water or mist. Those complaining there is not mist feature either didn&#x27;t try to turn the nozzle or they were sent defective bottles because all 6 of the bottle I received have both misting and stream.</li>
    <li> The quality is excellent, better than I was expecting at the price.  The size is good and it fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> Love this for hair care and cleaning.  Since the girls are 2, we don&#x27;t put harsh cleaners in them because one is for spraying their hair and another is for spraying the toilet.  lemon and grapefruit peels soaked in vinegar and hydrogen peroxide for 2 weeks makes an awesome cleaner. just add a drop or two of dish soap to act as a surfactant.</li>
    <li> None of them broke, and we used them all the time. My kids take them to their sports activities in the summer to keep cool, and now my daughter uses one for her hair. They really work well, surprisingly.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 and two failed.  The common denominator is the heat of my trunk. The ones I use most often, kept inside, are still working fine. Nice, convenient, size.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a fine mist from these spray bottles, but they&#x27;re more like a regular spray bottle.  Still works overall, for most of my needs.  They&#x27;re also a good value.</li>
    <li> They bottles are study and sprays a nice mist for water based liquids and a stream for oil based liquids.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as miniature misting bottles and they&#x27;re fantastic. Very even and fine mist and they hold exactly the amount that I need. My only complaint is that it takes a little bit of fiddling to screw the sprayer onto the bottle, but maybe it&#x27;s just me. They&#x27;re really great little mister bottles.</li>
    <li> I bought a small terrarium for my office and needed a small spray bottle to mist it.  After looking at product specific misters, I decided to buy a spray bottle instead.  I am glad I did.  The size of these bottles is spot on for my needs (8oz).  They are great quality and spray an even stream.  I love having these reviews to read, which help me make the most informed and accurate buying decisions.  For the price, you just cannot go wrong.  AND as a prime member, I received 2 day shipping free!</li>
    <li> -Adjustable from a super fine mist to a stream that reaches 15 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;NOTE: This is not like a squirt gun. While concentrated up close, the stream does spread out the farther it travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bottles seal perfectly and never leak or drip out the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A suction is not formed inside the bottle as I&#x27;ve noticed with other cheap sprayers which require you to unscrew the nozzle after several squirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-In total, 7.5\\&quot; tall and bottle has 2.5\\&quot; diameter. The small size is simply awesome for portability and making chores a breeze since you can carry a couple bottles in normal pockets (not skinny jean pockets!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Standard size threading on nozzle. Can fit other bottles, but tube is limited to 5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My use includes plain water, plant fertilizer, floor cleaners, rubbing alcohol, vinegar, lemon juice, mineral oil, etc. without issues. Note: All fluids were room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No measuring marks, but not a problem for me. I used a measuring cup and a permanent marker and wrote ticks on the bottles. It took less than 60 seconds per bottle and well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Tip: If you do this, I also recommend covering your marks with some clear tape so they don&#x27;t fade or smear when if wash them or get chemicals on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five months ago I bought these and I use them all the time for misting. They are all still working perfectly fine, although I probably treat them nicer than most people. I can&#x27;t say how long they&#x27;d last for a strong-handed person or someone squeezing them hastily. I am also careful not to tighten the nozzle too much when setting it for misting so that the pump doesn&#x27;t get overworked.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t plan to use these for like a cleaning business then they are fine. We bought them for hair, home cleaning, and cat training and they are great. Seem kinda cheap for professional use, though.</li>
    <li> These were great to line up a bunch of our most often used cleaning products over the sink (vinegar, vinegear/water solution, hydrogen peroxide, Fit produce wash, etc) - we just printed and stuck some labels on them and now it&#x27;s easy to grab these nice unassuming bottles for the task at hand, rather than using a bulky ugly cleaner bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these!  They are a great size for small batches of home-made cleaning products!  They also have an adjustable nozzle and work amazingly well at the fine-mist end of it!</li>
    <li> I make my own household cleaners, sanitizers and herbal air sprays, so I was looking for a bottle that could mist.  You would think this would be an easy task, but unfortunately most bottles do not seem to have that function.  These bottles, when turned most of the way closed, shoot out a fine mist.  I have been using them for several weeks now with no trouble, which is more than I can say for spray bottles I bought at the grocery store that fell apart after normal use. I have used these to water seedlings, and for homemade bug spray as well.  It was way too easy to use up all 6 of them, and I will be needing to order more in the near future.</li>
