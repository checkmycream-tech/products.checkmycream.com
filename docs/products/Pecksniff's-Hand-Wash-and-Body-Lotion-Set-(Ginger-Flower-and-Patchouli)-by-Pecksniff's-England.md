    <li> lotion but.......scent don&#x27;t last!</li>
    <li> LOVE Pecksniff products and the scent is lovely. Feels very luxurious.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of the soap is lovely and is very mild on your hands. You feel clean and fresh. I love the hand lotion as well. I have this in my guest bathroom .... and I must say..... It makes for a very beautiful display !! Quite a few of my friends have commented on it. In fact .... I was visiting a dear friend for the weekend and loved this product so much .... I ordered it when I arrived home. It&#x27;s a bit pricey.... but a little bit goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a soap and lotion with Patchouli.  Came across this set and decided to give it a shot.  Glad I did. I love these products.  The fragrance is light and most pleasant.  Not only is the lotion&#x27;s fragrance wonderful, a little goes a long way and leaves my skin soft and feeling nice.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The service and packaging were excellent and the product great.  I would like to purchase this fragrance in a perfume, will check to see if it is available.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff. It is delicious. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance.  Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Loved the scent of the Hand wash, when I purchased in one of our local stores and could no longer find it until I went into great Amazon .com and there it was. This time I also purchased the Body lotion and love it as well. Great product and I hope you continue have it in stock. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Shaina</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set.  The scent is so soothing and hands feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I was able to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> When staying at a B &amp; B up in the Berkshires, I discovered this lovely handwash and lotion.  I loved the gentle fragrance and even the handwash made my skin soft...so I searched for it on-line and ordered it.  I hope it will always be available as I&#x27;ve found none I like better.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a soap/lotion that has a patchouli odor this is not the product for you. The scent is closer to baby powder. :-(  Was very unhappy and disappointed. I always read the reviews on an item before before buying but this time they lead me astray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else. And now I have my sister-in-law hooked on it!&lt;br /&gt;Mary Donohue</li>
