      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>An ok replacement for a cheaper brow powder.  </li>
      <li>Of course, most of those brandz cost ~</li>
      <li>Just read the label to make sure that WAX is the 1st ingredient listed-</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, lasted all day, and came off easily with makeup wipes.</li>
      <li>I am going to buy another as the price is fantastic and my 13 year took off with the one I had.</li>
      <li>, I thought how important can this be?</li>
      <li>Otherwise, chapstix contain mineral oil as primary ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality service, personal touch and helpful advice on which colors might work best for me that Grace My Face Minerals has freely offered.  </li>
      <li>I had Brooke Shields brows when I was young and they have thinned out with age but still look pretty good.</li>
      <li>So far I have used concealer powder, this product, and some stunning (but muted) eyeshadows and have only good things to say about this company.  </li>
      <li>It matches perfectly with my blonde hair and looks natural even in direct sunlight!</li>
      <li>Depending upon your own personal ratio of Wax to Powder.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s a rare Seller, &amp; an Asset to the e-marketplace.  </li>
      <li>then I comb a clear coat on top.</li>
      <li>It looks more natural on me then</li>
      <li>light / bright face powder, for highlighting / accentuating the contrast between brow color against pale skin color, also for correcting under-eye circles,</li>
      <li>In an ocean of etail misrepresentation, just how much her FAB customer service, is appreciated !!!  </li>
      <li>Since my choicest cosmetic piks always seem bound for discontinuation, right?  </li>
      <li>I have very sparse eyebrows and The Dark Ash Blonde is perfect for fairer skinned women.  </li>
      <li>that are still a medium brown, and this product softens my natural brow, and lets me draw on the missing tail of my brow to blend beautifully with the rest.  </li>
      <li>I used to have the fullest, most face-framing eyebrows, &amp; I never gave &amp;#34;Eyebrows&amp;#34; a 2nd thought.  </li>
      <li>I put the wax on first then</li>
      <li>I really like this set!</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, product as described works very VERY well..</li>
      <li>I contacted Seller w/ some very polite, specific packaging requests, (of course I offered to pay any add&#x27;l charges incurred), &amp; to my delighted astonishment, this Seller totally understood &amp; responded to my concerns!  </li>
      <li>and I love, love this Dark Ash Blonde eyebrow set!!</li>
      <li>My hair is medium brown, but most even most blonde eyebrow fillers are too dark for me.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This is a great product for shaping or filling in thin eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Who wants ORANGE eyebrowz?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, &amp; I always buy the absolute fairest powder among all brands...</li>
      <li>Suddenly, no worries :)  Each came stacked in a 3-pc, compact, screw-on / connecting clear acrylic jars- (1)</li>
      <li>Like many women, I don&#x27;t dig the current &amp;#34;Brow Bonanza&amp;#34;, but rather, I NEED a natural, understated Brow extender &amp; filler-</li>
      <li>Magical Perfection for us Dark Blonde - Light / Med.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow out my eyebrows fully due to a health condition.</li>
      <li>Ashe Brow Powder &#x3D; LIGHT (stays light w/ water, after dry); BUT DARKENS dramatically / permanently when mixed w/ Wax or Oil !</li>
      <li>less wax w/ More Powder &#x3D; a darker Brow &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>OK, on to this actual product- Brow Powder, in my color choice &amp;#34;Dark Ash Blonde !  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural and boosts my confidence!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it(:</li>
      <li>Only to have it d/c&#x27;d (when Bare Minerals d/c&#x27;d their magical Ash Blonde / Med. Brown Brow powder, &amp; we girlz went into panic mode!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter &amp;</li>
      <li>I really cannot believe how much you actually get for the price...</li>
      <li>This KEY final step that will soften &amp; genuinely &amp;#34;set&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are very blonde, I just used this and like it very much.</li>
      <li>Always applying more intense than needed, finishing w/ the LAST step, of intensively brushing in some transucent face powder, to soften the color &amp; any harsh edges, &amp; set a natural look, that lasts all day (through skiing, swimming, hiking, high humidity, etc.)  </li>
      <li>After the right powder shade/ tone, the next single most important component required to achieve a natural Brow, is a very stiff Brow brush!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned that more wax w/ less powder &#x3D; a sheerer, lighter wash of color (where I want that, in the inner corners of my Browz)- Vs.</li>
      <li>My challenge has been to find soft pigments that brighten, but do not dominate my fairer skin color and blond/silver hair.  </li>
      <li>ago, well into my 40&#x27;s, I was applying an intense eye, &amp; suddenly noticed that my Brows&#x27; &amp;#34;tails&amp;#34; had disappeared-</li>
      <li>She really went WAY above &amp; beyond the call, to accommodate my personality quirks.  </li>
      <li>In contrast, Wax (or Oil) completely transforms this Ashe Blonde color, from a lovely Delicate, Pale Blonde Powder, into a gorgeous, rich, deep, dark, Mid-Brown!  </li>
      <li>Ash Blonde Brow powder is a highly pigmented / color saturated / neutral / natural tone, (blissfully!)</li>
      <li>Absolutely Amazing product (all of them are, seriously!)</li>
      <li>It is soooo hard to fine taupe brow/shadows</li>
      <li>The color is a little more ashy than expected and definitely does not go on as well as</li>
      <li>I used Bare Essentials brow powder before they discontinued it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Summary:  This &amp;#34;Ashe Blonde&amp;#34; color (seems genuinely Great for actual pale Blondes, btw!), is very pale / light (although initially may seem to darken when applied wet, it dries right back down to a very pale shade).  </li>
      <li>Once complete, use a giant face-powder brush to liberally smoosh face-powder all up &amp; deeply into your Wax-Powdered Brows...  </li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been sick at my never ending search of a good brow product</li>
<li> powder stays put all day, came with an extra lighter blonde shade of powder and a second long angle brush.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff.  I used Bare Essentials brow powder before they discontinued it. This is equally as good.  A little goes a long way and it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I really like this set! exactly what I wanted. I will purchase this again.</li>

It&#x27;s very long lastly and versatile especially since you can change the color (if needed) if you decide to change your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This is great.  It is soooo hard to fine taupe brow/shadows but this is great and while I didn&#x27;t think I needed wax - it&#x27;s awesome - allows very nice definition.  Will buy again (and have).</li>
    <li> I love this mineral brow duo.  It&#x27;s affordable and gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow shaper kit. It&#x27;s my favorite because you can blend bettervti create the color you want</li>
    <li> Love this!  Fills the brows in nicely. Easy to apply.  Stays put</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used eyebrow powder before, and this was the perfect first kit. It comes with the perfect shade of powder for my ash blond eyebrows, shaping wax, lighter powder for touchups, and a great little brush. It was easy to apply, lasted all day, and came off easily with makeup wipes. This is a great product for shaping or filling in thin eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great brow powder.  Color is as described.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the best brow powder I have ever used. I had Brooke Shields brows when I was young and they have thinned out with age but still look pretty good. I have used many, many brands and this is the best. I put the wax on first then the colors then I comb a clear coat on top. I have an amazing eyebrow brush from Hakuhodo that is my favorite. It is wider and longer then average brushes. I use the dark ash blonde though I have medium brown hair. It looks more natural on me then the darker shades(they can look harsh at times especially on us forty something&#x27;s). I am going to buy another as the price is fantastic and my 13 year took off with the one I had. Love this brand!</li>
    <li> GREAT brow powder for a great price. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Too dark and it does not look good on! I want my money back! Thanks</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are very blonde, I just used this and like it very much.</li>
    <li> An ok replacement for a cheaper brow powder.  The color is a little more ashy than expected and definitely does not go on as well as other brands but I would buy again simply for the price factor.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It matches perfectly with my blonde hair and looks natural even in direct sunlight! It came early and was in excellent condition! I highly recommend it(:</li>
    <li> I really like it.  I have very sparse eyebrows and The Dark Ash Blonde is perfect for fairer skinned women.  My hair is medium brown, but most even most blonde eyebrow fillers are too dark for me.  The wax helps it to stay on all day.  I also bought a Duo Eyebrow Brush by Keshima to apply it and it is a really nice brush.  I will order this again and I am throwing out all the other failed products.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, product as described works very VERY well.. powder stays put all day, came with an extra lighter blonde shade of powder and a second long angle brush.</li>
    <li> Love this. My friend showed me this, I thought how important can this be? HUH I never go out with out it anymore.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing product (all of them are, seriously!) and I love, love this Dark Ash Blonde eyebrow set!! I am a senior who is &amp;#34;embracing the gray&amp;#34; after years of fighting the roots by dyeing them brown and I have very fair skin with a ton of freckles and sun spots from years of tanning until I got smarter.  Now, I find myself reinventing myself to discover the wonders of makeup.  My challenge has been to find soft pigments that brighten, but do not dominate my fairer skin color and blond/silver hair.  I have half brows (the tail is virtually non-existent) that are still a medium brown, and this product softens my natural brow, and lets me draw on the missing tail of my brow to blend beautifully with the rest.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality service, personal touch and helpful advice on which colors might work best for me that Grace My Face Minerals has freely offered.  What a pleasure to use makeup that enhances, and is actually good for me.  So far I have used concealer powder, this product, and some stunning (but muted) eyeshadows and have only good things to say about this company.  I guarantee you will be as delighted as I am with their service and beautiful products.  Buy with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  As of this date, Amazon no longer allows multiple product reviews, so I am unable to leave a specific review any longer for multiple products purchased if they are from the same vendor.  I think this is a horrible disservice to both consumers and the vendors as is the unverified review ratings, but they aren&#x27;t changing back to the previous review method in spite of my multiple protests. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Bomb-diggity Brow Powder!  L@@K!  Replaces Bare Minerals Dark Ash / Medium Brown !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  This &amp;#34;Ashe Blonde&amp;#34; color (seems genuinely Great for actual pale Blondes, btw!), is very pale / light (although initially may seem to darken when applied wet, it dries right back down to a very pale shade).  WAX is the trick !  *** In contrast, Wax (or Oil) completely transforms this Ashe Blonde color, from a lovely Delicate, Pale Blonde Powder, into a gorgeous, rich, deep, dark, Mid-Brown!  (But not TOO dark; And ZERO Orange! Perfectly neutral / natural - l@@king).  Magical Perfection for us Dark Blonde - Light / Med. Brown - haired girlz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st:  This Seller is AMAZING !!!  I initially ordered 2 of these &amp;#34;just to try&amp;#34; (1 for home, 2nd for handbag)- They were Perfecto, so I went back &amp; e-purchased / (stock-piled) a decade&#x27;s supply- Since my choicest cosmetic piks always seem bound for discontinuation, right?  I contacted Seller w/ some very polite, specific packaging requests, (of course I offered to pay any add&#x27;l charges incurred), &amp; to my delighted astonishment, this Seller totally understood &amp; responded to my concerns!  She really went WAY above &amp; beyond the call, to accommodate my personality quirks.  She is just Fabulous !!!  She&#x27;s a rare Seller, &amp; an Asset to the e-marketplace.  If you have occasion to buy from her, by all means, do!  And let her know- In an ocean of etail misrepresentation, just how much her FAB customer service, is appreciated !!!  &amp;#62;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd:  OK, on to this actual product- Brow Powder, in my color choice &amp;#34;Dark Ash Blonde !  My story-  I used to have the fullest, most face-framing eyebrows, &amp; I never gave &amp;#34;Eyebrows&amp;#34; a 2nd thought.  (Who thinx of Eyebrowz?)  A few yrs. ago, well into my 40&#x27;s, I was applying an intense eye, &amp; suddenly noticed that my Brows&#x27; &amp;#34;tails&amp;#34; had disappeared- Oh noooo !!!  Like many women, I don&#x27;t dig the current &amp;#34;Brow Bonanza&amp;#34;, but rather, I NEED a natural, understated Brow extender &amp; filler- And I found it!  Only to have it d/c&#x27;d (when Bare Minerals d/c&#x27;d their magical Ash Blonde / Med. Brown Brow powder, &amp; we girlz went into panic mode!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter &amp;#34;Grace My Face Minerals&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;Ashe Blonde&amp;#34; !!!  Suddenly, no worries :)  Each came stacked in a 3-pc, compact, screw-on / connecting clear acrylic jars- (1) The actual pigmented powder, (2) The &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;, &amp; (3) A Perfect (!) light / bright face powder, for highlighting / accentuating the contrast between brow color against pale skin color, also for correcting under-eye circles, + worx perfectly as a T-zone powder!  I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, &amp; I always buy the absolute fairest powder among all brands... It&#x27;s difficult for me to find powder light enough, but this Seller NAILED the accompanying highlighting powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ash Blonde Brow powder is a highly pigmented / color saturated / neutral / natural tone, (blissfully!) absent any hint of Orangutangue Orange that other Cosmetic brands seem incapable of escaping.  For realz... Who wants ORANGE eyebrowz? Yet, 99.5% of Brow brands&#x27; Powders / Pencils / Creams &#x3D; ORANGE YUK :(  Finally, with the current Brow craze, a very few select brands have achieved a natural, A+ / ASHY Dark Blonde / Med. Brown Brow powder!  Of course, most of those brandz cost ~ $30 (-ish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice- After the right powder shade/ tone, the next single most important component required to achieve a natural Brow, is a very stiff Brow brush!  And, know this: Wax DARKENS the Powder- Possibly from barely there, to TOO dark !  This Ash Blonde Brow powder gradiates from very pale, all the way to very deep, dark, intense brown; Depending upon your own personal ratio of Wax to Powder.  (Tip- Buy any beeswax, or any Carnuba / vegetal-based wax- chapstick to apply your Brow powder !  I use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s- Just read the label to make sure that WAX is the 1st ingredient listed- Otherwise, chapstix contain mineral oil as primary ingredient.  Wax stays put much better than oil.)*  I&#x27;ve learned that more wax w/ less powder &#x3D; a sheerer, lighter wash of color (where I want that, in the inner corners of my Browz)- Vs. less wax w/ More Powder &#x3D; a darker Brow &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34;.  I spend ~ 1-2 min&#x27;s each am filling in my brows- Always applying more intense than needed, finishing w/ the LAST step, of intensively brushing in some transucent face powder, to soften the color &amp; any harsh edges, &amp; set a natural look, that lasts all day (through skiing, swimming, hiking, high humidity, etc.)  Carnuba wax is an all-natural / vegetal wax, that is the hardest wax in nature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*KEY SECRET- Apply a your Waxed Brow Powder a bit heavier than needed (~ 10 - 20% heavier).  Once complete, use a giant face-powder brush to liberally smoosh face-powder all up &amp; deeply into your Wax-Powdered Brows...  This KEY final step that will soften &amp; genuinely &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; your Brows to last all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: Ashe Brow Powder &#x3D; LIGHT (stays light w/ water, after dry); BUT DARKENS dramatically / permanently when mixed w/ Wax or Oil !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow out my eyebrows fully due to a health condition. I&#x27;ve been struggling over the years to find something that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;penciled&amp;#34; and after years of searching this stuff is AMAZING! It looks very natural and boosts my confidence!</li>
    <li> Found it hard to use and goes on too dark.</li>
