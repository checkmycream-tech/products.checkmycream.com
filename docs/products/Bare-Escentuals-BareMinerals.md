      <li>This is a product I have been using for years and love the light weight foundation powder.</li>
      <li>Original SPF 14 Foundation is my favorite makeup.  </li>
      <li>So then I decided I should get the original formula instead, especially after reading a review from a Sephora (or Ulta or something) employee that said the original foundation is best for combo skin.</li>
      <li>It is easy to find a shade for any skin tone.  </li>
      <li>A final great reason I love this foundation is that it has SPF15 in it.  </li>

      <li>I got it first time, because I had a gift card for sephora and decided to try nice powder.</li>
      <li>This powder is wonderful and it never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
      <li>This light makeup is a good solution for me because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it looks nice and natural with the right shade.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Interesting, I love the matte finish, but this stuff makes my face oily and it catches in my pores in a way that makes my pores look large and my face old. I&#x27;ll stick with the matte finish.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and have always had trouble keeping foundation in place. Not so with this product. It has real staying power. With oily skin comes large pores. With bareMinerals, the look of large pores is minimized. At the urging of my dermatologist, I tried Jane Iredale powder foundation. (She just happens to sell it.) I found all things equal except the bareMinerals offered the added benefit of a more luminous look and the price is much more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, the problem I have is that I&#x27;m more of a neutral skin tone but I end up getting the cool toned foundation because the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; is too light and the next neutral shade \\&quot;medium\\&quot; is too dark. So I end up getting \\&quot;fairly medium\\&quot; for cool skintones. It works alright but it&#x27;s disappointing that the brand acts like each shade is the same except for changing it for skin tone-not so!</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend.  She used it for a little while.  Didn&#x27;t end up liking it.  She said that it is a little thin, doesn&#x27;t give proper cover.  So she went back to sheercover and is happy.</li>
    <li> The reason I started ordering Bare Escentuals through Amazon is because it is 20% cheaper and I do not pay shipping.  Living in the south with continuous humidity you certainly need a product that will not make you feel any stickier and this does the job 100%.</li>
    <li> I like how this foundation goes smooth on face and adds a little bit of a glow, but it gives too little coverage for me, and coverage is not very buildable. I prefer Pur minerals foundation for better coverage and buildability.</li>
    <li> *UPDATE* August 11, 2011:  The cakey look I was getting was my fault! A teensy bit goes a LONG way, and it is important to buff, buff, buff! I tried this again about a week ago and it looked flawless, natural, and glowing- it looked great. But unfortunately it still broke me out :( So now I&#x27;m going to just try going the tinted moisturizer route I guess...     However, I am actually somewhat relieved that BM causes me to break out and that I basically have no choice but to stop using it, because I&#x27;ve read some ominous things about BM.     This article discusses Dr.Oz&#x27;s claims of it causing lung scarring, note the comments at the end from the many women that think he may be on to something. The response from Leslie, CEO of BM(it&#x27;s within the article), doesn&#x27;t make me feel any better. If they could prove that BM doesn&#x27;t cause lung problems, I&#x27;d trust them. But them saying that there is currently no proof that lung problems are a possible side effect, makes me raise an eyebrow.:   [...]    I&#x27;ve also read that there is an ingredient that seriously clogs pores, which is why you have to \\&quot;buff, buff, buff\\&quot;. If true, it would explain why BM is known to cause cystic acne, acne, and scarring- like it has done for me and many others.    Review from July 1, 2011:  I first got Bare Minerals in December of 2010, so I have been using it for it at least 7 months, although today was the day I decided to stop. I have combo skin, so first I bought the matte. The Ulta lady told me I should get Medium Beige, so that&#x27;s what I got. When I got home and tried it out I noticed that it looked a little too dark for my skin #1, but #2 it had an orangey look to it. I wore it for a few hours and once my face did start to produce oil, the matte handled it very nicely and the orangey tint seemed to lessen. But still, it was the wrong color, so I went to an Ulta closer to my house and exchanged it for... something else. Okay well to sum it up- I went through a few different matte shades trying to find one that didn&#x27;t make it look like I had tried applying a light bronzer all over my face- but even the fairly light still looked orange!! So then I decided I should get the original formula instead, especially after reading a review from a Sephora (or Ulta or something) employee that said the original foundation is best for combo skin. This took a couple tries, but finally- fairly medium was the perfect match. The Ulta employee this time tried telling me I should get fairly light but it had too much of a yellow tone and made me look washed out.     So now I had my perfect shade. The whole, using it as your under eye concealer thing did NOT work for me. I loved how creamy the foundation was though! And it covered flaws well, and as a spot concealer on my face (not under my eyes) it worked great. But it did break me out. And every single break out I got with it would scar! I never used to scar from blemishes! I&#x27;m not sure why it did this, but it did... I did find that I would break out less if I used a light application of my physicians formula mineral foundation before applying the bare minerals. Another thing I had to do was apply my physicians formula tinted moisturizer or else I&#x27;d be more likely to break out. And yet another thing, I&#x27;d have to put my clean and clear moisturizer which has salicylic acid it it before applying the bare minerals- AND put some mary kay benzoyl cream on the area that the bare minerals would cause the most break outs! It was just too much trouble! To top it off, the mineral veil seemed to make me break out more, the foundation itself seemed to make my pores MORE noticeable, and my face would look like it was wet in photos (I like the dewey look but not like this).     So... as much I wish I had found the perfect foundation when I finally (after many years of longing to) bought Bare Minerals... I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Goes on smoothly and the color is a perfect blend.  Looks natural - no lines. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used bare minerals for years now.  This is a great product.  However I misjudged the color.  It was totally my fault the seller was good.  They shipped it to me on time and everything was great.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals but hate the retail price. this is the perfect solution. i received this within a few days and it is exactly what i ordered!</li>
    <li> This is a full size 8g container. I have been using Philosophy airbrushed canvas makeup, but I still like this better, and it&#x27;s cheaper. The sifter is new to me, but it seems like a nice feature. Fairly medium is pretty much a perfect color for my skin. I have light skin and freckles.</li>
    <li> This is not the real foundation. I have both this and the actual product and there&#x27;s a huge difference in coverage.</li>
    <li> This is not a legit bare minerals product. Powder was diluted.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> Perfect shade; perfect looking skin ... I don&#x27;t wear that much makeup because I don&#x27;t want to go around looking like the Real Housewives of Wherever; it not only gives me the spf protection I need but it also creates this glow on my skin that I can&#x27;t ever seem to get from any other product. I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals user for life!</li>
    <li> The foundation, blush and mineral veil from Bare Escentuals have changed the way I feel about make-up.  I absolutely adore these products and would never go back to over-the-counter drugstore brands.  It always looks so natural and feels wonderful.  As it wears throughout the day, it really stays true and looks natural.  I never have to worry about it settling into creases or getting clumpy-looking.  I often carry the mineral veil with me when i go out, but I very rarely have to re-apply the powder, even though I live in southern Louisiana where it is super humid!      One suggestion I would make for this product- especially if you have dry skin- is to apply your moisturizer, let it rest for a few minutes on your skin, then use a make-up sponge or your fingers to apply the foundation powder to your face.  The Bare Escentuals video recommends using the applicator brush for this purpose, but, since I use a heavier moisturizer than most, the make-up can become unevenly distributed if I use the brush for the foundation step.  Once the foundation is on, then I use a brush for the blush and mineral veil steps with no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals Original SPF 14 Foundation is my favorite makeup.  I like the natural appearance it give my skin.  It is not heavy and does not clog my pores. It is easy to find a shade for any skin tone.  I recommend this product to anyone who is wanting a more natural look for their skin.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals products and the foundation is a must have product that I always keep on hand.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this makeup for over 10 years, it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s light and I never feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> Not quite as smooth as the original, but still works well.  I really like the increased color options, this shade matches much closer than the original light.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation.  It goes on so smooth and light.  I really don&#x27;t like to wear liquid foundation after starting to use this product.  It makes my skin clearer as well.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. I have adult acne and this product does a fantastic job covering any flaws or acne I might have. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Looks great and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great cover for every day use.  If you have crappy skin this wont heal it, but it can cover minimal pimples.  Honestly I have decen skin, and I only use this because I am a pale irish girl.  It DOES make lines and wrinkles appear more and it WILL rub off if you touch it in the slightest or if you have really oily skin.  I had used this before a long time ago and I dont remember this happening.  Either way, I use it for work or for whenever but for nights out I  go with a liquid foundation and use this a a powder finish</li>
    <li> BareMinerals is my favorite! Love this powder. A little goes a long way so this jar lasts so long.</li>
    <li> Used it the first time 6 years ago and have been using it since, hands down... the best coverage.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without my Bare Escentuals Foundation. Love, Love, Love it!! Gives a very soft and natural feel to the skin.</li>
    <li> As a person with very sensitive skin I thought I couldn&#x27;t wear make-up until I found Bare Escentuals.  I wear this absolutely every day and love that they have diversified their shades a bit.  This is a perfect match for my slightly pale and rosey skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have been using for years and love the light weight foundation powder. It always leaves my skin clear and hides any imperfections. You really cannot beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I have used bareMinerals for 10 years now.  When I started using bareMinerals, I had severe acne, and it was the ONLY foundation that offered adequate coverage without feeling cakey or making my face feel heavy and oily.  Now, 10 years later, it continues to offer amazing coverage, and helps disguise some of scars the acne left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more coverage, layer the powder foundation.  For lighter coverage, simply &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; one layer of the foundation onto your skin.  bareMinerals offers great coverage, includes SPF 15 (can&#x27;t go wrong!!), isn&#x27;t drying, all while feeling light-weight.  I HIGHLY recommend this foundation.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Works wonders to cover up my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup. its light but provides perfect coverage for a natural look and glow!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, always ships fast. The original formula doesn&#x27;t seem to suit my skin as well as the matte. I will be going with the matte next buy ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mineral foundation for over five years because it is the best I&#x27;ve tried. I experimented with cheaper mineral products from a drug store, but I didn&#x27;t get the same flawless coverage. The coverage is very natural looking. You can control the amount of coverage you are looking for by simply applying more or less of the product. Again, this stuff is the best, and it continues to receives high ratings in magazines for a reason!</li>
    <li> This is the only mineral product I have tried but am very pleased with how little is needed. I apply jojoba oil and let it absorb before adding the foundation. I have purchased 3 colors, fairly light which I mix with fairly medium which I also mix with medium. I don&#x27;t use any of the colors straight. You can definitely be too heavy handed. A little goes a long way. Nice product. Nice value.</li>
    <li> Love this Foundation, I will never buy anything else..I have dry skin &amp; it covers well and stays on all day</li>
    <li> Only the best! Perfect price too</li>
    <li> Has great coverage! Really love this make-up!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Before  I started using I do remember I never knew quite what my shade was or the product just didn&#x27;t lay right. I would get a different  foundation every time. The thought of trying to navigate a cosmetic  aisle to me now is frankly  terrifying. This powder is wonderful and it never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
    <li> This is perfect, and exactly the same as what I purchased at Sephora a year ago and cheaper than what I remember from buying my last product at Sephora.  I have been using it for a few years and does a wonderful job and looks natural.  It also comes in a cute pink bag :).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and allergic reaction prone sking - especially on my face. This light makeup is a good solution for me because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it looks nice and natural with the right shade. It helps smooth and diminish the appearance of redness and dark circles. I always finish the look by applying the dark shade/bronzer as a blush and sometimes putting the mineral veil on top of the foundation and before the blush for longer lasting wear. I don&#x27;t do this everyday, but whenever I have an outing or special occasion it looks nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for about 5 yrs and wouldnt use anything else.  Buying on Amazon saved me some money so I will definatley buy it again</li>
    <li> My wife is huge fan of Bare Minerals.  I was very glad to find an inexpensive and highly reliable source for the entire product line.</li>
    <li> This foundation I have been using for years. Covers the spots and gives an over-all even look to the skin.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION. JUST WHAT I ORDERED. IT WAS THE SHADE I WANTED AND WAS STILL SEALED WITH A PROTECTIVE CLIP, UNOPENED.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time choosing foundations. I like the feeling of it being light on my face and doesn&#x27;t make me break out . I also love the color choices because I have a hard time finding the right color for my skin. I&#x27;m glad I finally found a foundation that is good to my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bareMinerals foundations since 2008.  It is the lightest (weight) foundation that I&#x27;ve found that still covers fairly well.  I like that depending on the brush that you can change the coverage.  I also like that this foundation doesn&#x27;t seem to seep into my skin (thus not really giving me more break-outs).  I do like that bareMinerals changed the container and now it locks, so that when I put this in my makeup bag all the powder doesn&#x27;t spill out into the lid, because the lid is an integral part of using this makeup (tap out the foundation into the lid, swirl brush and tap off excess back into lid).  A final great reason I love this foundation is that it has SPF15 in it.  I often forget to apply sunscreen and this is just a safety net in protecting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did remove 1 star because this makeup is great, but I wear &amp;#34;Fairly Medium&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried numerous other colors (both lighter and darker and in the other color scheme that seems more yellow) and I cannot find a color that truly matches my skin - the colors are either too yellow or too pink/beige.  The color is not too off so I will continue to wear this because of all the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary of PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight&lt;br /&gt;- Great coverage&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make me break-out&lt;br /&gt;- Click Lock&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Color isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
    <li> I would hate for people to be turned off by the actual product, because it works very well.  Since this is not the product it claims to be, it doesn&#x27;t cover or work as the actual product does.  I thought I was saving, better to buy the real thing guys, sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can match my skin tone and get the coverage I look for from my makeup.  I&#x27;ve been a bareMinerals customer for many years and I do not see myself changing any time soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for years, good product, great price. If your use to this product not much more I can say about it, if you&#x27;re new to BM I suggest going to Macy&#x27;s and having one of their &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; gals explain the process.</li>
    <li> Air like this product. I got it first time, because I had a gift card for sephora and decided to try nice powder. I use it with primer under and it makes it lay better</li>
    <li> Bought this once and got the original bareMinerals product, but when I repurchased I got what obviously looked as a counterfeit product - it seemed more like a shimmering powder rather than a mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> I really do love bareMinerals products, and this item arrived extremely quickly! It was here almost 5 days before I expected it! I would recommend this seller! The only reason I don&#x27;t give the item five stars is the click, lock and go sifter. It gets in the way, and I go through the product way faster since they&#x27;ve put it in. I prefer the old container.</li>
    <li> First powder foundation that I came across with excellent coverage without the hassle. I have very obvious hyper pigmentation marks and this stuff covers it very well.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s always a go to foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone that needs minimum coverage.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation. I have sensitive skin and I am very acne prone but this foundation helps keep my breakouts away by wearing it. I never use to wear makeup because of hour I break out but this really helps. I haven&#x27;t tried much else of bare minerals but I am slowing trying new things. This color is perfect for my winter complextion. its very light but it makes me feel like I am not a ghost!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation. It covers well and does not leave lines like most foundations. It makes my skin look smooth.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting, I used it every day for full coverage over liquid makeup since August and just ran out mid-December. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals, as they are one of 2 companies that I can safely use with out breaking out.  I have very sensitive skin, and this product is AWESOME at &amp;#34;playing nice&amp;#34; with it :-)</li>
    <li> If you have golden/yellow undertones this is perfect for you. I&#x27;d suggest making sure you try it on in the store more than once to insure you get the right color.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage of this product, however after a few hours my skin is shiny. I have to blot and reapply 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> NOT Bare Minerals !! I have been using this product for years and this is the first time I bought it off of Amazon.. It is not the same.. It has an odd smell and provides zero coverage!! Only buy at real Bare Minerals dealers..like sephora or department stores! Do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I have used BE makeup for over 20 years. LOVE IT!!  No problems with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, however, this is nothing like the product that I usually buy at the Bare Essentuals Store. It was powdery with no coverage and tons of sparkles. Maybe it is an old version of the product or fake? Will only be purchasing in store from now on.</li>
