<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does tame frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Great!  Love the smell and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> my hair feels nice after I used it</li>
    <li> It helps to bring out the curls and keeps the frizz down.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve only used this a few days but have seen the world of difference! My hair tends to be frizzy and a wild mix of curly and wavy. This product has left my curls tamed and my hair frizz free- but not oily like other products have left my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky. I love the scent, it leaves my hair smelling good, but isn&#x27;t an overwhelming scent. I was lucky enough to get this product at a promotional price. I also must compliment customer service. My first package arrived damaged (due to what I believe was our mail person not handling with care) and I contacted the company who immediately responded, and then called amazon and had the product to me within a day. Not many companies would go out of their way like that, and I was very impressed!</li>
    <li> not that great. most of the oil stays on my fingers. I am now mixing a bit of it with my usual after-shampoo product which is Fekkai glossing cream. Probably won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, medium length hair and this weighs it down.  I only use a small amount but it is still too heavy.  Smells Great and feels great but no volume.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! My hair is so soft, silky, shinny, and smells great! Definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> WOW!! Is all I can say!! Just WOW!! My hair is very damaged from years of coloring and styling, so I&#x27;ve tried everything in the book to try and restore it&#x27;s former healthy looking self. Nothing, for me, has come as close as this has! I put it on after showering, when my hair is still damp, and I&#x27;ve seen a world of difference! My hair is silky smooth now. The frizz that once haunted me has pretty much gone away completely!! And the fragrance... Ohhhh my goodness the frangrance!! This stuff smells amazing!! Even my 3 year old begs me to put this in her hair because she loves it so much. She says she&#x27;s fabulous when I put it in! :) This comes in an easy to pump bottle, and with my waist length hair, it only takes a couple of pumps to get the job done. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. That fact in no way swayed my opinion of this product. This is top notch!!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is overwhelmingly strong and gave me headaches. This hair oil also activated my allergic contact dermatitis.  If you have eczema and a history of skin allergies (particularly if you are sensitive to fragrance), I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
    <li> I do not know how I lived without this product. To say I love it is a complete understatement. It leaves my hair so soft and incredibly manageable without it looking greasy the next day.  I have been on the quest for the perfect hair product. I have thick brown hair that frizzes rift after a blow out and I can never get it to look and feel just right. When I was offered a coupon for a review on this product I figured why not. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Pantene to Bumble and Bumble. Nothing has worked. Except this.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I use it every day. Wet hair, dry hair, crazy hair. This is my go to product.  Try it- you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This little bottle of heaven will also make your hair feel and smell like heaven. I am a sucker for this smell. Must be the macadamia in it. Whatever it is makes you want to just grab your hair and give it a hug and a sniff. I use just a couple drops and the effect is amazing. Smooths and make it nice and shiny. A big reason I wanted to try THIS OIL and not another is that it is one of the only that combines the macadamia with the argan oil. I have a few different brands of just argan oil and wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan over a long period. This hasn&#x27;t done me that way. There is a difference. I was able to get a coupon discount and just had to review it. SMELLS SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> The smell in this is nice and subtle.  It immediately calmed down some frizzies I had from the humidty.  Its not greasy looking though in your hair.  I am looking forward to continuing to use this in my dry, naturally curly hair.  I will be buying more of this when its gone myself and my daughter.  I did use a coupon on this order.</li>
    <li> This products not only smells good but it works amazing it leaves my hair so soft. And it leave my hair looking healthy not greasy like other products !!!! Love it !</li>
    <li> i use it for me and my little girl we both have curly hair and it works really good and tames frizz highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells wonderful and turns my sometimes frizzy waves into ringlets. It is not too heavy. I like it better than Beautiful Curls curl oil.</li>
    <li> Love!  I have very thick and coarse hair that is always frizzy and have used every product imagninable to tame it.  This works great and makes my hair feel silky smooth in the process.</li>
    <li> I was reading good review on Moroccan Argan Oil. 10 Stars all the way! I LOVE IT ♡</li>
    <li> LOVE this, I use many different oils on my hair to soften and give it shine, This one does not make my hair feel overly oily and use can use less than the store bought brands, like CHI.  It keeps my hair from being frizz and looking dull.  I am super impressed on how little I have to use.  The bottle easily will last me over 3 months and I used it almost daily.. I live a  very humid are of the US.  I can use it on my hair curly or even straighten it and it looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any products in my hair on a daily basis but I do swim in our pool 5 days a week.  I have health hair but was looking for more body and shine when I purchased this on promotion.  Not only is the smell amazing but the oil has really helped my hair.  It is so easy to apply I am not trying to put oil in my hands and hope it makes it to my hair...I just spray it directly on and massage it in.  I have more shine and body now.</li>
    <li> I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of hair oils, so I was excited to try this. Proargan does have a different consistency than I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s almost a gel. Wait. You will have to completely pardon this comparison, but it&#x27;s the consistency of, um, lubricant of the personal variety. Yes! Sorry. It&#x27;s true. Once it goes on your hair though, it sinks in and makes it gleam. I truly adore this product for another reason too - the smell! WoW! It&#x27;s a strong, very perfumey, romantic, sophisticated scent. It actually reminds me a little of Chanel Mademoiselle. The intensity fades when it dries into your hair into a nice, mellow hint that you are amazing.  I was lucky to be able to try this during a promotion, but I&#x27;ll be buying it again. The gloss lasts for days and when I couple it with a dry shampoo for my roots, I&#x27;m fabulous for about three whole days. Then I turn back into Ursula and jump into the sea.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and this is THE most amazing hair product I have ever used. My hair is gorgeous, soft, and has shine. I wish I would have known about this YEARS ago!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. Detangles really well, makes my hair soft, shiny, and tones down the frizz.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any extreme results but I like this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I use this product when I wear a ponytail because it makes all of my fly aways lay down. I don&#x27;t use it when I wear my hair down because it is a little too heavy for that.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite oil!! for my hair!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, which becomes particularly hard to style once the weather gets warmer and humid. Which is why I was so excited to use a promotional code to purchase this product! I have really been looking for something that won&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but that also won&#x27;t leave it feeling or looking greasy. This ProArgan oil is the product I was looking for! It does have a nice, light scent which is slightly floral (at least to me). Another oil I had been using smelled kind of musty or earthy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan of that. I like being able to use a few little drops of this oil on my hair before going out and knowing that my fly-aways will be tamed. My hair also feels noticeably softer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I would highly recommend ProArgan oil!</li>
    <li> Even as a guy I do try and take great care of my hair. I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil in the past and loved it and after seeing this at a promotional discount I decided to jump on it. I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. It adds just the right amount of natural oils to your hair without it feeling overly greasy. Would recommend a thousands times over.</li>
    <li> HANDS DOWN, the Moroccan Argan Oil and Australian Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment is my new favorite hair product.  My entire life, I have not been a huge lover of hair products.  In fact, after serving in the military for ten years, I was accustomed to throwing my long hair into a bun, and spritzing it up with a bit of hairspray.  That was my routine.  Now, my husband and I both enjoy applying the Moroccan Argan Oil and Australian Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment to our freshly washed, or dry hair.  In the mornings I apply a small amount to my freshly brushed and slept on hair to remove any frizz.  In the evening, I apply the Moroccan Argan Oil and Australian Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment to my freshly damp hair.  The scent is wonderful, and it makes my hair feel hydrated, soft, and the frizz is gone.  I was so excited to order the Moroccan Argan Oil and Australian Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment as part of a promotional offer, but I would buy this product over and over again.  The bottle is large, and will last for a while (if I stop giving it out to family and friends when they come over.) &#x3D;)  After going swimming this weekend, my hair did not feel brittle and dry as it normally does.  This is an awesome product, and it is well worth the money.  Love, love, LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s wife here- I&#x27;ve used lots of products, oils, serums, in my life for my dry, curly hair. This one doesn&#x27;t make the cut. Too greasy and didn&#x27;t really hydrate or add shine. I&#x27;ll go back to the other major brand or what my spalon uses.</li>
    <li> Well I am normally very sceptical on hair products as I have very fine hair. But with both Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil I decided to give it a go. Now after trying ProArgan I decided I just had to share my thoughts. After applying a small amount to my hair and styling as usual I was amazed at how soft and shiny my hair felt. No fly away hair which was fantastic as I style my hair daily. It has such a light, beautiful fragrance that is not overbearing at all. The bottle is gorgeous and now looks great in my bathroom. I am using this product on my hair each day and am loving the condition of my hair after only using this product for the last week. I would highly recommend this product to others who have fine hair like myself. I have previously tried hair styling products with Argan Oil but they all leave my hair feeling limp and oily. I am extremely happy with my purchase and truly amazed at the results...</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair oils over the years, but this is by far the best one I have come across. It is really light so doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy like the others ive tried on the market. I can use it in between washes if I need to, not that it&#x27;s really needed as it does such a fantastic job after just one application! It definitely reduces the amount of time spent blowdrying and It smells great!! It truely is a brilliant product.</li>
    <li> This oil made my hair shinier and more healthy-looking. However, it did not help breakage or split ends. it only improved the look. I suppose, if I used much more of it and covered my hair with it every day, it could have therapeutic effect, but I can&#x27;t walk around with greasy hair.  Also, it leaked into the box while it was shipped, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use most of it.</li>
    <li> I already use Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil for different things but to find them combined in a hair treatment caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the scent but it is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little goes a long way in treating your hair. You will notice right away that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and it tames the fly away and frizzies. I can&#x27;t wait to see the longer term effects of using this product. So far, I think I am going to be a huge fan! Just a few applications and I can see a difference in the shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair which always has &#x27;fly away&#x27; bits. This product has helped control the &#x27;fly aways&#x27; and my hair is so soft and shiny! It is amazing how many people have commented on how healthy my hair looks. My 10 year old daughter has fallen in love with ProArgon too. Her frizzy hair is so smooth when she uses it. It smells divine as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone - which I have been doing!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth silky and quite amazing!  This product is very large and you do not need a lot to get the trick done.  I was given the opportunity to try this through a promotion and I am so glad I ordered!  The smell is very pleasant that does not linger every time you wave your hair around.  I have gotten some great compliments on my hair since using this.  I do not have to worry about my fly-aways and any frizz after a day of no shampoo.  This is a wonderful product that I would highly recommend to anyone who needs to moisturize their hair while adding sheen, and softness.  Argan Oil is amazing for you in so many ways, so having a product that you can apply to your hair, makes it even better!  A great treatment that does not weigh my hair down and one that I can use daily!</li>
    <li> It’s hard to find good hair products! I have tried many Moroccan (Argan) oils before and have been left with an oily mess. I only tried this product because I was offered it as a promotional deal and boy am I glad. My routine is to let my hair dry naturally which leaves it a little frizzy and coarse. I have used silicon oils that leave my hair looking very nice.  After my hair dries, I place some silicon oil on the ends and then roll my hair in hot rollers. It comes out smooth and healthy looking but I always am looking for something natural like this ProArgan product. I applied the ProArgan to my hair and styled it as usual. I was very happy that this combination of Argan oil and Macadamia nut oil left my hair unusually soft, shiny, and silky without any frizz. Even the next day my hair looked and felt healthy. I have been using this product for two weeks now and the coarseness and frizziness of my hair has visibly reduced. I am extremely happy with this product and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Moroccan oil products. I have very difficult, frizzy, thick hair and it&#x27;s almost impossible to control, especially in humidity. Moroccan oil seems to be the only thing that helps with those issues for me. This particular one is not as heavy as others I&#x27;ve used. A little goes a long way! This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or weighted down. It smells really good too! Since I&#x27;m an avid buyer of Moroccan oil I was so excited to try this and write a review of my experience and was excited to receive this as a promotional item.</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is amazing. Hair that was once hay-like is now soft and easy to look after. Loving it.</li>
    <li> I feel like this actually dried my hair out</li>
    <li> I have quite short blonde coloured hair and the proargan hair treatment has left my hair feeling much softer and healthier even in the short time I have been using it. I love the fragrance as it is not over powering, I thoroughly recommend this product for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I have purchased this product at a promotional discount in exchange for posting my honest review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a very light nutty-sweet fragrance, smells good to me. Does the good job at what it claims to do. It hydrates and straightens hair. Leaves hair feeling silky smooth, enhances natural shine, tames frizz. It protects from harmful UV rays and from styling heat which is great. It did not work well for me because my hair is naturally oily and this product lasted 1 day for me with beautiful results. The second day my hair was already oily and not good looking. I would recommend this product to people with normal or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use much product in my hair as it&#x27;s so fine. Occasionally I use Argan oil in my hair for dryness, but just a drop too much and my hair looks greasy, so I was a bit apprehensive to try this product. So happy I did! It made my dry hair super soft and shiny without weighing it down! It makes my hair smell great as well! Definitely will be order this agin.</li>
    <li> My Hair: Very fine, thinner, and overall kinda fried from tons of bleach! My hair is about shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product: I have only used it about 4 times now, but man am I impressed! I only use ONE pump, because i know how too much of anything can make your hair oily. I use it on my hair wet when I get out of the shower. As a cosmetologist, I know the important things to look out for when buying products, especially products outside of a salon. Here&#x27;s the scoop on this stuff, it does not have linseed oil, alcohol, sulfates, parabens, artificial coloring, and is not tested on animals. It passes my test for sure : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: o my, this stuff smells AMAZING!! In my opinion, it smells just like Victor and Rolf Flower-bomb perfume, and if you have ever smelt it, you know its amazing! I cant stop sniffing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you see the money back guarantee? This company backs their products, which I personally love! I doubt anyone would need to use this guarantee because the product is pretty awesome. I received this product for a discount, in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed by this product! It&#x27;s really good. It&#x27;s not oily and has a nice scent. I&#x27;ve seen the difference in my hair. I&#x27;m almost out and I&#x27;m about to purchase another.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair that tends to be on the dry side (especially in the winter) and my two daughters both have very long hair. One is an elite junior swimmer who is in a chlorinated pool 20+ hours a week and the other is a jr open tennis player. It is safe to say that all three of us have environmental challenges in keeping our hair soft, smooth and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProArgan has really made a difference. Not inexpensive but very effective. We LOVE it and it is packaged beautifully as well! Only problem is one bottle to share among 3 girls is a problem :)</li>
    <li> I got it last Saturday 3/21/15 so I have only had for a week but so far I am really impressed with it..love the smell of it..,i can see a difference already a lil bit&amp; he makes my blonde hair very shiny. I really like it so far..I am glad I made the decision to  uh that instead of the argon oil iwas using thank you</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Argan Oil &amp; Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment by ProArgan is definitely a product that actually works for me, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;amazing. I have dry, fine blonde hair and have had alot of trouble in the past trying to find the right product that suits my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This hair product leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and shiny, my ends don&#x27;t look dry and frizzy and it does not weigh my hair down. I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After trying Proargan I definitely was amazed how it made my hair feel so soft, shiny &amp; look so much healthier. Proargan has a beautiful fragrance and makes styling so much easier. I highly  recommend this product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was extremely displeased with this product. It arrived with the box smashed and opened it to find a leaky bottle, but still fully sealed. I decided to chalk it up to poor packaging and tried to wash off the bottle, only to have it not come off the bottle, my hands, all over the sink. After throroughly scrubbing everything clean that this product came in contact with, I decided against using it and it went directly in the trash.</li>
    <li> For all the damage I&#x27;ve put my hair through, I really don&#x27;t do as much as I should to keep my hair healthy. This year, with all the cold weather coming in now, my hair has started to look and feel extra dry and frizzy. I was pointed to try the ProArgan oil by a family member.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it out, I had an office party to go to and not only could I feel a big difference, but a lot of my coworkers pointed out that my hair looked lighter and fluffier and started asking what I did differently. I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this hair treatment and am definitely stuck on it for future damage control to my hair.</li>
    <li> Not magical product but i like it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I saw this offered at a promotion price and snatched it up. I have super long, curly hair as do my three girls &amp; we are spending lots of time in the water this summer &amp; it is really drying out our hair. Once receiving this product I began using it on all of our hair, especially my little ones whose hair seems to be suffering the most from our summer activities. I LOVE it! It has a great smell, applies well, does not leave a residue, makes the hair immediately look shinier &amp; healthier. The bottle/dispenser is great &amp; dispenses a great amount. I will definitely purchase again &amp; recommend to anyone. I seriously cannot say enough good about this product!!</li>
    <li> Definitely took the frizz away and made my hair soft and silky looking after 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended product :-)</li>
    <li> Here I was just going to try another hair product as I have done many times before, but none before have made my hair feel just like I&#x27;ve walked out of a hair salon. My hair is very dull, dry and fizzy and when straightened it becomes oily after only one day which means its been very hard to find a product that will help me manage and control all these issues, but here it is! I love this product! It looks bright, has a beautiful light fragrance and makes my hair look, feel and smell like it never has before, soft, shiny,silky and no fly always, which will now last me days before i have to re style.  Amazing!!! I have made a special place in my draw for ProArgan And I will defiantly keep purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and shine</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil for about a week now and really like it.  It works really well with a flat iron.  I have a natural curl to my hair and when I let it air dry, the ProArgon makes the curls look shiny and not frizzy at all even in the high humidity of NC in the summer.</li>
    <li> Tames the frizzies and gives good shine.</li>
    <li> Wow! Let me just say, I LOVE this product. I&#x27;m very selective what I use and/or put in my hair. I&#x27;m not one to try the latest fad or mess with a huge variety of products. This one is absolutely remarkable. I read some of the reviews, and frankly, I do not know why a couple complained about an overbearing scent. In my opinion, it&#x27;s PERFECT. Smells lovely, and the oil feels rich yet light. I&#x27;ve had zero problems with oily issues using it and I will say it truly makes your hair super soft. And ladies...let me suggest using a bit on your legs after showering and shaving! It&#x27;s silky, smooth and hydrating! :)</li>
    <li> Wow what an amazing product. Finally a product that works.  I was a bit sceptical when I was ask to give it a try as I have used lots of products in the past and really doing nothing to improve my hair or making it worse.  I have very thick dry hair and I was just amazed by the outcome.  I  applied it  to damp hair to find that styling was easier and left my hair feeling smooth, hydrated, tamed and more healthier looking.  Definitely does not leave my hair oily or weighed down like the others have done in the past.  My hair actually looks and feels healthier.  I highly recommend ProArgan and will continue to buy it.

    <li> Great product. My hair is very straight, but can look a bit frizzy . I have tried lots of different products without much success. I find a little bit of this oil rubbed into wet hair makes my hair smooth and shiny. It becomes a lot more manageable and looks better for longer. A little bit goes a long way, it must be used sparingly, making it great value for money.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Really does make your hair soft. I use it immediately after towel drying. Comb through. Let it soak in a few minutes ...then I apply my styling products (in my case, curling products). I follow up with a bit more on the ends. I have dry hair to begin with but my hair never looks greasy using this product. Highly recommend. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This oil is incredible.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.  My hair has never responded so well to any other kind of hair treatment.  When I wake up in the morning, there&#x27;s this glorious, healthy shine to my hair.  My hair tends to be dry, especially in humid weather.  Moroccan Argan/Macadamia Oil takes care of that.  I have only used this oil a short while and can see amazing results.  I was a little worried spending so much money on a product I had never tried before, but now know the extra expense was worth it.  I&#x27;m so grateful to ProArgan for coming up with this lovely product.  Many thanks.</li>
    <li> Excellent product makes hair softer and shiny but not weighted down.</li>
    <li> Great product to tame my Florida frizz!&lt;br /&gt;Lovely fragrance also !</li>
    <li> I have been searching a long time for a hair treatment that knew what I needed...lol...but seriously, I wanted to find an oil that balanced, nourished and calmed...and wasn&#x27;t too heavy, smelled good.  I know, a tall order!  However, I feel I finally found the help I needed.  Moroccan Argan Oil not only knows what my hair needs but appeals to my senses.  The creator of the oil is dedicated and personable.  ProArgan was/is my FINALLY! ;)  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> This is what is important to me when purchasing a good hair oil (though sometimes I have to lower my standards due to cost) -- all natural &amp; organic ingredients, ample quantity of product for the price, and most importantly, that it performs -- protection from the elements &amp; heat, smoothing, hydrating without feeling or looking greasy, and adds silkiness and shine.  This product delivers on all counts!!  It made my hair look and feel like I just came out of the salon!  I was beyond pleased!!!  I had never used Macadamia nut oil before and turns out it is incredibly good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an oil on my hair EVERY day, sometimes twice a day so I can honestly say, I know my hair oils.  I have thick, slightly curly, Caucasian hair (the kind that when I get it cut I tell my hairdresser that when she thinks she has thinned it enough, to do it again) that is dry on account of coloring and using a hot flat iron, both a little too frequently.  So I really need a good oil that works.  Other oils I have tried:  Garnier, Josie Maran (from Sephora, super expensive for .5 oz), The Body Shop argan oil, plain coconut oil, and a couple of other that I cannot remember the name of.  While each one had their pluses, not a single one gave me as much as ProArgan did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a BARGAIN too!  The reason why it attracted me to it in the first place.  Let&#x27;s go back to the expensive Josie Maran oil from Sephora.  It cost $12 for 1/2 ounce.  Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and the tiny bottle didn&#x27;t last very long.  This ProArgan oil costs, at the current price, about 8.49 for a full ounce.  So a little over $4 per 1/2 ounce (the bottle has over 4 full ounces!) compared to the stingy little 1/2 ounce that the Josie Maran bottle gives you.  ProArgan has much much MUCH better ingredients, worked 10 times better, and is a fraction of the price!!  A no-brainer in my book.  Thought I would throw that out there in case anyone has the audacity to think this is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried ProArgan on wet hair and let it naturally dry.  Gave me silky and shiny waves.  Was impressed.  I usually have to iron the heck of it.  Then today, after using the oil and flat iron, had lunch outdoors, in the FOG!  A fine mist of little hairdo-wrecking droplets.  My hair held up!  Poofed up ever so slightly but survived having an outdoor lunch in the fog without getting frizzy.  I&#x27;m hecka impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is so decadent that I use the leftover on my palm and rub it on  my neck and decolletage.  Makes my skin super soft and not greasy after it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged very well.  The bottle is very nice with a pump that gives you just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:  This is a wonderful hair oil for everything you need!  I think it would work great on fine hair too due to the fact it does not weigh down or make your hair greasy.  It is as good, or in my opinion BETTER, than other high-end, expensive oils.  VERY generous amount for the price, with super high quality ingredients.  I will most definitely be a repeat customer.  I have finally found THE hair treatment oil of my dreams.  THANK YOU ProArgan!!and let it naturally dry.  Gave me silky and shiny waves.  Was impressed.  I usually have to iron the heck of it.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product now for about two weeks.  I apply it to my wet hair after shampooing.  It seems to make my hair stronger but not oily.  I have very long blond hair and it makes it far easier to comb out. It also makes my hair soft, full and shiny. I&#x27;m really glad I found this product and have purchased extra bottles to give to friends.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give it some time before I reviewed the product. I have to say I am impressed from start to finish. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Also there is no super dry bounce back that you get after using some products. I can use it on wet hair or dry of shine and fly away control. I have 2b hair for anyone that knows curly hair and it defines my curls but makes it easier to blow dry straight when I want. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length dull fine hair but... WOW not now! First time I used ProArgan I got compliments on my hair! I was so overwhelmed with the results with ProArgan! I had tried &amp;#34;other oil products&amp;#34; for shine, curbing flyaways (which drives me crazy) and as a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; treatment BUT they have been either too heavy greasy and highly fragranced (I have a sensitive scalp) but hey FINALLY someone has got it right!&lt;br /&gt;I have trained in the beauty industry and am ALWAYS on the lookout for new quality hair and beauty products and am so happy I have discovered this product ! I highly recommend this product for fine flyaway and DULL hair. A little bit on the fingertips (and I mean  &amp;#34;A little&amp;#34; what great value AND high quality) goes a long long way and it gave MY HAIR &amp;#34; OMG!&amp;#34; gorgeous shine. Im blonde and my hair looks like SPUN GOLD when I use this product. I&#x27;m serious move over Rapunzel! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;We all know when it comes to shine the trick is not to use too much ( I use a quarter of a garden pea size drop ) it gives me incredible shine NO GREASE and its nourishing my hair at the same time -I just apply it style it and get on with my day!&lt;br /&gt;Bonus is it also STOPS my fine hair from frizz and fly aways! Best thing is this product is versatile! I love to use it on my hair when its damp at the roots and tips for curls and let it dry naturally. It stops frizz and makes my hair feel lush moisturised and nourished. I also use it under the dryer it actually feels like my hair is protected from the heat AND dries quicker!!! Like most &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products you have to be careful how much you use ...however I really just cant get enough of this high quality product. My favorite thing is to wash my hair apply the oil leave it in overnight and wake up to hair that feels healthy and alive! All I can say is OMG!  What a  wonderful high quality oil product that does what it claims- has NO offputting fragrance and is versatile! Im happy thankyou!</li>
    <li> My hair is slightly wavy-straight but very thick, so I have a lot of frizzies and flyaways. I use to use coconut oil on occasion, but as little as I used I would always end up looking greasy. When I first tried this product, I had a hard time with the smell. Thankfully the smell dissipated pretty quick. It&#x27;s like a very strong vanilla musky scent at first but after a while you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. It also felt very greasy to the touch, but my hair quickly absorbed it. I only use one pump for my long hair, and can probably use a bit more. I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy but it looks shiny and healthy. My frizz is tamed. I would definitely continue using. Since a little goes s long way, I see this product lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago and just got a chance to use it today. LOVE it! I&#x27;m a huge, huge fan of Argan oil and this stuff is golden. I&#x27;ve never used an argan/macadamia combination, but I have to say I love it. My hair is naturally crazy and frizzy, and this tames the beast. :) Makes my hair feel so silky. Very rarely do I find a product that can replicate that just-out-of-the-salon feeling, but this absolutely does. Highly recommend! And smells yummy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was looking for a light oil hair treatment with natural/ organic ingredients for a long time. I have long thin hair with dry ends and oily scalp tendency and typical oils I used are either too heavy that diminish the hair volume or make my head look greasy. I also have a bad habit of going to bed with my hair not completely dry because I try to avoid using dry blower that damages my hair, and if I do that the oils that I apply to the ends get all over my head and make the roots oily too. ProArgan oil nourishes the ends, but it is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t add any heaviness to  my thin hair and no greasy scalp either!  I am pretty happy with the product and have been using it for a few months now about every other day applying it on damp hair.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a lightweight, almost serum, type of oil.  It&#x27;s not super greasy and it&#x27;s not impossible to wash off of your hands after you put it in your hair, like some other oils I&#x27;ve tried.  It does seem to make my hair shiny and a bit stronger, which is awesome!  Since I wash my long hair every other day, I love that I can use it on both wet and dry hair, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue, which would require me to wash every day.    My only negative about this product is the smell.  By the end of the day, I&#x27;m almost able to enjoy the smell of my hair because the overwhelming odor of the product has worn off by then.  But until that point, I&#x27;m miserable! I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells, especially floral scents, and this one is just WAY too strong at the beginning.  It&#x27;s given me a massive headache every time I&#x27;ve used it so I won&#x27;t be buying it again, and honestly, won&#x27;t even be finishing this bottle. It&#x27;s a shame too because I love that it&#x27;s free of alcohol, parabens, sulfates and animal-testing!  If they ever come out with a fragrance-free version, I&#x27;m there!</li>
    <li> Great hair care product.</li>
    <li> I saw this was offered as part of a promotion and I was so excited to get a coupon, I couldn&#x27;t wait to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and frizzy hair, which isn&#x27;t a great combination. When I saw a coupon for this, I was anxious to try it. I put one pumpful in my hair before blow drying, then another pumpful in the ends before styling. It has definitely controlled the frizz and made my ends a lot less dry. I will try almost any hair product to help get my hair under control, and this is definitely one I&#x27;m very happy with. If you are looking for an oil for your hair, this is a really great option!</li>
    <li> Mt youngest daughter was the worst when it came to caring for her hair. Just brushing it led to constant tears and frustration for us both. And more times than not she left the house looking as if she didn&#x27;t brush her hair at all. So when I received a cupon for this product for a review I didn&#x27;t hesitate.  She&#x27;s been using it for a week now and my daughter said I had to give this product five stars.  The first things I noticed about the oil are the smell of the oil. It is pleasant not strong or over whelming like other oils we have tried in the past (and we tried many). The other is that the oil doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all. It&#x27;s a nice light consistency which is something I look for in oils. Nothing worse than your hair looking like you pit a jar of crisco in it.  My daughter puts it in both her damp and dry hair. It is now so easy to brush and feels so soft. It doesn&#x27;t look like any oil is in her hair and there is no strong scent to deal with. It also doesn&#x27;t give a build up which she would have to wash her hair after using it twice like other oils either.  Overall we both love this product and are very thankful I can ger a brush through her hair with no more fuss.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy! And the best part is customer service, they really care about their customers satisfaction!</li>
    <li> Great product! Although I don&#x27;t see a difference in the health of my hair yet, it does help me to get through combing it and it is very lightweight.  I even use it in my baby&#x27;s hair, who has fine hair just like myself :-) It smells wonderful, and you don&#x27;t have to use much. It goes a long way! I think this one little bottle will last me over a year!</li>
    <li> I have not had my hair kept this moist, and supple until I use this product, only for two days.  It smells very light and delightfully, as well as keeping my dry hair the best ever, since I start coloring my hair.  Many thanks for such as great product.  Little Runner</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair treatment for about a week now .. I use it in my hair while it&#x27;s dry because my hair is very long (length about mid-abdomen) and I straighten it almost daily so it gets very, very dry.. I use your oil in hopes to keep it healthy and protected and I find it&#x27;s not so saturated and &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; that I am restricted to just using it while my hair is wet. I especially work it into the dry tips which tend to split. So far I really like it.. Besides the moisture it adds back to my hair, the other thing I love is the scent .. Amazing! I get migraines with perfumes but this hair treatment does not trigger my migraines and emits such a lovely feminine scent .. Two things solved with one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a future buyer of this product, thanks!</li>
    <li> I blow dry and flat iron my hair every day and it shows. This oil left my hair so soft and shiny, used it on damp hair before blowdrying and a little more before using the flat iron. Got compliments on how healthy my hair looked all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it leaves my hair soft and it smell great. I recommend buying this product, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love my long hair. I don&#x27;t necessarily love the weird kink that is in my hair. Or the way my hair feels after washing it everyday because of my job. I can contest that over the course of the last five years alone I have spent a few thousand dollars on products and treatments for my hair. I detest going to a salon because I feel that it never lasts.&lt;br /&gt;This product has changed my perspective on hair oil. It does wonders to my hair. It makes it manageable,  soft and makes my hair ends seem less damaged after use. For the price it is a very large bottle.  And now that I use it daily I am using my blow dryer and straightener more and more less frequently. I have fewer fly aways and less mess, and I live in one of the most humid states.&lt;br /&gt;Hello good hair day, every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different argan oil hair products, but they all left my hair feeling greasy and limp. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, hoping that with the macadamia oil and no linseed oil it might make a difference.  I am so glad I did, I am totally in love with this product!  Not only does it smell wonderful, my hair looks and feels amazing - so soft, smooth and easy to style.  I also love the fact that there is no artifical colors in the product, I my hair is blonde and I have used oils in the past that have turned my hair slightly yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting healthier hair.  Thank you Proargan....I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair oil!!! I have tried everything on my dry, coarse hair and it either doesn&#x27;t condition ENOUGH or leaves my hair greasy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this! I put it on my towel dried hair (you don&#x27;t need too much, but there is no such thing as too much... Won&#x27;t leave hair with any icky residue!) and it took my lifeless, dull and seriously dry hair to silky smooth and fully conditioned. I didn&#x27;t even believe the 5 stars on Amazon buy figured I&#x27;d give it a try... I am THRILLED I did!!! Seriously happy customer (and the scent is sooooo delicious too!!)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the Moroccan Argan Oil and Australian Macadamia Oil Hair Treatment.  Not only does it smell wonderful, but it leaves my hair soft and non oily.  I will definitely be buying this again and highly recommend to others.  Update to my review: I have now been using this product for almost 3 months. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny; I use it everyday. So glad I started using this. Initially, I was concerned that the oil would weigh my hair down or eventually build up, but it hasn&#x27;t at all. It&#x27;s a great product. Still highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using it, but it it way too expensive for what it does, not much!!! I use an oil from Herbel essence and it works way better and helps my hair. Will never buy this again</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I felt the moisturizing results after one use.  It leaves my hair shiny and silky.  It does not make my light brown hair look greasy.  I will definitely buy again.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t deal with the smell.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this product leaves my hair. I have used it on wet hair with good results, but I love it best on dry hair. Just a tiny drop rubbed in my palms and through freshly dried hair leaves it shiny, soft and smooth all day long. My hair is very short, and this does not weigh it down or make it feel oily. And I wash my hair everyday, so after a few weeks of daily use, I am beginning to notice my hair has more shine and luster than it did before I started using the ProArgon. A special bonus is that it smells terrific! I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I  was very impressed with the quality of this product and the customer service.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, soon after I ordered this hair treatment, I received a detailed e-mail from the company explaining how to use this product and what to expect from it. It was very helpful and handy.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I received it very fast which was very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I applied it right away and was amazed with the results. After just a few days of using it I saw a significant improvement in my hair already.  I have super fine fair hair which I color every month and split ends are always a problem. With this great product this problem seems to start to solve: I rub the treatment into the ends strand by strand every day after washing it and I am very happy with what I see. The ends look nourished and revived. (Iron curler can take a break). I used it as recommended applying onto towel-dried or dry hair and it worked both ways: after 7-8 days my hair got back its luster and shine. The texture of the treatment is serum-like and it does not weigh my fine hair down at all. The fragrance is very nice too;  my husband who is usually very sensitive to scents, commented on how nicely my hair smells.  I am very glad that I have got such a wonderful product and excellent and personalized customer service. I will be definitely buying this product again and soon.</li>
    <li> I have fine, dry, curly hair, and have been using ProArgan for the past few weeks and it has definately helped to control the frizziness! I especially like the fresh fragrance of the product, its light and easy to apply - my hair looks and feels healthier. I love using ProArgan everyday and would highly recommend this product! Thankyou!</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this I rarely need my straightener, a quick blow dry and my hair stays great allday</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel very soft and I love the fragrance of it.  I use it as a styling tool and as a leave in.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. I can confirm all the great reviews written on Amazon.  I’m still trying to balance the right amount to use without overdoing it.  I also really like the smell. Overall, I am very pleased, and plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I got this the other day.. Omg I&#x27;m loving this in my hair!!!! No frizzy, and my curly hair is looking healthy and the smell, omg I&#x27;m loving the smell!! Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic product.</li>
    <li> So far I love the ProArgan. It seems to help my ends from becoming damaged from heat styling. I like it so much I gave my Paul Mitchell product to a co-worker.</li>
    <li> I really wish I would&#x27;ve tried this stuff before cutting off 5 inches of my hair. This has helped tremendously with the frizzy and pouffy-ness of my hair! My hair is so soft and smooth now that I&#x27;ve been using this! Bonus that it smells good! I wish I would&#x27;ve looked into what to do for dry frizzy hair instead of chopping it off like some suggested. Luckily I was able to buy this when there wAs a promotion going on. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends and family that have dry frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I love trying different hair products and this one really pulled through for me. It left my hair feeling super soft and i tend to have a ton of fly-away hair pieces that drive me absolutely crazy. This helped tame my hair all over and really give it a nice shine that made it look great. I used a very small amount and got great results which means that this bottle will last which i love! I would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product after receiving a promo code but the review is 100% my own!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened this bottle was the smell - amazing! I can still smell it hours after I put it on. It has left my hair feeling soft and shiny as well - the product feels very high quality for the price. I typically buy MoraccanOil - but when I saw this brand up for a promotional discount I had to try it. I&#x27;m quite happy with it - it&#x27;s also a larger bottle than MoraccanOil, and a little less than half the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! This has done wonders for my hair! I am loving soft and smooth my hair feels and looks after blowdrying when I use this product. My ends tend to get dry living in a desert climate, and this gives me the added moisture they need. I picked this up at the right time during a promotional period, so I decided to give yet another oil a try. Oils tend to often times be too heavy or greasy for my hair, because it is on the fine, or thin side. But this one actually works very well. Of course I use a little less then normal, since I have less hair. It smells wonderful, which is always a selling point for me. If it doesn&#x27;t smell good, I will not be using it! This is a winner!</li>
    <li> As someone who has been using Argan oil for quite some time, I was excited to be able to review this product. In exchange for my review, I did receive this item at a lower price via a coupon my code. What makes this better than just my plain Argan oil is that it also includes Macadamia Nut oil. It smells divine and when I used it on my damp hair before styling and then just a touch after styling, my hair was soft, full, and shiny, without being greasy or flat.</li>
    <li> I use this on both my hair and skin every day.  I like it because it&#x27;s not to heavy and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something I can put on my hair to help smooth it out.  I naturally have curly frizzy hair, so I flat iron it almost everyday.  I needed something that would help nourish my hair without drying it out.  It only take a couple of drops for your entire head of hair.  Even after I finished blow drying it I could tell a difference.  When I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair it would look like a frizzy mess, with this product it was actually not as bad.  When I began to flat iron my hair I didn&#x27;t even need to add additional product that I normally spray on before I flat iron my hair.  I was able to purchase this product during a promotion as was so glad I did.  I would buy this stuff at full price.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see a product up for review. In my unbiased opinion I Love this stuff!! my hair was so soft and silky. I have to wash my hair everyday because I have an oily scalp which over night makes oily hair. I usually use an oil only if my ends are dry. I tried this on damp and dry hair and it works great! never oily, just left my hair shiny and healthy looking. It only takes a small amount so this bottle should last a long time. Not any smell and its in clear color. Love the bottle and the pump. This is a fantastic hair oil that will add shine, softness, and make your hair healthier every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I like this product and used it before but not until this particular brand did I notice the sparkles it put on the high lights in my hair.. I don&#x27;t like this as much.</li>
    <li> I have been a moroccan oil user for 4 years, but the price has doubled. I was searching for a similar product that would be more reasonably priced gave the Proargan oil a try.  This is a great product, very similar to the Moroccan oil, and it is much more reasonably priced. I have very curly hair and this product controls frizz and moisturizes.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have bleached and colored hair. This product makes my hair looks shiny and healthy. Plus it smells good! I&#x27;m glad I trusted those reviews.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but..... being in the desert during the winter, in the sunshine, really takes its toll on my hair. Adding moisturizer is the only solution. The hydrating does not restore my curl but I appreciate the healthy addition. I am confident I will recover quicker when I return to WA having added ProArgan to my hair. The company is excellent. Their customer service is right up there with the BEST I have dealt with via internet purchasing.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I didn&#x27;t think I have ever found a product that didn&#x27;t weigh the hair down, even on my fine limp hair.  I also have started to use it on my daughters thick, easily tangled hair and both our hair has never been in such great soft,  shiny condition.  I just love this stuff and I can&#x27;t recommended this product highly enough to all my family and friends.  It is  definitely a girls best friend. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and definitely lived up to its claims. My hair feels so soft and silky even days after using it, my hair is still shiny and frizz free. I have naturally curly hair and straighten it with the hair dryer. My hair is long and was feeling quite dry and frizzy. I was sceptical, thinking this would just be another type or Argan oil product. It&#x27;s definitely the best oil product I&#x27;ve used on my hair and I have tried different products for years. Makes drying my hair so much easier, love, love love this product and would highly recommend it to everyone!!!!! Xxx</li>
    <li> It works good ,but it has very unpleasant scent for me some people might find it ok but I can&#x27;t stand its smell, I&#x27;m using it on my daughter &#x27;s hair smell doesn&#x27;t bother her</li>
    <li> After years of damage on my hair with hair straightners and such, my hair is quite fine and dry so most hair oils are too heavy and only end up making my hair too oily. But after hearing about this treatment through a friend I thought I would give it a shot.The result was such a huge difference. Unlike most other leave in products, this one doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy at all and has the most beautiful scent. After using ProArgan my hair has transformed from dry and flat to super soft and manageable. If you are looking for a cure for damaged or distressed hair, I give this my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells great and I really could tell after just one use that my hair is smoother and softer! I will continue to buy this in the future</li>
    <li> I love a product that is totally natural, especially when I&#x27;m using it on my children.  My daughter has very fine hair that has a wave through it.  Proargan has helped to tame her fine hair and has brought out the curl as a result.  It is also wonderful with knots, so no more howling at hair brush time.  It is a really lovely product.</li>
    <li> Good for average hair as a leave in product after styling</li>
    <li> Does what its suppose to. I&#x27;m not going to write a huge long post because everything this advertises, it does. :)</li>
    <li> I live in SW Arizona and the dry climate is absolute torture for my thick and curly hair.  I have medium length hair and the bottom few inches of my hair are constantly dry and damaged.  I jumped at the chance to try this during a promotional period!  First off, it smells divine!  Sweet but not overpowering.  I have taken to applying this directly after my shower and my hair is smoothing out nicely and very few fly-aways when it dries.  My curls are bouncier and the ends of my hair are not as dry and straggly.  My hair does not feel heavy or oily after applying this ProArgan treatment.  I received this shortly after buying a bottle of olive oil hair treatment from a salon.  ProArgan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is a great deal!  It will last a long time.  I have been applying daily (2 pumps) to my medium length hair for about 3 weeks and the bottle is not even down .5 inch!</li>
    <li> I have a love-hate relationship with my hair.  Lately it has been leaning more towards just hate.  My individual strands of hair are thick but I don&#x27;t have very much of it so it is always limp and lifeless but with a bunch of baby fly aways near my hair line.  To top it off it gets oily very easily and I have to wash it every day or just pull it back.  Because of all of that I am always nervous to try new hair products.  I received this ProArgan at a discount in order to give an honest review so I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE IT!  The first thing I noticed is that it comes in a fancy, chic bottle. The packaging makes me feel like I am treating myself to some fancy hair products.  The texture of the Argan oil is so silky.  It does not feel oily or greasy at all.  It is a very light silky feeling for your hair.  Oh and the scent is amazing.  I use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair also and she will grab my hand and smell it after I apply it because she loves the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  It leaves my hair feeling smooth and takes care of the fly-aways at my hair line.  And my hair is so shiny and and smells amazing. Honestly, if I could give this product 6 stars I would.</li>
    <li> I tried ProArgan for a month before writing this review. This product is absolutely the best finishing oil I&#x27;ve tried.  Compared to the other very well known brand that is expensive (MO), this oil is different.  I&#x27;ve applied ProArgan to my dry and wet hair and it does not weigh it down in either case - surprising.  The other Moroccan oil would leave my hair a little oily, not ProArgan, it seems to just glide over the hair and disappear leaving my hair sweet smelling and manageable.  It seems to strengthen my hair shaft, and leaves my hair soft.  It&#x27;s a nice finishing product for shine and a leave-on conditioner.  Highly recommend.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  I intend to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I threw out all my other leave in conditioners/heat protectors/fly away frizz smoothers...this product does what it says- and does it all! I have a small bathroom and was sick of wasting money on these cheaper drug store products that didn&#x27;t deliver results on my bleached blonde hair and cluttered up my counter.  I wised up. started reading product reviews  on here, took a chance and am glad I did! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype&#x27;s about.  I&#x27;ve used it three times without results that are especially appealing.  One time, I wound up using too much (5 pumps) because 4 pumps (one pump at a time) would not remove the flyaways from static.  From the way reviews espouse its benefits, you&#x27;d think it was the second coming of coconut oil.  I&#x27;m waiting to see how it works as a thermal protectant for heat styling.  I&#x27;ll amend my review if my hair starts falling out.  It&#x27;s an okay product (might have skin uses) but, for hair, it&#x27;s not any better than a bottle of Frizz Ez.</li>
    <li> This smells terrible. It smells like strong, stinky, men&#x27;s cologne. I couldn&#x27;t stand to use it more than once.</li>
    <li> Winner winner! I used this the first day I got it and have not been disappointed! You only need to use a small amount for the softest, shiniest hair ever! Doesn&#x27;t leave me with greasy hair and is gentle enough to use every day. there is no off-putting smell that come with some oils and I just love it! This is the best oil treatment I ever used and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This oil made my hair feel so soft! I have very coarse frizzy hair. It didn&#x27;t do as much as I&#x27;d hoped for the frizz (nothing ever does), but my hair feels amazing - It was super easy to brush, too. I applied a few drops to my damp hair. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this does when I flat iron it! Great hair product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the ProArgan Premium Hair Serum/ Oil for just a few days and already love it! It does not weigh down my hair, has a very light texture and nourishes without leaving the hair oily. Also, it smells really nice. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> When I was looking for an oil for my hair and I saw this one I was kinda skeptical because it had so many good reviews, anyways I went ahead and bought it, it was awesome! It smells terrific and it leaves your hair shiny, not greasy, super light weigh, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you about long term changes in my hair, but so far, this is my absolutely favorite oil that I&#x27;ve tried.  Update 05/10/15 I still love and have this product. It leaves my hair soft and silky, but not glossy or oily. It smells very good. I have to say that I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with fly away, but that is just how my hair it is. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> My poor thinning senior hair is feeling like hair again. Thank you. Marcia</li>
    <li> I am loving it this oil its great I have Mix hair and I have been bleaching it for over 20 years and my hair was dry but not now this Argan oil and Australian macadamia oil is wonderful I use it every day and it does not Flatten my hair thank you so for this oil</li>
    <li> Good hair oil with good smell too.</li>
    <li> I had misgivings about this product. I have curly hair which can get frizzy on humid days....I was also nervous that it may have left my hair greasy. I have to say...I love it. Not only does it not leave my hair greasy, it leaves my hair soft and frizz free. The smell is subtle ..I love it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This Product is Amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I Love the way it makes my hair feel soft and the smell is incredible! I get compliments on great my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is way more shinier!!&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for your hair!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff just a little bit that all it takes.</li>
    <li> Great for hair.  At first I was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t pure argon oil so I then bought some pure argon oil to try as well.  The pure oil is difficult to distribute without getting too much on, and then it stays greasy.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that.  The silicones and polymers in it are good vehicles for distributing the argon oil throughout hair, then they evaporate and leave the oil, which absorbs into the hair to condition and smooth it.  Seems greasy at first but absorbs well.</li>
    <li> love this! makes my fine hair silky and smooth without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Totally useless thing. Not as nourishing as oil, not smoothing hair as cream, the only thing it has - number one component that brings the soft texture and it isn&#x27;t sticky. Great smell - the only use of the item. Better purchase some oil containing products, don&#x27;t waste money</li>
    <li> Love it! I have really fine hair &amp; was nervous to try it since a lot of hair products tend to weigh my hair down but with all the good reviews I had to try it. So glad I did. Its a bigger bottle than most so its going to last &amp; it also smells great!</li>
    <li> The product did seem to be lightweight and non greasy, but I was not able to try it more than once due to its fragrance, which I found nauseating. It has a strong musk-like scent that seems to be prevalent in other perfumes and body sprays these days.</li>
