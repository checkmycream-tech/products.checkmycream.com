      <li>This stuff is MUCH more pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It feels amazing.</li>
      <li>The taste is nice.  </li>
      <li>I tended to use the industrial kind of mouthwashes though.</li>
      <li>But the mouthwash is nice.  </li>
      <li>Of course the consumer would have to decide if getting all of them is cost effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Health products by Crest since they came out and have continued to buy them as I find them to be effective</li>
      <li>This is a nice set that would work well as a care-package for someone away at school.  </li>
      <li>For an overnight it will be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice way to try a variety of crest products all at once.</li>
      <li>I gag very easily, and this toothbrush gave me \\&quot;issues\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The floss is nice - but the plastic box size is large, making it more ideal for the type of floss that stays home, rather than travels in your purse.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this was my favorite part of the package.</li>
      <li>well then, settle for a sparkling clean mouth instead because that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get with this great product BOOM!</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is alcohol-free and was pretty happy with it.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush is probably my favorite of the grouping and has a nice, solid handle and great bristles that feel like they are doing a quite thorough job of cleaning your teeth!</li>
      <li>It really does glide and it tastes great too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a kid anymore been still love these products.</li>
      <li>I love Glide.</li>
      <li>What it most closely resembles to me is Altoids.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love the floss.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been pleased with this set, though found more uses for some items than others.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for whether the mouthwash is any better than Listerine, though.</li>
      <li>The floss works nicely (as most do).  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product, Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste.</li>
      <li>mouthwash is the last part of this wonderful time taking care of my mouth and teeth.</li>
      <li>This set is basically the Cadillac of mouth care kits... and let&#x27;s face it, who wouldn&#x27;t love a Cadillac?  </li>
      <li>, the toothpaste is okay but would prefer products with ingredients that don&#x27;t \\&quot;stain teeth\\&quot; (as cited on packaging).  </li>
      <li>Anywho, you get floss(severely underused by most), a toothbrush, toothpaste, and some mouth wash.  </li>
      <li>I did not notice Crest helping with sensitivity better than Sensodine.  </li>
      <li>A thoughtful gift or just a nice collection for yourself and your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is really top notch.  </li>
      <li>This is MUCH MUCH better.</li>
      <li>A dentist would probably be better</li>
      <li>better mouth health</li>
      <li>I do love the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love the toothbrush with</li>
      <li>I love Glide.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Toothpaste is fresh tasting and leaves my mouth feeling good.</li>
      <li>I got this because what the heck I can always use more toothpaste and mouthwash and the dentist says I should floss.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves a great clean, fresh feel without the burning side</li>
      <li>Unlike other \\&quot;gift\\&quot; sets that contain nonsense or junk items, Crest has actually put together an excellent collection of their best products.  </li>
      <li>because I can&#x27;t use the large toothbrush, the floss is good</li>
      <li>But I do have to say this is the most comfortable non-power toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
      <li>the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed the toothbrush, its comfortable on the teeth</li>
      <li>The floss is most important and I like the Glide Pro Health.  </li>
      <li>What these kits are especially nice for is as a gift to my family members in both the military and those attending college.</li>
      <li>* Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash:  a, use twice-a-day (for 24 hour protection -- antigingivitis, antiplaque), oral rinse that leaves My mouth feeling squeakie-clean and has smooth minty/refreshing flavor that didn&#x27;t burn My tongue. :)</li>
      <li>But I have been impressed with each of the products and do not notice the staining other people have.</li>
      <li>Easy as can be.</li>
      <li>Yes, the curiously strong mints.</li>
      <li>other reviewers mentioned, it might be best to pick and choose the components on this bundle for yourself, but really as long as you&#x27;re okay with a medium firmness brush, this is a great deal.</li>
      <li>collection full of your favorite products all in one</li>
      <li>However, this system seemed to work fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t argue with free even if it&#x27;s not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, I know the reviews on this are mixed...and many point out the possibility of \\&quot;teeth staining\\&quot; when using these products.  I must admit I don&#x27;t read the packages as good as I should.  I also do not tend to search out websites and product reviews on something as simple as tooth paste or floss.  With that being said, I DO buy and use products that I have used in the past with good luck, and with a brand I normally trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I used ALL the products in this kit for about 15 days.  I do not notice any teeth staining, but I am not sure how long that would take to be an issue?!  I think the tooth paste has a great minty flavor and it does not seem to \\&quot;gum\\&quot; up the end of the tube like some tooth pastes do.  I love, love, love the floss.  It is super \\&quot;slick\\&quot; and does not get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; on those hard to reach/tight spaces in your mouth.  The tooth brush is another love!  The tooth brush has small bumps or ribs on the back of the tooth brush that invigorate your cheeks while brushing.  This makes for a great \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel to brushing your teeth!  Love it!  The mouth wash is great too.  It has a minty fresh flavor but not too strong.  I know in the past I have purchased mouth wash that I cannot \\&quot;swish\\&quot; around for more than 10 seconds without feeling I have burned the inside of my mouth!  This product leaves a great clean, fresh feel without the burning side affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if the price is listed \\&quot;right\\&quot; when you purchase the collection I can&#x27;t imagine any issues, other than \\&quot;if\\&quot; indeed this stains your teeth.  In all honesty, I feel as though most products have some horrible side affect if we read the fine print to every product.  In the years I have used Crest products I have yet to have an issue.</li>
    <li> The Crest Pro-Health Collection is the perfect all in one kit that you need to maintain a healthy mouth and beautiful smile. This kit is perfect for you to send with your college freshman and you can give this as a nice going away gift because it has everything. The Oral-B floss is satiny and smooth enough to not cause any irritation to your gums and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health mouthwash comes in a large one liter bottle and it is alcohol free.  The Oral-B toothbrush is great and had the gum stimulators on the outer edges and this helps promote healthy gums. A thoughtful gift or just a nice collection for yourself and your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection full of your favorite products all in one you will love it as much as I have.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice assortment of dental products from Crest. It would make a wonderful gift for a student starting college or similar situation. The product sizes are generous (not trial or travel sizes). Please note that this is the alcohol-free mouthwash intended to cause less burning than the traditional mouthwash. While some may prefer the alcohol-free, others complain that it leaves an after-taste and/or stains the mouth more than the traditional alcohol-based mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I got this because what the heck I can always use more toothpaste and mouthwash and the dentist says I should floss.  The only problem is my teeth are in such a state that the floss doesn&#x27;t work that well.  And as for the toothpaste it&#x27;s hard to notice much difference given that most of the teeth I still have are crowns.  And I have a fancy electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t really need the manual one except as a backup for overnight travel or if there&#x27;s a blackout and I want to brush my teeth.  But the mouthwash is nice.  What I don&#x27;t like about Crest toothpaste is it leaves this gross film in my mouth afterwards.  I&#x27;d before Colgate but I can&#x27;t argue with free even if it&#x27;s not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve received a bundled dental kit. It&#x27;s like \\&quot;The Best of Crest Pro-Health\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure who would buy such a kit (is it a birthday gift for someone who really loves their teeth? Or for a student going off to college? Or is it a CARE package for a loved one in the Armed Forces? Maybe). The only reason I see an ordinary consumer buying it is for purely economic reasons - if it&#x27;s actually cheaper to buy this set rather than buying each individual item (which is what most people do). As of this date, Amazon has no price for the bundle, so I can&#x27;t compare (I will update this review when the price appears once again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit consists of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the all-in-one medium toothbrush is decent but since I use Sonicare, it is of limited use to me. Since I have receding gums, I have given up using manual toothbrushes. However, for the everyday user (hubby) it works fine. Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second item that particularly interested me was the mouthwash. As some of you know, there has been controversy over Listerine because long-term use of any mouthwash containing alchohol is reputedly linked to oral cancer. Hence, I was interested to see if this Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint mouthwash was a viable alterative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a minty taste and leaves a mild, tingly feeling (definitely not as strong as Listerine). However, I understand from reading some reviews on this product that it contains a stain-causing chemical. Since I used it only few times, I can&#x27;t judge whether this effect is true. So far my teeth look fine and I don&#x27;t see any excessive brown stains. I can&#x27;t speak for whether the mouthwash is any better than Listerine, though. Since alcohol does kill germs, I am suspicious that it may not be as effective for long term use as Listerine. As a compromise, I plan to alternate this mouthwash with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next. Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss. I love Glide. No problems here, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t shred as easily as other brands do. The best part of this set for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the toothpaste. According to the box, it has everything you&#x27;d want in a toothpaste: fights cavities, gingivitis, gum disease, brightens teeth and removes stains (ironic if the staining mouthwash rumors are true -you brush your teeth to get rid of stains only to get it back again!). However, it terms of taste, I didn&#x27;t like it. While the color is a cool mint blue, it leaves your mouth with a strange burning sensation. I am a long time user of Colgate Total, and have never experienced this type of stinging. Strangely enough, it leaves your mouth with the effect that Listerine does! But I much prefer Colgate because I prefer my toothpaste to be bland - I&#x27;ll leave the stinging feeling to the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it. So I have mixed feelings about this kit because I couldn&#x27;t verify where the mouthwash really leaves brown stains as other reviewers have pointed out. Time will tell, and I will update my review accordingly.germs, I am suspicious that it may not be as effective for long term use as Listerine.

    <li> This is great deal to buy. and packaged to help you get pro health teeth cleaning and maintenance. I am using it everyday and promote the use of flossing and using these packaged crest products of teeth maintenance. feeling great everyday. breath fresh each time I brush. flossing helps keep disease away from mouth. and enjoy kissing my wife.</li>
    <li> A nice complete kit to have for travelling, but I wish they came in smaller size, easier to pack along with other necessities before you go on a trip.</li>
    <li> This is a great collection of products all designed to work together. The floss is a strip, rather than a string, so it really does glide easily between my teeth. I have gums that are pretty tender, and this product never bothered them once. The mouthwash is alcohol-free, so there was none of the stinging or drying I&#x27;ve gotten with other brands. The toothbrush comes in a medium firmness, which is my only complaint. My dentist told me to avoid anything but a soft brush, so I&#x27;ve been a little paranoid about using this one very much. I really do like the increased texture of the tongue-scraping pad, though. Lastly, there is a great tube of toothpaste. Honestly, this was my favorite part of the package. It says the flavor is \\&quot;Cool Peppermint.\\&quot; What it most closely resembles to me is Altoids. Yes, the curiously strong mints. This flavor really blew me away. It seemed to last a good while for me, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers mentioned, it might be best to pick and choose the components on this bundle for yourself, but really as long as you&#x27;re okay with a medium firmness brush, this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most complete kit for clean teeth I have ever owned. I love the toothbrush with it&#x27;s various types and shapes of bristles. It feels like no spot on my teeth is being missed. I already loved the toothpaste, I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Health toothpaste for a good while now and I am very satisfied. What makes me really like the toothpaste for this kit is the tube. It&#x27;s the type of tube that can stand up, because it has a big flat top. Now I don&#x27;t have to put the toothpaste in my medicine cabinet. I can just let it stand on my sink. The mouthwash is good too, which is something I&#x27;ve been using before I received this kit. It does not have a painful sensation like Listerine does. I have to admit though, I haven&#x27;t used the dental floss yet. If I decided to use it, I may update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably be a good, practical present for a college student that&#x27;s going away from home. So if you haven&#x27;t got the message, it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
    <li> Wow wee I loved using all 4 of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start out with the floss, it smells good and it leaves a good feeling after using it. Then use the large mouth toothbrush. The toothbrush feels so amazing, I find myself using it a few times a day! I love how the toothpaste has little bits of freshener in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash is the last part of this wonderful time taking care of my mouth and teeth. The mouthwash has little bits of goodness in it too. All of my family uses the mouthwash, and after you use it, it just makes you smile! Which is awesome, because your smile is beautiful!! Thanks Crest, I know I will be buying all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the prices, it is a really good deal! Nothing is too expensive when taking care of your mouth and teeth!!</li>
    <li> This is a very handy, all at once purchase of Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health line. As these products will last for a varying amount of time, I feel like it&#x27;s a great thing to buy if you are interested in switching brands, moving (and just want to start over with all mouthcare) or want to set up an extra set of stuff at a summer house, or a dorm or something along those lines. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the type of collection that will be constantly re-ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the individual products, I like some more than others. The floss is nice - but the plastic box size is large, making it more ideal for the type of floss that stays home, rather than travels in your purse. The toothpaste has a very sweet flavor, and not as minty as I prefer, so though it works nicely, is not my favorite brand. The mouthwash lacks the burn of more astringent varieties, and has an odd, almost licorice-like aftertaste that isn&#x27;t unappealing, but markedly strange. The toothbrush is probably my favorite of the grouping and has a nice, solid handle and great bristles that feel like they are doing a quite thorough job of cleaning your teeth!</li>
    <li> First, I like the floss.  This is the floss I always use.  It glides well and does not shred.  I buy it in bulk package from Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like other items in the kit.  Both the toothpaste and the rinse have a warning saying that they may cause teeth staining.  What is up with that?!  I have been using them for two weeks and I am constantly worried about staining.  After brushing, I now spend time to examine my teeth to see if they became stained.  So far, I don&#x27;t think they did, but if I see a stain I will blame these products simply because of the warning.  Staining of teeth is not something people should worry about when brushing their teeth.  Incidentally, SmartMouth rinse states that it will not stain teeth or dentures.  I do not want to be concerned with teeth staining when using tooth care products, so I will look for products that do not contain a possibility to cause staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth, so I normally use Sensodine toothpaste which was recommended by every dentist I have seen.  Crest Pro-Care toothpaste has never been recommended to me by a dentist, although it claims to help with hyper-sensitivity.  I did not notice Crest helping with sensitivity better than Sensodine.  According to dentists I visited, teeth sensitivity is a result of tooth enamel erosion.  My dentists always recommended SOFT bristled brushes to reduce erosion.  The toothbrush included in this kit has MEDIUM bristles, which may promote erosion of the enamel.  Crest might have included medium toothbrush to combat the potential staining, but this is just my guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think that this is a good collection of products because of the potential teeth staining by the toothpaste and the rinse, and because the toothbrush has medium bristles which may promote enamel erosion and increase sensitivity.  Additionally, items in this kit will likely run out at different times, so consumers are unlikely to purchase this as a kit more than once.  At the time of this review the price is not available, so I cannot comment on value, but I do not see why one would be more interested in buying these products as a kit than individually.time of this review the price is not available, so I cannot comment on value, but I do not see why one would be more interested in buying these products as a kit than individually.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice collection. Ultimately it should come down to cost for you, if it makes sense to buy these items as a group. It might be that you only need one or two of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the review to comment on the floss. Absolutely first-rate. So well worth the extra expense. This gets where it needs to go, including tight gaps, without pain and without tearing/shredding. Best floss I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit has all four things you need to help you in your war on dental plaque. I enjoyed the toothbrush, its comfortable on the teeth and it&#x27;ll clean all of the nooks and crannies in your mouth.  The toothpaste is really top notch.  I enjoyed the taste and it really starts to work once you start brushing.  The floss is most important and I like the Glide Pro Health.  The floss wont get caught in your teeth like other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Finally to cap off everything is the mouth wash.  The Crest Pro Health rinse really gets washing around inside.  Best of all it doesn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an all-in-one kit for your dental needs then look no further than the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit.</li>
    <li> This collection is great. The products are useful, and the quality is equal to, or better, than comparable products on the market. I find the flavor pleasing, and using this twice daily is no hardship at all. I&#x27;m taking care of my teeth, and believe that I&#x27;ll keep the teeth I have much longer because of using these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pro-Health products for a few years now, mostly the toothpaste for me, while my husband uses the toothpaste and the toothbrushes. We&#x27;ve been pleased with this set, though found more uses for some items than others. The toothbrush and toothpaste was used up immediately -- my husband likes the slightly smaller head on the Pro-Health brushes, and the angle works well for him to get his back teeth. The toothpaste has always helped me keep my teeth white, ever since using an over the counter bleaching product a year ago. My husband even puts a dab of it on a sensitive tooth every night per instructions from his dentist, and it keeps the tooth from hurting. The floss was new for us, and I love it. Absolutely ADORE this floss, as it&#x27;s a nice thickness so it can get out food particles (thin floss often passes right by it) but it&#x27;s waxed enough that it comes out easily. The rinse is our least favorite. We use it on occasion, but there is a really nasty cloying taste to it, and we won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I do like Crest products so I was excited to try this kit.&lt;br /&gt;While it was handy getting everything in one (mouthwash, toothpaste, floss &amp; a toothbrush), the kit overall was unremarkable EXCEPT the toothbrush - my initial review said the toothbrush was average. I have now come to believe it&#x27;s just like those commercials where there&#x27;s an army of tiny people scrubbing your teeth. It feels amazing. Otherwise: These seem to be good but average products, promising whitening (I&#x27;ve noticed no difference) and better mouth health, blah blah blah. The toothpaste is a blue, somewhat gritty gel, a little dry in the mouth, but otherwise no complaints. Mouthwash is effective, not for as long as they promise, but doesn&#x27;t have a ton of burn to it. The floss is fairly high-quality.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be a good deal for things my husband uses, so I got it for him.  It was nice to have one of each in the cabinet ready to go when he ran out of his previous stash.  He loves the mouthwash and I love that he uses it because he used to use yucky-tasting medicine mouthwash!!  This is MUCH MUCH better.</li>
    <li> I personally use each of these items regularly for my dental needs but I buy them all separatly. What these kits are especially nice for is as a gift to my family members in both the military and those attending college. At first I though sending these would be met with all the enthusism of a visit to the DMV, but sometimes a gift is more about what someone need rather than what they want.. I was surprised by the \\&quot;Thank yous\\&quot; I&#x27;ve received from sending these. All in all a great collection of essential dental necessities all in one place.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally!  Everything I need (dental-wise, for daily use) in one convenient bundle (kit)!  *does a little Happy dance* :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush:  the toothbrush head (loaded with cross action bristles) is a lot larger than what is considered normal.  The back of the handle is cushioned (I kid ya not!) and there are textured/rubberized grips where the thumb and forefinger usually rest when brushing.  The sides of the brush head have soft gum stimulators. The back of the brush head (and along the sides) one finds the tongue and cheek cleaner.  Impressive, does a fantastic job of cleaning and stimulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste:  a full sized (6 ounce) squeeze tube of cool peppermint flavored gell toothpaste (with Fluoride) that is not all that sudsy/foamy (like most other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used). after brushing and rinsing mouth with clean water, one is left with a minty fresh feeling inside mouth. I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss:  floss is like a flat ribbon -- as opposed to a traditional thread like floss.  It is very smooth, glides between teeth without cutting or rubbing too hard.  If one uses a threader to clean braces, or permanent bridges (as examples) the floss loads and pulls between teeth smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash:  a, use twice-a-day (for 24 hour protection -- antigingivitis, antiplaque), oral rinse that leaves My mouth feeling squeakie-clean and has smooth minty/refreshing flavor that didn&#x27;t burn My tongue. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013</li>
    <li> This is a nice way to try a variety of crest products all at once. Of course the consumer would have to decide if getting all of them is cost effective. But I have been impressed with each of the products and do not notice the staining other people have. I am not saying it isn&#x27;t real, just that I have not experienced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste is fresh tasting and leaves my mouth feeling good. The mouthwash is not at all stingy to me, it is quite pleasant. I tended to use the industrial kind of mouthwashes though. But it is very mellow to me. I use power toothbrushes. But I do have to say this is the most comfortable non-power toothbrush I have ever used. It is very large and very soft. For an overnight it will be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss is really good. Super comfortable and gets easily in everywhere. One of the best if not best floss I have used. So all the products are good, but it might make sense to just pick up the ones you need individually. But if you haven&#x27;t been using Crest and want to try them all this is a recommended product.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Crest kid. I&#x27;m not a kid anymore been still love these products. I was glad to try the Pro Health line for us older \\&quot;kids\\&quot;. I am very pleased with this extension line and will continue using the Crest Pro Health collection. It makes my mouth feel very happy and healthy</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this kit from Crest. We have been using the Crest toothpaste and decided to venture out into the other pro-health products. I have had some trouble in the past with mouthwash and my sensitive teeth. However, this system seemed to work fine. The minty effect of the mouthwash and toothpaste lasts about average. I do feel as though my teeth look whiter after doing the mouth wash and toothpaste. I don&#x27;t have any proof but feel that they are a shade or two lighter after a month. The floss is great as it has a minty taste but is a little pricey. There are cheaper alternatives if you don&#x27;t want to purchase the whole kit that work just as well. I do love the toothbrush. However, I typically use a Crest toothbrush and not a sonicare or other type of toothbrush. Overall, I would buy this to avoid needing to get it from Wal-Mart as it is fairly well priced and a complete set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Health products by Crest since they came out and have continued to buy them as I find them to be effective and I really like the minty feeling of all the products.</li>
    <li> This is an odd grouping of products. It is a great way to try all the Crest products, but I would never buy this collection on a regular basis. I have purchased the toothpaste before, but I&#x27;ve had never tried the mouthwash, and I like it a lot. I will definitely buy the toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set that would work well as a care-package for someone away at school.  It includes mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, and a toothbrush.  The toothbrush is the same kind that my dentist gives out, so I&#x27;ve used these ones quite a bit and like the different bristles that get into all the little spaces of my teeth.  The floss is a standard easy-glide.  The mouthwash has some sting/burn to it despite being alcohol free; however, it goes away fairly quickly so that my mouth just felt fresh--I didn&#x27;t feel I needed to rinse with water.  The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have the bite that some mint toothpastes do, but does have a grittiness that I felt was similar to the polish used at a dental office.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! Everything goes together and lasts the same amount of time, so when you run out you get a whole new kit and start over. Easy as can be. My mouth has never been fresher and I feel good knowing I am using pro-health products that continue working even after I am done brushing, flossing and rinsing. The brush feels great, like a massage. The mouthwash is pleasant without a lot of \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to it, it left my mouth feeling fresh for a long time. The floss is the nicest floss I have ever used. It really does glide and it tastes great too. Excellent kit.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste. Because of the fact that it&#x27;s making my teeth a shade whiter, each week that I use it. This product is AWESOME!!! I&#x27;d recommend this product to ALL of my friends &amp; family. Like I&#x27;ve already done.</li>
    <li> I would actually prefer fluoride-free products.  However, it is difficult to find dental products from the major companies that do not contain fluoride.  I was using Toms of Main products for a while, but the fluoride-free versions became hard to find and they recently started making smaller sizes but charging the same amount.  It got to be quite expensive.  Therefore, I started using the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash.  I like the fact that it is alcohol-free and was pretty happy with it.  I hadn&#x27;t used the toothpaste before, but I do like it okay enough to finish the tube.  The taste is nice.  The toothbrush provided in this kit is much too big for my liking.  I gag very easily, and this toothbrush gave me \\&quot;issues\\&quot;.  The floss works nicely (as most do).  It worked smoothly and there were no issues with breaking.  I probably won&#x27;t get this kit again, because I can&#x27;t use the large toothbrush, the floss is good but so are other brands, the toothpaste is okay but would prefer products with ingredients that don&#x27;t \\&quot;stain teeth\\&quot; (as cited on packaging).  I will either purchase the mouthwash or maybe go back to a fluoride-free formula.</li>
    <li> With a mouth like mine, the heavy artillery must sometimes be called in.  This is said \\&quot;heavy artillery.\\&quot; A dentist would probably be better but... who likes to go to the dentist?  Better yet, who can afford one?!  For all those that answered \\&quot;yes\\&quot; to the two previously posed questions... lucky you(you sicko&#x27;s!).  For the rest of us(anybody? *crickets*), there&#x27;s the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit.  This comes with everything you need to revitalize your mouth except that weird little suction hose thingy and a cloth bib!  Anywho, you get floss(severely underused by most), a toothbrush, toothpaste, and some mouth wash.  This set is basically the Cadillac of mouth care kits... and let&#x27;s face it, who wouldn&#x27;t love a Cadillac?  Oh you wouldn&#x27;t?  I see... well then, settle for a sparkling clean mouth instead because that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get with this great product BOOM!</li>
    <li> This is a great little package! Unlike other \\&quot;gift\\&quot; sets that contain nonsense or junk items, Crest has actually put together an excellent collection of their best products.  I prefer the Crest Pro Health mouthwash over Listerine-- big time.  After using the Crest mouthwash for several months, I tried some Listerine I had left over and promptly discarded it.  This stuff is MUCH more pleasant.  The toothbrush and floss are also outstanding and high quality.  I have noticed a marked decrease in stains/tartar buildup after using all four products in tandem.  Highly Recommended!</li>
