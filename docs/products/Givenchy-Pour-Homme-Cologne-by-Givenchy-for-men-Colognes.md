      <li>So, over the years I have tried many colognes.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not a snob about it; I love Montale oudhs</li>
      <li>ALSO IS MY FAVORITE COLOGNE.</li>
      <li>100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>and so do I, however I personally wasnt impressed with this one.</li>
      <li>I have read that people LOVE Givenchy fragrances</li>
      <li>gladly recommend it.</li>
      <li>AM USUALLY SATISFIED WITH ALL MY PURCHASES FROM AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
      <li>The Babes love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My favorite men&#x27;s cologne ...</li>
      <li>This is one of my husbands favorite scents.</li>
      <li>THE BEST OF THE 3 DIFFERENT COLOGNE VARIETY.</li>
      <li>very original.</li>
      <li>It smells delightful on clean, warm skin, but lasts for less than an hour.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it quite a bit.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to see this cologne come back.  </li>
      <li>Perfect cologne for everyday or night use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm, sweet without being cloying, and very peasant.</li>
      <li>it is not the original Givenchy</li>
      <li>Its smell is rich with a variety of aromatic nuances.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this cologne to every Male that likes a nice Light smelling cologne that is Not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love a good aqua or fougere, especially vetiver, as much as a dark rose attar.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>I finally found my favorite Cologne!</li>
      <li>It has a fresh pleasant /not very strong but long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>I have it, but rarely use it, as it reminds me of a bug spray.</li>
      <li>Also, note that any bottle I rate 3 stars or higher, I would replace when it&#x27;s done - it&#x27;s worth a permanent place.</li>
      <li>Givenchy Pour Homme is definitely more of a formal cologne, not an energetic scent like something you may want to wear everyday or out to a club.  </li>
      <li>Above all, it doesn&#x27;t become overwhelming even if you tend to use a lot.</li>
      <li>, I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
      <li>you so much for bringing this cologne back it evokes precious memories.</li>
      <li>All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience.</li>
      <li>In that company, this is a very decent fragrance indeed to earn 3 or 4 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it just isn&#x27;t as nice as previous purchases of this product in the store.  </li>
      <li>I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances.</li>
      <li>Absolutely</li>
      <li>this was not the real thing,it was a imitation,I would not recommend this to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle.</li>
      <li>That maybe several dozens, but that leaves several dozens I own or have tried that I have not and will not replace.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always get great compliments on this cologne and it does last awhile, at least for me.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this clogne .</li>
      <li>This fragrance is great as it can cater to all different age groups but primarily young and middle aged adults.  </li>
      <li>This is the real deal, folks....not a cheap imitation that you cannot smell after 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>The cologne arrived quickly and my boyfriend really likes it, so I&#x27;d recommend taking advantage of this AMAZING deal since this is usually a LOT more expensive.  </li>
      <li>The cedar is critical and it really won&#x27;t last for a full work day, even on fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The cedar is critical and it really won&#x27;t last for a full work day, even on fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The first givenchy i brought was more stronger than this.am not really happy about it.but nothing i can do.i</li>
      <li>A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is).</li>
      <li>It is what i was expected, the shipping was freaking fast!!</li>
      <li>Toilette Spray this firm are distinguished by a rich and tart flavor.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about ordering this because the price was so much cheaper than normal, but I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a unexpected treat we could both enjoy, so I gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>a plus but its geared toward a mature male say 40-50ish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional.</li>
      <li>so if you decide to buy it, prepare yourself to be surprised that it smells much different and will not stay for long.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance. LOVE IT! Smells great!! I literally feel like melting into whomever is wearing it.</li>
    <li> Happy to find something that still has the original fragrance. My husband was very happy to receive the gift and he uses it every day.</li>
    <li> A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is). I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional. I don&#x27;t go out and party. Not much need for evening formal wear. Mostly just business and business-casual attire, then of course, something for family outings or just to smell nice around the house.

    <li> my son loves this all he wears for years now. many compliaments!</li>
    <li> I have it, but rarely use it, as it reminds me of a bug spray. I prefer Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures for Men. [...]</li>
    <li> Got my sweetie 2 bottles for  what I would have paid for 1 bottle at the department store. Trust me it&#x27;s the real thing, I was skeptical too!</li>
    <li> It is what i was expected, the shipping was freaking fast!! it deserves the highest rate</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this because the price was so much cheaper than normal, but I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a unexpected treat we could both enjoy, so I gave it a try.  The cologne arrived quickly and my boyfriend really likes it, so I&#x27;d recommend taking advantage of this AMAZING deal since this is usually a LOT more expensive.  I&#x27;m considering ordering a second \\&quot;back up\\&quot; bottle just in case they run out or raise the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this was a knock-off (it was packaged correctly and such) but maybe it has been sitting around too long or something.  Not sure why, but it just isn&#x27;t as nice as previous purchases of this product in the store.  Probably going to throw it away.</li>
    <li> it is not the original Givenchy so if you decide to buy it, prepare yourself to be surprised that it smells much different and will not stay for long. No good</li>
    <li> This fragrance is great as it can cater to all different age groups but primarily young and middle aged adults.  I always get great compliments on this cologne and it does last awhile, at least for me.  Givenchy Pour Homme is definitely more of a formal cologne, not an energetic scent like something you may want to wear everyday or out to a club.  Above all, it doesn&#x27;t become overwhelming even if you tend to use a lot.</li>
    <li> This is one of my husbands favorite scents. The quality of this product is always exceptional never diluted like some store bought versions.</li>
    <li> The Babes love this stuff.</li>
    <li> courteous service, I really liked the product, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This product is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.</li>
    <li> So, over the years I have tried many colognes. Some of the products I liked, but in most cases I have always was not been unsatisfied with a purchase. But one of my friends advised me to choose a Cologne company Givenchy. This was the beginning of my attachment to the products of this company. It is in their lines of colognes I found the flavor that I wanted. Toilette Spray this firm are distinguished by a rich and tart flavor. Its smell is rich with a variety of aromatic nuances. Enough for me to use it twice a week because the flavor lasts a long time. I finally found my favorite Cologne! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The first givenchy i brought was more stronger than this.am not really happy about it.but nothing i can do.i just got poloRalph to replace it.thanks for opportunity to express my feeling.</li>
    <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Givenchy Pour Homme, if you want your on smell than this is for you. Two words, buy it!</li>
    <li> excellent clogne many compliments from others. would highly recommend this clogne . too bad it is very hard to find in local area. that&#x27;s ok !  that&#x27;s why we have the internet ! !</li>
    <li> I have read that people LOVE Givenchy fragrances and so do I, however I personally wasnt impressed with this one. I have had it for 5mons now and it has grown on me but its not my go to fragrance. Pour Homme smells like a designer cologne a plus but its geared toward a mature male say 40-50ish.</li>
    <li> I do like the product and have to say the service and price are exceptional great.I&#x27;m going to reorder this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Amazone :)</li>
    <li> This is a fake and there is no way to return it.</li>
    <li> I simply love this fragrance. It has a fresh pleasant /not very strong but long lasting scent. This is the \\&quot;one\\&quot; that people ask all the time \\&quot;what is your perfume?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, folks....not a cheap imitation that you cannot smell after 15 minutes. I purposely sprayed it on a shirt when I received it (3 days ago) and I can STILL smell it on there! You cannot beat the price, either!</li>
    <li> Perfect cologne for everyday or night use.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> smells great!!! long lasting, but not over bearin.</li>
    <li> this was not the real thing,it was a imitation,I would not recommend this to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;I AM USUALLY SATISFIED WITH ALL MY PURCHASES FROM AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;THIS ALSO IS MY FAVORITE COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love givenchy this wonderful smelling cologne is very balanced.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  Would I recommend this product?  Absolutely</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this cologne come back.  I kept searching for any company that might have one of these left over.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for bringing this cologne back it evokes precious memories.</li>
    <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne ... fresh, a little woodsy and a little citrusy ... subtle ...</li>
    <li> This cologne You can wear all the time I get compliments on it every day And for the price that I found it can&#x27;t go wrong with it. I would recommend this cologne to every Male that likes a nice Light smelling cologne that is Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The department store in our area no longer carried this.  When I found it on line, I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> what a rip off...they wont even accept returns. Used to have one before and I remember it smelling nice. The one I got in the mail is terrible, almost unusable.</li>
    <li> THE BEST OF THE 3 DIFFERENT COLOGNE VARIETY. THIS ONE IS NOW THE HARDEST TO FIND IN STORES EXCEPT DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY , BUT THE PRICE IS DOUBLE.</li>
