<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my new blow dryer.  My only wish is that the temperature was adjustable but for the price, it&#x27;s a great little unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 2013 Update:  I&#x27;m falling out of love with my new blow dryer.  It&#x27;s still just as powerful - when I can get it to turn on...  The on switch is becoming tempermental and I have to wiggle it ever so slightly for about a minute before I find the sweet spot and it roars to life.  So it&#x27;s been demoted to two stars.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price</li>
    <li> Yes I would consider to buy another Vidal Sassoon Dryer. Great price and poduct. Really does the job. Love it</li>
    <li> This is my second hair dyer and they all got WAY too hot.  My neck on several occasions was really red.  It is very loud.  Rigjt now I&#x27;m shopping for a new hair dryer because I stunk up the whole bathroom using the dryer this morning.  Will not be buying this blow dryer if it was the last one available.</li>
    <li> Great product -- so light and powerful. Dries my very thick hair in a flash. I do wish the cord was a bit longer. It is JUST long enough.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and this particular style and brand lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> works good. shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Works great, no complaints</li>
    <li> Needed a small blow dryer and this pretty much does the job and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a good and powerful hair dryer and the price is good.  It&#x27;s small enough to travel with and powerful enough to do the job quickly.  I have very long hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> As a male that only uses this hairdryer for approximately 10-15 seconds a day to style my hair, I can say it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is one power house, has hot and cold functions, high and low air blast. I totally love how this works, been using it to dry my hair as well as straighten my natural afro hair and so far its being pure perfection. Haven&#x27;t had to use high settings cause the low works just good enough for me. It is better recommended to use the cold air during routine drying to prevent drying out of hair except when one plans to straighten it then go ahead and blast that heat.</li>
    <li> Works well. I had thought it was a folding one, that is incorrect, but it is pretty compact anyway, I just really like the folding ones.. Great for the price though.</li>
    <li> I bought this inexpensive hair dryer to straighten out my refrigerator gaskets (my wife does not own one as she has short hair).  It works perfectly... so much so that I wonder that if it has enough poop for someone who wants to dry their hair.  But, for me, it is great.</li>
    <li> We are using these in our facility since our professional wall mounted ones are currently not working. They work great. Have had no issues and they get a ton of use. May 30-35 uses a day.</li>
    <li> Lots of power on high setting. Easy to clean, which is important. Some competitors will eventually plug up and overheat.</li>
    <li> This dryer is light so it is good to carry for travel. The quality is good with its price. I could be more satisfied if it can be folded.</li>
    <li> Very powerful for such a small item but it doesn&#x27;t sit comfortably in the hand.. decent for the price though, good for travel</li>
    <li> This dryer has two speeds:  too hot and under-powered.  The hot setting is too hot to use unless you keep your finger on the &amp;#34;cold button,&amp;#34; which defeats the purpose.  The low setting is about as useful as fanning your head with a folded piece of paper.  I was all set to return it, but the shipping cost made it not worth it to do so.  I&#x27;ll keep this one as a back-up, but now I have to buy another hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought it because this was in a hotel room and I liked the weight - very light.  After years of buying expensive dryers I finally figured out that I just need a dryer - heat, blowing, and cold-shot is handy.  So I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> Very powerful blow dryer take minimal time to dry my hair. I gets the job done Great Product to have.</li>
    <li> Small and has good horsepower, a little noisy, good for the $$</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have hair (I shave my head),&lt;br /&gt;but I ordered this to use when painting (I&#x27;m an artiste).&lt;br /&gt;The price was right, and it does precisely what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;(Also, my daughter steals it to dry her hair, so I guess it works for that, too, considering how often I have to dig it out of the mess in the kid&#x27;s room when I need it to dry layers and washes of my acrylic paint).</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Very little blower power, especially for an 1875w. The heat, however, even on low, just about burns my head. Returning to Amazon and will purchase a full size dryer.</li>
    <li> Replaced a Vidal Sasson that was about 20 years old that gave up the ghost. Very similar but can remove the back and clean. Works well and similar to unit it replaced. Can&#x27;t argue with sucess.</li>
    <li> This was a backup in case my old one goes. Sure enough the old revlon went. The Vidal is quick and light. Love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Love that the back cap comes off so I can clean the lint, dust, and hair out of the filter.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
    <li> Works Great!!  No problems!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dorm room and the second time I turned it on it started sparking. When I looked inside I could see an itty bitty part of the inside catch on fire, after a few seconds it went away and was perfectly fine. Now every time I cut it on, it sparks and I have to wait for it to go out. It might just be a defect to the one I got but hey, it still works and is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s already broke. I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, but exactly what I needed. High speed, low speed perfect!</li>
    <li> Cheap hairdryer but needed one for travel...in case I leave it, don&#x27;t care. :)</li>
    <li> Good, basic hair dryer. I had one just like this for several years (maybe 5 years?) before it finally gave out. When looking for a new one I was happy to see this exact model and for a great price. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bells and whistles but it works well and gets the job done. I also like the attached loop for hanging it up when not in use.</li>
    <li> Power is great, but it heats up more than I would like.  Warmer rather than hot temps would be more hair-friendly.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works well enough, but the cord is very short, so short that it kept coming unplugged!  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer, it has power and dries my hair faster than my old one.  I think this dryer would be better if the cord was about a foot longer.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a very good hair dryer, the price is great, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the turbo dryer, have used it 3-4 times since it arrived and very pleased with it.Thank you,</li>
    <li> Little powerhouse of a blow dryer! It works very well and its lightweight...however I am updating my review to reflect that as of 11/4/15 (bought Feb 2015) the blow dryer has died...going to buy a Conair this time...Good while it lasted</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. It is light weight - travel size. Dries my hair very fast.</li>
    <li> And it still works! Buying the same one only because my old one is literally started falling apart (but still works as new)</li>
    <li> This product works well.  Very affordable.  Could be more powerful, but it is more that capable of fulfilling your hair drying needs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really just a standard blow dryer. I really liked the price and it does the job. I like the light weight of it.</li>
    <li> Solid dryer for the prices. works well under high heat. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The wind and heat are both very good. I like it. Besides, the price is reasonable. Hope it has more colors to choose from</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about. It dries my hair either really fast or really slow. I only wish it had a medium speed.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with it the very first time I used it.  Started well, nice and strong and then I turned it off and when I tried to turn it back on the switch jammed.  It will come on by using the GFI switch but only on low.  Some other buyers mentioned that the switch is tricky. I&#x27;m going to see if I can return it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price. Nice and light. Slow speed and SuperSonic speeds are settings along with cool air.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer and at an incredible price too!  You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.  And it&#x27;s easy to clean as well.  That will help it have a much longer life.</li>
    <li> Very strong considering how small it is! Works like a charm</li>
    <li> Pretty small and basic.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> brand new, excellent quality, performs as expected. cant ask anymore for this price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a low speed that is just right for me. I am pleased with the Vidal Sassoon dryer.</li>
    <li> I operated in a correct way. I didn&#x27;t expect that this dryer would be broken (could not start) so soon--after using only once!! It looks normal but just could not start working. I checked the plug and the dryer, but could not figure out the reason why it stops working.&lt;br /&gt;I am really upset with it.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer does what it is expected to do. No problems. Small enough to fit in the spot we have for it. The price was right.</li>
    <li> A little loud but works perfectly and good for the price</li>
    <li> A decent size and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s relatively small, lightweight and powerful.  I&#x27;ve used these for years and always keep several on hand for guests and my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Packs a punch in a smaller, lightweight hair dryer.  Gives you a couple of heat/speed options which is nice.  Dries my hair quickly &amp; efficiently without costing a lot of money.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> A perfect low cost blow dryer. Cheap. Blows hot and cold. Decent cord length. You just can&#x27;t do better for the price.</li>
    <li> I needed something fast and affordable and this fits the bill. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and it&#x27;s pretty powerful. I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s ideal for styling, as I purchased it strictly for quick-drying, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works well!  Compact design!  Only gave this 4 stars because it is a bit loud.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I know it is great.</li>
    <li> jus got my blow dryer n it works perfect n came on time too</li>
    <li> Strong heat and air flow.</li>
    <li> My last hair dryer was a Vidal Sassoon 1875W, very much like this model.  It lasted over 20 years!  I&#x27;m back for another one since it was so dependable!</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for fine, thin or short hair.  I have long, thick hair and need more hot air than what this hair dryer puts out so it takes longer to dry.  A good price though and will keep it to use when I travel.</li>
    <li> So I had this old Vidal Sassoon hair dryer. It lasted for two decades -a real work horse. A year ago I came to Amazon to replace it. Now I&#x27;m back as that thing (Conair) went up in a literal blaze of glory. Decided to return to the brand of my old work horse hoping for longer life this time round. Wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price point. But I&#x27;m quite pleased with the dryer&#x27;s power and light-weight design. My husband didn&#x27;t know I had made the switch and actually complimented me on how good my hair looked. My hair DID look less frizzy. Happy with the purchase. Perhaps the beginning of a decades long trusted workhorse relationship?</li>
    <li> It dries very fast and very quickly. You wouldn&#x27;t think it does based on how small it is (and how cheap it is as well) but absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> excellent- functional- speedy hair dryer</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised this dryer is great for the price . Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> in the first day i used it it melted after minutes even though it was in low heat  it was just a wast of money poor quality i don&#x27;t recommend it !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lasted three years and it keeps working fine. It dries my hair fine. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the back filter thing fell off too easily. I lost it during a move after the first year.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my art studio to dry layers of paint.  It&#x27;s small, compact - perfect for what I need.  Not sure I&#x27;d have been happy if had purchased for my hair as it has no attachment.</li>
    <li> I love this little dryer. It&#x27;s a beast and does the job. There is the normal low and high setting. The product is exactly like the picture and I am very happy with my purchase. My blow drying has been cut in half because of how powerful this dryer can be. Very happy and will purchase again to have one at home and one for traveling. At least of it is stolen I will have one at home.</li>
    <li> Hot &amp; fast. Also very light weight. Nothing fancy but perfect for my needs. Hope it lasts awhile!!</li>
    <li> Great dryer for price.  My wife and daughter with their long hair like it better than more expensive ones purchased in the past.  I like the cool shot button that allows cool down prior to shutting off as this extends life of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Not enough speed/heat control</li>
    <li> Burned out last week...did not last long and became a fire hazard.  very disappointed....it was doing strange things with electricity before it went out.</li>
    <li> Such a great hair dryer for the price. It&#x27;s compact and powerful, which I was happily surprised by.</li>
    <li> Be frankly, this price can buy this is very lucky.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected--but works fine.</li>
    <li> for the money great deal, great size fits into drawer and enough power , looks professional and think most would be happy with</li>
    <li> This dryer is great, old style dryer, not those ceramic types that everyone seems to be complaining about. good price too, I think I paid like $10-12 dollars? also the opening where the hot air comes out is just right, not too small or large. comes in different colors too.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a small blow dryer. IO have really thick hair and it does a petty good job. It doesn&#x27;t take to long.</li>
    <li> Christmas present sure she will like it</li>
    <li> it blows extremely hot air, may be above 170F at one foot. Don&#x27;t burn your scalp</li>
    <li> it drys hair much faster than other hair dryers. I like it. And it&#x27;s very easy to hold, light weight.</li>
    <li> Works great but has no medium heat setting with full power.  Hot is really hot</li>
    <li> Used this to remove warning stickers on an UTV.  Worked great. Bet it would work well on hair too.</li>
    <li> Love the size it works perfect for me</li>
    <li> This replaces an older Vidal Sassoon turbo-dryer.  I like the design and function of this model, and its performance is outstanding.  You can&#x27;t do better for a simple, basic hair dryer.  When this one wears out I will buy another exactly like it.  For the money (less than $13), you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Works good, drys hair, Its a hair dryer not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Having inexplicably been through three hair dryers in the past two years, I bought this dryer because it reminded me of the one that my mom has been using for the past 15 years (same brand, 1875 watts).  Just like hers, this dryer is a bit on the loud side, but aren&#x27;t all blow dryers?  The settings are simple, and there are no frills, but it does the job and I&#x27;m hoping to keep it around for a while!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It works, was economical and the color is fine.  Hope it holds up for a long time.</li>
    <li> I plugged it in and turned it on and my house smelt like burning rubber.  I returned it right after opening it.</li>
    <li> really powerful given its small and handy size. the only thing that keeps annoying me is that the cord seems relatively short...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that you can beat this hair dryer for the price. It has a very good fan speed and the heat is instant.  The cool button is very convenient. It is light weight. The plastic body, cord and plug are all good quality. The back comes off easily so that you can clean out any collected lint from the lint screen. The little hanger loop lets me keep it close by on the wall without being in the way. I have had it for 2 months, and I will check back in a year and let you know if it is still working.</li>
    <li> Trying to replace a Conair R875 that has a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; low speed. Unfortunately the new models no longer are as hot. I have gone through several hair dryers only to find the low speed is lukewarm. Other than that its your typical hair dryer, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a smaller hair dryer with a lot of power but it is rather noisy so the dogs do not do well when I dry them after baths.</li>
    <li> Always liked this hair dryer more than the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; ones. These seem to give off better heat and more power. One weak point is the on-off switch, so we turn is on-off with the GFI breaker. Got twice the life out of the old one this way. And how about just $12.00 bucks for this? Yea, good deal.</li>
    <li> Love this little hairdryer, Its very powerful, and it drys hair in a snap.  I love love this dryer and I love the price also.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> It dries just as fast if not faster than more expensive models at half the weight.  It&#x27;s a great hairdryer.  Easy to bring on trips too.</li>
    <li> Great product and great value.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cost effective. so powerful dryer.</li>
    <li> We bought one of these with the Revlon label and it works great.  The Revlon label was being sold on Amazon for $7.77 each and when I went back to buy another one for our camper, they were up to $18.00.  We were not happy.  I finally found the exact same thing with the Vidal Sassoon label for $11+ and bought it.  We&#x27;re still not happy about the price, but we at least have a light weight compact unit for our camper.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, It is exactly the same thing as the Revlon Rvdr5034.  I just checked, the Revlon label is now down to $11.99 and the Vidal is now $12.99.</li>
    <li> Fan inside stopped working within 2 months of purchase. After the replacement policy ended.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you.  This is an excellent dryer with two temperature settings, as well as a cooling button as well.  It is small enough for compact travel use as well.  There&#x27;s no need to spend big bucks on a perfectly good dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it. Worth the price and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I used this at a hotel and loved the weight of it. It&#x27;s very light and yet dries your hair quickly.  It&#x27;s only downfall is it&#x27;s not real quiet but the expensive dryer I had before was so heavy it wore me out by the time my hair was dry.</li>
    <li> It is a little noisy. But it is cheap and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Let me say that my wife absolutely loves this hair dryer. After she broke a Vidal Sassoon 1875 watt travel model that was $19.99 (by drying a spill on the couch a bit too close and shorting the dryer) she asked me to find a replacement at a reasonable price. I spent about an hour on Amazon looking at the various Vidal Sassoon models and other 1875 watt dryers and with this price I decided to buy it for her. She was not disapointed. She is a 22 year old women with color treated hair and is very picky about her dryer and she &amp;#34;absolutely loves it, it works nicely and gets hot almost immediately! just as good as the more expensive model we used to have&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an at home dryer at a great price, this is my choice for sure! We are going to order a 2nd one for our guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size, light weight and very efficient. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. I would recommend it highly...</li>
    <li> its a nice small hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;great for travelers. fits in small bags. I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;works great for the price I paid</li>
    <li> We bought this dryer for trips to visit our son. It works very well, and takes up little space in a suitcase or drawer.</li>
    <li> Received this blow dryer plug it in and it went &amp;#34;POP&amp;#34; . Didn&#x27;t even work for one minute before blew up. Very disappointed but now I have to send it back what a pain in the back end. Not happy !</li>
    <li> dried my very thick hair, pretty much got exactly what i expected. Wonderful for the price, and it&#x27;s nice and compact.</li>
    <li> works well, I use it for drying paintings, so dont need bells and whistles. I like the small size.</li>
    <li> After 6 month of use in an airbnb, this dryer has proven to be a best value (5/15)</li>
    <li> Smaller blow dryer however is powerful. Great blow-dryer for the price!</li>
    <li> An extra one for the guest room.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> A great deal for the price, and it does the job well; however, the cord is just a bit too short for my comfort.  I find that I have to stand just a little too close to an electrical outlet for maximum arm mobility as I use this dryer.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good value and I do recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Powerful little blow dryer.  No fuss, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s blow dryer died recenty, as they are want to do and I ordered this one as a replacement. It remains to be seen how long it will last but she likes everything about it so far.</li>
    <li> light weight but plent of power</li>
    <li> Christmas gift - recipient says works well.</li>
    <li> Lots of power for heat and &amp;#34;cool burst&amp;#34; which you can use longer than just a burst.</li>
    <li> An excellent dryer, much better than expected for its cost.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> GREAT hair dryer.  I purchased this same hair dryer several years ago and absolutely LOVE it.  I wanted a second one to keep at our recently purchased beach house, but could not find it in retail stores.  I was thrilled to see that I could get this online!  Now, I have it; and It works just as well as the one I use at home.  Small, light weight, and the best feature--it dries my long, thick, straight hair fast!  Great little hair dryer!  Does the job with no frills!</li>
    <li> It keeps turning off while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> works well for a cheap no frills dryer.</li>
    <li> Not a great hair dryer. It does get very hot, but the force of the air is not enough to dry my hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> This Turbo Dryer and I do mean (TURBO) is very powerful and excellent quality.  I liked it so well I bought a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Value,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry</li>
    <li> great hairdryer  I only buy these works longer and has more air flow then other models id recpmend this hair dryer</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Conair that had stopped working after about three years. I did not want to spend a lot of money since I was buying a hair dryer sight unseen. It is very light weight, but almost blows too strongly for the way I style my hair in the morning. There are only two settings – low and high. The low is very weak and the high blows so strongly that more hair blows around than just what I have on my round brush when I am working on a specific area of my head. The cord is also shorter than my old dryer and I have to work in a more confined area of the mirror in my bathroom. Overall it’s a good value but I might go to Sally Beauty and look at dryers to select one with more settings.</li>
    <li> so i had the larger version of this item from over 10 years ago, prob more like 15 years so i wanted something by the same company and if not the exact same. ::fingers crossed:: that when i received the item it was the same. so...it was...just way smaller. i was nervous, but decided to give it a try to see the power from the little guy...and success!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they managed to keep the item simplistic...high/low, on/off and cold. the nice feature on this one is you can take a part of the head off to clean...i haven&#x27;t figured out how and honestly not something that was on my old one so not sure how often it will require it...but a good option. like the old version, it&#x27;s SUPER light and one of my absolute favorite features!! so man other hair dryers are heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;final, and the main test was the power. for being small this little guy drys well!! i&#x27;m excited cause it&#x27;s got the power and a perfect size for traveling! 5 stars all the way, now hopefully it will last another 15 years like the last one. oh yea and for the price of $13 when hair dryers at target are twice that how could you go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. i added a photo of the size so you can see...next to the standard  scientific notebook. :)</li>
    <li> This is not a dryer I&#x27;d use every day - it&#x27;s loud and runs a little hot, but it&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting it in the guest bath where it will get occasional use and for the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> This is actually a replacement dryer.  I had the same unit and left it at the gym. It grew legs and walked away.  I like the blow dryer because it&#x27;s very light weight. I have a lot of hair that takes forever to dry.  The dryers at the gym are too heavy.  For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the cottage  and haven&#x27;t used it yet.For the price and the brand name you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I have one of these that finally died and I bought this replacement.  It is great and I received it quickly!</li>
    <li> This Vidal Sassoon 5524, 1875 watt hair dryer in black is small enough to travel with, but has very good drying power! Love that it has 2 speeds: low &amp; high with a power boost button that shoots cooler air.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this for a quick hairstyle change The hair sylist showed me and I ordered this works perfect - Last time i used one was 10 years ago</li>
    <li> This dryer has great power for the money.  The only drawback is that the cord is too short.  You can&#x27;t move away from the outlet at all without the cord pulling out.  That is a real negative for me as I like to bend over to dry the back of my hair and am limited to a small space.  I am looking for another dryer with an adequate length cord.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has cut my drying time quite a bit.  I have thick hair and would spend quite a bit of time drying it before.  Love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Got it for my girlfriend so that&#x27;s one less thing she has to pack up when she stays the night. It works :-)</li>
    <li> not bad, works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Small and strong but too hot and the cord is too short</li>
    <li> Simple, and I think that&#x27;s why I like it so much.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and easy for traveling but I thought it would put out more heat. But I will not complain it was a great price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very light for such a powerful hair dryer.  The power is great.  Love the &#x27;cool&#x27; button.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. The only problem I have with it is that it is a bit loud, but dries my hair quickly. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Definitely works well for the price I payed. I would recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting chilly and I like being able to dry my hair. It arrived as expected and looks as depicted in the advertisement.</li>
    <li> I have had this same model for 5 - 6 years and it has worked very well until a few months ago the switch worked intermittently, so I got a new  one. My hair is getting thinner as I age and I only use the low heat setting so it may not b e the best if one has a lot of hair. It is lite in weight and very good for simple hair drying.  I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Schlegel</li>
    <li> Lasted 1 year 4 months.</li>
    <li> lightweight and powerful</li>
    <li> Bought this for the lady to replace an identical unit that was many years old... she wanted nothing else other than this exact model!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer at any price.  It was so good I bought a second one for my wife.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, and in excellent condition.  She absolutely loves it and has thanked me over and over for it!  Makes a great gift, or a new one for yourself...highly recommended!</li>
