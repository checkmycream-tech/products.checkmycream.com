      <li>Now the process begins to see how it works but from all the rave, i&#x27;m sure it will be just what the Dr. ordered...  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The ingredients indicate it is mostly alcohol and it is very watery.</li>
      <li>It faded fairly quickly and then I realized what had happened.</li>
      <li>It has a mild burn/tingle when applied to the skin, and from what I have read can improve blood circulation to the applied area.</li>

      <li>I still have from the first bottle,but just in case I wanted to stock up!</li>
      <li>but this is the only thing I&#x27;m putting in my hair twice a day along with some hair pills that I bought on Amazon which Are amazing, and I also wrote a review for that, my very first two reviews for the first time!</li>
      <li>About 2 months ago i started to search for natural hair products to better the dryness in my hair and by a GOD</li>
      <li>my daughter was born, about 3 months later I started loosing my hair abundantly.  </li>
      <li>just gets a bit warm for a short period of time.</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this product to have an oily consistent but is just cinnamon scented water and no oil at all.</li>
      <li>First time I did this</li>
      <li>I do believe in the increased blood flow, but not sure what else this is good for.</li>
      <li>it made my hair strong enough again.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY DINT SEE ANY DIFFRENCE</li>
      <li>I do notice I don&#x27;t itch as much.</li>
      <li>My pixie cut has grown so much is Bizzarre, because my hair grows out real  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>and she bought me this product i cannot begin to tell you how fast my hair started to grow</li>
      <li>It really works..</li>
      <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t burn so much</li>
      <li>But I was really hoping this would help.</li>
      <li>, it kept growing bigger and bigger and quite honestly i didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
      <li>Little over a year ago i noticed i had a bald spot on the top of my hair</li>
      <li>I have new growth on the bald spot and in areas where hair had been thinning out.</li>
      <li>The products were brand new with plastic seal caps.</li>
      <li>About 6 years ago I was drying my hair and found a small, quarter size bald spot on the side of my head under the top layer of hair (You couldn&#x27;t see unless I flipped my hair).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it for 2 weeks so far.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed much growth and I will be ordering actual cinnamon oil instead.</li>
      <li>I also applied it to my thin eyebrows and now they too are growing in nicely, where they werent before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m out of the weave cap but wearing a style that covers the affected area until the new growth gets long and thick enough to blend with the healthy locks.</li>
      <li>I have been using Cinnamon Essential Oil (put directly in my shampoo) for almost a year now</li>
      <li>and my hair is much thicker and my hairline is back to where it was long ago!  </li>
      <li>Be careful though if you do try this because if you put too much in and its not mixed up very well you could end up with red lines down your face for a little while haha.  </li>

<li> Only to find out I had another dime size bald spot on the other side.</li>
<li> And today is January 29, 2015, i&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully every single day one in the morning, and one at night.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize what it was and had a red streak down the side of my face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s alcohol and not much else.</li>
<li> no oil as expected, based on the product name.</li>
<li> I use it once every other day and product seems to work</li>
<li> I could not use it on my hair due to the smell.</li>

<li> However due to the reviews I found, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with what I&#x27;ve been doing because I have seen results.  </li>
<li> , i combined this with also drinking to capsuls a day of biotin 5,000mg which means i was taking 10,000mg a day in little over a week my hair started to grow.</li>
<li> Please buy and if you can get your hands on biotin then you&#x27;ll see a difference in a few days.</li>
<li> This stuff burns my edges pretty bad, but any where else I put it on it</li>
<li> and a small drop is all you need.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works for genetic balding, but in my case, both my stylist and I can see the difference from March to July.</li>
<li> This product was a complete disappointment.</li>
<li> The bottle is so small.</li>
<li> grows hair!mind you that you have to wash this product out of your hair at least once a week..</li>
<li> slow!</li>
<li> I have not experienced any growth in the spots that are thin.</li>
<li> I thought there was something terribly wrong.  </li>
<li> Hair loss in women is sad and very frustrating</li>
<li> but my hair was either bald or very thin at the crown</li>
<li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> It had the worst chemical smell imaginable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only purchase this product on the reviews that it will grow back thinning or balding...it doesn&#x27;t work and I stopped using but will finish and never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought espiritu de canela in a beauty supply by my house! I didn&#x27;t purchase it here! But I needed to write a review, and I don&#x27;t write reviews! But this product is so amazing!! I cut my hair in a pixie cut on December 30, 2014. And today is January 29, 2015, i&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully every single day one in the morning, and one at night. I massage my scalp very often throughout the day and it&#x27;s been working absolutely amazing!!!!  My pixie cut has grown so much is Bizzarre, because my hair grows out real  slow! I Cannot recommend this product enough is absolutely amazing!!!  And it really doesn&#x27;t burn so much I love it I already bought a second bottle! I still have from the first bottle,but just in case I wanted to stock up! I am doing other hair regiments,  as well but this is the only thing I&#x27;m putting in my hair twice a day along with some hair pills that I bought on Amazon which Are amazing, and I also wrote a review for that, my very first two reviews for the first time! You must try!!! I will update in the end of February again!</li>
    <li> The seller ships in a flash, said the product would arrive btwn the 6 &amp; 9 of December but I received it on the 5th. The products were brand new with plastic seal caps. Now the process begins to see how it works but from all the rave, i&#x27;m sure it will be just what the Dr. ordered...  Thank you so much</li>
    <li> It worked for me.  I was loosing hair and it helped me regrow it, plus it stopped the itching I was having all the time.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of this product and it stopped my itchy scalp. I can&#x27;t say if it made my hair grow or not.  There is a bald spot on my head that looks as though there is more hair there now. I bought this to help my hair grow but this solved another problem. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was told by my barber to get this product to treat hair loss. Had bald spots.. I use it once every other day and product seems to work</li>
    <li> Cuando di a luz mi hija, a los 3 meses comenc&amp;eacute; a perder mi cabello en cantidades alarmantes.  Compr&amp;eacute; este producto y lo us&amp;eacute; una vez por semana unas 3 &amp;oacute; 4 veces y se detuvo la ca&amp;iacute;da.  S&amp;oacute;lo un consejo:  Recomiendo no usar por m&amp;aacute;s de una hora pues la &amp;uacute;ltima vez que lo apliqu&amp;eacute; me entretuve haciendo otras cosas y estuve mucho m&amp;aacute;s tiempo del requerido y se me hicieron como peque&amp;ntilde;as quemaduras en el cuero cabelludo.  Recomiendo un 100% este producto para restaurar el cabello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my daughter was born, about 3 months later I started loosing my hair abundantly.  I bought Esp&amp;iacute;ritu de Canela and using it once/week for about 3 weeks it made my hair strong enough again.  My advice:  Don&#x27;t use it for more than one hour.  I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> About 6 years ago I was drying my hair and found a small, quarter size bald spot on the side of my head under the top layer of hair (You couldn&#x27;t see unless I flipped my hair). This spot kept growing and growing till it was big enough for me to seek medical help. After finding out i had alopecia areata and getting cortizone shots for about 6 month my hair finally grew back. Only to find out I had another dime size bald spot on the other side. I couldn&#x27;t take the pain of the shots any longer so that was not an option. About 2 months ago i started to search for natural hair products to better the dryness in my hair and by a GOD sent miracle I came across this product \\&quot;Espiritu de Canela\\&quot;. I cannot tell you how happy I am! I have new growth on the bald spot and in areas where hair had been thinning out. Its like a fairy came and just dropped hair on my head. I also applied it to my thin eyebrows and now they too are growing in nicely, where they werent before. THANK GOD for this miracle and Dr Collado&#x27;s \\&quot;Espiritu de canela\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Smelled like cinnamon but did not stimulate the scalp like others I have tried.  It&#x27;s alcohol and not much else.</li>
    <li> I have not experienced any growth in the spots that are thin. I have not noticed any difference. I do notice I don&#x27;t itch as much. But I was really hoping this would help. I lost a lot of hair after 3 heart surgeries. I figured it had to be the meds they gave me while i was in the hospital. This stuff burns my edges pretty bad, but any where else I put it on it just gets a bit warm for a short period of time. But still not seeing any improvement. I see it works for a lot of people and seeing that I paid for it I will be using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete disappointment. I could not use it on my hair due to the smell. It had the worst chemical smell imaginable. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> grows hair!mind you that you have to wash this product out of your hair at least once a week..just letting you know</li>
    <li> I was expecting this product to have an oily consistent but is just cinnamon scented water and no oil at all.</li>
    <li> Little over a year ago i noticed i had a bald spot on the top of my hair, it kept growing bigger and bigger and quite honestly i didn&#x27;t know what to do. My aunt is&lt;br /&gt;a hair stylest and she bought me this product i cannot begin to tell you how fast my hair started to grow, i combined this with also drinking to capsuls a day of biotin 5,000mg which means i was taking 10,000mg a day in little over a week my hair started to grow. Please buy and if you can get your hands on biotin then you&#x27;ll see a difference in a few days.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by one of my friend. it has a great cinnamon smell. and a small drop is all you need. thank you.</li>
    <li> It really works.. But burns for minute</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last year. It helps with hair loss and bold spots.</li>
    <li> Wonderful service. Smells great. Could feel the oil penetrating my scalp. Easy to apply. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I REALLY DINT SEE ANY DIFFRENCE I JUST DONT KNOW...MB I WILL TRY AGAIN AND LET YOU ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENDS....</li>
    <li> I was told that this product works for thinning hair. This is not oil. The ingredients indicate it is mostly alcohol and it is very watery. I have not noticed much growth and I will be ordering actual cinnamon oil instead.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews which stated people saw improvements using this for symptoms of alopecia areata. While I&#x27;m happy for their results, I have not seen any improvement in my bald spot from alopecia. I&#x27;ve been applying it for 2 weeks so far. It has a mild burn/tingle when applied to the skin, and from what I have read can improve blood circulation to the applied area. I do believe in the increased blood flow, but not sure what else this is good for. It does smell nice if you like cinnamon.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  It simply felt like just cinnamon and water; no oil as expected, based on the product name.</li>
    <li> I went on here to look at the reviews of this product to see if this was yet another option for me in addition to what I&#x27;m using now.  However due to the reviews I found, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with what I&#x27;ve been doing because I have seen results.  I have been using Cinnamon Essential Oil (put directly in my shampoo) for almost a year now and my hair is much thicker and my hairline is back to where it was long ago!  Be careful though if you do try this because if you put too much in and its not mixed up very well you could end up with red lines down your face for a little while haha.  First time I did this I didn&#x27;t realize what it was and had a red streak down the side of my face. I thought there was something terribly wrong.  It faded fairly quickly and then I realized what had happened. You&#x27;ll have to be somewhat patient though because it does take time to notice a difference. Hope this helps someone that maybe didn&#x27;t have luck with this product.  Hair loss in women is sad and very frustrating I know.</li>
    <li> The product is good. The bottle is so small. I should have order a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazaon.com in March 2012 and have seen good results. This oil treatment works for hair that was damaged from perms or as a result of stress related thinning. I have locks but my hair was either bald or very thin at the crown so I used a weave cap to supplement as a filler. Over a period of four months, I now have growth in the bald areas and my hair is getting thicker in that area as well. I use a toothbrush to rub/massage 1/4 capful on the affected areas twice a day. I also use a good hydrating shampoo once-a-week. I&#x27;m out of the weave cap but wearing a style that covers the affected area until the new growth gets long and thick enough to blend with the healthy locks. I will post again in 4-5 months to report whether I continue to see results. I&#x27;m not sure if this product works for genetic balding, but in my case, both my stylist and I can see the difference from March to July.</li>
    <li> Great product! It tingles a bit when you apply it. But has given me great results!</li>
