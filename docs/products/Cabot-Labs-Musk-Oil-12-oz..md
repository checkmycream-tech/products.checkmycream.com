      <li>They even enclosed a sample of the body lotion, also smells amazing...</li>
      <li>Yes,when you smell it from the bottle there&#x27;s no noticeable scent,but when on your skin your own body chemistry mixes with the oil and emits a soft,sensual,Clean,scent.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy some of my own</li>
      <li>Contacted the seller and they contacted the distributor who said to warm it up to restore fragrance.</li>
      <li>most were good</li>
      <li>Honestly, this has no smell.  </li>

      <li>True story !!</li>
      <li>It is not as good as the original musk oil by Cabot Labs.</li>
      <li>Despite some of the good reviews this is not the original musk.</li>
      <li>I have looked all over for this great musk oil that smells exactly as I remembered it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So while this is not as strong as I like it does smell nice and will do for now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best musk on the market.  Soft and romantic, not overbearing.  My favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this product because of several negative reviews.I am in search of a Musk Oil made in the 70&#x27;s called Satana Musk Oil(worn by most of us 70&#x27;s gals),not able to find it,I decided to give this one a try.I&#x27;m glad I did.Yes,when you smell it from the bottle there&#x27;s no noticeable scent,but when on your skin your own body chemistry mixes with the oil and emits a soft,sensual,Clean,scent.Others will notice it,even if you don&#x27;t smell it.I&#x27;ve given up wearing perfumes that are recently being sold, they always seem to be too strong on me.I love the delicate,but clean sensuous scent of Cabot Lab Musk Oil,and will continue to order it.I hope it never disappears like my beloved Satana Musk Oil.Give this one a try,I suggest wearing it for a week,I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this musk and appreciate that I can get it and get it easily. Thanks for the prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> This may be called Musk Oil, but there is almost zero aroma, and it is NOTHING, nothing like the original Dana Musk Oil, or any of the other musk oils released in the 1970s.  Do not waste your time on this one.  If you have the cash, visit the Near Orient and get the real thing.</li>
    <li> zero scent, three days later, a complete rip off!  and I am too busy to hassle with sending it back, don&#x27;t fall for this!  I read the bad reviews and opted to buy it anyway based on the good reviews?  Desperate to find the musk oil from the 70&#x27;s, thinking this place was legitimate...nope, burned..</li>
    <li> Love the scent.    I remember this when I was younger and lots of girls were wearing it.    The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful, clean smelling, healthy scent out there. I could bathe in it...if that were economically feasible. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that the scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last. If they made it a bit stronger, wow---it would sell like hotcakes. Another dreamy musk scent that is worth its weight in gold is Egyptian Musk Oil by Abdul Kareem. Must try this one too!</li>
    <li> I bought this Product afew years ago and I liked the smell...but this Order does not have a smell at all to me and I&#x27;m very disappointed.Wasted Money! It&#x27;s just a bottle of Oil.</li>
    <li> My Aunt has been dying for someone to get her a bottle of this oil, and she was very happy with it!She has had so many bottles before now, and there was not one complaint from her.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, the fragrance does not last not even  1 hour. I used musk oil for many years and its fragance lasted for 3-5 hours or even more, but this one did not. Could it be the Brand?</li>
    <li> after reading many reviews of this stuff I figured I had to try it but I do believe you either can or can&#x27;t smell musk!</li>
    <li> I love this oil but the last few times I ordered it the smell seems to have gone, almost like it had been diluted.  I can hardly smell it when I put it on. :(</li>
    <li> nice and light.  I wear it every day.  I will order more for backup.  My sister recommended this perfume. One of my favorites</li>
    <li> I just researched and its not worth buying this. It is a dried secretion painfully obtained from musk deer, beaver, muskrat, civet cat, and otter genitals. Wild cats are kept captive in cages in horrible conditions and are whipped around the genitals to produce the scent; beavers are trapped; deer are shot. Other alternatives are: labdanum oil (from various rockrose shrubs) and extracts from other plants with a musky scent. Please find out more about musk before buying.</li>
    <li> Opened it and no scent... Put some on, no scent..then about an hour later I could smell myself and I smelled yummy and sexy..;-) There is another brand I was looking for but it is almost impossible to find that smells very musky like from the 60/70&#x27;s and now I cannot find it. I had a small bottle of it and one of my sons girlfriend stole it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this is not as strong as I like it does smell nice and will do for now. I just cannot give it 5 stars because it is not the original musk scent they claim it to be.. However, it does smell nice, just very faint so have to use a lot more...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20yrs. It&#x27;s still the same. People will stop you out of nowhere to say what are you wearing? It&#x27;s Deelish fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon and one of my favorites is Egyptian musk but I decided to try this since I fell In love with the scent and didn&#x27;t know which brand to buy. Well I was so excited to receive this when it came and when I put it on it literally only stayed on my skin for a total of 3 seconds. Huge rip off since they charge so much for a small bottle. I&#x27;m returning it ASAP!</li>
    <li> my musk oil just arrived and I was so happy because the bottle I had was almost gone- when I opened the new bottle I almost cried. It smells like burning rubber bands and not like musk at all. It&#x27;s gross!!</li>
    <li> This item is not what I expected.  Very watered down and has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping it would be better quality.</li>
    <li> Very bad, the scent was lost with the shipping?</li>
    <li> I was really disapointed in this product.  There is barely a scent in the bottle or on pulse points when applied.  I will be waiting to see if anyone tells me I smell good since I can not really smell much fragrance at all.</li>
    <li> Oil always goes directly on the skin. I know that. I have tried this musk oil several times and am not happy with the scent. I was a happy user of Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk until they changed the formula and now it sucks. Bought hoping to find another musk scent to enjoy. And NO I was not looking for Wild Musk - I&#x27;ve accepted this is gone for good. My husband told me this smelled like old hamburger. Not good. Overall the scent is weak, gone quickly and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> amozon take this crap off of amozon !!!! so so so disappointing, dont last , more than about 10mins!! dont know what they did to it, not the same ,smells the same ,, its like water and I bought  it listening to other reviews  . most were good but i never by if there were so many negative ones !!  again SSOOOOOOOOOO disappointing</li>
    <li> Oil smells nice, n it was delivered in time. ..</li>
    <li> I have actually been looking for this product for a few years now. I knew Cabot Labs made it, but couldn&#x27;t find it. My mom absolutely loved this product, although she settled for imitation perfume it wasn&#x27;t the same. So, when I cam across this product on Amazon, I was truly impressed. I would reccommend this to anyone. THANKS AMAZON!</li>
    <li> This is all I&#x27;ve ever known my Mom wearing. Its light and lasted all day. Its hard to find it around where I live, so I purchased it on here.</li>
    <li> Musk oil    I have already sent in a review on this item.    Will never order it again unless they reformulate it.  It was a waste of money because I&#x27;m still trying to  find the fragrance that is supposed to be in it.  Also ordered the Vanille Molinard and the fragrance was gone  before I walked out of the bathroom.    How will I ever find a nice elderly man at this rate?</li>
    <li> After 20 years I ordered this product.  It is just as I remembered. A clean  delightful scent.  Put on pulse points for best results.</li>
    <li> I smelled the aroma of fresh hogwash. I am going to take this to Consumer affairs. And we&#x27;ll see if this person will be on here selling kitchen oil to make money I am surprised Amazon hasn&#x27;t put this account on redflag alert. I suggest to everyone to report this person to Amazon. If this is not resolved, contact your local bbb.org and file a complaint. This way whenever future complaints arises in stuff like this we won&#x27;t get ripped off. I purchased three other oils from Egypt lets see how those smell...Hopefully not like whipped virgin crotch like the other person suggested.</li>
    <li> it used to be great it was the best musk oil and people MEN loved it but the last 5 bottles i have bought have no smell at all some say heat it up but the others i bought 10 yrs ago i did not have to and the bottle kept the smell i would order 10 bottles at a time.i do not know what has happened to it</li>
    <li> Many of the positive reviews are misleading. The fragrance is very light and does not last. It requires quite a bit the oil to get a whiff. Nothing like the original product we had in the 1970&#x27;s...guess it is gone forever!</li>
    <li> Loved the fragrance however it doesn&#x27;t last. I was hoping to find theism I used to wear in the 70&#x27;s and I read the other comments about this product. Unfortunately it loses it&#x27;s fragrance too soon.</li>
    <li> I love Musk Oil and was excited to receive this product despite mixed reviews.  I was not impressed.  The top notes aren&#x27;t there and neither are the bottom notes.  It has a faint smell at first and it is gone within seconds after applying.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This musk oil was not what I was expecting when I ordered it however it does smell good and I combine other oils with it.</li>
    <li> I!m in my 50&#x27;s bought this to relive the smell of the 70&#x27;s and I think it&#x27;s not quite like I remember</li>
    <li> This musk has no scent.  Do not buy, you will be disappointed.  I have been wearing musk for 35 years..don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;you might not smell it on yourself but others will smell it on you&amp;#34; nonsense...you should be able to smell from the bottle!  I bought 2 bottles but returned both of them.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have bought Cabot Labs Musk Oil at high end stores. Sometimes you get a weak batch. Not this time! It smells just wonderful and the price was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have ever worn! I have been using it for over 30 years and have always had people stop me (even follow me out to my car) to find out what I am wearing. It really doesn&#x27;t have an odor in the bottle and you can&#x27;t smell it on yourself but others can. I am always told that I smell fresh and clean. MEN LOVE IT! My grandmother used to give this to all granddaughters and we had to search long and hard to find it after she passed away. We ALL still use it. West Cabot Cosmetics is the manufacturer but it is now distributed by Cooperlabs. Very sensual yet inexpensive. chambet</li>
    <li> This product used to be the best! It just isn&#x27;t the same since the FDA banned one of it&#x27;s ingredients.(a company rep told me this when I complained to them about the lack of scent)  I&#x27;m in search of a new musk because I miss it!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells however, the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me.  Apparently my chemistry absorbs the aroma so it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me, at all.</li>
    <li> I love musks.  I live in the perpetual search for the most beautiful musk oil.  I own more that 12 different musks.  This one is on the light side.  It smells like a fresh powder on me.  After about one hour it is a little more dusky. And then it fades away completely.  I have found that on my skin it works best when I mix it with a carrier oil like jojoba.  Something happens to the scent. It expands and deepens.  My only complaint is that it fades quickly.  I have also mixed the oil with some of my own fragrances and it mixes well and can \\&quot;musk up\\&quot; another fragrance if the mixer frag is selected well.    With this musk people either love it or are ambivalent.  No one hates this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have recamended this perfume to many friends and several have purchased it&lt;br /&gt;I have been happy with this product for many years</li>
    <li> I used to use Coty Musk Oil but since it is no longer available I tried the Original Musk and loved it.  I have smelled other Musks but didn&#x27;t like the fragrence.  This is the first Musk since Coty that I liked.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and fast on shipping. I  am pleased with the product and look forward to my next order when I get ready to order.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to smell within a few minutes however I get complements everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best musk. I never fail to get a compliment each time I wear this! It is subtle, not brash.</li>
    <li> It was good but the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong. The scent was too faint and I could not smell it very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of musk oil for years.  It smells great, but is not overwhelming. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have loved Cabot Musk Oil since 1971. Great stuff...it seems where ever I go people know ahead of time and love the smell on me.</li>
    <li> Not the same fragrance. Barely any fragrance at all. Contacted the seller and they contacted the distributor who said to warm it up to restore fragrance. No difference. It has to be that the formulation has changed. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> All this is just plain oil in a bottle. Do not order this product. I asked everyone in my office if they can smell it. All of them said no.</li>
    <li> Dont waste the time or money..its not the same as back in the day, and its a shame...they now give musk a bad name..time to retire it if we cant get it...</li>
    <li> It is exactly like it was many years ago when my mother used to wear it. I still have a bottle from about 13 years ago that still smells just as strong as the new.</li>
    <li> it had NO scent at all! Original? NOT what I remember! VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> When I first got this and opened it It had a nice smell, a few days later I couldn&#x27;t not smell it at all. I&#x27;ve put the bottle in direct sunlight and still nothing.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, not the small amount of money I spent but not to have the original fragrance I expected from that 70&#x27;s era. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I called the company and they are well aware of this reoccurring complaint from their customers.  They should really stop making it if they can&#x27;t capture the strength this product once had.</li>
    <li> It has a subtle yet very pleasant aroma that boost my confidence every time I wear it. Been having a lot of compliments :)</li>
    <li> My grandma has worn this perfume since I was a little girl and I&#x27;ve always loved the smell. I decided to buy some of my own and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It has a light smell that mixes with each person&#x27;s pheromones to created a slightly different smell on each person. I like that it isn&#x27;t overpowering. Some perfumes give me migraines because they&#x27;re so strong. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> There was absolutely no scent to this, went right into the trash.  One of the few times I didn&#x27;t check ratings, learned.</li>
    <li> Has no fragrance at all, seems to be old stock and no longer is what I remember it was.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;Throwback&amp;#34; scent for the women in my family...  We used to be able to get it locally, and 1 day it was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found it on amazon!..  We are ALL wearing it again...  The scent lingers in your clothes even after you wash them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a delicious scent!</li>
    <li> I wanted the original musk oil so bad that I tried it despite the few negative reviews.  I should have listened to them.  There is no scent in the bottle. I wore it to work today and asked many people if they could smell it on me.  None of them could smell a thing. I tried it on them just to see if it was my body chemistry.  No one could smell anything on anyone.   I am so disappointed, not to mention out $15.00 including the shipping. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Despite some of the good reviews this is not the original musk.</li>
    <li> Most fragrances are too powerful so I wanted to go back to something sensuous that would remind me of the fragrances of the &#x27;70s. Men don&#x27;t really like perfumed women anyway, so I bought this particular Musk Oil hoping the smell of it would teasingly linger on my warm skin. Unfortunately, the smell of it is so faint, even in the little bottle, when applied to the skin, there is no smell at all. I would not ever recommend this to anyone. I will try to get a refund from the Cabot Labs but in the meantime, I bought Jovan Musk Oil and am very pleased with the scent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!I don&#x27;t know who writes the positive reviews for this product.If you buy it, it&#x27;s like throwing away money.The smell is very faint (i can&#x27;t barely smell it) and it doeen&#x27;t smell like the musck smell I knew.It smells terrible.I could sent it back, but I payed 4$ for shipping, if I return it I will have to pay another 4$ and it doesn&#x27;t worth it.Now I wish that I would believe the negative reviews and did&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect musk: subtle and soft.  This musk is very feminine and has become my signature scent especially daytime.  Shh...if you buy this it must remain your secret.</li>
    <li> perfect as always  love it</li>
    <li> Love this Musk Oil, hope the continue to sell this item.</li>
    <li> I have used Cabot&#x27;s musk oil for 35 years.  I just love it!!  When I buy it, I order at least 10 at a time.</li>
    <li> Product&#x27;s fragrance is weakened since my last purchase a number of years ago. Although the smell is still pleasant it seems diluted and not a long lasting as in the past. Had my sister who also has used Cabot in the past verify my assessment. Perhaps this equates to the larger bottlle!</li>
    <li> II am very disappointed in this purchase. I have been using this product for years, it was once a wonderful product. It barely has an odor to it  and wears off within an hour. The beauty of this product is that  the essensece would linger for the entire day or more, and everyone always made a comment on what a beautiful fresh  scent I had. My husband said he could notice very little scent. What in God&#x27;s name did you do to this product? It is sorely obvious the formula was changed , or this is counterfeit, really unhappy with this purchase, and will not buy again. the old adage, if it aint broke dont fix it would certainly apply here.</li>
    <li> To all of the musk triers who say there is no scent, you are wrong.  I too ordered some and thought there was no scent.  I put the bottle in my bathroom window with my other bottles.  It gets sun there.  Next time I opened the Musk bottle it was the most fragrant I had ever smelled!  The trick is in the heat!  If your body temperature tends to run cold, this may not be the product for you.  But if you are hot, watch out!  Try leaving it in a warm or sunny place, you will be amazed!  So will everyone around you!</li>
    <li> I love this product the smell is so clean refreshing</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be musk oil but smell more like a chemistry lab.  I tried to give it away.  Zeno luck.  A threw it out.  The only great musk oil is Coty which is no longer manufactured.</li>
    <li> My gal loves this!  we watch the Internet for deals and Amazon always has the best prices. This is the best brand out there.</li>
    <li> I have loved musk oil since the 60ties.  When I wear it I get so many people ask what I am wearing.  Love it</li>
    <li> i found a bottle of this stuff in my grandmothers house, so it must have been over fifty years old.  It still smelled great.  I ended up using the entire bottle and wanted to purchase another.  The scent is clean, and you can dab it wherever.  It is very subtle but when your body warms up, the scent becomes stronger.  Smells clean and fresh, and I love the retro mini bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Cabot Musk Oil for many years now.  I love the fragrance and the fact I can smell it on me most of the day.  People&lt;br /&gt;stop me and tell me I smell so good.  I&#x27;m ordering more now..</li>
    <li> My friend wears this and I asked if I can get the name and where she got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Musk since a young age. And my supplier for the Egyptian Musk I wore, is no longer available so I needed to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an everyday scent that compliments my warm body.  I think that&#x27;s why it smells so good on me and compliments are frequent.. Few dabs on neck pulse points lasts all day!!! mix it up with a lil Patchouli and it&#x27;s even more enjoyable..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This musk is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of those that say this musk oil has &amp;#34;no scent&amp;#34; and is &amp;#34;just mineral oil.&amp;#34;  Well, I&#x27;m 52 years old and my sister and I LOVE musk oil...but ONLY this one, and have been wearing it as long as it&#x27;s been available.  This is the key:  the thing about musk oil, and what most of us appreciate about it, is that it is NOT a heavy scent, and when you wear it you yourself WON&#x27;T notice it, especially after using it for a while.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean others don&#x27;t!  It&#x27;s a natural scent that works with your body&#x27;s chemistry and, yes, heat.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times people (and seriously, mostly men) have come up to me and asked what I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so incredibly good, yet natural and sexy....and without fail I say, &amp;#34;Really? I can&#x27;t even smell myself! But thank you, it&#x27;s musk oil!&amp;#34;  And to me, THAT&#x27;S the mark of a great scent...not something that knocks people over the minute you walk in the room or causes others to pass out who have the misfortune to be in an elevator with you.  Trust me, wear this stuff and you&#x27;ll get noticed.  It&#x27;s the only musk I ever wear.</li>
    <li> The BEST ever!!!! Wore it in high school in the 70&#x27;s and people still stop me and ask me where I got it and what it is!!!!!! BEST EVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> no better scent on the market. I love it and anyone that comes near me says .. Oh what are you wearing!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this Musk oil for years from Cooper Labs, and I can truely say it WAS the original musk oil from the 70&#x27;s and I Loved it!  Amazon sells the same Musk which they get from Cooper labs!  I ordered about a month ago from Cooper labs because I was running low on musk and I must say I was very angry because there is NO smell to this musk oil anymore!  The box has changed so I thought they sent me something different!  The bottle is still the same but the packaging is different! I called Cooper Labs and asked if they changed the formula in any way and they said they haven&#x27;t changed the formula in 17 years! Then they said that their warehouse is very cold and I should let the musk warm up in my house!  Did that STILL NO SMELL!  Then I ordered on Amazon, because the picture showed the Musk Oil(from Cooper Labs) in the original packaging(the Yellow box)so I took a chance and ordered from Amazon!  When it came in the mail it was in the new packaging( black box) STILL NO SMELL! Has anyone else had this problem?  Please post!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this perfume for me and there is no smell. It&#x27;s just oil. Do not gamble with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this musk oil for many years. I would not change to another musk oil.This musk oil has it&#x27;s own unique scent. I don&#x27;t think any other product could come close. I get so many compliments. Cabot labs, please continue to keep this musk oil on the market.                                 Thank You</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve used this musk oil for many years and love to use it in winter months will be ordering more tks</li>
    <li> Love this musk oil and happy to have found it again. Always get compliments. Great price. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used coty wild musk for years.This is the next best thing for me.Smells better as your skin heats up,like musk oil should.I will buy more! Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over thirty years. I used to purchase at a store so this online shopping is new to me! Musk was delivered on time and perfect.</li>
    <li> Still searching for my long-lost scent from back in the day.  Have ordered almost every musk on Amazon.  So far, this is the best of the bunch.  It has a hint of the old scent but it&#x27;s VERY weak.  Maybe if I reduce it...</li>
    <li> I love musk oil and after the good reviews I wanted to try this. Oh my goodness, absolutely zero scent. Nothing. Nothing in the bottle nothing on the skin. It is plain oil. What a total and complete ripoff of 10 bucks. To send it back would be another 5 bucks... to say the least I am disappointed and mad at myself for buying something I could not test beforehand or something that is a pain to return. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the negative complaints are.i got my wore that day and was asked what kind of cologne I&#x27;m wearing from a friend now he&#x27;s buying some ..smells great</li>
    <li> I have over 200 essential oils (and some synthetics)&lt;br /&gt;I am very familiar with musks from the 70&#x27;s, and 80&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I actually still have some great ones.&lt;br /&gt;70&#x27;s musk that I liked, had little top note, but bloomed into the sexiest semi-sweet scent that lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;THIS musk is NOT as described&lt;br /&gt;I was hopeful at first that it may bloom into something... but all I get is a subtle chemical smell&lt;br /&gt;I am also well aware that oils can be intensified by body heat</li>
    <li> The cool thing about this fragrance is that you forget you&#x27;re wearing it until someone follows you down the street to tell you, &amp;#34;you smell amazing!&amp;#34;  It happens all the time....men AND women.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. This oil smells different on everyone because It works with your own body chemistry, It is like having your own signature scent. I always receive compliments.</li>
    <li> As stated above ,on a man or woman it simply iWorks with your body chemistry and smells different on the person  using it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I normally order from Cabot Labs directly. This Musk Oil seemed &#x27;diluted&#x27; and not as full-scented as the Musk from Cabot&#x27;s. I was disappointed will not order again unless it is directly from Cabot Labs.</li>
    <li> Had no scent what so ever</li>
    <li> Strange, but in a cool way... I can&#x27;t smell it on myself, but other people can and I get loads of compliments from men and women. Winter is just ending here in New York, so I expect lots more compliments when the summer is in full swing. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you can&#x27;t smell it. Trust me. If you have a pulse, it has a scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obvious to me that the formula has been changed.  It&#x27;s smells like chemicals - just a hint of musk.  I will never buy this product again.  I even threw it away as I wouldn&#x27;t want to return it and it goes out to another customer.  And for the record, I LOVE Musk and now have to hunt again for another type. Very displeased.</li>
    <li> My mom was so excited to recieve her favorite oil...only to get 3 of them with absolutly no smell...we opened all 3 and not one of them had a smell..and to top it off i cant even return them for her...so out the cash with smelless musk oil!!! thanks alot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Cabot&#x27;s manufactures great musk oil but I hate to say that I&#x27;m disappointed and surprised about that fact. I smelled the oil and could barely smell anything. Very weak, smelled like a very small amount of the musk was mixed with clear oil, very diluted smelling, Maybe I got a bottle from a bad batch. I may try to purchase again though......</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent forever! This batch is all oil and no scent. Everyone I have contacted keeps passing me off to the next person simply stating....we havent had any problems. I wrote cabot and heard nothing. So much for Musk Oil....Im done forever. I guess wearing this scent for like 20 years doesnt matter to you????????</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for this great musk oil that smells exactly as I remembered it.  I was really excited to get it and thrilled that it was as good as it used to be.  It disappeared for years when the company went out, but relocated to California.  Thanks to amazon,,, I found it. I Get lots of &amp;#34;What are you wearing, it smells great&amp;#34;. Arrived in good packaging in perfect condition, this is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered.  They even enclosed a sample of the body lotion, also smells amazing...</li>
    <li> I admired my sister in laws scent she was wearing She had a small amount left in her bottle and gave it to me. I loved it and everyone complemented me. I bought the same exact musk oil and when I put it on it had no smell at all. It was like putting on just oil.. I was very disappointed but am wondering how my sister in laws smelled so good and mine had no odor at all.. I was told not to buy from the seller anymore. See others here had the same problem we probably all bought by the same seller. So beware.</li>
    <li> West Cabot musk oil has been my favorite scent since I first purchased it in the late 1970&#x27;s. For nostalgia sake, I held onto the last bottle I purchased (it was in an atomizer) many years ago, as it really never lost or changed its original scent. I tried searching for it a few years ago, but all web postings suggested that it had been discontinued. What a surprise to find it on Amazon. However, I truly was not expecting the original product when I placed the order and figured I would probably end up tossing it in the rubbish. I was in shock when I opened the bottle and found it to be the exact same scent I had longed for all these years. The scent of the oil is weaker than that of the product from 30+ years ago. But what a fabulous walk down memory land whenever I open the bottle. Thanks to who ever has revived this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for many years, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this musk oil! It is THE BEST!!!! Great Smell! Sounds Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;It is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;tRY IT NOW!</li>
    <li> I accepted the risk buying this despite the reviews of \\&quot;no scent&#x27; by some reviewers since Musk molecules sit at the edge of detection for the human nose due to the relatively massive size of the molecules, hence the reason that most synthetic perfumes - be they fine or functional, use a mixture of musks in the hope that customers can smell at least one musk note (even perfumers are not immune from this partial anosmia). In short because one customer doesn&#x27;t smell anything, it doesn&#x27;t mean that I wouldn&#x27;t. I am pleased to announce that I do indeed smell this musk, and it is pleasant - however, it is incredibly weak! Not that I wish to leave sillage the size of a tanker in my wake with fragrance, but I would at least like to enjoy it myself and the sub-par intensity is not explained by anosmia. BTW - isn&#x27;t a lab producing a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; musk oil a bit of an oxymoron. Natural musk is banned in the interest of preserving the animal which produces it, which is listed as endangered - courtesy the use of their musk glands in perfume for a couple thousand years. Wonder which chemical musk(s) this is?</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this perfume when I was a teenager by my best friend, and I&#x27;ve been hooked since. It smelled like glue in the bottle, but once I dabbed some on my skin, the scent was amazing!  I&#x27;m now a 40-something and Musk Oil is the only scent I can wear, and the only one I WILL wear. To the \\&quot;haters\\&quot; out there, you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!</li>
    <li> kept my sweetheart happy. easy to find. easy to order. fair price. the only problem is having to pay freight.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this wonderful product for 20 year&#x27;s or more! It&#x27;s just like I remember, thank you, thank you! !</li>
    <li> definitely not what i expected as it just is not the lasting fragrance i thought it would be.  Guess i will give up on the musk fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Had used it years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. So I checked Amazon and I found it. Saw some bad reviews and was skeptical about ordering it, but i did anyway. I&#x27;m completely happy that I did. The smell is so distinctive and when I can&#x27;t smell it on me, other people still can. And the order shipped on time. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my transaction.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who had a hard time finding it locally. She was very pleased, and said she would save it to wear only to church.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and put it on, thinking that it was a lovely, yet light musk oil.  Five minutes later I thought it (the scent) was gone, but I was wrong.  I was out and about, doing errands and was told by a few people that I smelled great, and they inquired what scent it was.  Still, I could not smell a thing, but they could.  Evidently, I am anosmic (unable to smell it) to this musk.  This may be a large molecule musk and some people may not be able to rsmell it on themselves, hence the anosmia (inability to smell it), but others can.  Regardless, I rarely get such compliments on any other fragrance, so even though I cannot smell it on myself, others do evidently enjoy it on me a lot, hence my 5-star rating.  If this review has been helpful to you, please click &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; below.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> IT DOESNOT SMELL ON ME LIKE THE OLD CABOT OIL, I USED TO USE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the old  &amp;#34;Village Musk Oil&amp;#34;.  Just don&#x27;t want everyone using it because people always say I &amp;#34;smell good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This musk is like no other....I have worn alot of different Musk for more than 35 years and this is my favorite. True, it is a little light smelling in the bottle,  place it on paulse area&#x27;s of your body.......as your day or night heats up so will this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Will never order it again.  Have loved it for years but alas this is not the same one I am used to purchasing.  It says Cabot labs but that is nowhere on the bottle or the box.  Counterfeit?  I think so.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume and it came in an open box and the liquid in the bottle has no odor!&lt;br /&gt; I do not even know what it is. I decided to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;This is really a disgrace...</li>
    <li> Not the musk I remember.  Still looking.  Does anyone know what I am talking about???  Is real musk in this oil???</li>
    <li> I have been using this musk oil for more than 30 years. This should tell you that I&#x27;m pleased with it and it suits my needs. If you expecting to smell it on yourself like some of the other oils or fragrance, then you are not going to want to purchase this. It works with your body chemistry and while other people may smell it on you, you may not be able to smell it. I have had many compliments from wearing this musk oil.&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you are expecting to smell it on yourself, &amp;#34;try using something else&amp;#34; !!!&lt;br /&gt;I will say, it appears that over the last few years, the smell has gotten a little faint, but I have gotten a little older.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this will help you in your decision as I always try to set the records straight by being honest and only reporting my observations when writing reviews.</li>
    <li> I had such hopes of finding the real Musk Oil when I saw this product...now I feel taken for its the worst quality of what it claims to be...if you don&#x27;t believe me &amp; enjoy that delightful musky sensual aroma...I suggest you waste your time &amp; money &amp; make a purchase that is basically water with a drop of oil...&amp; its far from Musk Oil...&amp; even further than Musk Oil Perfume...its terrible how consumers are mislead...I&#x27;m sorry I opend the box but you don&#x27;t know til you open the product then its tough to return the lies...oh well, live &amp; learn!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this since my mother told me what her secret scent was. I get stopped everywhere in the street by men and women asking me what I am wearing. One person event asked me and said it was &amp;#34;the most lovely penetrating scent he ever smelled.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t smell like much in the bottle but put it on your body and it mixes with your pheromones. Definitely dab it on where there is body friction, sweat glands, or hot areas of your body. A few dabs in those ares go a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE disappointment. I have bought this product for so many years, something is VERY wrong with the  chemical compound. It smells like NOTHING, whatever they removed  they need to put back!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and haven&#x27;t had any complaints. I hope to continue to purchase this product again, and I certainly hope they don&#x27;t change anything. It works just fine the way it is. Has a subtle smell that the person doesn&#x27;t really smell on themselves. But other people can definitely smell it! I have gotten many compliments whenever I wear this scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering or overwhelming, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This product delivers just what it says. Musk oil goes by a persons body chemistry, so it&#x27;s not for everyone, but when it compliments your chemistry it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Cabot Oils has a great fragrance but after mid-morning I no longer detect a scent. However, after mid-morning several people have complimented me on my perfume.</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I&#x27;m not a big perfume person but when I smelled this on my sister I just had to try it. Instant compliments! I&#x27;ll re-order when this one runs out. Ty!</li>
    <li> i ordered several bottles some of them had the musk scent some did not.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  This is the smell you catch on a girl that makes you think about her all day.  I&#x27;m a guy, but I think the allure of musk goes both ways.  I&#x27;ll be using just a dab as an undercurrent to other scents to give it that something extra.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Natural Musk Oil for over  decades now. I use it along with my perfume and I have always received many compliments on the way I smell.  Strangers stop me in the street, at the gym, work, and asked what do I use that smells so nice and fresh. It&#x27;s sexy and powerful , I believe it has magic. Yes indeed.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the original musk oil by Cabot Labs. that I have been using many years. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product gives off the most beautiful aroma when the bottle is opened but no fragrance when I put it on. I&#x27;m determined to try it again maybe better luck next time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last like musk</li>
    <li> The very subtle smell is also very noticable to others and people comment on how lovely I smell.  I also have learned to smell it and it is wonderful/</li>
    <li> I have been searching in vain for several years for a replacement for Coty Wild Musk Oil, which I, like many other people, loved and can no longer obtain. This is not the same, but it shares the wonderful attribute of being one of the few perfumes in the world I can wear without feeling sick! It is a very gentle scent, but pleasant and warm, and lingers nicely on the skin. I will certainly continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This musk smells great but 20 minutes after I apply it to my wrists or neck it doesn&#x27;t retain the scent. It seems watered down with oil. I would not buy this product again and do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume. It just may take a little time to notice. But it is well worth waiting for. I put it on, and at first it did not seem to have any fragrance at all. But after a while it developed, and then it developed  further, and I liked it more and more and more! It is so very lovely.</li>
    <li> I have used The original musk oil from This laboratory is great. You can always keep The oil as new if you let it stay a bit in The sun light frequently</li>
    <li> While not exactly what I expected, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  The middle of the road rating is because once applied the aroma fades into nothing.  I do like the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> Not musk at all! It smells like very light powdery old out dated perfume to me:(</li>
    <li> I have used a version of this Musk Oil since I was 22 years old.  (I am now 63)  Through the years the company has changed several times (at least the address on the bottle has changed) because in the old days I had to write the company for prices, etc.  The bottle and label have stayed the same so it has made it easy to identify and replace.  Since it lasts a loooong time, and I usually order 2 bottles at a time, I have not had a reason to reorder in several years -- until now.  This new formula or company or whatever is not the musk oil I remember but a sort of musk water.  I am so very disappointed.  Before ordering I read the reviews and several people mentioned not liking this &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; but I just assumed they had never used it before and really didn&#x27;t know what they were talking about.  They do..&lt;br /&gt;If you have never order this before you may be happy but if you have used musk oil in the past, you will be disappointed in this new formula or whatever.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Very fresh and light!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this oil. You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on but everyone smells it. It&#x27;s light and fresh and you only need a little.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re wearing it until someone says that you smell so good. What are you wearing?  I will always use it!</li>
    <li> The male Musk dear attracts his mate to him naturally with this scent. It is unisex, meaning both men and women can wear it. It changes a little to it&#x27;s owner, again, naturally. I love love loved it at 13 yrs old and now I am 55 still wearing it !! True story !!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this has no smell.  Neither in the bottle, nor on the skin. I doubt anyone can smell this.  I have a very good sense of smell, and there is nothing there.  It&#x27;s a scam.</li>
