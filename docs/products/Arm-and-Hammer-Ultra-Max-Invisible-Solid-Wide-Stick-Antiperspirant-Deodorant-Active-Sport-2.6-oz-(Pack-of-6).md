      <li>but I didn&#x27;t get the full count; the description said six pieces</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrive as scheduled, and worked properly!</li>
    <li> Buying 5 containers at a time reduces the price a lot compared to drug stores.  It is virtually 100% on controlling perspiration.  (I wish they&#x27;d make one for the face!)</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  I tried numerous brands of deodorant before I found one that didn&#x27;t irritate my arm pits.  Besides being gentle, the Arm &amp; Hammer Deodorant is a very effective deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I have tried scores of deodorants, including the extra strong ones for men... but nothing worked. My over-active armpits seemed immune to all until I discovered Arms &amp; Hammer deodorant/antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively for the past 15 years now... and now that I live overseas and I can&#x27;t get them in the country that I&#x27;m at, I buy the deodorant in bulk and have my kids ship it to me from America.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing beats the power of this deodorant. It&#x27;s a MUST in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Just got the package today. I can only use this type because of my eczema...Thank you again!!!</li>
    <li> God dammit.  It&#x27;s so hard to find the right deodorant.  I accidentally bought this one, I have to keep reminding myself \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot; is code for opaque white flaky crap.  I have no clue what the translucent solids are called.  Not \\&quot;gel\\&quot; because that term is reserved for the cold goopy crap.    Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using the EXACT SAME item except NOT anti-perspirant (which makes no difference in terms of sweat, it seems), and NOT the crumbly white crap.  Now I can&#x27;t find the good one on Amazon anymore.</li>
    <li> I swet a lot and this deodorant really works. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it keeps my pits dry.&lt;br /&gt;I cycle to work and this keeps me fresh without needing a shower upon arrival.&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered this online because it was becoming difficult to find locally (walmart or target&#x27;s business model --&amp;#62; less selection to sell more).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for more than 5 years, exclusively. It is very effective and smells great. I am writing a review on deodorant! I don&#x27;t plan on switching anytime soon, as I have tried multiple deodorant/antiperspirants, none of which were as effective. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 5 years...maybe more. Never let me down, even in the sweatiest times. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a long time and convinced myself it was a great product, even though I walked around still smelling like armpit, with white cakey crumbles all over my bedroom floor and shirt stains.  It has the right amount of ingredient but it&#x27;s still a white cakey hot mess.  The advanced &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; products, while expensive, are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Like all Arm &amp; Hammer products, deodorants have a perfect quality. I guess it&#x27;s because baking soda is extremely effective and offers everlasting life. Perfumes or fragrances they offer, are very refreshing. Also the design of presentation is very pleasing to the eye. Congratulations to Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. specifically to Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
    <li> This arm &amp; hammer was hard to find now in store now, but I was able to get as possible.</li>
    <li> My husband will ONLY use this brand/scent of deodorant.  Every time we go to the store, we cannot find the active sport.  We can find EVERY OTHER scent except this one.  This is a bit pricey for 6 sticks but to save him the trouble from having to search all the drug stores (unsuccessfully), it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It makes me not stink!  Yay!  (ROFL... a review of deodorant... yep, I&#x27;m that bored tonight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, it&#x27;ll make you not stink.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different deodorants and I always ended up smelling like&lt;br /&gt;a dead skunk on the side of the road.With the medicine I take they tend to make sweat more than usual.This deodorant is perfect.Ultramax will last for days if you need it to.</li>
    <li> What is there to say about deodorant that gets the job done? I try not to use stronger deodorant often but when I do I have no complaints with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazon delivers automatically - COOL</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this brand. I like the scent and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Nothing exciting about the product.  Its large and it works.  It was also rather inexpensive.  It works great for men or women.</li>
    <li> Originally I bought one for my husband at a local store and he really liked it.  For some strange reason Arm&amp;Hammer Deodorants are no longer available in stores around here, so I hopped online.  Thankfully, Amazon.com has this available in a six pack, so we&#x27;re set for a while again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pleasant but not overpowering, good for a male.  Does the job even in hot weather, no staining of clothes.  Very much recommended!</li>
    <li> The product is fine but I didn&#x27;t get the full count; the description said six pieces but I only got five.&lt;br /&gt;I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant.  It does it&#x27;s job without irritating my skin.  I just wish there was a complelely clear version that did the same.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, great finish, it&#x27;s just as shown in the image and as stated in the specifications. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This smells great on my man!!</li>
    <li> Product choices can be very confusing,but choosing a deodorant for life doesn&#x27;t have to be. use this deodorant,and you will never have to switch unless you want to</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the quietly effective Arm and Hammer I know! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This order came faster than expected and the product is top notch. Made my life much easier. It was great to be able to beat anyone&#x27;s sale price by buying on line.</li>
    <li> Not as flashy as some of the others but gets the job done. I appreciate the package of three it came in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years. I never have issues with sweaty armpits no matter how hot I get.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because I am a fan of A&amp;H other deodorant.  This one does not disappoint.  I prefer this kind of stick for working out.  It protects &amp; is not too strong.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant. But I thought it was gonna be the blue stick. Another words. The one that doesnt leave any white spots.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it really work to control my body odor and sweating.  I really rely on this for everyday use because of my allergies and this has been a go to for me for years as other products cause rashes and itchiness.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband because of bulk. He likes this specific brand the best and how well it works for him. The shipping was fast and I would not only recommend it, but look forward to buying again in the future. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product works good for me. The only reason I give it three stars is because it is labeled as an invisible solid but it will leave a white residue under your armpits and will get on your clothes. Also it doesn&#x27;t work great under a lot of activity. For daily use it works good.</li>
