    <li> I love this product but the price could&#x27;ve been more reasonable</li>
    <li> Makes your skin sooooo soft!  Love it</li>
    <li> Product is great, prices are more than large box stores like Walmart. In the future I will buy at Walmart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good value for the money. It smells sweet and fruity.&lt;br /&gt; Just like any other dove product it leaves my skin gentle and smooth. Although the scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a supermarket. The ingredient list is very complicated however.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Wanted a shower wash that didn&#x27;t leave an oily residue after my shower but still left my skin feeling clean &amp; moisturizer, this is it. I&#x27;ve used another large brand-name product for years, trying all the varieties offered but never felt rinsed clean of a soapy or almost oily feeling on my skin. Dove Go Fresh Revive is by far the best cleansing &amp; moisturizing I&#x27;ve found. This was my first purchase but I&#x27;m staying on the Subscribe &amp; Save program. The price for this product can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Our daughter loves this Dove Go Fresh Revive Body Wash product, saying that it leaves her skin clean and moisturized... and that it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current sale price for the two 14.5 ounce bottles (29 ounces in total) is under seven bucks delivered via an order Add-On, and that&#x27;s fairly good for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like it too, just keep an eye out for a good price and go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes your body feel exceptionally soft.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s overpriced when compared to their options.  I didn&#x27;t catch the price per ounce on this stuff when I bought it.  I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Typical dove quality with a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Love the small &amp; my skins feels soft</li>
    <li> I love Dove body wash! With the exception of a few scents/ styles, I love them all. This one has a nice fresh scent. Not too overpowering, just pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great scent and excellent price. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Its not a 29 oz... These are small bottles. Disappointing. They are 29 oz combined.</li>
    <li> If I ever have to shower without Dove body wash,  shower feels incomplete.</li>
    <li> Love all Dove products!</li>
    <li> very small bottles for the price.  would not order this again...</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> Good deal for both, gave it as a gift and they loved it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than the normal bottles. I should have checked the  ounces listed.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting some kind of online only size of 29oz bottles. Didn&#x27;t think to read the reviews since I&#x27;ve used this before. While it doesn&#x27;t say exactly what you get in the description, if you enlarge the photo, which I did not, you will see it says two 14.5oz bottles on the bottom. I can&#x27;t help but feel a little tricked.</li>
    <li> My favorite body was... Great smell</li>
    <li> Smells great! Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product as it does not melt like a bar of soap.</li>
