      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to maintain the length or cut the bangs or something, this will do for sure.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>And I love the plastic sheaths they are in.</li>
      <li>I have $1 scissors I bought that are better.  </li>
      <li>probably because they&#x27;ve been used (who even knows how many times) before.</li>
      <li>If they preform it&#x27;ll be ok, but that&#x27;s to be seen.</li>
      <li>but it is ok.</li>
      <li>I just need to get a bit more practice using the comb/scissor combo sheers.  </li>
      <li>they fit my hands nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering online for many years and this has never happened.</li>
      <li>Way better than the shears that come with clippers that you would buy in a Wahl set.</li>
      <li>it is what I expect but delivery was suck,they did not come to send my package on the time they show me, so I need to drive more than 30 mins to another city to get my stuff</li>
      <li>Bought as a gift and enjoyed by its recipient.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and very nice scissors set.</li>
      <li>Both were full size and nicely finished and polished.</li>
      <li>The barber shears are pretty good, considering the cost.</li>
      <li>I thought $10 was a pretty good price for both of these scissors.</li>
      <li>My husband cuts his own hair and was lacking versatile tools I thought he needed to do an adequate job.</li>
      <li>They are strong and have a very clean cut.</li>
      <li>A professional stylist would disagree but for my purposes they were great.</li>
      <li>He requires regular grooming and this keeps him looking good!</li>
      <li>The thinning shears are quite sharp and do an excellent job.</li>
      <li>I liked these scissors very much.  </li>
      <li>The scissors itself works fine.</li>
      <li>It cuts just fine</li>
      <li>and I would recommend others who are looking for great tools to purchase these especially if you are an advanced barber/ stylist</li>
      <li>and although they seem too light in weight they do the job I need done.</li>
      <li>Plus they come with a free pair of thinning shears which I&#x27;ll use on my dogs.</li>
      <li>These are great for the non-professional who wants a good cut with a little body (using the thinning shears).</li>
      <li>figured real barber shears would be a huge improvement, but they turned out to be just an okay improvement.  </li>
      <li>I will likely give these away or donate them and spend more money to get something better.</li>
      <li>They are a long way from being \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; as the description says, more suitable for home haircutting once a month or so.</li>
      <li>I got these for a quick replacement.</li>
      <li>The blades weren&#x27;t very sharp and it didn&#x27;t feel great on my fingers.  </li>
      <li>Having personally purchased and tried with this particular set, I can honestly say that they work well and smoothly.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like them better than the Office Max ones, and don&#x27;t regret buying them, but if you are looking for an amazing difference, maybe spend some more dough.</li>
      <li>I like them very much.</li>
      <li>I originally ordered from hobbytoolsupply only because I was looking for thinning shears, and when I saw the set for pretty cheap</li>
      <li>/&gt;The thinning shears are nice, except my 9 year old says they hurt because they pull his hair; not sharp enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>shipping was pretty</li>
      <li>I read many of the comments that were saying only one scissor out of two came; worked well for me.</li>
      <li>Just exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>Well I guess to start off, I was grateful to receive both items after reading many people only received the scissors.</li>
      <li>The curved metal bit on the top is to rest your middle finger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years now and finally wore my old pair of barber shears out.</li>
      <li>They looked new and so far operate just fine.</li>
      <li>It is a smart way to have them at home for a woman.</li>
      <li>haha ha</li>
      <li>Given the price, don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t put much expect on them.</li>
      <li>I use them very often.</li>
      <li>I bought this set of scissors for my wife because she does that hair salon thing when i told her how much it was</li>
      <li>But like I said, the quality upon their price, so I wouldn&#x27;t complain much..</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to this product, had them shipped</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for these.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I could look at the hair under a microscope I&#x27;d see that the cut is much cleaner or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scissors are sharp and very comfortable on the fingers.</li>
      <li>The large trimming scissors work OK but are not that sharp.  </li>
      <li>nice but plain gets job done</li>
      <li>They look like brand new when I received them.</li>
      <li>However, I bought these scissors in new condition but I found hair stuck to it after opening it.</li>
      <li>These new scissors work well</li>
      <li>Only thing is that, I&#x27;ve stopped cutting their hair since I&#x27;m not the best.</li>
      <li>They are definitely easier to use because of the size, and they let me get to the tight spots around his ears without as much fear, so I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  </li>
      <li>A friend who is a professional hair dresser gave them the thumbs up!</li>
      <li>I mean they sent both of the shears but the regular shears do not look anything how they look on the picture , other than that they&#x27;re pretty good</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m doing fine,not great while my cutting but my husband &amp;#34;still&amp;#34; have ears and he survives every time.</li>
      <li>Used them to cut and texture my bangs, everyone thought I&#x27;d got to a professional, told them where to buy them.</li>
      <li>So far I have not gotten hairs yanked out yet.</li>
      <li>Better for delicate hands.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t smooth and also not comfortable on my hand.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend money on trimming scissors, don&#x27;t put much value on the bonus thinning scissors as they are more or less a waste of time.  </li>
      <li>They are a high enough quality for me and my home needed touch ups.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as promised. No complaints. Good price. :)</li>
    <li> Given the price, don&#x27;t expect much.  The large trimming scissors work OK but are not that sharp.  The thinning scissors are more or less a waste of time.  If you&#x27;re going to spend money on trimming scissors, don&#x27;t put much value on the bonus thinning scissors as they are more or less a waste of time.  Bottom line, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> nice but plain gets job done</li>
    <li> The scissors itself works fine. However, I bought these scissors in new condition but I found hair stuck to it after opening it.</li>
    <li> It makes my finger hurts when doing the cutting</li>
    <li> My money was so tight that I needed to give my hair a trim and this was cheaper than getting a bad haircut. The scissors are sharp and very comfortable on the fingers. The thinning shears are quite sharp and do an excellent job. These are great for the non-professional who wants a good cut with a little body (using the thinning shears).</li>
    <li> The thinning scissors was missing when I received the package. I read the reviews and that had happened to other customers too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years now and finally wore my old pair of barber shears out. These new scissors work well and although they seem too light in weight they do the job I need done. Plus they come with a free pair of thinning shears which I&#x27;ll use on my dogs.</li>
    <li> My review may not be fair because I&#x27;ve never owned barber shears before.  I&#x27;m comparing them against a pair of titanium paper cutting scissors you can get at Office Max for $6 that I used to use on my son&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured real barber shears would be a huge improvement, but they turned out to be just an okay improvement.  They are definitely easier to use because of the size, and they let me get to the tight spots around his ears without as much fear, so I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  I just thought barber shears would be razor sharp and slice through hair with no difficulty; but I&#x27;m not sure these guys cut through his hair much easier than the Office Max special.  Maybe if I could look at the hair under a microscope I&#x27;d see that the cut is much cleaner or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thinning shears are nice, except my 9 year old says they hurt because they pull his hair; not sharp enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, either I have unrealistic expectations of what barber shears should be capable of, or you get what you pay for and shouldn&#x27;t expect a whole lot from something this inexpensive.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like them better than the Office Max ones, and don&#x27;t regret buying them, but if you are looking for an amazing difference, maybe spend some more dough.</li>
    <li> The scissors tip is really sharp, so I need to be careful not to poke or else.&lt;br /&gt;I had the same brand scissors before, but these ones are just not good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know anything about barber scissors but does the job.    They looked new and so far operate just fine. Good size.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m doing fine,not great while my cutting but my husband &amp;#34;still&amp;#34; have ears and he survives every time.I keep on trucking,don&#x27;t give up if you are a &amp;#34;novice&amp;#34; hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I liked these scissors very much.  I just need to get a bit more practice using the comb/scissor combo sheers.  they fit my hands nicely.</li>
    <li> It cuts just fine but the finger holes are a little small. Better for delicate hands.</li>
    <li> I recently bought both the barber scissors and the thinning scissors.  The second time I used the barber scissors they were sticking a bit so I tried moving them back and forth to loosen them, and the screw that holds them together broke.  I now have 2 daggers....bad quality control ICE.......</li>
    <li> the scissors were a little stiff for my taste so i put mineral oil on it and it cuts nicely. The thinning tool is nice.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and very nice scissors set. I use them very often. I like them very much. It is a smart way to have them at home for a woman.</li>
    <li> These are really good quality,&lt;br /&gt;.I have used them twice on my wife,s hair with good results.She does not have to visit the salon every four weeks</li>
    <li> The thinning scissors were a little hard to open and close.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set of scissors because my boyfriend does not like to pay money to get his hair cut. I thought $10 was a pretty good price for both of these scissors. I received the box, opened it up and I came to realize that only the regular trimming scissors were in the box, not the thinning ones. To add to that, they were in the sleeve that said &#x27;THINNING SCISSORS.&#x27; I then rushed to called amazon and they offered me a refund and to return the package with everything in it. Personally, I would not order from this company. I do not know who packaged the scissors but they must be blind and cannot read. I went ahead and ordered a little bit more expensive scissors, hoping that would account for actually getting what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Zero start, was used and bad...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for these.  The blades weren&#x27;t very sharp and it didn&#x27;t feel great on my fingers.  I should have bought ones with rubber inserts.</li>
    <li> These are plain, steel scissors which are good for cutting hair. Do not use them to break down a chicken, to do arts and crafts, or to do electrical work. If you do, you will probably damage them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are for trimming hair - ideally, human hair. They are useful for beard, sideburn, eyebrow, and hair trimming and cutting. The curved metal bit on the top is to rest your middle finger. If you do not hold them correctly, they may be uncomfortable. If you hold them correctly, they will not be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not know how to cut and/or style hair, this will not teach you how.</li>
    <li> My wife got  these shears to start giving me haircuts at home and save money. These scissors are very sharp and cut very well.</li>
    <li> I got these for a quick replacement. The thinning shears are pointless and a waste of cheap metal. They did nothing but pull the hair. The shears are not much better but can be used. Do not waste your time unless you are not a professional.</li>
    <li> The bolt in middle that hops them together was loose. When I received them do can&#x27;t even cut hair with yhem</li>
    <li> The barber shears are pretty good, considering the cost. Not as sharp as they should be, and I had to tighten them up before they&#x27;d work properly; but they were inexpensive so I can&#x27;t really complain. They are a long way from being \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; as the description says, more suitable for home haircutting once a month or so. The thinning shears work well though, no complaints there.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews I read on Amazon on scissors sets have not been too good. Having personally purchased and tried with this particular set, I can honestly say that they work well and smoothly. They look like brand new when I received them. The material is sturdy. So far I have not gotten hairs yanked out yet.</li>
    <li> much nicer than I expected.  From the picture I thought one pair was smaller.  Both were full size and nicely finished and polished. A good value.  Cuppie</li>
    <li> My husband cuts his own hair and was lacking versatile tools I thought he needed to do an adequate job. I purchased this set for Christmas and he absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> these are very nice and work well, good value</li>
    <li> Based on delivery time, I guess they forged the metal to make these by hand.</li>
    <li> I only bought them for about $8 so I didn&#x27;t put much expect on them. Well it&#x27;s a 50/50 for me because the 7.5&amp;#34; is sharp enough to cut my hair but the thinner scissors are not working for me - it seems not sharp enough to cut any hair. But like I said, the quality upon their price, so I wouldn&#x27;t complain much..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> it is what I expect but delivery was suck,they did not come to send my package on the time they show me, so I need to drive more than 30 mins to another city to get my stuff</li>
    <li> Way better than the shears that come with clippers that you would buy in a Wahl set. Good cut for bargain price.</li>
    <li> I received only the barber shears and not the thinning shears.  I am not interested in receiving them anymore and I want to keep the barber shears.  Can I get a partial refund to my credit card for the missing item?</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when I received this package in the mail. It&#x27;s supposed to be a \\&quot;set\\&quot; of both barber shears and thinning shears: the image pictures both, and all the other customer reviews rate both shears. I originally ordered from hobbytoolsupply only because I was looking for thinning shears, and when I saw the set for pretty cheap I thought, \\&quot;hey, why not just get both?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package came only the barber shears were included. How do you forget half an order? I&#x27;ve been ordering online for many years and this has never happened. What an inconvenience and how disappointing! If I had known it would be such a hassle I would have shopped elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and enjoyed by its recipient.</li>
    <li> Very good product and I would recommend others who are looking for great tools to purchase these especially if you are an advanced barber/ stylist</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot of money, but I don&#x27;t like being mislead. They&#x27;re not the one in the picture. No rubber stopper nothin. If they preform it&#x27;ll be ok, but that&#x27;s to be seen.</li>
    <li> Well I guess to start off, I was grateful to receive both items after reading many people only received the scissors. Unfortunately, they were both USED (even though they were marketed as new). Gross. I chose this item because reviews on a similar pair had reviews of used items as well and I would have rather risked getting only half my order than something used. Lo and behold, it&#x27;s the same seller. Ugh. And when I say used...I mean pieces of hair still caught in both items. They are currently being disinfected in my dishwasher...it sucks, but for the price paid for them I guess it&#x27;s not an awful deal??? Not sure how well they cut hair yet, though the scissors don&#x27;t appear as sharp as they should...probably because they&#x27;ve been used (who even knows how many times) before. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of scissors for my wife because she does that hair salon thing when i told her how much it was she said i was kidding greta value on a pair of scissors very sharp.</li>
    <li> I mean they sent both of the shears but the regular shears do not look anything how they look on the picture , other than that they&#x27;re pretty good , I&#x27;m a barber and they get the job done . I was only disappointed that the regular shears did not look anything like in the picture</li>
    <li> These are no where near as smooth on cutting hair as other ones I have used in the past.  I will likely give these away or donate them and spend more money to get something better.</li>
    <li> Very good scissors. Used them to cut and texture my bangs, everyone thought I&#x27;d got to a professional, told them where to buy them. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have around the house to do some hair trimming between cuts or as emergency items. They have worked great my wife used them to cut her bangs and we used them to trim our sons hair as well. They are strong and have a very clean cut.</li>
    <li> great scissors! I didn&#x27;t know they would be so nice! Thank you again!!! And I love the plastic sheaths they are in.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how sharp these would be as the price for both was very low.  They are a high enough quality for me and my home needed touch ups.  A professional stylist would disagree but for my purposes they were great.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this product, had them shipped so I could get them the next day. I open the box to find I only got one of the scissors. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I wanted to have both of the scissors, so I feel like I over paid.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my family&#x27;s hair, and it definitely gets the job done. Only thing is that, I&#x27;ve stopped cutting their hair since I&#x27;m not the best. If you&#x27;re looking to maintain the length or cut the bangs or something, this will do for sure.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a pair or 2of shears so i could cut my bangs, and cut my sons hair down the road. These are perfect, the price was right, and the quality is great</li>
    <li> cutting hair by myself is very interesting. good tools.although it is a little expensive. but it is ok. haha ha</li>
    <li> I cut hair (non-professionally) at home on a regular basis.  I had hoped that these would be sharp and would last.  I have $1 scissors I bought that are better.  But, if you sharpen these quite a bit, they work okay.  They aren&#x27;t smooth and also not comfortable on my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this scissors to cut my own hair and my kids hair. I&#x27;m not a professional but they work really good</li>
    <li> Great product just as described and great value for the price. Its nice to have them as set. A friend who is a professional hair dresser gave them the thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Scissors came. Great quality, fine cut and easy to handle. I read many of the comments that were saying only one scissor out of two came; worked well for me. Both arrived. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I am not a professional hair stylist but I do cut my family&#x27;s hair and this set of scissors is sharp &amp; feel very durable.  I think I will have them for a long time.</li>
    <li> The shears was 6.5 instead of 7.5</li>
    <li> We purchased this item for use in grooming our Westie. He requires regular grooming and this keeps him looking good!</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Great! They&#x27;re not pro scissors, but for the price they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
