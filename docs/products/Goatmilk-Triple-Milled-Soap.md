    <li> My mother is in love with the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn goatmilk products - this was a great find!  The store site doesn&#x27;t carry a lot of the goatsmilk products any longer.</li>

    <li> The perfume smell in this soap is outrageously strong.  Had to give it to my sister.  I could not use it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap and haven&#x27;t used anything else in the shower for 20 years. Doesn&#x27;t smell obnoxious; very little fragrance. Lasts forever because it&#x27;s triple-milled (dense). Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. I settled on the Goat Milk because it has the least fragrance of all Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s tripple-milled soap. Makes a beautiful and thoughtful gift too.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, having been introduced to it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and rarely use anything but this soap.  I even take it overseas with me when I travel, as to do without seems unacceptable.</li>

    <li> Very drying soap, so if you have oily skin it might be okay to use, or maybe in the summer when there is more humidity.&lt;br /&gt;It would be horrible for me to use in the winter time. Smell is nice. I would not order again though. Sorry Crabtree.</li>
