      <li>Easy to apply which is good.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use...!</li>
      <li>Works quickly which is good.</li>
      <li>I might as well go gray. :-)</li>
      <li>Better than products with lead.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps my hair is ligther brown than before, but it&#x27;s Ok</li>
      <li>so I have more on hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gets better when it dries a bit, but you do need to rinse before bed or your pillow will stain.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s better to wash hair thoroughly after use.</li>
      <li>Plan to use it for many years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>The ladies flirt with him and he feel youthful and confident.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, my gray hair disappeared.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as the Youthair Creme or Just For Men, or Grecian Formulas with Lead Acetate.</li>
      <li>I never would have believed that it could be so easy.  </li>
      <li>works fine as advertised</li>
      <li>It is more powerful than the youthair that has lead acetate and does not have a pungent smell.</li>
      <li>Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience.</li>
      <li>Very effective and hair colour change is noticed after the third day use.</li>
      <li>This is actually more effective, and although it still has a sulphur scent, the smell is not as strong overall.  </li>
      <li>He has been very pleased with this product over the years and keeps coming back for more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nothing more than a temporary dye.</li>
      <li>My wife would be quick to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really, I run and exercise and am in good shape for a 65 year old</li>
      <li>Though very satisfied with regular Youthair (and with its competition, Grecian Formula), I decided to try this product because I was a bit concerned about the lead acetate in the others.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product with lead in it for a long time and it was good</li>
      <li>Minimal sulpher smell which is good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;People needs to care a little bit more of what they put in their bodies, no Lead makes me feel better</li>
      <li>had used Grecian Formula ten or more years ago, but eventually gave up on it because I couldn&#x27;t abide the lead smell.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kind of funky... not quite chemical like other products, but not quite something you want to smell like.</li>
      <li>You certainly can&#x27;t see it on the hair afterwards.  </li>
      <li>you rinse out your hair before bed (to avoid a brown pillow) much of the darkness will rinse out.</li>
      <li>I know - whatever. hahaha</li>
      <li>when washing your hair, or just rinse your hair until it really needs a wash.</li>
      <li>I used the regular Cream with lead by 20 years, but  I change to Lead Free to avoid the risk of cancer.</li>
      <li>IT takes about 4 weeks to work effectively but by then hair that has just grown in is gray until a few weeks go by.</li>
      <li>After two  weeks my hair is back to it&#x27;s original color and matching my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Better than the other!</li>
      <li>I am thin on top but to have my sides back to my original color took years off my apperance, and to darken what is on top actually makes it look thicker.</li>
      <li>Highly Reccomend.</li>
      <li>After a few more uses, my hair had turned brown/black.</li>
      <li>It works great on dark brown/mixed grey hair and only takes me 3 days to cover it.  </li>
      <li>I shower in the morning (using a mild, color-safe shampoo) and then apply the hair creme to towel-dry (or dry hair), and then brush my hair to assure complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I discovered the high lead content in the OLDER item, I searched for an alternative and found this lead-free version on European Amazon, so I just bought it there.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll probably agree that the two minor caveats associated with this product (funny scent and potential for staining) far outweigh the dangers of rubbing a toxic, heavy metal, which is known carcinogen, into your scalp :)</li>
      <li>As far as odor or smell, I did not notice anything, and nobody has said anything.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
      <li>product is not as fast acting as the products with Lead Acetate.</li>
      <li>After a week I cut back on how much I was using from a dab to just a pea size amount.</li>
      <li>and I just don&#x27;t want my hair to make me feel old.</li>
      <li>I am a 61 year old woman and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>It will rub off on nearly everything your hair comes in contact with.</li>
      <li>Downfalls, does not last more than a few days.</li>
      <li>little more greasy than normal but not much.</li>
      <li>applied in moderation, it is non-greasy and very much like any other hair groom product.  </li>
      <li>Works better than Grecian with less mess</li>
      <li>It works and brings back natural hair color.</li>
      <li>I write reviews only if a product is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s probably the quickest and safest game in town for temporarily covering gray.  </li>
<li> But it also doesn&#x27;t cause Cancer if you accidentally get it on your skin or even worse, if you have a cut or abrasion on your hands or scalp when you apply</li>

<li> The hair smells bad</li>
<li> can cover up gray without nasty smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.  After a couple of uses my hair had already lost its whiteness and had acquired a nice gray.  After a few more uses, my hair had turned brown/black.</li>
    <li> Very effective and hair colour change is noticed after the third day use.</li>
    <li> The hair smells bad so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> It works...and it&#x27;s easy to use...!</li>
    <li> I write reviews only if a product is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad.  This one is unbelievably good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used Grecian Formula ten or more years ago, but eventually gave up on it because I couldn&#x27;t abide the lead smell.  This product (without lead) has a whiff of that same acrid odor, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it since day two. I shower in the morning (using a mild, color-safe shampoo) and then apply the hair creme to towel-dry (or dry hair), and then brush my hair to assure complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If applied in moderation, it is non-greasy and very much like any other hair groom product.  You certainly can&#x27;t see it on the hair afterwards.  I have not seen any brown stains on my pillowcase.  My wife would be quick to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look and feel ten years younger.  I never would have believed that it could be so easy.  The funny thing is that my wife hasn&#x27;t even noticed yet--or at least hasn&#x27;t said anything.  We celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary tonight, so I will ask at dinner.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this item for my father for the last 22 years. When I discovered the high lead content in the OLDER item, I searched for an alternative and found this lead-free version on European Amazon, so I just bought it there. Finally, the U.S. has caught up and now I can just get it here as well. My father is 74 and does not look a day over 60. The ladies flirt with him and he feel youthful and confident. He has been very pleased with this product over the years and keeps coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week and I can see great improvement. You will notice your hair gets&lt;br /&gt;a little more greasy than normal but not much. Follow the instruction and you will see great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;People needs to care a little bit more of what they put in their bodies, no Lead makes me feel better&lt;br /&gt;than using the other products with Lead.</li>
    <li> Works better than Grecian with less mess</li>
    <li> works fine as advertised</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It works! Contains no lead which is good. Minimal sulpher smell which is good. Works quickly which is good. Easy to apply which is good. Downfalls, does not last more than a few days. Washes out within 3/4 days, and it WILL stain your pillow cases and bedding brown!  If you sweat a lot from your head the sweat drops coming off your head dripping down your face will be brown. It&#x27;s really nothing more than a temporary dye. The cream is white in color from the tube until oxygen hits it then it turns brown while it&#x27;s on your head. It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s probably the quickest and safest game in town for temporarily covering gray.  I just placed a 2nd order so it&#x27;s not all bad in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> Stuff stinks just as bad as the &amp;#34;Other&amp;#34; brand that has lead in it and makes your hair heavy and flat, even if you use just a little bit.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to work. IT takes about 4 weeks to work effectively but by then hair that has just grown in is gray until a few weeks go by. So the newest grown in hair is always gray.</li>
    <li> Works for me, no obnoxious smell. The only problem is that when my hair is cut all color is gone and have to re-apply. I use the product 3 x week to cover gray hair.</li>
    <li> Better than the other!</li>
    <li> can cover up gray without nasty smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product with lead in it for a long time and it was good but the warnings about lead made me decide to change. I don&#x27;t want hair coloring per se so went with this. Easy to apply but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it says that well. You have to use it daily. I&#x27;m thinking when my supply runs out I might as well go gray. :-) Really, I run and exercise and am in good shape for a 65 year old and I just don&#x27;t want my hair to make me feel old. I know - whatever. hahaha</li>
    <li> Works great.  Better than products with lead.  Plan to use it for many years.  Recommend it to anyone that will just put it on overnight.</li>
    <li> I used the regular Cream with lead by 20 years, but  I change to Lead Free to avoid the risk of cancer. I&#x27;m using it by two weeks and the results are excellent. Perhaps my hair is ligther brown than before, but it&#x27;s Ok&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, and do not believe all negative reviews against it.</li>
    <li> Actually worked as the description says. After 2 days I could tell the difference, but it was subtle. After a week I cut back on how much I was using from a dab to just a pea size amount. After two  weeks my hair is back to it&#x27;s original color and matching my eyebrows. I am thin on top but to have my sides back to my original color took years off my apperance, and to darken what is on top actually makes it look thicker. The three tubes I got likely will last a year, but I am going to reorder soon just so I have more on hand. As far as odor or smell, I did not notice anything, and nobody has said anything. Thank you Youthhair.</li>
    <li> It works well. It is more powerful than the youthair that has lead acetate and does not have a pungent smell. I am a 61 year old woman and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after reading about Lead Acetate. That is some nasty stuff, and it is used in most products that eliminate gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not as fast acting as the products with Lead Acetate. But it also doesn&#x27;t cause Cancer if you accidentally get it on your skin or even worse, if you have a cut or abrasion on your hands or scalp when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has to be used a little differently. When you apply it, you have to leave it in for several hours. The smell is kind of funky... not quite chemical like other products, but not quite something you want to smell like. (Almost a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; odor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will turn noticeably darker immediately after applying. This change is not permanent, and it&#x27;s not color-fast! It will rub off on nearly everything your hair comes in contact with. It&#x27;s gets better when it dries a bit, but you do need to rinse before bed or your pillow will stain. It&#x27;s best to use a gentle soap (baby shampoo?) when washing your hair, or just rinse your hair until it really needs a wash. It does a good job as a styling cream, which is a good thing, because you can&#x27;t use creams or gels when the product is in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you rinse out your hair before bed (to avoid a brown pillow) much of the darkness will rinse out. However, each application does increase the amount of darker hair that remains. (And gray reduction, which is why we bought it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... it&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as the Youthair Creme or Just For Men, or Grecian Formulas with Lead Acetate. But if you do 5 minutes of research about Lead Acetate... you&#x27;ll probably agree that the two minor caveats associated with this product (funny scent and potential for staining) far outweigh the dangers of rubbing a toxic, heavy metal, which is known carcinogen, into your scalp :)</li>
    <li> Pretty good, my gray hair disappeared. However, the color of my hair is black but after using Youthair the color turned to dark brownish. Hope Youthair have variety of colors to choose.</li>
    <li> Very good product,THE YOUTHAIR  CREME LEAD FREE I WILL USE FOR LIFE  AND I WILL TELL OTHERS TO USE IT</li>
    <li> It works great on dark brown/mixed grey hair and only takes me 3 days to cover it.  It leaves a brown residue on towels if wiped off when wet so it&#x27;s better to wash hair thoroughly after use.</li>
    <li> Waste of money not worth it 4 month no different. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Though very satisfied with regular Youthair (and with its competition, Grecian Formula), I decided to try this product because I was a bit concerned about the lead acetate in the others.  This is actually more effective, and although it still has a sulphur scent, the smell is not as strong overall.  This is a little more difficult to apply than regular Youthair Creme, so it doesn&#x27;t go as far.  It also stains pillowcases and clothing, so users must take measures to prevent that.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> works great, safe for my body because it&#x27;s lead-free.  I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
    <li> Yourhair Crème is among the best hair product that I have used to date. It works and brings back natural hair color. This is a product I can recommend with five stars.</li>
