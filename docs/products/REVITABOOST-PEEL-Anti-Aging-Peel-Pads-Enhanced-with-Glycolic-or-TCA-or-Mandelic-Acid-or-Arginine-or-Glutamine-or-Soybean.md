      <li>This was a safe and effective peel for me.</li>
      <li>So far I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>the substitute product is wonderful after the first use my skin was really smooth .my hyperpigmentation has faded.  </li>
      <li>Like many on this board, I&#x27;ve used other Perfect Image products and am experienced with peels.  </li>
      <li>This is very important.</li>
      <li>and it was alleviated as soon as I splashed water on my face and neck, to rinse off the peel.</li>
      <li>and these did the appropriate amount of &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; without eating my face away.</li>
      <li>Am waiting to use it again to leave on longer and see if it sloughs more.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know the cause for sure, for one.</li>
      <li>Love this peel for &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; peels.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use sunscreen as one is more prone to sunburn after use.</li>
      <li>Also It did smooth out my skin nicely and got rid of some of my acne but not all.</li>
      <li>I like to follow with an over the counter cortisone cream or even better an ointment.</li>
      <li>Salicylic acid is more drying.</li>
      <li>Skin was frosting on the tops of my cheeks immediately, where the most hyper pigmentation was.</li>
      <li>The Level 1 peels would have not been able to penetrate my skin.</li>
      <li>, I see improvement with the texture of my skin but need more work and time with the discoloration even though its generally better.</li>
      <li>Works better than whatever they use in the spa&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>last note: I use Perfect Image&#x27;s hydra repair wrinkle cream for two nights after, and then continue with the hydra repair COMBINED with Vit. C (ascorbic acid powder).</li>
      <li>I love the convenience of the pads.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to allow approximately 1 week of frosting/peeling of my skin before I am looking normal again but it does seem to work. I have had several chemical peels and microderm before at spas and dermatologist offices with minor peeling for only a day or two (and this was a lot stronger than any of those). I have sensitive skin but it is very &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; when it comes to chemical peels and microdermabrasion. This one actually produces results. Whatever you do, DO NOT leave it on longer than they say. I was unable to do more than a minute and still had a lot of frosting on my forehead (lasts about 5 days) and peeling pn the rest of my face. If you want results try this, but like they say no pain no gain.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it about once a month and always peel. this product is the closest thing to a professional peel that Ive found. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these twice and I feel they&#x27;re doing their job!</li>
    <li> Love them will be reordering!</li>
    <li> light but strong peel. The product comes packaged in a small plastic container with individual round cotton wipes. The product provider included some high level instructions but this is more a use-at your own- risk type of product and its something similar to what I have used/done at a clinicians office.&lt;br /&gt; I applied it after washing my face and left it on for about 3 minutes. There was a bit of stinging and some redness but after 3 minutes I washed it off with water, gently patting and not rubbing. I immediately added some moisturizer and an ointment. I had read in one of the medical sites that you should apply cream a couple of times a day to avoid any cracking and avoid redness.&lt;br /&gt; The peeling did not start for me until day 5. I applied the product on Monday and started to peel on Saturday. In between I had some crusting, so it made it difficult to wear make up or any other make up product. But I made sure I wore moisturizer and sunblock at a minimum. When it was time for peeling and flake off ,  it was more of &#x27;dry patches peeling&#x27; and it continue to peel for about 3-4 days. It just looked like I had really dry skin and it was flaking. Once the peeling finished the skin underneath was nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, this procedure requires some patience on your behalf, its not as strong as a full blown TCA peel but its strong enough to slough off any dead skin and address any acne or light peel type of issues. Patience on your end is required and should consider 7-10 days of downtime. You probably don&#x27;t want to do this the weekend before a party.</li>
    <li> Too strong!! But nice after the peel</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but they work wonders. I use them on my chest and arms, I&#x27;m in my upper forties and so the freckling begins lol! I use them every two weeks and my chest peels a little and the skin underneath is so soft and youthful looking. The only downfall is the pads fall apart easily, so I usually use two but like I said that would cover chest and arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48-African American...Brown. I bought this product to help with acne scars and get a general peel to rejuvenate my skin.  First try, used for about 5 minute and had some slight peeling around the noise and under the lip only.  Pretty much unnoticeable to the eye but I could see the smoother skin under the area that peeled.  Tried again a few days ago, only peeling its my finger tips which are really, really peeling.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how long to use for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest following directions to avoid a terrible experience.  Not much peelin on my face  but it does have a burn sensation when applying.</li>
    <li> A little bit about me: Sensitive Asian skin, acne prone, fair to very light medium skin, with yellow undertones. Lots of freckles, hyper pigmentation from the sun and adolescent acne, and very mild acne scars, all on my cheeks. No active breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid researcher for the best skin care products for my skin type. I normally see a cosmetic dermatologist once a year for laser treatment on my skin to get rid of the acne scars and hyper pigmentation. Though mild, they do become more apparent during the summer. I opted to try an at-home peel because laser treatment was becoming too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first peel ever. I decided on this particular at-home peel because it had superb ingredients, high ratings, and though there are not too many reviews I read each and every one of them and found all reviewers to be honest about the efficacy of the product. (Honest reviewers are becoming more difficult to find on Amazon unfortunately.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done two peels, two weeks apart. Summary below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First peel:&lt;br /&gt;-Left on for 1 minute, 15 seconds. Had NO frosting of the skin, though it did give a burning/stinging sensation, nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. Washed with cold water and applied a heavy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 1: Skin felt tight.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 2: Skin began to feel scaly in the areas that had hyper pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 3: Slight flaking of the skin, with more moderate peeling until the end of Day 6 after first treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely noticed an improvement in skin tone and texture, freckles and dark spots were a bit lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second peel:&lt;br /&gt;-Used a glove to rub the peel pad in circles around my face (my fingertips peeled last time from not using hand protection, not a big deal but I didn&#x27;t want this to happen again.) Left on for 1 minute, 35 seconds. Skin was frosting on the tops of my cheeks immediately, where the most hyper pigmentation was. I washed this off with cold water and applied a heavy moisturizer. I knew that since my skin frosted, this was going to be a much more extensive peel, a good thing for someone who wants to get rid of years of hyper pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 1: Skin was tight and pink in some areas where it frosted.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 2: Skin began to feel very scaly, more extensive in terms of area and hardness. I also saw a &amp;#34;browning/coffee ground&amp;#34; appearance on the hyper pigmented areas that frosted.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 3: Dryness and mild flaking around the mouth and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 4: Skin was becoming VERY flaky on the cheeks but only slightly peeled/fell off with mild rubbing from washing my face with a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;-Day 5: EXTENSIVE peeling in the shower, all over my cheeks where the hyper pigmentation was. Very few scaly areas left to peel off on their own. Completed peeling at the end of Day 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this peel when I knew I had at least 5-6 days of down time, because on Days 3-5 the scaliness is very apparent. This time off also allowed me to not wear makeup because I was at home, and to not worry about the sun ruining my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I HIGHLY recommend this product. I had incredible results with using this peel just two times. My hyper pigmentation and freckles are significantly lightened and nearly gone. I suspect 2 more treatments will completely get rid of them. I will continue to use this as frequently as I can, with a minimum of 2 weeks in between treatments. Just follow the directions and this should be very easy to do at home.rizer.

    <li> did 3 peels already, great product</li>
    <li> After using this product........all I can say is that its GREAT!  Teddy from Tucson</li>
    <li> Ladies this a great product and I will by again... Thanks</li>
    <li> Works good, is a bit painful at first.</li>
    <li> Anything thing that does not break out my skin is a great thing, this does not.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have never tried a peel before but this one works. I left it on for about a 1 minute before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore but just that little time gave me results. Now, like I said, I have never done a peel before, so to my surprise I have been peeling from day 2-5. Almost done now and my skin looks amazing. Even though I hate the process of peeling, my skin looks amazing!! I have received so many compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product three times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st time  - I left it on for one minute and had light peeling in patches, not my entire face.  It made my face red for the first day only. No other side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd time - I left it on for 1.5 minutes and had slightly more peeling that the first time. Again, it was in patches. It made my face red for the first day and my skin begin to look slight drawn and wrinkled but this would go away when i applied moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd time - I used two layers. I left the first on for one minute and then applied the second and left it on for one additional minute. This produced a very good amount of peeling over my entire face. With this use, my skin frosted and the burning was pretty intense but not painful. This method made my face very red for two days and by day three my skin was very dry, drawn and wrinkled. But, putting antibiotic ointment on it smoothed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It works well. But, you want to start slow so you don&#x27;t burn your skin.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be. I kept it on about 3 min too. I am used to peeling coming off in sheets, this was just mildly flaky and dry. I guess it&#x27;s be good if you just wanted a refresher.</li>
    <li> This is the most intense peel that I have ever used. I have bought several different peels which I thought were pretty weak. This one actually yields results. It is uncomfortable but not unbearable and  was quite safe for a TCA and glycolic peel.</li>
    <li> suffered from melasma for years and i used hydroquinone up to 10% kid you not! spend thousands of dollars on peels and stuff like that but man this stuff work!! it really made me peel! i am using it once a week and used it twice so far! i really can tell there is a difference! i just cant believe how well it worked for me! awesomeeee and darn cheappp 50 pads, i.e. 50 weeks if u use it weekly! am planning to go on monthly use after sometime! am religiously using sunscreen spf 50 at least 3 times/day. also using moisturizer! ps: u might feel skin getting little wrinkly and dry, but thats coz its going to peel. One piece of advice, use a timer when you put it, and dont leave it for more than one minute if your new to peels..can go to 1.5 mins if you are used to peels and can tolerate it...use gloves when u put it on coz the tips of my fingers peeled really bad....am very happy with this product..i rarely write a review but man this product works.</li>
    <li> These pads are strong. I overheld them the first time and irritated my skin, which was tottally my fault. Second time I wiped my face and washed it off after a minute. Love the results! Great product. Use as directed.</li>
    <li> I have had several chemical peels at a med spa. These are very similar to the effects I had with a professional peel and I am very pleased! I have VERY sensitive skin and these did the appropriate amount of &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; without eating my face away. Now for my warning. When you go to neutralize it with the cold water use a washcloth or something similar. I made the mistake of standing over the sink a splashing my face with cold water and although my eyes were closed I still got some in my eyes. Not fun. Actually dangerous!! Please do not make this mistake!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the product I received . Sold out so they sent me a substitute item I was it would have told me it was sold out.but the substitute product is wonderful after the first use my skin was really smooth .my hyperpigmentation has faded.  But I really wanted the peel pads instead of the 30percent peel that was substituted. I will purchase again. My face didn&#x27;t peel but it does work with no pain at least for me.</li>
    <li> Works better than whatever they use in the spa&#x27;s. I have had several $100 peels in spa salons and this is the first one to actually cause my skin to lightly peal and look refreshed after.</li>
    <li> These really are &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; pads - they get the job done.  I used a pad for about a minute and then used a second peel pad for another minute or two.  For a few days my skin felt very tight and then by the 4th or 5th day I started to peel  (like a sunburn peel) for another few days.  Makeup did not go on very well during those days but I just used a lot of moisturizer.  There is improvement in skin when the peeling is done. I will continue to use these pads.</li>
    <li> Great product. Slight tingling sensation then the peel starts within three days. Make sure you use sunscreen as one is more prone to sunburn after use.</li>
    <li> Good results but takes 2 weeks to peel.</li>
    <li> This product is effective in creating a peel, however, it takes 4 to 5 days for the peel to peel off entirely, leaving you with an unattractive peely face for almost a week.</li>
    <li> This product is very strong, don&#x27;t fool yourself for the soaked pads presentation. I&#x27;m experienced with home and professional grade acid peels and while effective, most people will experience an intense burning sensation, while others (myself included, will find it way too painful. In general, no home peel should be left on for more than 1-2 minutes regardless, but this one is hard to keep even for one minute. Sensible, thin, injured or irritated skins stay away from it. The same if you haven&#x27;t had strong peels in the past.&lt;br /&gt;SUNSCREEN is absolutely MANDATORY after applying this product, but you should make sunscreen use as part of your daily routine no matter what. No other method to avoid premature aging is more effective than everyday sunscreen protection, if you fry your face under the sun, don&#x27;t waste time and money on peelings or anti-aging products or procedures, as the sun light break collagen molecules, stimulate over pigmentation and oil glands, and more to make your skin wrinkled, flaccid, full of dark spots. It can prevent you from getting all old ironically, if you die from an aggressive skin cancer. Just put it on.</li>
    <li> The Eternity Peel pads are very effective in renewing the old dead skin!  They are definitely prescription strength so read the directions carefully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mainly for my Butt cause I am one of those people who struggle with pimples and acne on the buttocks area, so there&#x27;s plenty of acne spots, discoloration and so.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use this product for 3 times (5 days between each), I left it first time for 1 Min, second 2 Min and used 2 peels, third 3 min and used 2 peels as well.&lt;br /&gt;the Area where I have the most dryness is peeling alright, but the same can&#x27;t be said for other parts of my buttocks. it takes 2  or 3 days to start peeling then the peeling process lasts for days as well. I like the product, I see improvement with the texture of my skin but need more work and time with the discoloration even though its generally better. its not super drying, I use either normal body lotion or body butter once or twice a day, after I finish applying the peel I wash with cold water and that&#x27;s it, didn&#x27;t use neutralizer on anything like that&lt;br /&gt;I used it on My Face as well, it peeled well but still can&#x27;t see an improvement regarding the acne dark spots, yet I used it only 3 times for 1 minutes only so let&#x27;s hope for the best next time</li>
    <li> Professional grade peel. Be careful if you have not used glycolics before.  Start with level one.&lt;br /&gt;Use a neutralizer.&lt;br /&gt;A  rehydrating cream.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle scrub. (I love Vivite)&lt;br /&gt;I am using level two with way better&lt;br /&gt; results than salon peels.&lt;br /&gt;Again, this product works so be very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves or your hands will peel!&lt;br /&gt;I look younger and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This was a safe and effective peel for me. After many years of cystic acne and now as an adult I had acne scars left over and some of them deep. Since I have adult thick layered skin I decided to do the Eternity Level 2 peel and I was happy I did. I had very dry skin with acne so the Glycolic TCA and Mandelic acid is a better blend for dry skin types. Salicylic acid is more drying. The Level 1 peels would have not been able to penetrate my skin. Since this was my first peel ever the product was strong for me so the first application I could not leave it on for 1 minute like it says. I left it for about 30 to 40 seconds. So I decided to do it again then next day leaving it on longer at 1 minute and the third day for about 1 minute and 30 seconds. Then I was told that is not what I&#x27;m suppose to do. Please note you can not use it 3 days in a row. Just use it one day/once and leave it on longer but less than 2 minutes or according to how your skin feels. You can even use another pad right after the other one but only if your skin can take it and then wash off. If it is stinging too much wash it off immediately with cool water follow by one part baking soda and 3 parts water. Please follow instructions and do not exceed the time. If you have any questions go to Perfect Image website and click on contact us and send an e-mail and they will call you back...... After I finished applying this product I started to peel the next day starting with my chin area. It took a week for me to peel completely. Do not put to much moisturizer on just a light moisturizer and sunscreen only when you go out so the skin can peel faster. At night just wash your face with a very mild cleanser and don&#x27;t put nothing else on so your face can peel faster. Now my skin is Normal and seems to be going on the dry side again but not as bad as it was that is for sure. So right now my skin is Normal to Dry. Also It did smooth out my skin nicely and got rid of some of my acne but not all. The scars are still there but less noticeable and it did soften them very much. I do see how I might need another application of the Eternity peel since my skin was really bad like I said above. You have to wait at least 2 to 3 weeks before doing another application. After that then I can maintain it. Salicylic acid is more affective for acne but at the same time it&#x27;s more drying than anything else so I will not be able to use that since my skin is on the normal to dry side. I highly recommend this Eternity peel especially for those who have acne scars and dry adult thick layered skin. So far I am very happy with this product. Keep in mind the TCA is what gets deep into the skin to remove a more thicker layer off your skin. That is why this product worked so great. I peeled and did not have that much redness and drying at all. Yes your skin will feel tight until it peels but once it peels you will be so happy to see how soft your face is. This is how it&#x27;s suppose to be. This was the first time in a very long time I felt my actual face. Before this I had all these dead layers of skin that hardened over time and it felt like I had a mask on my face. That is not normal. But now my skin feels soft and normal and wonderful. So very happy with this peel. I highly recommend it. Thank you Perfect Image!ill there but less noticeable and it did soften them very much.

    <li> First of all, I have only used it 3 times. But, the areas  that I used it on, like my cleavage  , are peeling away my wrinkles and age spots. It hurts on the face, I could only use it for 1 minute before dunking my face in cold water, but it definitely seems to be working. My face feels like its really dry, but I am assuming that&#x27;s part of the peeling process. I can see some peeling on my face, so I hope that my age spots and fine lines will be disappearing soon. Right now it seems to be doing exactly what it says it does. I&#x27;ll know for sure in the next month or two.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but after over ten years of using peels - numerous, numerous peels, mostly bought off of the Internet, often high potency - this finally is one that delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything different from what I&#x27;m used to with peels: tightening and buffing/polishing my skin. They haven&#x27;t been able to budge my melasma, and I sometimes suspect they are actually part of the cause. (Why, then, do I keep on using them? I don&#x27;t know the cause for sure, for one. And acid peels still rejuvenate the skin and thicken collagen. I want these benefits.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these pads for convenience sake. There isn&#x27;t any indication of percentages for the acids, hence I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be crazy potent, even if you are advised to leave it on for under two minutes. Which is fairly short, even for a peel, and would actually indicate serious potency. And indeed, potent it is! Even for my elephant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the results: what I absolutely love about these pads, is that they actually make me peel. That is something where even Perfect Image&#x27;s other peel products, like TCA and Lactic Acid, by and large fail. With other acids I will sometimes get some crust-like skin in isolated spots (highly annoying and tends to make me scratch, with danger of damaging my skin) but never a soft overall continuous peeling. And that&#x27;s exactly what Eternity Peel pads succeed in doing. I start peeling after a day or two, three, and then peel for about two, three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this soft overall peeling, my skin is left not just tighter, buffed and fresh looking. My skin has actually lightened and my melasma has noticeably improved. Not gone after a mere two rounds, mind you, but improved which is major. My melasma has been stubborn as a mule. Apparently each person&#x27;s skin responds to a very particular configuration of acids and ingredients, and this may well be the magic formula for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope improvement will continue, and I will gladly keep on using this convenient and effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: I use Perfect Image&#x27;s hydra repair wrinkle cream for two nights after, and then continue with the hydra repair COMBINED with Vit. C (ascorbic acid powder). Either it is coincidence or this actually speeds up and possibly even intensifies the peeling, and perhaps helps the lightening of my skin as well. During the day I apply two to three times very high SPF and UVA ++++ protection. That&#x27;s it. Highly recommended.ll gladly keep on using this convenient and effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: I use Perfect Image&#x27;s hydra repair wrinkle cream for two nights after, and then continue with the hydra repair COMBINED with Vit.

    <li> EXTREMELY effective!  NOT recommended for beginners or inexperience users-you will get chemical burns if not careful or inexperience at using this.  Highly recommended if you have experience with using chemical peels.  Definitely wear vinyl gloves to protect Palm/fingers from peeling.  Sunscreen is a must if stepping outdoors.</li>
    <li> Works great with no down time</li>
    <li> Great product!  Peeled after a few days and my skin looked great!</li>
    <li> WOW! This is EXCELLENT for first timers and also seasoned Chemical peelers. This Perfect Image line quickly became my favorite when I tried the 20% &amp; 30% gel serum peels.  I decided to try these pads on a shopping whim &amp; let me say they are even more amazing!  You can seriously get a professional level peel from these products &amp; adjust it to your own skin by experimenting with amount of product &amp; length of time you leave them on. As anyone who has done peels knows, you can easily spend $200 just to get a minor TCH peel at the dermatologist. To be able to do a real peel at your home on your own schedule as often as you want is amazing and certainly CAN SAVE YOU HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.. SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel is quite simple:  Wash face, dry well, wipe pad across skin. Fan if it burns.  On your first time you will likely see a white frosting on part or all of your skin.  You will feel a tingling strong enough to make you concerned. *****On your 1st peel, rinse product off within your comfort level 30-60 seconds &amp; rinse well. PAT afterwards - DO NOT rub in any way.  I like to follow with an over the counter cortisone cream or even better an ointment. Your skin will instantly appear smoother BUT can get dry &amp; peel-like within a few days. ***** If you want to get a much deeper peel: Wash your face thoroughly &amp; use a scrub to exfoliate. Dry thoroughly as before. Place product on skin coating all areas &amp; even neck &amp; chest area on breast bone to minimize wrinkles and sun spots in this area. As it starts to tingle/burn (this is same stuff that happens in the office) apply an additional layer of product.  As it whitens you&#x27;ll know what to do, washing immediately with cold water to get rid of and shut office the activation.  Cool water is critical. Light patting.  DO NOT be afraid of the flakes, whiteness nor  tightness of skin **** Again, apply Cortisone afterwards.  I am fond of using a product like Neosporin as they make it with a pain reliever and healsminor cuts that may occur as peeling.  *** Your skin will gently flake off in the shower, rub gently with finger in small circles moisturizing everyday.  The stronger &amp; thus deeper peels mean business! Some people need to stay away from work for a few days.  The skin gets dry, tight &amp; darkens as if the skin prepares to remove wrinkles, sun spots etc.  This looks like you&#x27;ve a magic machine that stole all your freckles and grouped them together! Be patient on doing last step!</li>
    <li> These pads do wonders for my skin. I followed the instructions exactly and voila - my skin feels smoother than it does after a dermatologist&#x27;s microdermabrasion session.&lt;br /&gt;The process stung a little (very minor stinging), however, it was short lived and it was alleviated as soon as I splashed water on my face and neck, to rinse off the peel. My skin was left a slightly flushed, very silky, smooth and with a healthy sheen to it. I&#x27;m very happy with these peels and would recommend them. I purchased this product as promotional sample in return for testing it and sharing my objective opinion of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 44 year-old white male. I&#x27;ve been getting professional peels and microdermabrasion every month for 13 years. These pads deliver a peel that is equal to, if not more intense, than my professional peels. These pads are definitely not for someone who is inexperienced. You can deliver serious damage if used incorrectly...they are that strong!!! However, if used correctly, you get a quality peel at a great price. Due to the results, I&#x27;ve even considered only getting a professional peel only every two months since discovering this product.</li>
    <li> Stings but it works.  Do not exceed the recommended time.</li>
    <li> I was excited about using this peel but The product was leaking and the box wet when received. The Pads on top are dried out. The protective layer around jar was in place and not broken but the lid was not screwed on tight allowing the liquid and moisture to escape. I won&#x27;t be using for fear of contamination. The box is too wet and damaged to return. At this point I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money because I also bought the pre-cleanser and follow up lotion which without the actual peel are worthless to me.</li>
    <li> First time using an acid peel so was a little nervous.  Had on about a minute and rinsed off.  Not too sensitive afterwards.  My face didn&#x27;t flake off like I thought it would it just became rough to the touch for about 2 weeks.  I hope it worked, I think it worked.  Am waiting to use it again to leave on longer and see if it sloughs more.  Overall happy with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different peels over the past 3 years and this one gives me the best results. I get a great peel and dewy fresh new skin. Here&#x27;s my routine:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gently wash&lt;br /&gt;2. Steam&lt;br /&gt;3. Dermaroll&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply peel pad.&lt;br /&gt;5. After 2 minutes, apply another peel pad over skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wait 2 minutes more for a total of 4 minutes. Please use caution. It burns like hell, but know your limit.&lt;br /&gt;7. Use a baking soda paste or ph neutralizer to neutralize acid in peel.  This is very important. It stops the acid from working.&lt;br /&gt;8. Rinse&lt;br /&gt;9. Slather up with hyuralonic acid and crisco shortening</li>
    <li> WOW be ready for a great peel and do not use this one if you are not experienced!! I love it and it works awesome for me because I have been doing them for years....this is NOT a beginners peel.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me, almost as well as a TCA peel I paid for at a spa.</li>
    <li> Love this peel for &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; peels.  I usually peel 2-3 days after the peel for about 5 days. Nothing serious, just a nice, even peel. Once it&#x27;s done...i have amazing clear, glowing skin with no breakouts!  A great deep peel. Thanks again for another amazing product!!</li>
    <li> this peel works amazingly to give you clear , young skin. I use it everyday .Better than well known peels</li>
    <li> These pads really give a good peel.  I leave on for about 2-3 minutes (and it really starts to burn).  The peeling usually begins around the second day and lasts for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This is my second purchase of this product.  I really love how these make my face look.  I usually do a series of treatments, once a week for about 4 weeks.  It is amazing how my skin looks by the 3rd day.  Once recommendation--I use a gauze pad to hold onto the pad when applying.  If you use your bare hands, your fingers will start peel as well.</li>
    <li> Great peel.....this is my second jar...</li>
    <li> Like many on this board, I&#x27;ve used other Perfect Image products and am experienced with peels.  The Eternity Peel is a strong, strong product. Follow the directions to the letter and you will have great results.  I used the peel pad and at 60 seconds couldn&#x27;t wait to start flushing my face with cold water.  The next day, my face was tight and shiny - a clear indication of what was developing. By day three, I started to lightly flake and continued to flake evenly over my entire face for the next few days.  I&#x27;m all refreshed and looking forward to my next peel.  For those of you who are battling acne, melasma, or like me, plain old fashioned age spots, do not judge the product or results after just one peel.  Use your peel pad consistently - every three weeks to four weeks - and you will see results in a few months.  If you peel more frequently, you begin to damage your skin and make it more vulnerable to all the maladies you&#x27;re trying to fix.  Patience is a virtue: give your peel four to six months.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I leave it on about 5 minutes. I am used to peels and have fair skin. Two to three days later my skin starts to peel. I love the convenience of the pads. They are a little flimsy but that is ok. Just don&#x27;t wipe too hard.</li>
    <li> Amazing product left my skin smooth and clear I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Eeee! Got a greasy box with the product all leaked out. Never had a chance to use it ewwww</li>
