      <li>VERY NICE BRUSH ,,I LIKED THE BRISTLES ,JUST THE RIGHT STIFFNESS  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I finally checked the mens department, because this is perfect!</li>
      <li>My mom had her brush for many, many years</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>But because of this, I cannot give it more than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the wider style better</li>
      <li>She love hers too.</li>
      <li>Apparently, most brushes that look like this are made with boar bristles, and not nylon.</li>
      <li>Gets through all hair types easily.</li>
      <li>And it looks pretty nice too.</li>
      <li>It is pure nylon bristles and nice for the price.</li>
      <li>Great for short wavy hair.</li>

      <li>Somehow I came to have two brushes that were exactly the same, that none of my sisters liked because they weren&#x27;t good for their hair.</li>
      <li>This brush is great for long hair, gets the knots out.  </li>
      <li>The bristles began falling out the very first time I used it, leaving a hole in the brush.  </li>
      <li>This is a great hair brush,  It is firm enough to give your scalp a good feeling, and does not tangle hair.  </li>
      <li>Being an older man its important to brush the hair with the right stiffness of the bristles.</li>
      <li>I have bought many a different brushes, but couldn&#x27;t find the right one.  </li>
      <li>Best brush I&#x27;ve ever had for my very thick hair!</li>
      <li>The next time, more bristles fell out.</li>
      <li>Great brush for thick hair</li>
      <li>This is exactly the brush I had been looking for to replace one I&#x27;ve had for decades.  </li>
      <li>I have thick hair and this brush is great for me.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>Would be great for someone with very dense, coarse hair that they aren&#x27;t trying to grow very long.</li>
      <li>My family does a my favorite new thing gift for Christmas and this may be my gift next year.</li>
      <li>The Diane Extra Firm Nylon Bristles Styling Brush came through looking pretty good, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  </li>
      <li>As the youngest of several siblings, I generally just got passed along most things.</li>
      <li>Better would be with 7 or 9 rows (paddle style), which would require less passes to leave the hair fully combed.</li>
      <li>The Diane brush with 5 rows of Extra Firm Nylon Bristles is a good brush.</li>
      <li>For years, I tried finding replacements for these brushes--and even when I bought new ones that I thought were similar--they weren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It always felt like I was trying to brush my hair with a cheap paint brush, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why these brushes that looked and felt the same actually had very soft bristles and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;dig into\\&quot;</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll likely have a better experience than me (judging by the other reviews).</li>
      <li>The bristles are slightly different on this one and the handle is a little skinnier, but overall it is just as good as my old one.</li>
      <li>I have hair that goes most of the way down my back</li>
      <li>This brush is really hard according to my family, but I love it.</li>
      <li>A soft brush wouldn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve used it for a month so far, without any others falling out.</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS BRISTLES, IT COMBS MY HAIR</li>
      <li>AS THE OLD ONE...</li>
      <li>all the back and forth was very tiring</li>
      <li>therefore I did not enjoy exactly the whole brush because the bristles were falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first picked it up it was lighter than expected but it feels sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I had one similar when I was young, my daughter took it when she moved out.  </li>
      <li>I went back to my trusty old hair brush by Goody.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m old enough I finally have one for myself!</li>
      <li>My mom has used this same brush in my hair since I was old enough to have it used on me.</li>
      <li>I wore the old one out pretty bad and wanted a fresh new one.</li>
      <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t write a review on anything, but I want to save other people from being taken like I was.  </li>

<li> I have searched the world over, seriously, for a hard brush that would work for my hair and feel *nice to me</li>
<li> The bristles are firmly attached, and should last a decent length of time.  </li>
<li> Very firm bristles and well made with real wood.</li>
<li> ; long.</li>
<li> All of the brushes I looked at in stores, and all the ones I ordered from the ladies department, were way too soft to dislodge dried sebum from my scalp.  </li>
<li> and where I live it is hard to find if any are here at all.</li>
<li> They leave my hair looking like it has little sections in it when I brush it back</li>
<li> bristles are truly extra firm.</li>
<li> Bristles are stiff enough and it was close to what I was looking</li>
<li> However, my hair is a very odd mix of slightly curly and a little thin and these brushes worked just fabulously on them.</li>
<li> I wanted to feel the brush on my scalp but not hurt by having sharp bristles.  </li>
<li> When they say extra firm, they mean extra firm!</li>
<li> I have long, thick, curly hair, and I need to scrape my scalp and draw dead skin and oils away from to be washed away.  </li>
<li> bought for teen with very thick wiry hair.</li>
<li> What&#x27;s worse is that they were left in my hair</li>
<li> but I would have preferred it to be a round brush</li>
<li> The bristles are a bit too harsh for my hair/scalp</li>
<li> Combs are way in the past for me.</li>
<li> Not sure why they are not longer.</li>
<li> He usually makes me chase him when it&#x27;s time to be groomed</li>
<li> I have always used a thick bristle brush like this in my hair</li>
<li> Unfortunately, probably because my hair is a little curly--these boar bristles are just wholly ineffective.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pathetic that it&#x27;s taken me into my 20s to figure this out, but at least I know what to look for in the future.</li>
<li> /&gt;So sad</li>
<li> Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t used it since.  </li>
<li> The bristles of the brush were falling out like crazy and then I contacted the seller.  </li>
<li> and I just hate the way they feel.</li>

    <li> bought for teen with very thick wiry hair. works well. bristles are truly extra firm.</li>
    <li> Gets through all hair types easily. Great for short wavy hair. Very firm bristles and well made with real wood.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, well made brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair brush,  It is firm enough to give your scalp a good feeling, and does not tangle hair.  I am ordering a second one to have at work.  I have fine hair, and it gives it a good lift.  The price is unbeatable, even with shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this brush is great for me. Bought one for my daughter. She love hers too.</li>
    <li> As the youngest of several siblings, I generally just got passed along most things. Somehow I came to have two brushes that were exactly the same, that none of my sisters liked because they weren&#x27;t good for their hair. However, my hair is a very odd mix of slightly curly and a little thin and these brushes worked just fabulously on them. For years, I tried finding replacements for these brushes--and even when I bought new ones that I thought were similar--they weren&#x27;t. It always felt like I was trying to brush my hair with a cheap paint brush, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why these brushes that looked and felt the same actually had very soft bristles and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;dig into\\&quot; my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reinforced nylon is the answer. Apparently, most brushes that look like this are made with boar bristles, and not nylon. Unfortunately, probably because my hair is a little curly--these boar bristles are just wholly ineffective. It&#x27;s a little pathetic that it&#x27;s taken me into my 20s to figure this out, but at least I know what to look for in the future. As for this actual brush, it looks just about as pictured in the preview pic and feels quality. Works beautifully for me. Recommended for those people who need this type of brush, but with stronger bristles.</li>
    <li> Fairly good quality. I like the wood. And it looks pretty nice too. Not too &#x27;femmy&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the fist time I used it (normal use), one set of bristles fell out, leaving a single empty hole. Not too big of a deal for me. The brush still works. And I&#x27;ve used it for a month so far, without any others falling out. But because of this, I cannot give it more than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll likely have a better experience than me (judging by the other reviews). I seem to always get that one in a thousand item that is junk, when all others are completely happy with theirs. It&#x27;s like a reverse lottery with me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush thought It would have been better though the bristles were good but I would have preferred it to be a round brush</li>
    <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t write a review on anything, but I want to save other people from being taken like I was.  The Diane Extra Firm Nylon Bristles Styling Brush came through looking pretty good, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  The bristles began falling out the very first time I used it, leaving a hole in the brush.  The next time, more bristles fell out. What&#x27;s worse is that they were left in my hair and I had to comb them out.  At last count (about 2 months ago), there were 26 holes in my brush where the bristles had been.  Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t used it since.  I went back to my trusty old hair brush by Goody.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> My mom had her brush for many, many years and where I live it is hard to find if any are here at all. So I ordered it on line. It is just a great brush. I love it</li>
    <li> My mom has used this same brush in my hair since I was old enough to have it used on me. Now that I&#x27;m old enough I finally have one for myself! I&#x27;ve always loved what this brush did fort hair and I wouldn&#x27;t change brushes ever.</li>
    <li> The bristles of the brush were falling out like crazy and then I contacted the seller.  The seller  told me to contact Diane company and that&#x27;s what I did then the Diane company said I need to speak to the company i actually bought the brush from and there needs to be a replacement,  all the back and forth was very tiring therefore I did not enjoy exactly the whole brush because the bristles were falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sad because the brush was good in the beginning then didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for long hair, gets the knots out.  I had one similar when I was young, my daughter took it when she moved out.  I have bought many a different brushes, but couldn&#x27;t find the right one.  THIS IS IT!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the brush I had been looking for to replace one I&#x27;ve had for decades.  All of the brushes I looked at in stores, and all the ones I ordered from the ladies department, were way too soft to dislodge dried sebum from my scalp.  I have long, thick, curly hair, and I need to scrape my scalp and draw dead skin and oils away from to be washed away.  A soft brush wouldn&#x27;t do it.  Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I finally checked the mens department, because this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I give them away, buy them for others because it feels great on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I LOOKED AT EVERY COMB KNOWN TO  MAN, ON AMAZON, AND THE CLOSEST TO THE ONE I HAVE USED OVER THREE DECADES, WAS THIS ONE...ALTHO IT IS NOT IDENTICAL AS FAR AS BRISTLES, IT COMBS MY HAIR ALMOST THE SAME WAY AS THE OLD ONE...THE PRICE WAS GOOD, AND SHIPMENT CAME VERY QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> I have searched the world over, seriously, for a hard brush that would work for my hair and feel *nice to me*. This brush is really hard according to my family, but I love it. It is the same as a brush that I have been using since childhood (a boar bristle British variety) and this is going to replace it. I like the wider style better and I own that as well.</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claims.</li>
    <li> The Diane brush with 5 rows of Extra Firm Nylon Bristles is a good brush. Just over 8&amp;#34; long. Better would be with 7 or 9 rows (paddle style), which would require less passes to leave the hair fully combed.</li>
    <li> One or two reviews gave me the impression this had boars hair mixed with the nylon. It is pure nylon bristles and nice for the price. It was just an add on to get free shipping so what the heck.</li>
    <li> This was actually the one my husband had and I stole his and he stole mine. I wore the old one out pretty bad and wanted a fresh new one. The bristles are slightly different on this one and the handle is a little skinnier, but overall it is just as good as my old one. I have hair that goes most of the way down my back and I cannot stand that plastic, nubby bristled brushes. They leave my hair looking like it has little sections in it when I brush it back and I just hate the way they feel. I have always used a thick bristle brush like this in my hair and I swear by them!</li>
    <li> Bristles are stiff enough and it was close to what I was looking for(Old style Goody&#x27;s)but the bristles are too short!!! Not sure why they are not longer. Feels like a rake not a brush.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever had for my very thick hair!</li>
    <li> Being an older man its important to brush the hair with the right stiffness of the bristles. Combs are way in the past for me.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE BRUSH ,,I LIKED THE BRISTLES ,JUST THE RIGHT STIFFNESS  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because the bristles are arranged in five rows, with the best length, the best stiffness.  The bristles are firmly attached, and should last a decent length of time.  I bought three in order insure myself they will be there well into the future.</li>
    <li> When they say extra firm, they mean extra firm! Would be great for someone with very dense, coarse hair that they aren&#x27;t trying to grow very long. The bristles are a bit too harsh for my hair/scalp but I&#x27;ve been using it on my Lhasa Poo and he loves it!  He usually makes me chase him when it&#x27;s time to be groomed but he actually lies in my lap while I brush him with this. Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I wanted a brush that would &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; through my hair.  I wanted to feel the brush on my scalp but not hurt by having sharp bristles.  This is a happy purchase.  When I first picked it up it was lighter than expected but it feels sturdy.  My family does a my favorite new thing gift for Christmas and this may be my gift next year.</li>
    <li> Great brush for thick hair</li>
