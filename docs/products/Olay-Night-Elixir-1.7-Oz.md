<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Work great. The product being in a pump is a major plus as the product does not get contaminated. The results depend on if you keep up using it.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I found this product by reading r/skincareaddiction on reddit.com. My skin is really sensitive to salicylic acid and I was afraid I could not use this but I was fine.&lt;br /&gt;I might try Paula&#x27;s Choice next but I will return to this product if it ends up working better. My skin is very clear and glowing.</li>
    <li> My mom and aunt both use this, so I decided to try it (Mom is in her 50s, I&#x27;m 27). It&#x27;s incredible. Like both my mom and my aunt, I have suffered from acne and have spent a lot of time in the sun. The acne left both types of scarring- the dents and the dark spots. And we all know the sun can leave a host of damage to the skin, even if you&#x27;re using sunscreen. While it hasn&#x27;t completely rid me of the little freckles/sun spots by my eyes the way it has for my aunt, it has ERASED my dark spots and shallow scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably different since I started using this a year ago. It&#x27;s smoother, more even toned, and the marks that I do get from the occasional pimple now (I attribute the fewer breakouts in-part to this serum) are gone much faster than before. After a few months of using this (my first bottle), i noticed that I really didn&#x27;t need all the foundation and concealer I&#x27;d been using. Now I just prefer to use a tinted moisturizer (Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth trying for yourself. Prices seem to vary a LOT depending on where you get it - I just saw it yesterday at RiteAid for 32$. Amazon seems to have the best price so far.</li>
    <li> I started to use this about a year ago instead of the purple night cream and I have yet to see a  wrinkle surface! I turned 40 this past year and can pass much younger. I love this product because it works as advertised ( like most of Olay&#x27;s products) but it isn&#x27;t thick, in fact you have to use it sparingly. Once you go over your face with it you need not touch it again. Non oily, non pore clogging, and scent free. This has been a product on my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list ever since I first tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this! There&#x27;s not that many products that I see difference with my skin pretty quickly (not overnight, but within a week or so). I have normal skin, I&#x27;m 31 but with no real wrinkles and a few freckles; but I do get some stress breakouts and I&#x27;m prone to both milia and rosacea. This stuff has softened the freckles, prevents milia, and doesn&#x27;t irritate rosacea. After prolonged use, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a significant overall improvement. And, the Environmental Working Group has rated it a 4 out 10 for cosmetics safety (where lower is better); a 4 isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s much lower than most anti-aging products on the market--and, to wit, I haven&#x27;t found one with a lower rating that&#x27;s any where as effective as this. So until that holy grail comes, this is my long term product pick. I use it with MyChelle Dermaceuticals Unscented Honeydew cleanser and John Masters SPF 30 moisturizer, and I&#x27;m set to go.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product it feels like it is quality going on and my face feels taken care of using it.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for this product. I&#x27;ve been happy with all the other Oil of Olay I&#x27;ve used but this falls short of my expectations. First, even 30 mins after applying a thin layer my face feels sticky. I sleep on my stomach and don&#x27;t like laying my face on my pillow when it feels like that. I also haven&#x27;t seen much benefit from it, but I may not have used it long enough. I stopped after the first week.</li>
    <li> I got a good deal with the $20 rebate from Olay for purchasing the items. I purchased 3 items, the night resurfacing elixir, the firming moisturizer and the wrinkle reducing cream, so it&#x27;s hard to say what&#x27;s doing the most. I have a very hard time remembering to do the resurfacing every night, but I am averaging about 3 times a week. My skin is looking better.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a bit too strong for my skin. It burns a bit after I put it on &amp; doesn&#x27;t really seem to moisturize much. My skin actually feels a bit irritated &amp; looks more blotchy than it did before I started using it. I was really hoping to like this product so I could use it as a replacement for my usual Boots no 7 Protect &amp; Perfect Serum Intense, because the Olay is cheaper &amp; contains more product. But...I&#x27;m sad to say this Olay product is not for me. I will be going back to my usual Boots no 7 product even though it costs more!</li>
    <li> I would give this a &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;A would be Burt&#x27;s bees night creme</li>
    <li> I bought this as my skin seemed dry, washed out, rough and I hadn&#x27;t had a facial in years.  I&#x27;d read a dermatologist say that you don&#x27;t have to pay boutique prices for boutique expensive skin care because the big companies like Olay spend a lot on research and development--they have big budgets, sell a lot, and their products have to be good.    I put this on at night and within a few days my skin was smooth, brighter, not rough and tighter. I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that last feature.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting a mini-facial or peel while I sleep. I was thrilled with the results, and am going to buy some more Olay products.  I feel like I&#x27;m taking good care of my skin without spending a lot of $$$$.</li>
    <li> I used this every night. I also used it on my husband&#x27;s face at night. I truly see the glows and lighten of the skin on his face. We loved it!.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for one week. I&#x27;d like to say that&#x27;s a good stuff. Thank you, seller!</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay and decided to give this one a try.  Have to say I was very dissapointed in it.  I&#x27;m usually not one to break out in pimples from using face cream, but after using this, I did, and not in the normal zones such as my forehead or chin, but I was getting pimples on my cheeks!!!  Will never use this again.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks ago as soon as I heard about it because my sister&#x27;s wedding was coming up. The very next day after I used it, my skin already looked so much nicer and smoother. I was in my sister&#x27;s wedding this weekend and I received great compliments about how young I look. I am 42 and one of my friends who I think is 10 years younger asked what my secret is to looking so young. I told her to try this product. I also heard that I was glowing in some of the pictures from the wedding. I would say this stuff really works and it has only been 2 weeks since I started using it. It&#x27;s awesome, and Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product; it really works as claimed, which was a pleasant surprise! Highly recommended. After only a couple days I noticed smaller pores and smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive facial skin and tend to have skin allergy. I used Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream &amp; Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex and they work good on me. So, I give Night Resurfacing Elixir a try as they&#x27;re the same product line. I like the light gel quality but after 1 minute it started to sting my face. I tried it for 3 days but still it&#x27;s the same stingy sensation on my face. May be it&#x27;s just me, but this might help for sensitive skin people like me.</li>
    <li> This elixir has a light gel-like consistency and dispenses easily from the pump dispenser. Although it might look and feel a little bit more classy and high end in a glass bottle, I have no complaints with the packaging. I&#x27;ve broken a few glass bottles in my time, so it&#x27;s probably better this way anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains glycolic acid. Think of it as a mini chemical peel but not so drastic. Unless you&#x27;re allergic to it, you shouldn&#x27;t come home with a red face. At the same time the elixir&#x27;s antioxidants and moisturizers provide soothing hydration to tighten skin&#x27;s surface. It is oil-free and fragrance-free, although it has a very slight scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay says that you should see a marked improvement in your skin in as little as seven days if used on a nightly basis. It is not recommended for daytime usage as glycolic acid can make the skin more sun sensitive. In fact, it is recommended that you use a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 during the day if you use this product at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need about two pumps from the bottle as I use the elixir not only on my face, but also on my neck and chest. It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin. I&#x27;m able to apply around my eyes with no problem.  Although it is a gel, it is not sticky at all, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and noticeably firmer immediately upon application. The elixir absorbs quickly, but allow about 5 minutes if you put a moisturizer on afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay says that you can use this product in lieu of a regular nighttime moisturizer. Perhaps in my younger days I might have, but I live in a dry environment, so I usually follow up with their Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. That being said, sometimes my skin does get a bit oily so I do sometimes skip the heavier cream and just use the Elixir. It&#x27;s great for those days as it is not a heavy moisturizer, but yet it provides sufficient hydration for normal/combination skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this about three months now and I feel like it has really improved my skin. In particular my neck area was not as firm as it once was and since using this product I&#x27;ve noted a marked improvement in the firmness of this area. My skin is remarkably smoother as well. I also noted that my moisturizer works better when I use it combination with the elixir. Perhaps the exfoliating of the glycolic acid makes the moisturizer absorb better into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product! 5 starsIn particular my neck area was not as firm as it once was and since using this product I&#x27;ve noted a marked improvement in the firmness of this area.

    <li> My serum got here really quickly and I really love the way it feels on my skin.  I will now be a regular user.</li>
    <li> I have used olay and neutragena products for a long time, however, the Olay night resufacing elixir is one of the best I have ever tried!!</li>
    <li> I was a devoted Nivea fan for years and because the availability became challenging, I looked for another comparable product. This is a better product, we live in a very dry climate and it works for me.</li>
    <li> Call me a bit nuts, but I really wanted to be able to see if this product worked. So, I purchased the \\&quot;Anti-Aging Moisturize Night Resurfacing Elixir,\\&quot; and for the first six nights, applied it only to the right side of my face. To keep the experiment fair, on the left, I continued using just my regular night time product, \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream.\\&quot; Please note, I am 47, have always used Olay products (though until 40, that meant the old fall back, \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot; with or without sun screen). My skin is pretty good for my age, but I would like it to be even better. Hence, the interest in the \\&quot;resurfacing elixir.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of use, the right side of my face looked the same, maybe the skin was a bit smoother to the touch. After four days, a *very* close inspection revealed smoother pores on the treated side. By days five and six, I actually could see a subtle improvement in my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes, and some lines from the corner of my mouth. After a full six nights of treatment, I could see that the slightly hanging jowl on my right jaw was not hanging as much as the one on the left side, and the scar on my throat (from surgery years ago) was tightened up on the right, more than the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had a good \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture. Was I lopsided before I started? Did the scar look much better on the right than the left before? Did the jowl always hang more on the left? Well, the answer to that will have to wait a few days, for the reverse treatment this week. Starting last night I put the Resurfacing Elixer on the left, and the Micro-Sculpting Cream on the right. Next week I will post what happens. I&#x27;m particularly interested to see if the left jowl raises up to be more even with the right, and if my throat scar looks better. But also the regular stuff: the crow&#x27;s feet, and the smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I get the impression that this product improved my skin, I gave it only 4-stars because of the subtlety of the results. I&#x27;d post a picture, but the results are so subtle, I can&#x27;t seem to get them to show up in a photo. I suspect a professional photographer with special lighting could bring out the comparison. But sans professional photographer, I&#x27;ll have to offer up only my words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping I have something good to report next week! (It will be added as a comment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Who the heck named this stuff? Awkward!results are so subtle, I can&#x27;t seem to get them to show up in a photo.

    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  It dried out my skin and left it dry and painful.  When I attempt to return to the seller I was told they would only take it back if I didn&#x27;t open it... how else I would know it it going to bother my skin??? From reading the label?  This product didn&#x27;t sell at the pharmacy or Target near me so I had to get it online to tried.  Bottom line, olay put too much perfumes in their product that end up bother my skin so if you have a sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use it. And unless you know the product will work for you, don&#x27;t get it from buybelow through amazon, their customer service sucks and amazon won&#x27;t do anything since they didn&#x27;t sell it to you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now (I know you&#x27;re supposed to wait at least a month for full results!), and I already feel like my skin does looks tighter and the fine lines on my forehead are smoothed out. I&#x27;m going to keep using nightly, and hopefully it will keep living up to my expectations!</li>
    <li> Good mild resurfacing product for an excellent price. The bottle lasted almost all winter because it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the entire face. I think it is worth the price point to resurface your skin. For a tip, don&#x27;t use this product and go into the sun or a tanning bed. It is a part of a good winter skin care regiment. Can be used by men or women. Some guys are afraid to use traditionally &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; brands. That&#x27;s silly. Women have a lot more to choose from, and they work. Plus, it is not effeminate to use any product that makes your skin look good. Who doesn&#x27;t want that? Just buy it. You will be glad you did. If you are afraid your friends will see you in the  women&#x27;s isle have your girlfriend or a friend do it for you. Actually, your male friends may ask you what you are using on your skin when they see the excellent results.</li>
    <li> Looks very questionable. Is this tge authentic olay product or replica? Reallllllly looks like cheap Olay.very cheap looking does anyone kno?</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb well.  I having oily skin and I&#x27;ve had breakouts since using it.  Feels sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for 25+ years to keep my 68-year old Irish skin soft &amp; clear.</li>
    <li> This product has done OK. After 7 weeks of use each night, I have noticed my small &amp;#34;chicken neck&amp;#34; has reduced slightly, but can see no other visible acions. My skin is still the same softness as before. You cannot use it around your eye&#x27;s, so you have to buy yet another product for that. Once you have put it on, you cannot do anything else for appx 5mins. It is greasy. I use a sleep mask, and now my sleep mask is very greasy and cannot be washed in hot water, so I need to buy a new one. Also,  you don&#x27;t want to touch anything after you have put it on or that will be greasy too.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle and I have to say \\&quot;How did I live without this product\\&quot;, my brown spots are fading and the wrinkles seem to be getting less noticeable. After only 2 weeks of use I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews for this and other OLAY Reginerist products, I bought it and the Daily Moisturizing serum.  After 2 months of faithful application:  Serum in the morning on a clean face; elixir in the evening on a clean face...EVERY day and night for 2 months....absolutely no change in my 51 year old skin.  I have a magnifying mirror that showed no change.  My jowls did not firm up like the other reviewer&#x27;s did.  My pores are not smaller or tighter.  My fine lines are still there if not more evident.  I do not smoke or drink alcohol.  I take care of my body with healthy eating and lifestyle.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND either of these two products.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay Facial products. I have been using the Regenerist line of  products and I like what they do. You can&#x27;t beat the results for the price.  I would recomend their products to my friends.  My grandaughter uses the gentle face cloths to wash her face in and the sensitive  moisturizer with the sunblock on her face. They are great products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks. The results are amazing. No more dark circles under my eyes and the fine lines around my eyes have improved by at least 50%. I noticed an improvement in days. My skin feels tighter and looks brighter. I just can&#x27;t believe I found something that actually works for a very reasonable price. I don&#x27;t think you will be dissapointed with this product, I love it.</li>
    <li> This product has been great for helping me get rid of open comedones and keeping those pores cleared out. It&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry your face out, and I am really sensitive to dry skin as I moved to a very dry climate from a very humid climate. Unfortunately, as it is an AHA, it&#x27;s not been much use for closed comedones. Use it at night instead of your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item a few weeks ago, and applied it to my face at night and i could feel a big difference in my skin first time use, the next morning i woke up and the wrinkles on my forehead were gone! this elixir doesnt have a strong fragrance, it didnt break out my skin, and didnt give me a headache it has excellent ingredients like grape seed and AHA&#x27;s the best i have used in a long time, ladies don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive skin care items, i have had that experience before and did not work for my skin as much as this item has, OLAY keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days, but what a difference!  My face feels more smooth and refreshed.    I would absolutely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Moisturize Night Resurfacing Elixir based on the recommendations for skin care on the olay.com website.  I discontinued use of this product due to the fact that it clogged my pores and resulted in acne.</li>
    <li> Does a really nice job of lightening darker spots on face.  Easy to use.  Absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER</li>
    <li> This is a second time purchase.  Over the approximately 12 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the Resurfacing Elixir, I can definitely tell a difference in skin smoothness and texture.  My skin feels tighter without being drying.  Small lines and wrinkles are less noticable.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with several Pro X products including the cleansing brush.  Will keep using indefinitely (I&#x27;m 67 years old).</li>
    <li> This is Olay&#x27;s best night time product, excellent in both content and use.  I love the elixir as it goes on so smoothly and makes the skin feel moisturized and exceptionally soft.  It is neither greasy nor heavy, suprisingly light and is so easy and quick to use!  Outstanding product which I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of products don&#x27;t work for me.  I decided to give this one a try and am so glad I did.  It literally \\&quot;glides\\&quot; onto your face and within seconds your skin feels so soft and smooth to the touch.  I&#x27;m hooked.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any outbursts or reddening of my skin.  I intend to keep using it and have since purchased a lot of their products.</li>
    <li> I used the product for about a month and although that wasn&#x27;t long enough to detect any noticible improvement, I had to stop using it because my skin is just too oily for this moisturizer.  I need more of a gel based product.  Also, for some reason I thought it contained retinol which it didn&#x27;t.  I think it would be a good product for someone with less oily skin than me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, so I&#x27;ve not seen much result yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful. My skin isn&#x27;t that dry, but I found that I need another layer of moisturizer on top of this at night.</li>
    <li> Received this Olay product with two others I purchased from Amazon. Upon opening the box I noticed that the product cover was not on tight and some of the contents had oozed out of the container and onto the inside of the box. This clearly looked like the box had been previously opened.  It appeared to be a return.  I mentioned it to Amazon in their shipping section but they never responded. One other Olay item, Regenerist Eye Cream, also appeared to be a return. The tube had been used and was only two thirds full. The last item was perfect and appeared to be fresh from the manufacturer.  I believe I could have sent the Moisturize or Eye Cream back for a replacement or refund but what good would that do?  I would still have to pay for the extra shipping costs. And a replacement could have been another old return that some other customer did not want. Like most people I do mail-order to save money.  When you think about paying for extra shipping, you need to ask yourself the question, why not just go down to the local discount store and buy it there?  At least you could verify that the product had not been tampered with.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent, I have noticed a difference in my skin and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. I reccomend this product and Olay Regenerist product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! You only need to use a very small amount, it spreads very easily, non-greasy. Sometimes even use it during the day when not wearing make-up. I could see a difference in the texture of my skin within a couple of days of use, even around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I purchased this almost a month ago.  I am 67 years old and have never used any type of anti-aging products except my usual routine of cleansing, moisturizing, etc.  I started developing wrinkles on both sides of my mouth and thought it was hopeless aside from some type of expensive procedure I couldn&#x27;t afford.  I used the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting serum for day and this Olay Regenerist anti-aging elixir at night.  In the meantime, I had a few breakouts but felt that my skin had to adjust to this new regimen.  I am simply amazed that this really, really works!!  I looked in the mirror this morning and was so stunned that I looked in several mirrors...the lines are almost totally gone.  I have never used any Olay products and I&#x27;m so very happy with these amazing results. My makeup looked so great today. I just keep looking in the mirror because I still can&#x27;t believe it!! Please give it time to work...don&#x27;t give up!  I am now a customer for life!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives skin a healthy glow.  Will continue to use on daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes use in conjunction with other products.  Still deciding.</li>
    <li> This has a real nice consistency when you put it on and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Good product at very good price. Received very quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased product and received today but it expired over a year ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent.. This product will enhance your skin, when you apply just one drop on your forehead, under your eyes, and sides.  Believe me I have been using this product for three years. I am being told that I look younger than my real age.  I even date females that are 20-25 years younger.  Dr. Bill</li>
    <li> I have been using the resurfacing elixir for one week and see a significant difference in my skin tone. I have been using Olay products for 15 years and am a devoted client.  The elixir has begun to reduce the deep smile lines around my mouth. I will continue to use the elixir and am eager to see the results in 30 days. By the way I am 62 years old and maintaining my youthful look is very important.  Thanks Olay-you never let me down.</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum. Nice weight and feel....not too heavy, not too light. I have oily skin so I am always wary about using thick night creams for fear of causing breakouts. However, this is a nice serum and I have confidence in Olay &amp; their products so I am sure in no time that I will see definite results. Even after using only one night, I woke up to less oily skin than usual and my skin was nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> More than satisfactory - works well with Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition.</li>
    <li> I use the whole line of Olay Regenerist products and like the simplicity of the routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite some time, and the price here is great.  I have always liked Olay Regenerist products, and I love the fact that I can use this as a &#x27;night cream&#x27; just by itself.  It makes my evening prep much more simple, so that I do it even when I&#x27;m really tired.  Does it work?  My face is soft and smooth each morning, and that&#x27;s all I ask.</li>
    <li> I liked the results of using this product. My skin did look smoother and felt softer. A word of caution though when using this-make sure you dont apply it near your eyes. The first time I used it I believe I used a little too much and too close to my eyes and woke up the following day with red, dry skin underneath my eyes- This product is strong-a little goes a long way! Also make sure you wear sunscreen when using it as per directions.</li>
    <li> I use the Olay Regenerist Anti-aging night resurfacing elixir at night and it is a relatively inexpensive anti-aging mousturizer.  During the day I use Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration regenerating cream and they both keep my face smooth and soft.  I used to use Este Lauder but now prefer Oil of  Olay.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and it is too soon to tell about it, but anything Olay is generally very good. (RETURNING TO THIS REVIEW: I have used this product for two months now and the compliments keep coming! Even my general practitioner-a woman--asked me what I was using because my skin looks, \\&quot;So lovely.\\&quot; I am now hooked and have spread the word to my friends who have commented on \\&quot;the glow.\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use after I cleanse my face at night.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My skin has shown a dramatic improvement in its appearance since using this product.  It has a healthier glow.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon has this on a subscription plan.  It is well worth it!</li>
    <li> It exfoliates as promised but made my face too red.  I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, but I met my Waterloo with this.</li>
    <li> Tragically, I discovered a big age spot right in the middle of my cheek.  Very distressing. After reading a ton of reviews I bought the Olay resurfacing elixer.  Additionally I boosted my  use of  the Nutrogena sun screen. As directed I applied this every night and I patiently waited for some improvement.  I did not see immediate results.  Very gradually I saw some fading of the brown spot.  Finally, after going through half of the bottle, the spot was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again.  It&#x27;s a very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this moisturizer for my mom and she is liking it so far. So Ofcourse I can&#x27;t say much about the product. But I would like to mention about this purchase. I recieved my product on time as mentioned. Which I love about amazon.</li>
    <li> I like Regenerist because I have adult acne and I am 50 , so it helps smooth and free my skin of acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of creams and lotions, this works the best for me. Others ( including the olay regenerist night cream) leave me with break outs. This feels light and no stickiness. Best of all my skin looks and feels great in the morning! This seems like a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; and moisturizer in one. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and never felt the need for serious skin care unti about a year ago. My forays into the world of night creams were not too successful. I was suspicious of high end creams and opted for inexpensive or mid priced options which did almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago I picked up the latest version of Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me and ordered this. I ordered this and another Olay serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been excellent. They didn&#x27;t come right away. It was at least ten days before I really saw a difference. But when the results stared to show, it was significant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and absolutely love it. I am 38 years old and have good skin (clear, even, not dry, not oily) but did have a few sun (dark) spots here and there due to my love of the sun and living in FL half of the year. I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this product...it tightens and clears your face while sleeping. It feels tingly and gel-like going on but tightens up quickly. My sun spots are mostly gone from this product...and while I am 38, I am constantly ID&#x27;d whenever I buy alcohol...so, I do believe that my nightly beauty routine is working...:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure as a 30 something that I thought my days of acne were over. Well due to a hormonal imbalanced caused by my birth control of choice, I have breakouts constantly. While using this product as directed, I began to notice more pores being blocked and turning into zits which was the point of purchasing this product. Maybe it works for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I had to stop using it. Such a shame as I heard such good things about it from my group of friends.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I sought it out after reading a great review on Paula&#x27;s Choice and was not disappointed. I apply it at night after washing my face and applying a toner, then let dry into the skin and apply moisturizer on top. There is no noticeable scent and the serum absorbs into the skin in a matter of minutes without leaving any residual feeling on your skin.  I initially bought this to help with acne scars due to the AHA component and have had some noticeable difference in my skin over the past 4-5 months of use. Additionally, my skin is so much smoother, which I noticed in the first week of use. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, an issue I have had with other glycolic-based products. I have even tried some other glycolic serums (MUAC&#x27;s, in particular) and they do not compare to the results I have had with this one.</li>
    <li> I use this every night under my Microsculpting serum and cream cocktail. I really noticed a different within the first week of use. Great for fine lines.  Deeper lines then more noticeable to me.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but I was disappointed to find that it was not filled up to the top. The ones in the store were not full to the top either, but were all filled to the top of the front label; this bottle had even less in it. I started to doubt whether the other Regenerist  product I purchased  was full. That one was in an opaque bottle, so I opened it and it wasn&#x27;t full, however, to be fair, I don&#x27;t know it it had 1.7 Fl Oz in it since I had no way of measuring it. I kept both items because of the extremely excellent price, even if they might have been light on weight.</li>
    <li> Arrived at record time, in good condition and as it is my first time using this product, I haven&#x27;t seen much difference but I love the feel, it&#x27;s not sticky especially in this heat wave........I think I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have non-sensitive combination skin and did not see any difference when using this. It isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me to wear alone -- like the product suggests. I went through about 2/3 of the bottle to give it a fair chance but will not be repurchasing. My skin simply was neither better nor worse while using this. After a couple skin care purchase flops on Amazon, I highly recommend going in-store and being 100% sure you&#x27;re getting a genuine product because every time I used this I doubted its authenticity.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A REASONABLE PRICE-I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 20 YEARS &amp; I LOOK AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THEN WOMEN I KNOW THAT USE THE EXPENSIVE STUFF.</li>
    <li> I started using this elixir a few weeks ago along with Olay Regenerist DNA superstructure cream SPF 30. I must be honest I haven&#x27;t used it every night, missed quite a few to be really honest but I have seen quite a change in my skin.  I told someone today that I am a grandmother and the ages of my children and she was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet child, she could not believe that I am 54 might I add again &amp;#34;sweet child&amp;#34; :-) she told me that I have such nice skin, I speak to her quite often and she never told me that before,  so I&#x27;m thinking that it has to be this wonderful elixir!&lt;br /&gt;So for all you young 54 year olds out there, take a page from this 54 year old and purchase this product you won&#x27;t be sorry or disappointed you can&#x27;t go wrong, only younger;-)&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review helps and God bless</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie, usually buying department store brands or from my dermatologist office. This is the best ant-aging glycolic treatment and the cost unbelievable. No longer do I spend 100$ plus on a night cream. The subscribe and save is convent and the extra savings a mere bonus. My skin is always bright and clear, it only takes a little product, if you over use your skin feels like a coating of gel in the morning. No need to use another product except for eye cream. I am 39 and my skin looks like it did in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Don&#x27;t know how it moisturizes but it does - when you apply it isn&#x27;t a cream or lotion, but my face loves it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum. Have been using for ages.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this online, I already have used up a bottle of the same product which I purchased at a local store and I would say, that was amazing! but this one I ordered online is not quite the same! It feels heavy &amp; thick and I hate the gel-like consistency of it unlike the 1st bottle I had bought at the store, that seemed original &amp; this one feels like counterfeit! I was really disappointed. I know I should feel the tingling sensation (just like how it felt with the 1st bottle that I already used up) but this one had no tingling effect whatsoever. And I know it&#x27;s supposed to have a mild scent to it but this one smells like a glue/paste. It makes my skin super oily, my husband was even making fun of me for looking like a greasy face. And I also had a breakout using this where in fact I very well know from my previous use of this same product that it really minimizes and eliminates bumps/pimples the very next day after applying it. Don&#x27;t trust buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, although I&#x27;m addicted to reading them for every product I purchase, but this product works wonders, first of all, im 29, so I dont have any wrinkles (and I plan to keep it that way for as long as possible) but I get a lot of blackheads along the jawline and underneath my chin, and this thing is helping clear that out, it feels smoother and although I still have some, I can only see them if I get real close, people often tell me I have beautiful skin and that makes my day.</li>
    <li> I have picky skin and Olay comes through for me every time great non-greasy and does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I purchased it a month ago and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  Will continue using it to see if, eventually, my skin does show an improvement.</li>
    <li> It certainly does help. It depends on the specific needs of your skin before one can say this works.  I have sensitive skin and I noticed this did help my acne and overall skin tone.  It does very very slightly resurface but very slightly. To see wrinkles fade I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;ll take a month or two and only slight lines vs deep lines.  I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone didn&#x27;t tolerate this well. It would be a great way for someone to dip in to acid peeling to see if it is a route they are interested in. Apply to a clean face  no need for moisturizer but if you like moisturizer apply 10 min later.</li>
    <li> Great BHA exfoliator! I decided to give this a try after reading the nice recommendation from Paula&#x27;s Choice, and I do love it! It&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the next day, your can feel your skin becoming smoother. I use it every other night, and I love it! Great stuff to recommend to everybody.</li>
    <li> I swear by this. I have very sensitive, fair skin and this is light. It works very well indeed to give a clearer, brighter complexion.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much more smooth and skin tone is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Have been getting compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple weeks now, not sure I&#x27;m really getting anything out of it, thought it does go on nicely.  It replaces your moisturizer, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as nice in the morning as when I use Olay&#x27;s beauty hydrating fluid (the pink bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick to exfoliation and the occasional gentle home peel.</li>
    <li> This truly is my second favorite facial product.  It gives the skin a most comfortable feeling of firming sensation, with just the tiniest amount having to be used to cover the entire face and neck area!  Have used this for two weeks now, and will never switch to another!  Getta ~</li>
    <li> This did nothing that it claimed to do. It was a waste of money for me and I would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a year ago to help with my dry, dull, and sometimes rough skin. I was amazed by the results the very first time I used this stuff. I woke up to brighter, softer skin and was VERY happy with the results. Here I am a year later and I haven&#x27;t had anymore issues with the dry skin I suffered from before. I have also made regular exfoliation a priority in my skin care regimen. Do yourself a favor and get this stuff! Your skin will thank you :)</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to paint</li>
    <li> I love lots of Olay products, and while this has a nice scent and makes my skin feel smooth after use, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement, so I probably will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This goes on like a Serum, and makes your skin feel oh...so...smooth!!!  Even for those of us with sensitive skin!  Yay!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on before bedtime (because of the glycolic acid--it has a good percentage), and wake up to skin that looks and feels soft and silky!!  I bought this at my Albertson&#x27;s before it closed, and purchased for a clearance price (so bought 3 bottles)!  I wish I had bought more, but who knew Olay would discontinue such a remarkable product?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad it is still on Amazon.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than a year and have been really pleased with it. I use it directly after my toner as it is an AHA Exfoliant. The texture is great and it&#x27;s gentle enough that I can use it nightly without any irritation. In addition to the exfoliation, it does contain some anti-oxidants as well as glycerin which helps. Because of the antioxidants, it is packaged in a amber colored bottle as antioxidants are slowly broken down when exposed to light. One more note about the efficacy is that make sure to check the expiration date. Recently I placed an order with Amazon seller &#x27;Sherman Bodega&#x27; and when I received it, it was completely expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to tell:  There is a code on the box and on the bottle - mine said &amp;#34;LOT 1173PRT&amp;#34;. You can enter that lot number at http://checkcosmetic.net &amp; it came up that it was made June 23, 2011 and is good for 36 months. I received it July 2, 2014. The key I&#x27;ve learned is to order it from Amazon directly instead of some other sellers unless you know who they are. It is a great product otherwise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used AHA products before and they&#x27;ve worked very well for me. I am a month into using this one, and it does nothing. My skin shows no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I like all of Olay products for skin care. I get compliments all the time about my complexion. I have been using these products for years. I was disappointed when I received mine, because the bottle was not full, as if some had been used. I purchase a lot of products from Amazon because I try to get the best price for the quality, especially in these hard times. Make sure when you order a new product, that it is just that , \\&quot;new\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks at night and can see a reduction in my crows feet.  I don&#x27;t know what some of the lady&#x27;s are doing to complain about the gooey  feeling.  Works for me and I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s!  This is my first time to use it and I won&#x27;t be without it.  Wish they had this when I was younger...all of Olay products work as well if not better than the very expensive items I used for years!!!</li>
    <li> I deleted my first review because I reviewed too quickly. The first week using this line was phenomenal. My skin looked and felt great. However, two months in, I&#x27;ve taken a turn for the worse. I don&#x27;t have problem skin. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it. I get the odd blemish now and again, but for the most part I&#x27;m clear. Holy bajoly, this stuff clogged my pores. I&#x27;m broken out, my skin is dull, and I look and feel like an oil slick. I have dry skin to the max, but you wouldn&#x27;t know that to look at me. I continued using this for several weeks past what I should because I blamed everything else under the sun: stress, hormones, weather, even food choices. But it&#x27;s clear to me now it&#x27;s the product.    I wanted this to work, mainly because I dropped about $100 on several products in this line, thinking if I went in for the whole load I&#x27;d get the best results. I figured eventually it would save me money. No, this was a fairly expensive mistake for me. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with skincare. I can&#x27;t think of any other brand, cheapo or department store, that caused such major issues for me. Some have been better than others, but none have been like this.</li>
    <li> I love all Olay products and this one is no exception.  Great for my skin...I can really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Has done wonders for my skin.  I just love everything Olay Regenerist.  My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem potent enough, but leaves a soft smooth feeling the next morning after using.  I like the Olay Regenerist and Pro X lines. The products are better than some department store quality without the steep prices.  Have only used this for 2 weeks, but will continue to use and see if any change in skin texture.</li>
    <li> work good last a long time  She raves about this stuff  what else can I say if you think your skin needs it get it..</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Easy to use.  Light.  Smells ok (family neutral - not flowery, etc).  Good results.</li>
    <li> This is more of a glycolic serum. It is not bad and I have tried it at night after using Beauticontrol glycolic&lt;br /&gt;pads then this before going to bad. Just an okay product, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love it, does not irritate my skin.  It&#x27;s hard to pick anti-aging products with so many choices out there. Knowing that mixing different products can make them ineffective, I like the Olay collection approach, which is a group of products that all work together. In my case it&#x27;s the Regnerist collection, for us 50+ girls.  So far, all I&#x27;ve tried are good and will continue to use.  The value and service at Amazon makes it more affordable, and I love the ease of Subscribe and Save ordering.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Advanced Anti-Aging night Resurfacing Elixir&amp;#34; title for this product had me expecting more results than what was actually delivered. Perhaps I just need to give it more time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased four (4) OLAY products and I can report that I am now a fan.  Good results overall at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now. My skin already looks a tad more luminous and just healthy. Its not oily at all. I have to be careful with products, especially in the T Zone. For instance with the moisturizer that comes in the regenerist starter trio pack (which is pretty good too), I only use it in certain places. This, i apply on the whole face, without an issue!</li>
    <li> Paula Begoun rated this one of the best exfoliants on the market and it&#x27;s priced here lower than any of it&#x27;s competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle for all the women in my family for their Christmas stockings and it was a hit with both the young ones (early 30&#x27;s) and me as the oldest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every night (alternate with Tazorac and CeraVe PM).  My skin has been looking so good lately that I don&#x27;t always wear foundation to work any more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to complement other Regenerist items which I was trying for the first time.  Given the reasonable price, I did not have high expectations, but I have been very pleasantly surprised at the results after only three weeks.  I have used the Elixir every night, and can see a visible difference in fine lines, firmness and sun damage. Having used much more expensive products, I can honestly say that the Olay products not only hold their own, but in this case, provide even better results.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this new product from olay and Have used it for a week now and the results are very good so far. You have to focus on one or two problem area&#x27;s and then you can slowly tell the difference over the weeks. Definitely a plus for me as I have only two problem area&#x27;s to focus on. Love this new regenerist olay and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> my mother say it is ok!</li>
    <li> Delivery was timely, as well as, the product was packed professionally.  The price of the product was competitive with the large discount drug retailers.  However, I have not used the product long enough to evaluate its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  It feels like velvet.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product in the market! I use many different products and this gets an AAAAAA, from me! I love the way it leaves your skin. Then I am excited to see my skin in the morning! This stuff really makes a difference unlike others on the market! This product also has Glycolic Acid in it which is exactly what you want in a product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s had very good results over the last month or so of using it. My skin is very smooth and hydrated, and I haven&#x27;t had to use an additional moisturizer (it is summer so this may change in the winter). I think this is a very good AHA exfoliator for the price.</li>
    <li> like how this makes my face feel. Really smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Have only used it a couple of nights so far&lt;br /&gt;I have had good lick with the daytime regenerist serum, so thought I would try this.</li>
    <li> Did not really see a difference after using the entire bottle.  It didn&#x27;t seem to have much potency at all.</li>
    <li> I may have just received a very stale product but it had no tingling effect whatsoever nor did I see any results.  It was supposed to be a mild gylcolic peel but I might as well have put water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing as I do like the olay scrub &amp; micro sculpting cream</li>
    <li> I love the fact that after putting on the serum, my face feels tighter and firmer. I have used other Olay products before and this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love the smoothness of this syrum....and the idea of it &amp;#34;replacing your normal nighttime moisturizer&amp;#34;.  Thought I would be using this forever.  However, by the second bottle I found that my skin was becoming dry and irritated by the retinal.  Disregard reviewers who have used product less than a few months.  The real results take a long time to manifest.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, very light and immediately absorbed into skin. Results overnight show smoother and more dewy skin. Olay did a disservice in discontinuing it. Unfortunately can no longer find in stores. Getting harder to find on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles and one was crushed and looks like a third of the serum leaked out.  The second bottle was undamaged.  So I&#x27;m happy with one not with the other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of all the reservist products but this one fell short. Firstly I didn&#x27;t like the gel like consistency,  I felt it wasn&#x27;t getting absorbed by my skin but was just staying on my skin. I didn&#x27;t see any difference even after I had finished the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product over and over and really like it.  Haven&#x27;t found anything else to compare it to yet.  Very satisifed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed for about two weeks. I see no difference in my skin whatsoever. If anything, I think my lines might be a little more prominent now. It&#x27;s hard to tell but it&#x27;s definitely not better. Very dissappointed. This is my second try with something in the regenerist line and both products did nothing at all me for. Someone else&#x27;s review mentioned tingling, is this supposed to tinge? It doesn&#x27;t. Could amazon be selling expired bottles?</li>
    <li> I am 40years old and have very sensitive dry skin. I had tried many different products and to me this is the only one works for me to make skin looks nicer and moisturized. I have been using this almost a year, I think skin tone got better too. Beside this I have been using clinique 7days scrub cleanser to clean my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff :-) approaching 40 and my skin is starting to show it. I received my package on-time and the price is cheaper than the store.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have only used 3 days so far and I already see an improvement in fine lines and tone. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived only 3/4 full which was a disappointment. Will give it a try, but I imagine there is no recourse for this damage.</li>
    <li> After I cleanse, I use this product overnight.  I feel that it helps restore skin cells and maintains moisture in the skin.</li>
    <li> This review is from the POV of a 24 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with a slight combination/normal skin texture. After my last two quarters of college, staying up late nights (and sometimes all night) I noticed heavy dark circles around my eyes. They were sulken in and I can clearly see the wrinkled skin around my eyes. I was mortified! The reviews for this product sold me because it claimed to \\&quot;plump\\&quot; the skin around your eyes. It did..a bit. I found that dark circles are genetic and can be slightly improved by better sleep and hydration, but in truth will never \\&quot;disappear.\\&quot; My wrinkled skin around the eyes is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a product to improve dark circles, this is not it. In terms of use, I did feel that it slightly plumped my skin, but not a huge noticible difference. Perhaps it is preventing further damage? It is oily, however. If I press my face onto my pillow after applying this product, my skin will stick to the fabric like the skin behind your thighs to leather seats, in shorts, on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you still in your 20s and deathly afraid to age, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Olay has a great reputation but only works for the appropriate age group.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in Good Housekeeping a few days after I realized that I never went back to an application of glycolic acid on my skin like the dermatologist had recommended to me. I bought the very expensive product from his office until he retired and was too lazy to get around to finding another derm doctor to replenish my supply and used very expensive $70 night cream from Arbonne that didn&#x27;t help. I used Mary Kay night cream that I really like, but I kept on thinking about the glycolic gel that really worked but I thought I could only get from a doctor. Then came the Good Housekeeping article, and I drove to my local store and bought it off the shelf! Now I see it is even cheaper on Amazon! It is just like the doctors stuff! It works. I love the way my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the doctor recommends that you rinse it off after 10-20 minutes for the first two weeks to make sure there is no irritation. This is not something Olay recommends, but I would suggest it. The one star reviews probably didn&#x27;t do this. Some skin is too sensitive for it, and a lower glycolic acid percentage might be warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the percentage of glycolic acid in this? Does anyone know? I can&#x27;t find it anywhere on their site.</li>
    <li> Although I am not an Olay fan usually, I love this product.  Price was better than buying at a local store.</li>
    <li> Love this olay product!  When I started using this item, I started to feel that my skin is much smoother.</li>
    <li> The elixir appears to nourish the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with always good skin- now in my mid sixties I find this works if I also add some eye moisturizer I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my skin, it absorbs quickly and delivers just as it promises. I have used Olay Regenerist for over 2 years and love the way my skin feels and looks. A definite winner!</li>
    <li> I gave a 5 rating to this Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Night Resurfacing Elixir because my fine lines are deminishing.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Well, I did, and after a couple of months, I have noticed no change whatsoever.  My skin is no better or worse.  I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or problems with pores, so I thought it would probably work well on fine lines.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if there is an expiration date for this product.  I did have it for quite a while before I used it and maybe the ingredients are no longer active?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use all the Regenerist products. I am 63, I dont have unrealistic expectations, and I like my skin using Regenerist. It has the best reviews in all the magazines.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the more expensive brands.  I have switched to the Oil of Olay brand of skin care products and have been quite happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My skin loves the retinol product!  Learned about it at Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautypedia.  My skin is clearer (Yes I fight acne AND wrinkles.  Don&#x27;t be jealous.) and my fine lines are definitely diminished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for years, and added this elixir about 6 months ago. I doubt that it&#x27;s made much difference as far as wrinkles go, but my skin tone is dramatically improved. Having lived in the high desert southwest all my life, I have a fair amount of sun damage and this product has improved those dark marks considerably. Overall, my skin is smoother and the tone is much more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best, for me, is that this is extremely gentle. I have outrageously sensitive skin, very fair, very dry, and just as persnickity as an old granny. This elixir doesn&#x27;t sting, dry, or irritate.</li>
    <li> Read Paula&#x27;s Choice and, must admit, was pretty skeptical of her glowing review. Also, didn&#x27;t see very visible results after 7 days either. However, I did find that after around two weeks, some of my old acne scars (not really scars, more like tiny holes/dents) became NOTICEABLY less pronounced. I used to have two eighth-inch-wide dents on my cheeks for one or two years and one of them disappeared completely!! The other one is now the size of a pinhole and barely visible. I would suggest if you have dry skin like me, to wait a few minutes after using for it to absorb and then layer another moisturizer on top. I will most definitely repurchase this after my bottle runs out in two or three months!</li>
    <li> It is the best! Started to work with the first application! NO burning or itching, just smooth younger looking skin. Best of all it was delivered fast and worry free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and I didn&#x27;t care for it that much.  So I tried it again and its really not all that.  You only need a tiny touch, and it spreads very well.  But why does it disappear so fast?  Just for the sake of using a glycolic acid, I would reorder as long as I can get it for half price.</li>
    <li> Very good thing for my dry skin. Very soft and quite enough to use without any cream after this Elixir</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. My skin is usually somewhat oily, but this winter it has been really dry and rough. Exfoliation and my usual daytime moisturizer weren&#x27;t doing enough. So I added this to my routine at night and noticed a HUGE difference after just 2 uses. I have no idea if it actually does any anti-aging anything, but as a moisturizer, it is FANTASTIC!!!!! Every morning, I wake up and my skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized. Not oily. In addition, my cleanser and daytime moisturizer seem to be working better since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> Love my newest purchase! Olay never fails to deliver. I apply a thin layer at night just after I cleanse then by the time I finish my peppermint tea its time for my retinol. I use both religiously every night as part of my anti aging skin care routine. Two thumbs up Olay</li>
    <li> I liked this serum a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I can see a difference. It&#x27;s not sticky, absorbs nicely, good texture and has no smell.</li>
    <li> This product worked on my skin type very well.  I have combination skin with some uneven tone and visible pores near my nose.  During the first few nights of use, it was a bit strong and I used it without moisturizer.  I had a small irritated spot.  I changed the frequency to once every other day so my skin can get use to it.  I then started to use it every night with moisturizer underneath it.  Results were gradual, but very effective.  My skin is overall smoother, more even, and my pores are much reduced.  It&#x27;s even more effective than the $85-$100 products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> The shipping and price was great but the product it self is not made for sensitive skin. If you plan on using this product use it every other day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine but I prefer a cream.  And, it takes a while to see results.  It goes on easily and that&#x27;s a plus and the price is right.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my mom and she loves it .This is the second time i bought it from amazon. with the coupon ,its cheaper. My mom said that this makes her skin smooth and very moisturizing .</li>
    <li> The 1 star is for the seller. The bottle was missing 1/3 of the product. I&#x27;ve used this product before but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it on-line  I give the product 4 stars!</li>
    <li> SPEECHLESS !  Read the reviews for this product everywhere possible.  I&#x27;m an Olay Regenerist user to begin with so this naturally piqued my interest.  I have slight sun-damage and after 3 years of some severe stress, my skin just was looking and feeling awful - as if I aged 10 years.  After just a few days of using this, my skin looked 75% better.  After 2 weeks, deep wrinkles, crows feet and sun spots are gone and the tightness has returned (used on my neck and decolletage as well).  Simply amazing product that will not dry you out, just will leave you in awe !</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this because I love Olay&#x27;s products, but after six weeks of nightly use I can honestly say I have not seen a single benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For results, I recommend the Regenerist Regenerating Serum.</li>
    <li> Removes dead skin with no irritation or redness.. Can be used on a daily basis. Reasonable price. Great value for all.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie .... From department stores to drugstores to shopping networks.... It is a good price points seems to deliver the same results as some pricer brands. I miss the free samples!!!! But the product goes on nice and it did not irratate my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this light, effective glycolic acid treatment from Olay Regenerist. Just the right amount to do what it is supposed to do well without unpleasant stinging, fragrances or oils. And now it is gone from store shelves, drug store web sites, and harder to find on Amazon! Guessing it&#x27;s being discontinued; hoping it&#x27;s because a similar new product will be launched soon. Not many glycolic acid products in drug stores and at reasonable prices, so I&#x27;m sorry to see this go. Guess that leaves Alpha Hydrox and maybe one or two others in the mass market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I like the way it feels on my face but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet!  I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle but if I don&#x27;t see any difference I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> Item arrived today and was opened, hence half of the lotion was in the bottom of the box. I&#x27;m afraid to use any of it, could have been an return from another customer. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift at christmas.  I never used anything at night but figured why night.  What a difference after a week.  My skin has a lot more tone to it and the lines around my mouth and eyes are not as noticible.  I have become a user for life.</li>
    <li> I enthusiastically recommend this product -- very effective!&lt;br /&gt;Works just as well as much more expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;This is now a permanent part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> good product.  this is my second order.</li>
    <li> I put this on every morning and and at night.  I am a very, very senior citizen and I can&#x27;t tell if it helps or not.  It feels good and I think it makes my skin a bit softer.</li>
    <li> I have only used a fraction of the bottle so far and can&#x27;t tell if there is any difference yet.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have been using it for about a year or so and it still seems to be improving the appearance of my skin.  I am allergic for a lot of skincare, but I&#x27;m really glad I discovered Olay products and am not allergic to them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this particular product in the store for quiet some time now but hesitated to buy it because of it&#x27;s price. When I saw how cheap it was in comparison, I decided it was time to try it out.  It&#x27;s my first week and I&#x27;m already seeing a slight difference in my skin. My skin smoother and some of my acne scars are peeling away. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I really did see quick results on my cheeks, forehead, and around my eyes.  It&#x27;s taking longer on my neck and chin.  I could not be happier, either way.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge difference in my skin, but I love the texture of this product going on, it lasts a long time, one pump goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Good value.</li>
    <li> This product beats Lancome any day. I use it in conjunction with other Olay products. Absolutely great. Smooths and hydrates quickly.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing. ONE DAY my skin was red and itchy, otherwise two months of nothing. If anything, my skin looked older because I followed product directions to use in place of my regular night lotion.  I am sort of hopeful it was counterfeit product because otherwise it is an inexcusably bad product.</li>
    <li> I really like this for my nighttime moisturizer.  Gets rid of the dry tight feeling after washing without leaving my skin feeling greasy and coated while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Regenerist really works (Charlene Folker/70).  Have always used Olay.  Trusted, dependable, priced right and no need to buy $100/per ounce HIGH FASHION goop with just a NAME.</li>
    <li> This goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> my  granddaughter gave me  a jar  of this about a year ago and i have been using  this  ever since</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! It really makes a difference in improving your skin while you sleep. This is perhaps my favorite product of theirs! It&#x27;s works great!</li>
    <li> I faithfully used this product and really did not see much difference in my skin, lines, etc.  You only need to use a small amount, but just did not see the benefit of this product.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like some of my other products I purchased for my skin care routine, did not use it long enough to tell you guys its pros and cons. Sorry ladies. I know I read reviews on products before I purchase skin care items becauase it is extremely helpful. I do appreciate the customers who are honest about the products. Nothing personal to the sellers and I hope they understand but its just honest and fair review that way.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for few weeks.. seems to be a good product</li>
    <li> This product is great. It does the same thing that expensive peels do without the discomfort or ugly appearance. My skin looks and feels great. It works better in conjuction with other Olay products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a few months now and I can honestly say, I see No difference. It has nice, light moisture to it but no anti aging or regenerating properties that I can see. I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great, I noticed a difference within a few day (softness), and in two weeks I started getting compliments on my skin looking great (I&#x27;m a guy turning 45 in a few months).  I use the daytime with SPF version, too, and did exclusively for night and day.  Since adding this to the regimen everything got even better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay , not sure of any great result .</li>
    <li> I have been using this Elixir for over a year.  Occasionally I will see and try something else, but I come right back to this product.  My face is so smooth when I use it. Pricing is really good, also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles.  However, I do have naturally uneven texture to my skin and this has helped moisturize and smooth my skin out.  The key to this product is putting a very very thin layer on otherwise you will get sticky.  Glycerin (which is great for your skin) is very high on the ingredient list so if you put too much on your skin, the serum gets super sticky and will stay that way for hours.  All in all, I like the product though I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Olay Regenerist believer.  Of all the product I&#x27;ve used, the Regenerist series is the best... and this is no exception.  Wrinkles don&#x27;t go away, but this helps make them less noticable, and I believe slows the overall aging process from showing up in your face.</li>
</ol>
