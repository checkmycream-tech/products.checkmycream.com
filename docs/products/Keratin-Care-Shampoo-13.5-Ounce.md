### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I love it!!!!</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for people with Keratin treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Very good product for hair treated with keratine</li>
      <li>Great smell and great results!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo</li>
      <li>Have a great day.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product for all who have got keratin smoothening done.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I heard some good things about this keratine from her, so should be ok.</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>Amazon really has the best price compared to buying it in a salon.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know for sure.    </li>
      <li>I got a brazilian blowout recently and this product seems to work perfectly!</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s sodium chloride (salt) free.  </li>
      <li>I received my item very quick and I appreciate that.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, everything was fine.</li>
      <li>was packing factory and smell and color of light and expiry date 24 months  </li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for almost 3 years and it does a great job, you really don&#x27;t need much to cleanse your hair.  </li>
      <li>Instead of having to return to the salon I purchased the first set of shampoo/conditioner from, I found it online for a better price.  </li>
      <li>The seller sent me the Color Care variety by mistake, but it actually turned out to be a good mistake, because my hair is colored as well.   </li>
      <li>This is true of all the sulfate/sodium chloride-free shampoos, because those ingredients are what result in lather.    </li>
      <li>Oh, it&#x27;s so nice to have 20 year old hair once again.</li>
      <li>It might be mild, but somehow, it just dries out your hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff does what it says, your hair will be silky smooth and shiny after the first use.</li>
      <li>I figured that with it being sodium free and a kertin complex that it&#x27;d be great for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it was just a simple misunderstanding.  </li>
      <li>if u use it daily better to buy it here.</li>
      <li>I have to use more shampoo this way, but I only shampoo and rinse once, not twice,</li>
      <li>i have very fine and dry hair and</li>
      <li>In fine print on the back it reads \\&quot;Copomon Enterrprises.\\</li>
      <li>I really like the smell even, and of course got the conditioner as well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>really makes hair shiny</li>
      <li>If you want the real thing, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>It looks to me like the discount beauty products seller is swapping a generic version of the shampoo and conditioner for the original Coppola version.</li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans very gently and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>one day i tried this product and was very surprised how it helps to keep my hair shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>Overall, I like it, but I still prefer the Organix Brazilian Keratin line which is also much cheaper and can be purchased nearly everywhere</li>
      <li>My hair is really soft and shiny..</li>
      <li>This was much cheaper than a similar product from my salon.</li>
      <li>I tried other sulfate free shampoos for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees</li>
      <li>Its main ingredient is ammonium lauryl sulfate, which can be pretty harsh on your hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hormones are flipping out, plus I have a thyroid condition and let me tell you, my hair was feeling it (dry, frizzy, curling in some places, straight in others...</li>
      <li>The product arrived within a reasonable timeframe, however the shampoo cap wasn&#x27;t closed completely and leaked</li>
      <li>This is an off brand IMITATING the TRUE Coppola Keratin COMPLEX.  </li>
      <li>Bought several and each time I do not receive the true Coppola Keratin COMPLEX as shown in the picture.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s very hard to wash out, and hasn&#x27;t helped alleviate my hair damage, assist in cleaning my scalp, or done anything worth while to justify the cost.  </li>

<li> but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.  </li>
<li> Why not spend the extra money on an organic or at least sulfate-free shampoo instead?</li>
<li> Leaves the hair feeling a little knotted and tangled once rinsed out, but this is remedied immediately once the conditioner is applied.    </li>
<li> Amazon makes it right by refunding me and letting me dispose of the shampoo just as well, but its truly disappointing!</li>
<li> After using this with the Coppola Keratin Care Shampoo, and Keratin Complex Infusion, my hair now has shine and is easier to comb.</li>
<li> I received a Keratin Complex shampoo, but not the one pictured, and not the one by COPPOLA.</li>

<li> I have no more frizzy hair!</li>
<li> One of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t have all the added scary chemicals that hurt your hair.  </li>
<li> Get this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed (unless you like frizzy, dry hair, then you&#x27;ll be very, very sad that it is gone).</li>
<li> I did unfortunately receive the wrong item</li>
<li> WRONG!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> really makes hair shiny</li>
    <li> i have never treated my hair with keratin but my daughter did, so she uses this shampoo. i have very fine and dry hair and one day i tried this product and was very surprised how it helps to keep my hair shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a delivery for a friend. I heard some good things about this keratine from her, so should be ok.</li>
    <li> The shampoo makes my hair look and feel like dry straw. It might be mild, but somehow, it just dries out your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a must if you&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment like I have.  I really like the smell even, and of course got the conditioner as well.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hormones are flipping out, plus I have a thyroid condition and let me tell you, my hair was feeling it (dry, frizzy, curling in some places, straight in others...a total mess). I came across Keratin Complex in a magazine and I thought, what the heck, why not try it? This stuff does what it says, your hair will be silky smooth and shiny after the first use. I was totally blown away that this product lived up to it&#x27;s reputation. I ended up ordering a brush that it supposed to enhance the shampoo &amp; conditioner&#x27;s effect and that works too! Oh, it&#x27;s so nice to have 20 year old hair once again. Get this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed (unless you like frizzy, dry hair, then you&#x27;ll be very, very sad that it is gone).</li>
    <li> Not packaging factory  The expiry date 16 months  Previously purchased the same product from another vendor was packing factory and smell and color of light and expiry date 24 months  As this product is not factory packaging and expiry date 18 months  I do not know if the product or change the factory, but no rest for this product</li>
    <li> I received my item very quick and I appreciate that.  I did unfortunately receive the wrong item and I am currently returning.  No big deal - it happens.  I&#x27;m sure it was just a simple misunderstanding.  The picture displayed showed the Care Shampoo and I received the Color Care Shampoo.  I would keep this product but my my hair does not respond well to the color care.  Really no big deal.  No fault to anyone with this transation.  Have a great day.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for all who have got keratin smoothening done. I have no more frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for people with Keratin treated hair.  Instead of having to return to the salon I purchased the first set of shampoo/conditioner from, I found it online for a better price.  The product arrived within a reasonable timeframe, however the shampoo cap wasn&#x27;t closed completely and leaked some product &gt;.&lt; Otherwise, everything was fine.</li>
    <li> Very good product for hair treated with keratine and I received my order on time I recommend the seller too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks.  It arrived jiggling around in the box it was sent in with nothing to keep it from spilling open.  I figured that with it being sodium free and a kertin complex that it&#x27;d be great for my hair.  WRONG!  It&#x27;s very hard to wash out, and hasn&#x27;t helped alleviate my hair damage, assist in cleaning my scalp, or done anything worth while to justify the cost.  I could&#x27;ve bought a bottle of Suave and got similar results.</li>
    <li> What I received is not the picture that is shown.  I received a Keratin Complex shampoo, but not the one pictured, and not the one by COPPOLA.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture on your screen.  The bottle that arrives in the mail is completely different.  And nowhere on it does it say that it is made by Coppola.  I contacted Amazon about this. It looks to me like the discount beauty products seller is swapping a generic version of the shampoo and conditioner for the original Coppola version. I didn&#x27;t try the shampoo.  I just contacted Amazon about a refund, which was promptly granted. If you want the real thing, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have stressed my hair from a keratin treatment that I do not believe was done correctly, plus my hair has been treated with color.  After using this with the Coppola Keratin Care Shampoo, and Keratin Complex Infusion, my hair now has shine and is easier to comb.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans very gently and leaves my hair soft and silky. This was much cheaper than a similar product from my salon.</li>
    <li> Sure, it&#x27;s sodium chloride (salt) free.  So what?  Its main ingredient is ammonium lauryl sulfate, which can be pretty harsh on your hair.  I&#x27;ve read it strips proteins from your hair but it wasn&#x27;t a scientific article so I don&#x27;t know for sure.    It also has cocamide DEA, a potential carcinogen.  Why not spend the extra money on an organic or at least sulfate-free shampoo instead?</li>
    <li> One of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t have all the added scary chemicals that hurt your hair.  Cheaper than any store ao if u use it daily better to buy it here.</li>
    <li> I got a brazilian blowout recently and this product seems to work perfectly! I wouldnt even think about switching to another. Great smell and great results!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! My hair is really soft and shiny..</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo and the matching conditioner after hearing about it from one of my friends.   She and I have both had BKT (Brazilian Keratin Treatment) and now need to use only sulfate and sodium chloride-free shampoos.  The seller sent me the Color Care variety by mistake, but it actually turned out to be a good mistake, because my hair is colored as well.   Do not expect a lot of lather from this shampoo.  This is true of all the sulfate/sodium chloride-free shampoos, because those ingredients are what result in lather.    I have to use more shampoo this way, but I only shampoo and rinse once, not twice, so it probably evens out.   Leaves the hair feeling a little knotted and tangled once rinsed out, but this is remedied immediately once the conditioner is applied.    Overall, I like it, but I still prefer the Organix Brazilian Keratin line which is also much cheaper and can be purchased nearly everywhere that sells shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost 3 years and it does a great job, you really don&#x27;t need much to cleanse your hair.  I tried other sulfate free shampoos for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.  The cost of the product is worth, less expensive that a retail store purchase such as Ulta.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware: The product pictured says Coppola, but what I received was similiar only in the color of the bottle. It is not the Coppola product that was advertised.. In fine print on the back it reads \\&quot;Copomon Enterrprises.\\&quot;  No way will I risk using this on my hair. I am contacting Amazon immediately.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be FOOLED again.  Bought several and each time I do not receive the true Coppola Keratin COMPLEX as shown in the picture.  This is an off brand IMITATING the TRUE Coppola Keratin COMPLEX.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t even seem to have Keratin in it as it gives my hair the frizzies! Amazon makes it right by refunding me and letting me dispose of the shampoo just as well, but its truly disappointing!</li>
    <li> I had keratin put in my hair and this shampoo def keeps it straighter for a longer period of time. Smells nice. Amazon really has the best price compared to buying it in a salon. Thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my salon after I got a Keratin treatment.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo and I like the way it smells.</li>
