      <li>we will take what we get, but an accurate description would have been appreciated.  </li>
      <li>it really synthetic and smells cheap if your over 21.</li>
      <li>If it helps anyone he is a in his early 30&#x27;s and this scent is age appropriate for his age group.</li>
      <li>Very clean and powerful masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>The package got here right on time.</li>

      <li>Its sucks that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but this cologne smells great</li>
      <li>This was first given to me by a girl who had a crush on me in 7th grade.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with how quick it arrived and even with my late ordering,  </li>
      <li>but it used to be much cheaper</li>
      <li>and he really liked it, but was never able to find it again.</li>
      <li>but i would love to see the price go down.</li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance, which could be why I placed a second order!</li>
      <li>Its masculine but not over powering.</li>
      <li>The cologne is actually really small but less is more when putting it on</li>

<li> I used one bottle and the other one was in a box somewhere.  </li>
<li> It doesmt come in a spray bottle so all you have is avatar that you can fab, Instead of spray which is pretty lame</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the description is misleading.</li>
<li> Not a huge inconvenience, but we just prefer spray bottles.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
<li> Avatar is so hard to find so</li>
<li> It became too common!</li>

    <li> Great smell, I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> We love it  ... getting this product at an affordable price was a shock to me ... delivery was more than prompt.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and used to wear it in middle school. This was first given to me by a girl who had a crush on me in 7th grade.I decided to purchase this again and to my surprise it still smells like it did back in the day. Yes it&#x27;s synthetic but its good for a light gym scent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone over 21. I did get a lot of compliments back when this was my signature scent but now I wouldn&#x27;t wear this to go out... it really synthetic and smells cheap if your over 21.</li>
    <li> This cologne was a gift and very nicely packed.  It smells really good and the recipient loved it.  The cologne is actually really small but less is more when putting it on so I&#x27;m thinking it will last a while and it does not fade after just an hour or two.  Really good mild scent.</li>
    <li> my man loves this cologne. I cant believe I found it for under $20. Coty has stopped making it and most want over $100. Thanks/</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. It is one of 2 of his favorite scents.If it helps anyone he is a in his early 30&#x27;s and this scent is age appropriate for his age group. The only problem I have is that since it is such a small bottle (0.5 oz) it does not spray on he must dab it on. Otherwise I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and I know what I am getting when I buy it ,I have not received it yet but I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne! My husband has been wearing it since he was a teenager and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love this aftershave&#x27;s smell and feel.  Very clean and powerful masculine scent.  I first bought it around 1997 when it was probably $5 for a bottle of aftershave; probably a 2-pack for $10.  I used one bottle and the other one was in a box somewhere.  I recently in 2015 found it and started using the discovered bottle.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.  I looked online to see if it was still made, and found that it&#x27;s now 10-20 times what it originally cost!  I&#x27;ll pass at that price, but it is a great scent.</li>
    <li> Its sucks that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but this cologne smells great and I get nice comments from everyone.</li>
    <li> great smell I (girl) bought this one too through my boyfriend&#x27;s amazon account for christmas because he also mentioned he would like to try it out. therefore I got it and it was a great price too. Thank you</li>
    <li> It doesmt come in a spray bottle so all you have is avatar that you can fab, Instead of spray which is pretty lame</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance, which could be why I placed a second order! Its masculine but not over powering. The best thing is not everyone is familiar with it. Many years ago I liked English Leather, until girls would ask if I was wearing English Leather. It became too common! With Avatar, I&#x27;ve been complimented and asked what fragrance it was.</li>
    <li> so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I would have rated a 5 but the bottle does not have a spray top and well what man is going to take the time to dab cologne on.&lt;br /&gt;i love the way this smells but it used to be much cheaper I&#x27;m not sure what happened or why it now cost over a hundred dollars but i would love to see the price go down.</li>
    <li> Its cuz its seasonal but u can find it at walgreens</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my son.  He loves this cologne and the only time we can get it is during the holidays.  However, this year, I couldn&#x27;t find any gifts sets at all.  So glad I checked here and got it for him.  He LOVED it!</li>
    <li> The package got here right on time. I gave it to my boyfriend as a surprise because every time we shop anywhere that sells men&#x27;s cologne, he always looks for this and can never find it. He said his grandparents (now deceased) got it for him as a Christmas gift when he was a teenager and he really liked it, but was never able to find it again. Originally I was going to get this for his birthday which is in a couple of months, but when I saw this for sale on here as cheap as it was, I decided to just order it right away. He loves it! He was so happy when I gave it to him and said it brought back lots of memories. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Brother in-law loved it!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Bought it for my son. We like this one a lot. We will purchase Avatar again. Next time in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Good buy and prompt delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite scent. I was very pleased with how quick it arrived and even with my late ordering,  it was here in time for Christmas. My only complaint is that the description is misleading. The .5fl oz bottle of cologne is a splash bottle not a spray. Avatar is so hard to find so we will take what we get, but an accurate description would have been appreciated.  Not a huge inconvenience, but we just prefer spray bottles.</li>
    <li> Best cologne EVER! Been wearing it for 16 years, even compared to the expensive colognes, this is the only one I get questioned and complimented on the most. Love!!!</li>
