    <li> I purchased this from a spa party I went to a couple weeks ago. I love it. The rep told that it would help with my headaches. I have intense headaches and migraines due to high stress and minimum exercise during the day.  This stuff manages to subdue the pain. so thankful I finally found something that helps instead of drowning in Advils and aspirins all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Very light for summer use!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. The citrus smell is nice and not overly strong. it takes only a small amount to moisturize my face at night. It feels cool on the skin and has even sped up the healing of sunburn, spider and insect bites, and rashes.</li>
    <li> This gelee is ridiculously expensive, but I splurged when I got a bonus at work.  I had tried it in a starter set and loved it.  It&#x27;s a treat at $50/container!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best stuff I have found to relax my sore muscles!  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for relieving arthritis pain and smells great.</li>
    <li> A must use after workout and shower. Pleasant fragrance and deep pain relief for joint and muscle soreness with a tingly refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. My second bottle so far. Lasts 1-2 yrs if used sporadically. Best after a hot tub.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Received quickly.</li>
    <li> Where aloe vera and other lotions fail, this is the only product to use. A little expensive, but the relief it provides from a sunburn is incredible.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Our family has used this product for years. If you have aches and pain after exercising, it will help get rid of them. Also great for Charlie horses. My shipping was fast and had no problems.</li>
    <li> Be cautious if you have sensitive skin. Loved the smell and texture of this cream. It feels rich and nourishing as you apply. However, 10 minutes on, my skin no longer felt moisturized, but dry, and I was hit with a sudden burning sensation over my entire body that I can only liken to having bathed in Listerine! For a minute I wondered if it was the sudden onset of some neurological disorder before realizing it was the product. The face mask burned my skin, too. Glad I tried before purchasing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s against Arbonne rules and regulations to sell their products via this method. Never ever trust products sold this way! They are more than likely expired and can&#x27;t be guaranteed that they haven&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me as a gift. I started using it on my face in the morning after my shower, it seems to tighten my pores and give a very refresing feeling to my face and a glow, which lasts all morning. I will never be withoutr it again.</li>
    <li> excersing+overweight&#x3D;Sore body.  I love the coolness relief for my sore muscles. My husband was mad how much i spent on it. about a month ago he used it one time for his sore legs, and at first complain how it made him feel cold. he woke up the next morning feeling good and barely sore.  Can you believe he havn&#x27;t stop using it. Now i have to order More.  Believe me, he is not going to complain about the price again.</li>
    <li> Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.... if you suffer hot flashes, muscle soreness or skin lesions.  I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> It was a couple days late, but no big deal,Thanks.</li>
