      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>so i may have already written a review for this product, but its so great</li>
      <li>so I have been looking for a good volumizing product to give it some life.</li>
      <li>Works great in making my hair more volume.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but either product is going to do amazing things to your hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading all the good reviews thinking it would give me the volume i&#x27;ve been seeking, but it&#x27;s more of a styling product.</li>
      <li>Salons keep trying to sell me their products but Root Boost does a great job on my very fine and straight hair and at a good price.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this product in a drug store when visiting relatives and loved it.</li>
      <li>They arrived with the plastic top taped on.</li>
      <li>This product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t travel with the cans unless you find a top that will fit.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this product lifts it without stiffness or the feeling of gunk in my hair.</li>
      <li>I love applying this to my roots, and also brushing some into my hair to achieve a nice, natural body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to getting a light foam on my fingers and applying it that way.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a product that would not make my hair heavy but would hold the lift and this was awesome.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and straight.  </li>
      <li>It is an overall great product, and lasts me about 2 months per can, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>this product, I am able to achieve volume with a product that is not only weightless and virtually undetectable, but does not have an overwhelming and stifling smell.</li>
      <li>It does have a shininess to it, but just the right amount.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>It still looks great in the mornings, and I can usually skip a night washing my hair without it looking greasy</li>
      <li>also another product that works just as good and was a little bit cheaper is the Tigi Catwalk</li>
      <li>My hair will be flat and curly, kinda greasy looking, right after my hair dries from showering, but with this and mousse, it has more body</li>
      <li>Exactly what I am looking for.</li>
      <li>This is the only root booster I use because I&#x27;ve tried many and they just don&#x27;t work like this one does.</li>
      <li>My hair actually feels thicker and has way more Texture.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and silky - translation flat-</li>
      <li>I believed I was purchasing the same item as I bought in the store, but now I wonder if that&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>(more fluffy I guess)</li>
      <li>I have fine black hair</li>
      <li>The nozzle is strange, and I can&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so far with this product</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go where I direct it.</li>
      <li>I found so far.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you have to apply extra to really get the hold that you want, but as a styler, I like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally, so I was pleased to order on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>After you blow dry, you will really feel the difference in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have long curly hair that tends to flatten near the scalp.  </li>

<li> I have long curly hair that tends to flatten near the scalp.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve never tried it on long hair.</li>
<li> but in no way frizzy- how long curly hair is supposed to look!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find and Amazon is one of the places that always has it for a decent price.</li>
<li> I gave it 4 stars because I must be careful not to use too much before blow drying or it will make my hair dull and dry.  </li>
<li> Also it made my hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and flat.  </li>
<li> Also leaves my hair a little dry, knotty, and sticky.</li>
<li> (oddly, I can&#x27;t do this when I have absolutely no product in my hair at all.)</li>
<li> and then I blow dry as usual.  </li>
<li> even after shaking, the product comes out half runny sometimes and half like a mousse.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m forever looking for something to give me a little body and lift.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not available in my area</li>
<li> When I took off the tape, I found the tops do not fit the cans and won&#x27;t stay on by themselves.</li>
<li> Just a few shots at the root of the hair at the crown after towel drying</li>
<li> I use this at night (when I take my showers) and usually go to bed with my hair slightly damp.  </li>
<li> So...why use Root Boost instead of an ordinary foam at the root?  </li>
<li> Plus it&#x27;s not sticky or hard in your hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair too hard.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I used it wrong, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
<li> Why pay for the expensive salon products?  </li>
<li> This is very irritating and is not how the product is sold in the store.</li>
<li> I usually hate hairsprays and root-boosting products for two reasons: they make my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, or give me an asthma attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s hard to find and Amazon is one of the places that always has it for a decent price. I use it like a spray mousse, which holds well for my Asian hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look too shiny either. It does have a shininess to it, but just the right amount. I have no complaints about it. Sometimes you have to apply extra to really get the hold that you want, but as a styler, I like it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair too hard. It&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> so i may have already written a review for this product, but its so great it deserves another 5 star rating. i love this product. also another product that works just as good and was a little bit cheaper is the Tigi Catwalk Your Highness Root Boost Spray 8.4 oz. but either product is going to do amazing things to your hair. its an essential in the morning. a must try.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and straight.  I&#x27;m forever looking for something to give me a little body and lift.  This product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s weightless...so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and flat.  Just a few shots at the root of the hair at the crown after towel drying and then I blow dry as usual.  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally, so I was pleased to order on Amazon.  I got 2...so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product in a drug store when visiting relatives and loved it. It&#x27;s not available in my area so I ordered two cans online. They arrived with the plastic top taped on. When I took off the tape, I found the tops do not fit the cans and won&#x27;t stay on by themselves. This is very irritating and is not how the product is sold in the store. You can&#x27;t travel with the cans unless you find a top that will fit. I believed I was purchasing the same item as I bought in the store, but now I wonder if that&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> So...why use Root Boost instead of an ordinary foam at the root?  Root Boost provides excellent lift and texture.  It also helps with making a well-formed curl or bend with a curling iron or flat iron.  I use regular foam mousse (Helps with fighting humidity) for the front and sides of my bob, but I always use Root Boost for the crown to aid in stacking. After you blow dry, you will really feel the difference in your hair.  It will feel coarser and thicker. Warning: I gave it 4 stars because I must be careful not to use too much before blow drying or it will make my hair dull and dry.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Never go on any trip without it too. My hair is fine and silky - translation flat- so I need some texture and body and this does it. My hair actually feels thicker and has way more Texture. My hair is short,  I&#x27;ve never tried it on long hair.</li>
    <li> Got this product based on the reviews and I do not notice a big volume difference when I use it. Also leaves my hair a little dry, knotty, and sticky. Will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only root booster I use because I&#x27;ve tried many and they just don&#x27;t work like this one does. Plus it&#x27;s not sticky or hard in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that tends to flatten near the scalp.  Root Boost definitely helps, plus it helps all over with frizz control (in conjunction with a regular foam mousse for the length.) My hair will be flat and curly, kinda greasy looking, right after my hair dries from showering, but with this and mousse, it has more body (more fluffy I guess) but in no way frizzy- how long curly hair is supposed to look!  I use this at night (when I take my showers) and usually go to bed with my hair slightly damp.  It still looks great in the mornings, and I can usually skip a night washing my hair without it looking greasy (oddly, I can&#x27;t do this when I have absolutely no product in my hair at all.) It is an overall great product, and lasts me about 2 months per can, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> The product would not spray!  Didn&#x27;t want to make a big deal out of this but since you asked me...</li>
    <li> I have used Root Boost for years.  Salons keep trying to sell me their products but Root Boost does a great job on my very fine and straight hair and at a good price.  Why pay for the expensive salon products?  I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I am looking for. Works great in making my hair more volume. Price is cheaper than anywhere I found so far.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a product that would not make my hair heavy but would hold the lift and this was awesome.</li>
    <li> I have fine black hair so I have been looking for a good volumizing product to give it some life. I bought this after reading all the good reviews thinking it would give me the volume i&#x27;ve been seeking, but it&#x27;s more of a styling product. It helped my hair stay up, but it didn&#x27;t give it any volume. Also it made my hair feel dry and brittle. I&#x27;m not sure if I used it wrong, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I usually hate hairsprays and root-boosting products for two reasons: they make my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, or give me an asthma attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I am able to achieve volume with a product that is not only weightless and virtually undetectable, but does not have an overwhelming and stifling smell. I love applying this to my roots, and also brushing some into my hair to achieve a nice, natural body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY issue I&#x27;ve had so far with this product is the packaging. The nozzle is strange, and I can&#x27;t get it to work right. even after shaking, the product comes out half runny sometimes and half like a mousse. It doesn&#x27;t go where I direct it. I&#x27;ve gotten used to getting a light foam on my fingers and applying it that way.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it in the crown of my hair so I have a lift and volume there. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. I have fine hair and this product lifts it without stiffness or the feeling of gunk in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I have used this also for 5+ years.  It works great &amp; give body and lift.  I will continure to buy this product.</li>
