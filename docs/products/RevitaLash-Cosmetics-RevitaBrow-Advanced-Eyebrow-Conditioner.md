      <li>Some improvement...needs more time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I am blonde and I have never had any eyebrows to speak of, therefore I had nothing to pluck! I started using this product and within about 2 months I had eyebrows! I even had one or 2 that were black. I was finally able to get them threaded. I now use it about 3 times a week to maintain what I have. I love this product.</li>
    <li> If you are consistent, it really works!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It does regrow your eyebrows but you must be diligent .  It must be used once a  day and regrowth starts in about a month.  Will try it for awhile.  Do not expect miracles from my  over plucked eyebrows but I am happy with what the product has done.</li>
    <li> I had lost most of my eyebrows due to a reaction from surgery. I had lost some hair as well. My daughter recommended this and I actually have my eyebrows back. Great product!</li>
    <li> My thinning brows are thickening and I&#x27;ve even had to trim them!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> All that I can say is &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and really works!  I have used it in the past.  States you can not use while pregnant or breastfeeding!  FYI  I can&#x27;t use it right now....Can&#x27;t wait til I can, brows will be much thicker and darker.</li>
    <li> I was desperate for some help and this seems to be doing the trick. Use at night but during the day I put a dab of olive oil on my brows and this seems to enhance the effect. I tried using it on my lashes but caused itching an d some swelling.go for it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this product really works it&#x27; awesome..With in 2 weeks my eyebrows where actually growing. Now  I don&#x27;t have to use a eyebrow pencil been using for a month....must buy</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this produc after she used it successfully for a eyebrow waxing disaster.  I wasn&#x27;t too optimistic because I never had much in the way of eyebrows to begin with.  In fact I rarely have to pluck because they don&#x27;t grow in much at all.  I have had to use powder to make my eyebrows look normal.  Within about two weeks I noticed growth, in the weeks it was very noticeable and now I have what I would consider malt normal brows.  The hair is growing in areas that never had hair and the rest is filling in very well.  I have a small scar on one of my brows,  and while the hair isn&#x27;t growing there, enough hair is growing around it so that it is much less noticeable.  I strongly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product so much that I have now ordered their hair product.  It is too soon to tell if it is working yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and I am very happy it really does grow eyebrows</li>
    <li> totally helped me grow in my eyebrows after over plucking...does take daily use for 3-4 weeks to notice a difference but i bought a second one to continue with the progress! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to restore overly plucked brows since the 90s.  Sad but true.  I&#x27;ve tried men&#x27;s strength Rogaine for six months (two months past what they tell you to), Anastasia Brow Serum (for a few years) and biotin supplements (for almost a year) and for all that, grew all of three brow hairs.  No exaggeration - THREE hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using RevitaBrow for almost a year and am seeing a difference.  It bulks up what you have and actually allows new hair to grow where it hasn&#x27;t in years.  Unfortunately, even with the most precise application, hairs are starting to pop up way below the brow line, but taking my tweezers out of retirement for clean up duty is a small price to pay.  You need patience with this product, but at Amazon prices, it&#x27;s worth it.  I would have given it a full five stars if I didn&#x27;t need my eyebrow pencil anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only thing that  has ever worked for me</li>
    <li> Wow, product works! I have eyelashes now.</li>
    <li> This is also good to grow your eyelashes</li>
    <li> It works well on thinning brows.</li>
    <li> I saw some improvement but not enough to make me re-purchase the product. I did it for a month straight but I think you need to give it more time than that and I ranout of patience.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to grow brow hairs but does work. Must be very patient. I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube in 6 months.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows definitely got thicker thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  Though I was unsure at first, my brows are growing back!  And the seller is a great company.  I highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> No results after 3 months.  A waste of money</li>
    <li> My eyebrow hair is actually growing!!</li>
    <li> Definately has help fill in my sparse brows !</li>
    <li> Works great on thinning eyebrows.  I started to use it twice daily until my brows reached&lt;br /&gt;desired thickness and color then I switched to once a day.  Back to twice when needed.</li>
    <li> I actually grew new eyebrows and I am 61 years old.  I am purchasing my second tube.</li>
    <li> My brows have been sparse for the past 15 years from overplucking when I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and I have A LOT of growth. Growth where I haven&#x27;t seen any growth in 10 years. My eyebrows aren&#x27;t that filled in yet but it&#x27;s getting there (I hope). The hairs grow in blonde and than they get dark when they get longer. I&#x27;ve noticed the preexisting hairs grow really fast so I have to trim them quite a bit. I still don&#x27;t notice that much growth in the areas I really need it. Most of the new growth is in areas where you would pluck the hair out anyway. I have noticed that it is easier now to fill in my brows and it looks more natural because there&#x27;s more hair. I&#x27;m anticipating the day when I can go without penciling in my eyebrows at all. I&#x27;m hoping this product will do that for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent in all ways. Can take some time but easy to apply and definitely increases hair growth -- naturally</li>
    <li> Faithful use didn&#x27;t seem to produce any visible improvement. I&#x27;m still using it and hoping for a miracle with longevity.</li>
    <li> Helps promote hair growth. Love it.been using it for a while now. Find it cheaper online</li>
    <li> It was a fair result.  Had only minimal regrowth on the eyebrows.  Not enough to get excited about.  Not what I expected based on other recommendations. Color is not an issue with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be interested to know how long one tube lasted with daily use for other customers. Mine lasted less than two months. It did work fairly well, but $30/month for eyebrows seems a bit steep.</li>
    <li> after a few weeks I do see some results.   ------ just not as much as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> a bit surprised, but this REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> It works but grows hair above brow. Not a deal breaker for me</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that makes my brows thicker.</li>
    <li> Ok this stuff really does what it says it will do. I didnt have any eyebrows and after using two of these I know have black bushy eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually growing eyebrows. It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but wish it was not so expensive!  It has brought back some eyebrows that I thought were long gone.  It is true it does darken the eyebrows, but not that much.  You should use it every night for best results, but can skip a day.  I did read somewhere that this product was discontinued, but I hope that is not true.</li>
    <li> Without it my brows would be very thin.  New growth within a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> After 3 months of use, I am beginning to see new growth!</li>
    <li> Some improvement...needs more time</li>
    <li> When I bought RevitaBrow, I read the reviews and I knew that it didn&#x27;t work for some people and I am now included in those people. the product did not have ANY effect on my eye brows. Granted I have what most would consider a medium brow to begin with, but I thought that it would thicken them up a bit. I applied the product twice a day and saw no effect. VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! Have to wait at least 3 months to see results , be patient , but you will love, love results&lt;br /&gt;I now have dark , thick brows &amp; you could barely see any brows before !!  Will continue to use this product !  .. I use it every night</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this and hesitant to pay so much for something that might not work.. I over plucked years ago and my brows never seemed to grow back. It took a couple weeks, but now my brows are sprouting up like weeds! I am so excited look each morning to see the progress..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks, and it is AMAZING the difference I see. I have blonde eyebrows as it is - and they have gotten thinner over the years (especially the arches). I can&#x27;t believe the difference I already see. Seriously, y&#x27;all. This works. I may not need eyebrow liner soon! I will continue to buy this without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Terrific product that makes eyebrows or eye lashes grow. Wish it was still offered for sale on Amazon. Please bring it back!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Totally Brooke shields status . The only one that works the most!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am so happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a five-star rating, because it did exactly what it advertised it would do.  My eyebrows seemed to be thinning and a family member told me to try this product.  She had very blond, thin eyebrows and after using this product it looked as though she had dyed them, she actually had  eyebrows!  I am completely satisfied, this product did what it claimed it would do.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants their eyebrows back the way they were.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Saw results in 2 weeks, continue to see results!</li>
    <li> It really works! Keeps sparse eyebrows growing. Easy to use, but requires that you use it every day without fail.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s stimulating growth or delaying fall-out yet, after using faithfully for about 10 days. But it is easy to apply, non-irritating and seems to make the existing individual brow hairs stronger.</li>
    <li> My brows do look slightly thicker but this product is overpriced for what it offers.</li>
    <li> All I&#x27;ve got to say:  I HAVE NEW, THICK EYEBROW! YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not working as the saying</li>
    <li> This is a re-order for me- I stopped using it for a few months and noticed thinning so I bought it again and now use it at morning and night and my brows are BACK!!! It takes about six weeks but it really DOES WORK. Be patient, it&#x27;s worth the wait. Just know you have to KEEP using it or your brows WILL thin out again. One tube will last about two to three months if you use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> works well while you&#x27;re using it but reverts back to original brow after stopping use.  fair price.  fair shipping.nice.  would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and no regrowth.  The only thing I have found that works is Latisse.  Unfortunately it caused me extreme black under eye circles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about stuff like this, but my eyebrows had thinned and gotten so patchy I was desperate to find something that might work. Revitabrow really does work. But it took a while. I didn&#x27;t really see results for at least a month and I used it religiously every night. I&#x27;ve read the reviews that say using it in the morning and at night helps to speed the process, so you might want to try that for faster results. But after using it for two months, my brows are almost totally grown in and full and I don&#x27;t want to risk getting too bushy! Nice problem to have, no? I know some people here said they saw results in just a week or so. That did not happen for me, but like I said, it did work and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Also, there were no side effects at all. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item and really works. Easy to use - you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t use it before.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price :) it&#x27;s not a miracle serum but it has definitely grown and improved the quality of my brows ~ I have been using this for quite some time now ~</li>
    <li> I was introduced to RevitaBrow by my esthetician. I&#x27;ve been using RevitaBrow Eyebrow Conditioner for almost a year.  It really helps my brows remain beautiful.  They are nicely conditioned, make the hairs grow in nicely.  I will continue using this product.  Also, at night when I have no mascara on I put a small amount on the base of my eyelashes.  It seems to have improved my eyelash growth as well.  :)</li>
    <li> I have used this for some time and find it very good. It takes several weeks to see results and you should continue use to keep.</li>
    <li> love the results,works as stated and i saved forty bucks over the salon price,i will definitly buy this product again</li>
    <li> It definitely works, I&#x27;ve seen a good amount of growth and it even appears darker.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work when I purchased but after using this item 2 weeks I can see my brows are growing ! I highly recommend this item !! :)</li>
    <li> This product is great. Made my eyebrows go from barely noticeable and thin to thick and filled in. It does take about a month to see real results but worth the wait. A real plus is that when the new hairs grow in they&#x27;re dark, just like when you were much younger. You don&#x27;t need to apply any make-up to them at all. They will start thinning again if you don&#x27;t stick with the product, so keep going. I found the product in &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; stores at a price of well over $100 per tube but I found on amazon direct from RevitaBrow for much less. I would recommend this product to anyone losing their eyebrows. They also make a RevitaLash for eyelashes and it works equally well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no mess and no side effects.  Took a good 6 weeks to notice any change though.  Eyebrows are definitely thicker.  Mine had stopped growing in after 20 years of over plucking.</li>
    <li> This product does make brows look noticeably thicker and fuller, but the results fade fast if you stop applying the product for a few days. The opaque packaging is probably necessary to protect the product from light, but it makes it difficult to see how much is left. Overall, the results justify the price.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe this would make a difference, but the review were pretty overwhelming. Between menopause and thyroid issues, my once full eyebrows are now not only blonde, but blonde and very sparse. I am at the end of my first tube, my eyebrows ARE fuller and darker, with no rashes or skin concerns. My only worry is whether they are ever going to be evenly full. But even now, it takes less eyebrow pencil to make them look right. I can&#x27;t find anything in the ingredients (unless something isn&#x27;t disclosed) that I wouldn&#x27;t want to put on my face...like some kind of rogaine, etc. I&#x27;m very pleased, and just ordered my second tube.</li>
    <li> this stuff regrew my eyebrows in one month, fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have used it for over a week now as direct.  The product does not work at all.  I am planning on returning it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> Yes, it seems to be working but it is taking some time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and I do see some change.</li>
    <li> I have very thin eyebrows and read about this product in a magazine. It was very pricey but the reviews were good so I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I do notice that it seems to be growing more hairs on my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m not finding that my eyebrows are appearing noticeably thicker. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I run out to see if it gets better but as of now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works real well. My eyebrows are growing, I love this product. No I don&#x27;t need to pencil in my brows.</li>
    <li> I love Revitalash but this doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well. My brows are thin and I put this on every night but they are still thin after using it for 4 months. I see a tiny improvement but not much. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> What more can I say, it works.</li>
    <li> After seeing my sisters great results I ordered a tube. Three weeks exactly after beginning to use it I notice what brow hairs that are there are fuller and the spots that were quite sparse are now showing growth. I use less pencil to fill in already. Happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: now about 6 weeks since I started using it. I&#x27;m actually finding I need to tweeze to clean up. Before starting to use this, I had almost completely lost the outer edge of the brow and started loosing the hair on the other ends. I was getting nervous they&#x27;d be all gone in a few months. They have regrowth all around, the outer ends are coming back too. My brows are fuller than they were just two weeks ago. I actually feel comfortable going out of the house without eyebrow pencil. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube and I believe it really has thickened up my eyebrows.  At least they seem thicker to me!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to work, sort of. I probably should use it twice daily instead of once a day.  I&#x27;m sure my brows would be worse without it.</li>
    <li> Use it several times a week and you willno longer have thin brows.  Works great - almost too great - that&#x27;s why don&#x27;t use every day!</li>
    <li> This product really works!!!  My eyebrows did grow back in with this after a disastrous waxing event.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to work for me, but after about 1 month of use I can definitely see a difference</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had nice eyebrows in years.  This helped grow new hair but just on the inside corners to center, for some reason they didn&#x27;t grow past the arch.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for more than one year.  My brows have been sparse since Chemotherapy 13 years ago.  RevitaBrow has helped my brows to grow thicker and full.  Will continue using this product and highly recommend for those who need some brow growth.  Excellent and actually works.</li>
    <li> I have been using RevitaBrow for about a month and a half and I can definitely see a difference. I am 52 years old and over plucked my brows when I was younger. My brows are darker and thicker now! I am using this product most nights before bed and mornings after I wash my face.There is still some room for growth but…. I will continue to use RevitaBrow!</li>
    <li> It works but needs to be consistent and takes awhile to see the results, apply regularly every night before bedtime</li>
    <li> Great product from Revitash!  Over the years, my brows have gotten thin.  Also, there hair close to the bridge of my nose that makes your brows look full was virtually gone.  This product is amazing.  My brows filled in beautifully.  They were full and framed my face as they should.  Because of the expense (hence, only four stars), I stopped using it.  Mistake!  I lost all that hair growth and had to start all over.  Expensive but really like the product.</li>
    <li> Has not done anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about three years ago. It WORKS for me. I did take OVER 60 days for there to be a marked improvement in my eyebrows (AND LASHES) and if you stop using it daily for a period of time, your eyebrows will thin again. I used to have to use an eyebrow pencil to fill in bare spots, I have not used a pencil for about three years! I loved the length of my lashes when I used the lash conditioner-- similar results to to &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product but without a script and or risk of my eye color changing!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different types of eyebrow conditioners with very little results. Then I found this one. My son and husband both commented on my new dark and thick eyebrows. I actually had to go and get them professionally shaped. How fun at age 63 to have full eyebrows again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this amazing product since 6 months now and I have seen a huge difference on my eyebrow that is why I think I&#x27;ll remain using it until I get the shape I really want. This product really works</li>
    <li> My 2nd time to use RevitaBrow.  Too soon to say anything about results.  Takes about a month before there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  My eyebrows are thin and spotty so I expect this product to help the hairs I have to develop a thicker brow.  For now it&#x27;s a wait and see mode. I do have HOPE though.</li>
    <li> Everybody has something good to say about my eyebrows after using this product ! the only bad thing I have to say is  :  DON&#x27;T turn it over it WILL SPILL !</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother. She&#x27;s been using this product for a while now. It&#x27;s working well. But once she stopped using it, her brows fall out again.</li>
    <li> Awesome..can&#x27;t live without out this!</li>
    <li> RevitaBrow is definitely no miracle product, but it does seem to work very effectively and at it&#x27;s own pace. I have been using this product for just over a month and around the second or third week I did find baby hairs sprouting where there were no baby hairs before however, I have seen no results in areas where I severely over plucked. I will continue to use this product. I have been applying RevitaBrow for about a month and a half. I also recommend reading the reviews of people who have used this product for a longer time period.</li>
    <li> I have used Revitalash in the past with wonderful results. I ran out and went to purchase more and it seemed more expensive than the Revitabrow. So I purchased this instead. I have been using it on my eyelashes and eyebrows and love the results of both. I have tried other products like Elastilash by Obagi but haven&#x27;t found any that work as great as the Revitalash products.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this thing actually seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a good transaction. My wife really likes this!</li>
    <li> luv this product and tell all - thyroid imbalance took a toll on my eyebrows and this product brought them back.</li>
    <li> Revita brow took a few weeks to start working but then I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. My brows grew in darker, fuller and thicker. They never appeared like this in my life. I actually needed to shape them. When I stopped and tried cheaper product, all the changes were gone and brows reverted back. So I&#x27;ve started over again and plan to keep using. Great never to have to worry about brow pencil or other make up I love it!  Not especially cheap but works.</li>
    <li> Reviltalash has totally worked to grow longer, stronger eyelashes after a few (~ 6 weeks), so trying eyebrow conditioner, 3 weeks so far.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as described.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does....I have used on both brows and eyelashes and have incredible growth on both..It has been just over two months and the results are spectacular....I have just reordered to make sure I do not run out. Buy it if you want longer lashes and thicker brows.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any difference, maybe got to use it longer</li>
    <li> I saw new growth in just a few weeks. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It does not meet expectations from advertising and is like mascara for the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I actually see my brows getting thicker. I still have to fill them in with brow pencil so it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I do see improvement after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d written an earlier &amp;#34;seller review&amp;#34; stating that this product had arrived quickly and in nice packaging.  Now that I&#x27;ve used the RevitaBrow conditioner for just over two months, I can also state that it actually works!  My eyebrows are definitely thicker and longer than they had been and I need to pluck those extra eyebrow hairs again.  My eyebrows had been getting so thin that one brow even had a bare area which is almost completely filled in now.  If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product, I&#x27;d suggest taking a close-up of your eyebrows before before you start using it.  I&#x27;d wished I had!</li>
    <li> Works very well as an eyebrow thickener and lengthener.</li>
    <li> There is no color to this product.  It is a conditioner and it has really helped grow my eyebrows.  I use it every day and really like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Absolutely love it! It really works!!</li>
    <li> In one month this promoted visiable, steering and healthy growth. It is worth the cost and is mite pricey at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have really thin eyebrows and they have gotten thicker, darker and I have hair where I didn&#x27;t before.  My hands-down favorite beauty product!</li>
    <li> I purchased RevitaBrow to use mostly on my eyebrows.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with hair growth on my left eyebrow, for some reason, my right eyebrow is &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and just doesn&#x27;t grow hair in certain areas.  I have tried at least a half a dozen eyebrow regrowth products over the years (most of which I purchased from Amazon), and I&#x27;ve also tried the well-known prescription brand, all without any success.  I honestly didn&#x27;t have high expectations for RevitaBrow.  But let me just say I&#x27;ve discovered that RevitaBrow is the HOLY GRAIL of eyebrow regrowth!  By week 5, I noticed significant brow growth in areas that haven&#x27;t grown hair in years.  If this stuff can work on me, it can work on just about anybody.  I think the people that don&#x27;t see the results are not using it long enough or consistently.  It really takes longer than 4 weeks to see a difference.  Please give it AT LEAST 5 to 6 weeks and you will be so pleased.  And it&#x27;s really not difficult to use; I&#x27;ve been applying it one time per day and only at night (since I use brow powder makeup during the daytime).  I just can&#x27;t be more thrilled to have found RevitaBrow and I will continue to use it for as long as it&#x27;s around.  I hesitated to write a review because I don&#x27;t want to risk the product going out of stock once the word gets out!  But really, if you&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and haven&#x27;t had much success, please give RevitaBrow a shot.  I have a sense that one tube will last about 2-3 months.  Although it&#x27;s pricey, for less than $1 a day, it is worth it to have gorgeous eyebrows again and to stop fretting about bald spots.  Also, I know the instructions advise not to use it on your eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve been making a light pass over my lash lines after applying to my eyebrows (though I have noticed that doing this can irritate the eye area slightly).  I&#x27;ve actually received remarks from 2 different people about how long my eyelashes look!  No compliments yet on the brows, but I don&#x27;t need them since I can see the results for myself.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product it cost $150 from a beauty salon . This time $64 . It&#x27;s works great with consistent daily use and gets brows  full and  healthy but you must co the using it to maintain them .</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me this product at Christmas time when I was in England.  She had used one recently herself and I noticed the difference it had made as soon as I saw her. The one she bought for me has lasted  about ten weeks although I think I probably used more of it than necessary as I was SO excited with the results. I do find it incredible as I don&#x27;t think I have ever had decent eyebrows in my entire life.  I have recommended RevitaBrow to my sister who has just begun to use hers, I can&#x27;t wait to hear her comments in a couple of weeks!&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is considering RevitaBrow - don&#x27;t hesitate, you&#x27;ll be amazed at the results!!</li>
    <li> Per advertisement I expected more new growth. Very disappointed. Only have maybe a half dozen new growth. Have been on my second purchase for about 2/3 weeks and still no improvement. For the price I expected more.</li>
    <li> I have really thin and almost invisible eyebrows my whole life. I started using this a few months ago, and it worked magically. Then I stopped using it and my eyebrows are back to be like before. So I brought more. I have full eyebrows now. No need to draw them in the morning. What a joy1 I love products that actually work!</li>
    <li> Takes about a month to get results... Then fills brows in nicely</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and so far I have seen a little growth to my eyebrows. I have seen increased thickness though to my existing eyebrows so it satisfies me for the time being.</li>
    <li> Great item &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Saw results in a few weeks. My eyebrows are much fuller.</li>
    <li> I still have some areas where hair did not grow.  I also didn&#x27;t expect for the product to dye my eyebrows.  The hair definitely got darker.&lt;br /&gt;And after I was done, it appears that there was no hair growth because I feel I went back to how I was.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I had very thin eyebrows when I started using it and now I look like Groucho Marks!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works--I have new growth on my thinning brows!</li>
    <li> still waiting to judge but so far has done nothing</li>
    <li> this really worked for me.  used it regularly for a month and brows grew in and grew longer.</li>
    <li> This product works - period.  I was losing my lashes due to a thyroid issue, skeptical and wary of the price - I was desperate - I ordered it anyway.  The brow and eyelash formulas are the same - I prefer the tip on the eyebrow applicator so I use this on my lashes. I have to apply it consistently or my lashes won&#x27;t continue growing back in after they fall out, but it&#x27;s either this or eyelash extensions and I prefer this.</li>
    <li> This really worked for me. I had very thin eyebrows that you can see the skin behind. I didn&#x27;t expect much but I was really surprised. My eyebrows were so thick that I had to use a tweezer. But you have to use it constantly. I ordered a new one because my eyebrows are starting to get thin again after not using it for a while.</li>
    <li> Takes about a month to see full results, but so worth the money. Long, full lashes and eyebrows fills in too.</li>
    <li> Lots of new growth where I would continue to tweeze, less growth in the actual brow area. Two months in, verdict still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless my daughter is sneaking it for her lashes, I am disappointed in how short it lasted. I read a review said it lasted 6 months, but mine has petered out after two, and I thought I was using it sparingly. Not sure I should invest again.</li>
    <li> This really works. You don&#x27;t have to use it every day either. Hen it last longer and still works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 month and already my eyebrows are looking thicker and the gap I had in one eyebrow is growing some new ones! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> this product works--I like to use it on eyelashes too--saw a difference in 2 weeks--enough to buy again-a little pricey-&lt;br /&gt;but can use every other day to make it last</li>
    <li> Love this -- it works like a charm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this before with 5 stars.  Reducing it to 4 on my second purchase (made after the new growth thinned out, just as predicted here) because this time it has turned my eyebrows SO dark they look black.  It also seems to be staining the skin underneath.  Anyone else have this issue?  Totally inconsistent from first tube, and I do like the hair, but the blackness is very stark.</li>
    <li> this product works - that&#x27;s all one need to know</li>
    <li> used it for 2 weeks and already see a fuller brow line.  I have even skipped a few nights with my busy schedule and I still see this product work.  Definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using that long but this stuff really works. Already starting to see hairs fill in the sparse places.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product, and has been for years she has tried other products though they do not work as well.</li>
    <li> This works! Thicker and darker brows, after about one month. I would definitely recommend this product, and have been using it for about a year now.</li>
    <li> Now I know that doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but this little item does exactly what it says it does.  It helps re-grow sparse eyebrows and keeps your eyebrow hairs healthy and strong.  My eyebrows were getting sparse once I reached 45-ish and there were gaps between the hairs, which didn&#x27;t look right.  After using this daily for 3 weeks, I noticed new hairs filling in the gaps.  Within another 2 weeks my brows were full and lush and look just like they did when I was much younger.  Would highly recommend this!  After the initial 3 weeks I switched to using it once every other day (hey, it ain&#x27;t cheap!), and I&#x27;ve retained the thick, full eyebrows I wanted.</li>
    <li> My 75 year  old lashes and brows have truly been revitalized. I love having long lashes and enough brow hair to be seen...again.... (In a way, reliving my past.)</li>
    <li> All I can say is that this product works beyond my wildest expectations!</li>
    <li> BETTER BROWS THEN EVER BEFORE</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as promised, waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow back my eyebrows for almost two years but I always had patches. I noticed they filled in when I went to pencil in the spaces and couldn&#x27;t tell where to draw! My threading lady noticed, too.&lt;br /&gt;I used once in the morning and once at night, on dry face, before moisturinzing. I used one full tube before my brows fully filled in, and the first effects were the existing hairs getting very long - which was a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out about three weeks ago and haven&#x27;t noticed any loss or changes so I think it is well worth the cost of one tube.</li>
    <li> i had very thin brows before using product. after one month, my brows became thicker and more filled in. love the product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical... it seems these kinds of products really oversell themselves, but I noticed visible results in one month!</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I plan to order more.  I ordered it after reading about it in Allure magazine.  It was recommended in 2 issues.</li>
    <li> it works. That&#x27;s all you need to know. My eyebrows are growing in kinda funky, but that&#x27;s my faces fault. My eyebrow hair is growing in much more quickly than without using RevitaBrow. I&#x27;m happy with it, and now get to play with and reshape these caterpillars growing in.</li>
    <li> Really helped my thinning eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve tried other similar products with no results. I now have my dark brows again .</li>
    <li> I like the product and it appears to be making my eyebrows thicker just slow to the areas that need it most...jury still out</li>
    <li> Great price and product. Could not get eyebrows to grow after this I finally have something to wax thank you</li>
    <li> This really does make my sparse eyebrows grow! Does take a little time - days - to start working, but then is great.</li>
    <li> This works. Started using this over a year ago, it took about 8 weeks to see results (to do with hair growth cycle) and I&#x27;ve been using it with great success ever since.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!! After just a few days I started noticing new darker hairs and after 3 weeks I have fuller eyebrows than I have ever had. My brows have always been patchy and really thin, this is a miracle product!! I&#x27;d recommend it to ANYONE. Now I&#x27;m dying to buy the eyelash conditioner since I now know this product actually works!!</li>
    <li> Like legions of beauty products promoted for women \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; this one hasn&#x27;t had any noticeable effect. I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t buy it again unless Brooke Shields brows suddenly sprout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on June 9, 2014. To give RevitaBrow a fair chance, I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully every day. I was skeptical at first, but eventually it smoothed the little bumps and rough spots in brow lines. I&#x27;m happy to say that new brow growth has made a nice difference. I still haven&#x27;t used up the first tube and will continue using RevitaBrow.</li>
    <li> I have used this product nightly since I got it.  In 3 months I had full eyebrows, just like I had when I was younger.  I had no bad side effects and there is still some left in the tube.  I&#x27;ll try to update when the tube is empty and I know how long it lasted.  Great product and worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The tube lasted about 3 months.  I&#x27;m reordering more!</li>
    <li> A good friend recommended this after I complimented her eyebrows. After having over tweezed since high school, and trying to let them grow out, I had kind of given up that they would naturally fill back in any more. Since using this for the past month or two, I&#x27;ve had a lot of acquaintances ask me what I&#x27;ve changed about my appearance, and it&#x27;s all because this has helped my eyebrows fill in and also thicken. I don&#x27;t need to fill them in with brow powder or pencil, and have even had to tame them down a bit. I&#x27;m Asian and have naturally sparse eyebrows anyway, but this stuff really did add some oomph and the weird horizontal patches in the middle of my eyebrows that hadn&#x27;t been growing in for the last couple of years of no plucking have finally started to fill in again. It really does work!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Within one week I notice that my eyebrow are thicker. I use it every morning and every evening. I didn&#x27;t notice the redness that others described. So far a lot of the sparse places I have look fuller and I don&#x27;t have to fill in my eyebrows as much.</li>
    <li> An excellent inhancement to prescription lash grower!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were thinning and this little device thickened them up in 30 days - recommend!!!! Just remember after your eyebrows are back to normal to continue use three days a week.</li>
    <li> One sweep across your brows and they appear fuller. This product works better than a brow brush and pencil and it conditions while it thickens! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian so it&#x27;s no surprise that I have short eyelashes but fortunately I have thick eyebrows with some bald spots due to scars. My friend referred me to revitabrow (she said it&#x27;s more potent than revitalash) for my eyelashes so I thought I gave it a try. The bottle lasted for 3 months for my eyelashes and eyebrows. I started noticing a difference after 1 month but a huge difference after 3 months. I love it! I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on how long my eyelashes are. And my eyebrows filled up, especially around my scars, making them more full. I had buy more, because your lashes and eyebrows will go back to its normal self, and we don&#x27;t want that!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this stuff rocks! I have bought it twice now and it really really works! My brows were thin from over plucking as a teenager and I thought there was no hope. Well, here to say---there is!! My brows are the fullest they have ever been. I use this religiously every night! Best money ever spent on a product!!</li>
    <li> It works wonders, just be patient.  It took approx. 4 weeks to achieve the heavy, bold eyebrows I like; however, you can&#x27;t stop using or else they go back to the wimpy brows you started off with.  Always have a replacement on hand.</li>
    <li> Love this product, lost my eyebrows in an illness , now there back very pleased</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Took about 4 weeks of use to see results. Eyebrows are thick enough now to be shaped. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow. This really freaking works. I have had a couple hairs on my eyebrows and it always have been frustrated for me to pain it every day. Since I am using it (2.5 months every night) I really see a big progress! My eyebrow is growing back and I am so happy. Hopefully I can get it to nice shape. I am def gonna order refill. Its pricey but def worth it!</li>
    <li> It really seems to be working.  Very happy with it!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work over time to add a little to eyebrows. I am giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I see some growth, but not the dramatic change I get with Revitalash.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is related, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, and when I had my brows done my skin was more sensitive than usual.  Next time I will stop using the product a few days before brow maintenance.</li>
    <li> WOW it is working !!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be no better than snake oil, but WOW it actually works. One reviewer said it dyes the hair.  It may, I&#x27;m not sure, but so what? If your brows look fuller so much the better!!  It DOES thicken and lengthen your brows.  I saw results in just two weeks applying it once a day (in the morning).  It goes on clear with the consistency of water, dries immediately and you can apply brow pencil almost immediately following application.</li>
    <li> Continues to work for me:)</li>
    <li> Existing hairs grew longer but no new/fuller growth in sparse spots, I discontinued using and later noticed that my eyebrows aren&#x27;t growing at all (4 months later) . I have never noticed this response with any other product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference. I may not have the thick brows I used to, but they are definitely noticeably fuller.</li>
    <li> When I was young and foolish during the Bowie glam era, I plucked my eyebrows down to nothing. I started using this product and my eyebrows came back. I look ten years younger because I no longer have to use old lady eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I had (note HAD) thin, sparse brows due to over tweezing for many,many years.  I have been using RevitaBrow now for a four and a half weeks.  This is so amazing!  I have nice full eyebrows for the first time in years.  I do use it twice a day and once my brows are what I want, I will drop back my usage.  I do know that to maintain the look, I have to keep using the product.  I highly recommend it.  I know I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month now and my eyebrows look much fuller, I am going to try the eyelash product next as they need it more than ever before.</li>
    <li> great product,my eyebrows were like before</li>
