<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price. Always. Always on time&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love these little pads. My OCD is nurtured when I open the container and see all of the little pads stacked up perfectly...it is true bliss. I love how my face feels after using them - so cool, so refreshed, and so clean. I love how gentle these are on my delicate, sensitive skin. I love how easy it is to throw these in my suitcase for traveling. I love how easily disposable these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DON&#x27;T love, however, is the name. Correction, indeed...as if my flawless complexion needs &amp;#34;correction.&amp;#34; I prefer to call them my complexion &amp;#34;enhancement&amp;#34; pads.... :)</li>
    <li> my face is so much clearer</li>
    <li> I was a bit scared of getting the max instead of the gentle, b/c of the alcohol content but went ahead and got the max. These pads do what they claim and do not burn or dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this along with the AHA/BHA acne clearing gel and my skin has been transformed. My skin is smooth and pores are smaller. I&#x27;m becoming a PTR fan. I ordered 2 more products and can&#x27;t wait to receive them.</li>
    <li> Very good product, for face and other problem areas.... my face rarely gets pimples but other body parts do (very embarrassing!) I  have tried everything - for over 20 years - and this is the first product to eradicate body-pimples completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - -be careful who you buy them from - I have gotten products that seemed like they had been replaced with stridex pads. The PTR pads should NOT smell like alcohol - the scent is very nice.  I trust Payless Beauty and Flex Commerce - their products always arrive sealed and smelling the way they should!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> Great product. It makes the skin tingle like it should but it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out very much. Still, I wished it didn&#x27;t have so much alcohol in it. It irritates my eyes when I come near it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps unlike others considering this purchase, I have normal to dry, sometimes sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;problem\\&quot; acne, but in the summer my face sometimes feels like a grease-fest, and I&#x27;ll get the occasional blemish.  When I bought these I really just wanted a good exfoliant, as the mask I had been using got discontinued.    I&#x27;ve only been using these for three days, but the difference in my skin is amazing.  My pores look distinctly smaller, and the two blemishes I had forming when I received the product were gone IN ONE DAY.  Granted, you can use these up to 3 times per day according to package instructions, and on the first day I did, but I think generally it will only be necessary once or twice a day to maintain results.  Also, this has officially replaced my normal facial cleanser, as the exfoliating side of the pads seems to remove every speck of dirt that ever thought about settling into your pores!  This product has NOT irritated my fair skin.    A few things regarding the product itself: It contains 10% glycolic acid.  This is the maximum amount of that exfoliant available without a prescription, so you get a high level of chemical exfoliation.  You also get a very high level of physical exfoliation with the appropriately textured side of the pad.  It&#x27;s on par with home micro-dermabrasion kits.  In spite of all this exfoliating power, these pads are packed with skin-soothers: chamomile, comfrey, green tea, aloe and allantoin, which is also used to reduce the appearance of scars in a variety of products.  The only exception I would take with the veracity of the product description is the scent description.  These smell like alcohol to me, not peaches.  However, the scent quickly evaporates, and I personally don&#x27;t care for synthetic peach smell anyway.  The pads are not thick, but they are thoroughly saturated, and it only takes one to treat the whole face.  Highly recommended, and a terrific value.</li>
    <li> Amazing - I saw a difference after only 2 nights.</li>
    <li> I have the pleasure of having both aging skin and adult acne and this really covers both bases quite well.  I use them only in the morning because I found I actually got MORE breakouts if I used them twice a day.  The bonus of using them in the a.m. is that they&#x27;re a great prep for make-up.  They get off all the little flakes and dead gunk and really prime your skin for moisturizer and then base.  I saw a noticeable reduction in breakouts and zits that do occur heal more quickly.  In addition, I think over time they soften and reduce fine lines.  I&#x27;m menopausal (yippee!) so I&#x27;ll continue to have issues until my hormones settle but this has helped control that annoying hormonal chin acne that many women get.  Another tip - they&#x27;ll last four months if you cut them in half so it&#x27;s also a good deal in comparison to other high-end designer skin care products.</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers stated, I had a bit of peeling, which I expected.  However, it was only for the first few days and then my skin cleared up beautifully. (I only have minor skin blemishes with some clogged pores).</li>
    <li> I was excited about this and thought the quality would be superb but it&#x27;s not very effective and really dried out my skin.  It also smells very strong.  I probably will not order again.</li>
    <li> I use these pads every couple of days and they really help with my complexion. They have helped to exfoliate and smooth out my skin as well as reduce old acne scaring. I get so many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using them. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it before, but I will not buy it again from this seller. The seal was broken and it smelled like finger nail polish remover rather than what I know the product should smell like.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product about one year ago. I have oily, acne prone,and large pores. I tried everything from proactiv to other expensive acne products. Thankfully I came accross these pads and I haven&#x27;t stopped using them ever since.</li>
    <li> I was using a similar product by Philosophy and ran out. When I went to the department store, I ended up leaving with these instead. And I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I will mention I have adult moderate cystic acne. It didn&#x27;t affect me until a little under a year ago, though I have always had some blackheads and an occasional whitehead. I had purchased and been using the Philosophy Clear Days Ahead system and it has been working ok. Using the pads twice daily (once in the morning and just before bed) I noticed some improvement in my acne. Two days after using the Peter Thomas Roth pads and I noticed a significant difference. I think it is fair to say these are much more effective on my skin problem than another product I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads have 2 sides. One is for &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; and the other for &amp;#34;pore-refinement.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t found any material that indicates which side to use first, so I have played around with them the last couple weeks. Either way, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in as far as which side to use first. There is a bit of a burn or sting after application though. I find it to be pretty mild and brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these twice everyday. Initially I was worried they would irritate my skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems there. I do still use all of the other products in the Philosophy line I mentioned, including the moisturizer. I have not used anything different so I am not sure if my skin is handling the pads well or the moisturizer is really helping me out. Either way I am pretty happy after about 3 weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am not having any problems and the acne seems to be subsiding I plan to continue with these products. Of course, sometimes things just catch my eye. I would recommend anyone with acne to give these a try. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but these may work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for about two years now and have tried just about everything to treat it. After reading such rave reviews about this product, I figured I would give it a try. The pads work as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see any miracles happening with my skin. From what I saw, they had the same effect as the Clearsil drugstore brand cleansing pads. My advice is to save your money.</li>
    <li> Though these correction pads have some good ingredients, this product strips the skin - which can cause a rebound effect of even more oiliness.  When denatured alcohol is one of the first five ingredients (ingredients are listed by amount, with the first ingredients comprising the highest % of the product) don&#x27;t buy it. I get better results from MD Alpha Beta pads. It has a LOT less alcohol in it. It&#x27;s ingredients are:     Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Extract, Citric Acid, Copper PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Glycolic Acid, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Water, Alcohol Denat., Sodium Benzoate, Soy Isoflavones, Genestein, Hamamelis Virginiana, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Zinc PCA</li>
    <li> This has alcohol in it, it&#x27;s highly irritating and made me break out like crazy (I purchased it to shrink my pores and exfoliate a little; I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts before!). I read up on alcohol in skin care products to figure out what was going on with my skin, and apparently it&#x27;s very highly skin damaging. Ie, if you&#x27;re purchasing this for anti aging, expect it to have the opposite effect.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these pads.  My skin is in the \\&quot;fine lines AND blemishes\\&quot; stage of life -- the pads seem to address both issues with the combination of acids.  They are gentle yet feel very effective - my skin feels really polished and the pores seem smaller too.  Less breakouts and smoother skin make me happy.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the correction pads while serving in Afghanistan. It was a face-saver! I am sensitive to the cold and the wind and my face becomes very dry at times. I get stress-induced breakouts, sometimes they can be quite unflattering, and sometimes it&#x27;s not even noticeable. But no matter the severity of the breakout, the pads served as an excellent topical treatment. I have eczema, but the medicine was gentle enough that I never experienced any skin irritation. My skin, after about a week&#x27;s time became even more toned and stubborn pimples were dried up within days and then gone without scarring. To make the pads last longer and to save my skin from over-medicating, I cut the pads in half and use once daily. It isn&#x27;t a miracle product, however favorable changes in my complexion were definitely apparent.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I have to use it every other day because my skin is sensative.  It still leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love PTR products. I suffer from &amp;#34;hormonal&amp;#34; cystic breakouts around my chin area. I read reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. Every month like clockwork my bumps appear either a week before or after my menstrual cycle. I feel that this product helps them heal but it hasn&#x27;t prevented my breakouts from occurring.  It has been great for cleaning my skin after being out in these warm, humid days. I use it 2x a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. In the winter I cut back to just every night.  All in all I think I will continue to use this product. As a side note, I do cut the pads in half so you get more for your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quick sometime. Works great on preventing breakout. Use it nightly</li>
    <li> i use this frequently and  has cleared up some brown spots.  nice stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this for two weeks, and then my skin had a break out of tiny bumps,  after this reaction my skin was peeling for 3 weeks!!! :(</li>
    <li> best product for my skin!</li>
    <li> This product has really changed my skin. I have very persistent (but moderate), hormonal acne that has significantly worsened in my 20s. Typically, I don&#x27;t get cystic or severe acne, but my skin is definitely broken out far more often than it&#x27;s clear. I have tried a myriad of acne products over the past 10 years that generally made my overall complexion worse - it seems that most acne products are targeted at bacteria-induced acne, and are extremely drying (which, in my case just makes my face oilier). I did not find that to be the case with this product. Sometimes I will use it twice a day, and it still does not have a super-drying effect. It&#x27;s improved my overall complexion quite a bit and seems to squelch impending breakouts and definitely wards off new ones. When not broken out, my complexion looks downright pretty. Unfortunately, the product has not stopped pimples altogether. I don&#x27;t know that any product will for my type of acne.      I saw another reviewer claimed that the pads caused overproduction of oil on her face, and I would imagine that this varies from skin-type to skin-type. This product has been the best so far for me, so I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. The price on Amazon is better, but if you&#x27;re on the fence consider buying from Sephora. They will allow you to return the product if it&#x27;s ineffective or you just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to help me at all. I followed the instructions completely and it didn&#x27;t make things better or worse. I have sensitive oily skin and unfortunately this failed to improve its condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have struggled with moderate persistent acne since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands and types of treatment, from Proactiv to Neutrogena Skin ID and Active Naturals to Mary Kay and Biore and Clean&amp;Clear, to home remedies, epsom salt, regular old soap, salycilic acid peels, masks, toners, just leaving my skin alone...  Basically I had nothing to lose by trying these too.  And I&#x27;ve been so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these pads for about 4 months now and the improvement in my skin is amazing.  Is it perfect? No, but I would say it&#x27;s like 90% better than it used to be.  I still get a zit here and there but they just don&#x27;t last like they used to and they don&#x27;t multiply.  This is just one of the 3 cleansing/treatment products I use in my routine that finally seems to be working, but I think it&#x27;s the most vital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them once a day at night after showering and washing/exfoliating my skin with African Black Soap.  They can REALLY sting if you have inflamed/irritated areas on your face, but it passes after a few seconds and it&#x27;s so worth the discomfort.  The smell is very strong but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.  And for me, they seem to rebalance my skin after the slightly drying effect of the black soap.  There&#x27;s no flaking afterwards, and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to wear less and less foundation (which finding the right foundation that wouldn&#x27;t break me out was half the battle I think. I had read that mineral makeup is healthier for the skin but powder foundations just don&#x27;t work for me so I&#x27;ve been using a liquid mineral foundation [[ASIN:B000MIF2S0 glominerals gloProtective Liquid Foundation - Satin II 1.4 oz.]] that seems to keep my skin happy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels healthier. Something in them also helps to fade acne marks quickly.  I was having a rough time around my jaw line for a few months before I started using these, but now in that same area there&#x27;s no discoloration, no monsters lurking; just clear skin.  They are definitely worth trying at the very least.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout my teens and twenties, I experienced mild acne that was easily \\&quot;cured\\&quot; by birth control pills and Proactiv.  Once I got married and decided to have kids, my acne came back.  I think a large part of this had to do with not being on the pill, but stress also added to the equation.  I have been struggling with my skin since my first son was born.  After doing lots of research, I stumbled upon this product.  I read all the reviews and looked into finding more information on these pads.  Realizing that it was definitely worth a shot, I ordered it.  I have pretty dry skin, so I use the pads every other night.  My skin looks and feels amazing!  After only 5 days (3 uses), most of my blemishes are dried up and disappearing.  I have dark spots around my chin that have begun to lighten as well.  My skin did tighten and get a little red at first, but I made sure that my skin was hydrated and used a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Pads as well.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
    <li> Love these things! They pair very well with Kate Sommerville Eradikate Acne mask</li>
    <li> Great product that really works. Wonderful peach smell to it. Will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> I have been using the pads for less than a month and can honestly say that I am noticing a difference in my complexion. I am 53 years old with combination (mostly oily) skin and I still get blackheads and the occasional pimple.  My skin looks a lot better since I started using these pads.</li>
    <li> The outer seals seemed to have been broken and the internal content were compromised,</li>
    <li> Really cleans your face.  Came quickly and is afford at a great price.  Peter Thomas Roth products are incredible.  I love how young it makes my face.</li>
    <li> Using for years, they exfoliate and alleviate the  appearance of wrinkles, have been using these for 3 years and look in my 30&#x27;s not my upper 40&#x27;s. A must! for your skin care line.</li>
    <li> I almost need to knock on wood before reviewing this product, because it&#x27;s worked so well so far and I have had zero luck with acne products that work in my 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt say I have horrible acne, but I don&#x27;t go most places without foundation.  I try to use makeup only for sensitive skin, etc etc but I still get pretty bad breakouts at least once a month.  I&#x27;ve used several prescription medicines from dermotologists that have been recommended to me. Anyways, I switched to these pads after noticing a friend of mine who has similar skin issues looked great, and although I wouldnt say I saw results in just a few days...I did notice a HUGE difference in about 2 weeks that my prescription pills/creams didnt do for me in 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit this product is strong...your face tingles quite a bit after using, but I have sensitive skin and I actually dont experience stinging or drying out.  Seriously, I would at least give this a try (the price is great compared to other brands that I&#x27;m sure work but are $$$$) if you have problem skin.  I even recommended the sensitive skin pads to my 13 year old sister who has been breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product/brand. Will be trying other products from PTR soon.</li>
    <li> These pads are amazing. I like the smell, the exfoliation is a bonus, and there is plenty of liquid in each one. I have used similar pads by a different company and you have to pour the liquid into the container. They dried out and you didn&#x27;t get enough product on your skin. These have plenty of liquid...yes a bit strong but that makes them work for my oily skin. I also notice they lessen the brown/sun spots on my face and the backs of my hands. I really love how they work for me.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! I bought this for my daughter because her normally clear skin started breaking out. We cut the pads in half and my daughter and sons have all been using them. I have noticed a huge improvement in all of their skin, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t even need to wear foundation anymore.</li>
    <li> I´ve been using products for controlling my acne/blemish problems since my early 20s. Later on I´ve added fine lines and wrinkles for my skin concerns. This product works as promised - one month after using twice a day the acne and blemish got under control and I´ve seen improvement  in the fine lines.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak more highly for these pads. Before I had them recommended to me by a facialist I struggled with breakouts and combination skin &#x3D; dryness and oily areas which led to regular breakouts. I introduced them to my skin and it was as if overnight my skin had pressed a reset button. Can&#x27;t live without &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> This is good It never ceases to amaze me how well I clean my face, and then these pads still pick up dirt! Must be one ingredient in here that does a good job picking up excess dirt. I ordered from yolo beauty through Amazon. Not sure how other people are having issues with this seller, or maybe others? I am sure there are some fakes online. Always are. Honestly it does smell more alcohol -like than peachy. Up close pure alcohol but as it fades, you can definitely smell some peach. So, if the seller I got is not genuine, they are doing a good job hiding it. Mine was sealed. The only negative is the textured side. I was mostly doing the cleanse side. Today, I really used the other side (I can have sensitive skin). Too much for my face. It got a little red. Will stick with just using the other side. All in all, good product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best astrigent acne fighting pads that I have found yet! Very fadt shipping due to prime. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was a bit weary about the price of this product, but I am a believer now.  I&#x27;ve been using the Max Complexion pads for about two weeks now, and my acne has completely cleared.  My pores are quite a bit smaller than they were before I began using these pads, and my skin tone has evened out as well.  I honestly did not expect such great results.</li>
    <li> This product is very strong. It dried up my skin in one day. I cut the pad it in half so I can use it more. I alternate with witched hazel toner because it&#x27;s not so hard on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for about 4-6 months now and my face has really cleared up.  I used to get small acne and &#x27;bumps&#x27; but haven&#x27;t had those issues since I started using these.  They smell great too!</li>
    <li> Love it. It helps with skin tone, oil control, and break outs. PTR line is awesome. The smell is a little strong.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Sephora and had high hopes. I don&#x27;t use it very often because it really burns (and I don&#x27;t feel I have sensitive skin).  Also, I HATE the smell...but I guess I am a minority, sounds like most people love the smell.  Maybe I should try it consistently for the results but I find myself avoiding it because it hurts to put it on.</li>
    <li> I have pretty good skin, but I still used to get the occasional pimple. These pads keeps my skin clear and now I rarely get any breakouts.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no joke. You can feel it working within a day. This stuff cleaned my pores and removed the top layer of skin slowly and safely. I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re thinking about microdermabrasion but are not ready to take the leap yet.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing I&#x27;ve been using clean &amp;clear with this too...but overall it&#x27;s been amazing use It before bed you&#x27;ll wake up clearer guaranteed after about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these all the time, but whenever I have a breakout I use them on the area for a few days after cleansing at night. They seem to help clear up breakouts faster than they would on their own.</li>
    <li> This is an acne product but the glycolic acid helps clarify my over 60 year old skin!</li>
    <li> I love love love these pads! I have purchased them several times and will continue to do so. They help me with break outs that I have as well as the ever unsightly Bacne! That&#x27;s right, I said it! They smell amazingly wonderful. I&#x27;ve even got my boyfriend in to using them. He loves them too! They do not burn my skin when I use them and i love that they are not overly saturated when I take them out the container. I tried using a different cheaper brand but the pads were so small and thin I ended up using 3 or 4 just to get the same coverage I get with 1 of these. I will stick with these!</li>
    <li> These pads smell like peaches and it makes my face super clean and soft afterwards. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but only because I have a million other toners/facial pads that I like to use.</li>
    <li> I used this once.  I think it smells disgusting but my kid is OK with it and it does seem to help her complexion.  The first jar we ordered was fine. However, the next two (NOT FROM THIS SUPPLIER - the suppliers I used don&#x27;t list the product any more) were moldy!  The first was awful.  The mold was heavy on the lid and the pads were a funky tan/orange color.  The second time (different seller) had a little mold just on the top of the seal; it hadn&#x27;t gotten into the jar itself (the plastic between the contents and the paper was fine).  The problem is not with the shippers but with the original packaging.  BTW - I returned the first one to Amazon without any problem and a credit was issued quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years and it is great. It helps polish my skin and lighten dark spots. I use it every other day, but when I first started using it I used it about twice a week. It tingles until you get used to it. I find I didn&#x27;t need to moisturize when I use it at night.</li>
    <li> I previously wrote in my review about how this product stings SO BAD. and it did, at first, bc my skin was in such BAD condition before that it had tiny scratches, scabs, etc from all the acne before. but after using this product for almost two months now, my skin has healed and the acne has gone away (literally, it&#x27;s gone! I went from having 1-2 large cystic pimples on my chin each week and many clogged congested pores on my nose and cheeks to now nothing). now that my skin isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; anymore, there is no stinging. when I rub the pad on my face it literally does not sting at all.  I did not change anything else about my skin care routine, so I know that THIS product is the reason my skin cleared up.  I will never ever stop re-purchasing and using these. if they stop making them, I&#x27;ll be devastated!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A  MAN AND I HAVE TO  SHAVE AND INSTEAD OF USING AFTER SHAVE I USE THIS PRODUCT AND I REALLY LIKE IT. IT  KEEPS MY SKIN SMOOTH AND RAZOR BUMP FREE AND I&#x27;M ALWAYS ASKED BY WOMEN IF I&#x27;M WEARING MAKEUP BECAUSE MY COMPLEXION IS SO EVEN. AND KNOW I DO NOT WEAR MAKE UP.</li>
    <li> Great product! I noticed a difference after just a couple of treatments. Skin not only looks better but also feels better. Very good value. We continue to try different products made by Peter.  Definitely recommended it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 months. I do like the pads, however did not really think that I needed them with using the anti-aging moisturizer. Just another expense that I decided was not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at a spa during a facial.  The esthetiician said it was great for people who did not want to take the time to exfoliate on a regular basis.  I have been hooked ever since!  This product minimizes poors, keeps break outs away and exfoliates.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I use it once a day.It keeps my  complexion clear  without drying the skin. The smell is pleasant. It is the best in this type of products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> first time user on the product..works great on the skin, clears up the pores.  I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Disgusting. One would think that I live in the gutters with the amount of dirt and grime the pads remove. Would recommend.  By the.  Love the peach scent. Nice touch.</li>
    <li> I loooooooove these pads!!! They changed my life!!! My skin has never looked better. I&#x27;m 30 yrs old with acne prone skin, these pads make my skin glow! I dont have a single pimple on my face not even when that time of the month rolls around. Will never be without it as long as PTR makes them!!!</li>
    <li> It smells like peaches and it cleans like magic. Just make sure you clean your face before applying and you can get away with using 1/2 a pad as there is quite a good amount of solution absorbed in each pad.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for around a month and have seen a difference. It isn&#x27;t drastic but my skin has gotten clearer. The pads work and don&#x27;t dry you out. The price isn&#x27;t bad and they don&#x27;t smell too funky. All good in my book.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy from BEAUTY NEW YORK the product didn&#x27;t come with the manufacture sealing. They put some other generic seal on there that was broken. The product didn&#x27;t even smell like it is supposed to. Who knows what they added to it. I have used these for over a year and they are selling ripoff items. It was sent back. The real ones that you can get from sephora work great!</li>
    <li> These are the only thing we have found that really does the job.  Acne gone. Tried everything else even prescription drugs</li>
    <li> The wrong product was shipped.</li>
    <li> There is some kind of Jedi mind control going on with this product!  I&#x27;ve not noticed any noticeable improvement in my skin, but I love this!  I love the smell, I love how it feels and other people have commented on how nice my skin looks.  I just don&#x27;t see it!  Will definitely re-order, because I&#x27;m such an addict that I can&#x27;t even bear to cut them in half, even though you don&#x27;t need the whole thing for your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love these pads.  They are perfect for my skin.  I usually buy them from Ulta or Sephora but these are $13 cheaper than both those places.  I just order in time to not run out.  They showed up, wrapped and sealed well in perfect condition.  I&#x27;d rather pay .38 a pad vs .60.  Would recommend, had no problems.  And the product is like none other.  ( and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products in my time).</li>
    <li> These are great for acne</li>
    <li> this product makes my &amp;#34; I have to pack this when I travel&amp;#34; list. Good for my skin, love the clean feel before I apply any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love these pads! Great for very oily skin and definitely smell much better than the prescription type. Almost feel that this may be a little secret my dermatologist would not have me know about....?</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m feeling some type of way that this product was opened!!!!  The inside seal was broken and the jar was sticky.  I had such high hopes for these pads. Do not by from &#x27;SIMPLY 4&#x27;.  When I contacted the seller and told them about my issue and request a refund, they had the nerve to tell me they couldn&#x27;t take it back if it was opened!!!!  REALLY?  I just logged off my computer and took a nap! I just couldn&#x27;t!!!  Excuse me AMAZON but you need to start doing background check so some of these sellers that you are &amp;#34;fulfilling&amp;#34; orders for because its making you look bad and got me wasting my hard earn cash on some bs. No wonder why they are only $26.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing! After having our 4th child my skin was all out of sorts and no amount of Dermatologist prescribed medications or ointments made a difference. I&#x27;ve tried it all, differen, retin a, and every new cream on the market- and nothing worked. I tried ACNE,Org, Proactive, nada.  I had given up hope that the tiny bumps beneath the skin would go away and as a last ditched effort I purchased these on May 10th.&lt;br /&gt;Since then my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since my mid twenties! As other reviewers state I cut these in 2 and 1/2 half is perfect enough to use in the morning while I use the other half in the evening before I go to bed.  Since I&#x27;ve used retin a before I knew my skin would  tolerate this product well.  I am surprised at how well my skin reacted to it.  Within a few days my skin was clearer, brighter and more even.  There is a strong Bellini smell to it, but it goes away after it settles and I honestly don&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I went from full coverage MAC foundation to Bare Minerals new serum foundation or Physicians Formula Spotless foundation which are both light coverage foundations. I need a spot of concealer for my old scars, but no more full coverage for this mama!&lt;br /&gt;My scars are slowly fading- i believe with continued use they&#x27;ll be gone in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I use the  Salicylic acid face wash at the end of my day after using Cetephil&#x27;s makeup remover wipes to remove all traces of makeup. 3 times a week I wash with my clarisonic Mia for a deeper cleaning.. and I use these wipes 2x a day.  Again- give it a try- this has really helped to even out my skin tone, clear up my complexion and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it.  If i do get a pimple- its usually because of TTOTM, but they go away within 24 hrs and don&#x27;t leave a scar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t been getting the unexpected pimples anymore and my dark spots seem to be faded slowly!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been fighting mild to moderate acne since my teens. I&#x27;m almost 25, and still never have a perfectly clear face, especially during my lady times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this still is incredible! After using it in the morning and at night for just 2-3 days, my face was feeling smoother, pores were smaller, and my breakouts are healing up and looking awesome. I&#x27;m very excited right now! I also cut the pads in half, half a circle is more than enough product to get your whole face generously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have troublesome combination skin, this stuff is worth the cost, because it&#x27;s a fantastic product that doesn&#x27;t irritate or over-dry your skin. (Which is my usual issue with acne treatments containing alcohol)&lt;br /&gt;It does have kind of a weird smell, like they tried to cover the alcohol with a peach bellini smell... I appreciate the effort; but personally, this stuff could smell like a wet dog and I&#x27;d still use it. It&#x27;s working THAT well.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but barevanity sends it to you opened and tampered!!!! Beware I am contacting my cousin at the BBB as well as Health Consumer Products. If I don&#x27;t get a credit barevanity WILL be out of business and I and my family will make it our mission. I don&#x27;t care if I have to spend 2 grand on my attorney to get them out of business so they don&#x27;t scam others that money is tight for.</li>
    <li> I started using this HG (Holy Grail) product back in May.  My normally hormonal skin hasn&#x27;t look this good since pre puberty.  I am no a in my early 30&#x27;s and this is a staple in my skin care routine.  As others have stated, I cut them in half and use one half in the morning and the other half at night after washing my face.  This is a godsend.  If I feel a pesky pimple coming I literally just use these amazing pads and it never grows or gets any larger than what they used to get before I used them.  There is a peach bellini smell to it, but it isn&#x27;t so strong that you can&#x27;t use it.  I ran out about a week ago and thought I could wait to order them- let me tell you what a big mistake that was.  A monster showed up out of nowhere on my chin the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  No other remedy helped to shrink it and it kept getting larger.  I ordered this item on Tuesday to be delivered to an Amazon locker in Seattle. It was there the next day and as soon as I used them, it felt as if my skin was telling me &amp;quot;where have you been?&amp;quot;  I will never be without this product.  No dermatologist medication, cleanser or treatment has cleared my skin as much as this product has.</li>
    <li> Seems like the same quality as a $4 Clearasil pads.  The ingredients are about the same.&lt;br /&gt;My rating is based on what I view the value of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year and a half and it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;m about to turn 31 and my acne came with me into my adulthood. Nothing worked. This is the only thing that ever cleared my skin up, didn&#x27;t dry it out, and kept my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;However - don&#x27;t buy from yolo beauty products on here - because I got an opened container and I don&#x27;t know what was in there. I contacted Amazon - heard nothing. Contacted Yolo, got some shady response that it&#x27;s brand new.&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy these on Amazon anymore</li>
    <li> I love this product, always have and I was happy to see that the price is lower here on amazon rather than at sephore where it is more pricey. The item shipped on time and everything but it had clearly already been opened. Everything was inside and it seemed to look like someone tried to cover up that they had already opened it. Whatever the product is the same so I just peeled off the first two pads and used the rest! They hadn&#x27;t been used or anything, you would definately be able to tell. Great product! Fast shipping just sad that it was already opened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big toner fan because I never saw a difference.  These pads are the only toner where I actually can tell the difference--they really work!  I have oily acne-prone skin and the best part of these is that one side of the pads is textured, which I used to really scrub my face.  It feels similar to micro-dermabrasion.</li>
    <li> Great product!! No more hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> Been using PTR products off and on for years and I&#x27;m usually satisfied with them. This product is no exception. 10% glycolic acid and 2% salicylic acid do a good job exfoliating and conditioning skin.</li>
    <li> These pads seem to work well, but I simply cannot bear the smell.  It&#x27;s not like it an offensive odor that you can deal with (make a face and get on with it) - it&#x27;s just the kind that makes you gag and cough. I think they were aiming for some fruity, refreshing, citrus fragrance, but for me it&#x27;s a total disaster.  I actually have to walk quickly around the house as I apply them to move way from the smell.  Obviously not for me, but maybe it&#x27;s my chemistry.  However, I love the ones from the Somme Institute.</li>
    <li> The Peter THomas Roth Max compexion correction pads are a perfect product for people of any age group that suffer from small break outs to more severe acne. It stings a bit on the skin, but keeps blemishes under control and clears them in no time. Ideal for home and travel as long as the lid is kept tightly secured so that the pads cannot dry up. I give this product several thumbs up! Also, I found that purchasing this product through Amazon was cheaper than from other sources.</li>
    <li> This clearly looked opened... And not just once but like it had been sitting on someone&#x27;s shelf for years and they just doused the wipes in some sort of disgusting smelling liquid and tried to resell them as if it were new. This is disgusting. I can&#x27;t believe I spent my money on this. I guess I&#x27;ll just go and buy them brand new from the store. I thought Amazon was better than this... This seems like something you would get on Craigslist.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Completely cleared up my skin.  Cannot live without!</li>
    <li> If I could give a zero, I would.  Product arrived later then exspected, leaking and the safety seal was taken off.  This makes the product unusable to me.  Garbage!  Then when I went on to return the product it said no returns.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great seller.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like the Peachy smell. It also leave a residue on the skin so not as pleased with this as I am with other PTR products.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I was looking for a replacement for a similar version of this product that is 3x as expensive and has a quarter quantity wise of what this one does. Although the Peter Thomas Roth brand does not work as well as the other brand I was using, it&#x27;s still a fairly decent product. The only downside is the smell. I have no idea why the company tried to mask the chemical smell with what they call a peach bellini scent. I have to hold my breath when using as the smell is so overpowering. It only enhances the alcohol and gives it the most off putting fake peach smell.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the smell, I still like the product but think after I&#x27;m done will go back to the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> it works very well for exfoliating and cleaning any make up residue left over. unfortunately.... it will burn and sting while minimizing the pores{dosent wornk that well in that aspect} on the bright side it leaves my face soo soft. i just use a light moisturizer to calm the buring  very good product would definately recomend it for acne and combination oily skin sufferers</li>
    <li> Great product, refreshing with strength without drying. My husband loves them. I use in combo with Murad acne system. I look younger and my skin has a healthy glow. My breakouts are fewer. My husbands skin is very oily, that&#x27;s why I got the max strength pads there is a gentler version. Strong aroma but leaves a food smelling peach scent fun to kiss;)</li>
    <li> You know the magazine articles where they list the top 10 items that some celebrity can&#x27;t live without? Well, this would definitely be on my list. I&#x27;ve been using them for several years. I have combination skin, very dry and flaky in spots and very oily in others. This is the only product I use and it keeps my skin perfectly balanced. So easy to use. Wipe face after shower (I use only water on my face) and then wipe entire face with one pad. 60 pads last 2 months. Such a deal!</li>
    <li> Love this product and all Peter Thomas Roth products...</li>
    <li> This product help get my dark spots under control.  Of course, my drinking plenty of water helped a lot too!  Put the soda down!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I saw a difference in a couple of days. My skin feels better and smoother! The smell is a bit unpleasant and strong but I just wipe around my face before moving to my nose so that the smell won&#x27;t be as strong and aggravate my nose and eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and I love it.  I recently ordered from Glowing Beauty Supply and received an opened package with a moldy brown lid, and a product that didn’t smell peachy as these pads usually do.  Returned and plan to order from Sephora so I know I’m not getting a product that may have been tampered with .</li>
    <li> Does what it claims, smell is medicinal , not plesant, skin glowsafter treatment, smooths and tightens, however you must close this jar tightly or the product will dry out quickly.</li>
    <li> Love these! They really do help my skin when I have breakouts and I love the smell. Peach bellini, who wouldn&#x27;t love that?</li>
    <li> Loyal customer. 2nd time buying this product. Smells of peaches. Noticed that I do not break out with pimples as much as I used to prior to using. The 2% salicylic acid does its job. I use it for my chest &amp; back as well as my face and see that it also keepa breakouts at bay. Inexpensive for this brand. I appreciate the use that aloe vera, chamomile, with hazel &amp; green tea are ingredients to balance the acidity against the skin. Paraben-free too&lt;br /&gt;Plus the product is Animal Cruelty Free. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Also received a damaged package with brown liquid leaking and odd smell. They&#x27;re obviously selling seconds or product past its exp date.  Once you get past the first few pads sees to be ok.</li>
    <li> These are the only pads I was able to find that have Salicylic and Glycolic Acid in their max over-the-couter concentrations. And let me tell you, these work great! I was previously using Malin + Goetz 10% Glycolic Acid Pads which, while I could tell they were working based on the tingle, weren&#x27;t causing dramatic differences in my skin. These PTR pads have done wonders just in a week! Less hyperpigmentation, smaller poors on my nose, and faster resolution of healing acne. I do want to mention that these have a VERY strong smell. Otherwise, truly great product. I also higly recommend PTR Acne Cleanser. It is THE BEST Salicylic Acid wash there is on the market.</li>
    <li> When I use this product every night I rarely have a blemish. The few that sneak through (usually only if I miss a day or 2) heal quickly and redness fades faster than it used to. I used to use benzoyl peroxide products but grew too sensitive. Salacylic acid alone just doesn&#x27;t seem to touch the problem. But this glycolic acid based pad has come to my rescue. I&#x27;ve tried other brands with the same active ingredient but I always come back to Peter Thomas Roth. I don&#x27;t even bother with other brands to treat my blemish-proned skin anymore. This one is the best!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the blemish buffing beads cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth. I use a small amount on my Olay spin brush and it works beautifully. A little goes a long way so it lasts me for months and months!</li>
    <li> These are great.  Keep them in the shower and use them immediately, do my shower things and use a cleanser on my face.  My skin is much softer and no more of that kind of scratchy feeling on my forehead.  Even my daughter swears by these.  After my face, I rub it on the back on my hands too</li>
    <li> These little pads are miracle workers, I swear. After a couple months of use, they&#x27;ve completely changed my skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile now and absolutely love it! I will continue to buy! Only complaint is that the inner seal had been broken and product did leak, but there was enough left that all the pads were still wet!</li>
    <li> i was told by a Sephora employee that this stuff is magic. it is. it works incredibly fast to clear break outs and leaves skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> J&#x27;adore! These are awesome. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 12. These are uh-mazing!</li>
    <li> Using this for adult acne for years.  Great product and gentle without harsh chemicals or irritation.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I puchased the Thomas Roth Max Complexion Correction Pads from America&#x27;s Beauty Supply (Fulfilled by Amazon). I BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH! The jar was not sealed around the outside of the lid. The inside seal along the top of the jar had a slit along the edge. I believe that the pads have either been replaced with cheap imitations or that the pads have been remoistened with water or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned the same problem with this product when purchased from BareVanity, Yolo and America&#x27;s Beauty Supply (basically all sellers that use the &amp;#34;Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; shipping option). I also noticed the same bad reviews of product tampering reported for the Peter Thomas Roth Un-wrinkle Pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows what could be in these jars? I am certainly not going to put this on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Its help to clear my skin. It does have strong smell. Have not seen a seen a change in the size of my pores.</li>
    <li> i love the peter thomas roth line, and this is no exception. i use them every 2-3 nights (if i used them more than that my chin would totally dry out) and they keep my skin super clean and tight. i&#x27;ve noticed if i go a week or more without using them that the little blemishes start to return, so i&#x27;m pretty diligent about washing my face every night and using these a couple times a week. they do sting a bit - some nights it&#x27;s no big deal and others i&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s more intense and i need to put lotion on right away to help cool things down.</li>
    <li> I thought they were the PTR unwrinkle pads, which is what I thought I was ordering.  The jars are the same, guess I need to read better.</li>
    <li> I ordered these by mistake because they were included on the Amazon list with another product I was ordering.  Instead of paying for return shipping, I kept them.  They do virtually nothing.  In fact, they may had made my face break out, which seldom happens normally.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best complexion correction serums I have ever used for my son. He has tried many more very popular products and none compare to this product in correction overnite and no dryness!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because my face has been looking haggard lately and needed something to tone my skin.  These work great after just two uses!  I noticed a difference in my face already.  The only con to these is the very strong smell! It got near my eyes and they were a bit sensitive to them (my eyes are sensitive to begin with).  It might not bother the average person but I did feel the scent was a bit strong (Although I do like the scent).</li>
    <li> This product was opened when I received it.. That is awful, what reliable company would send an opened product. And I sent an email and no response</li>
    <li> I used Max Complexion Correction Pads today for the first time.  The pads are not for anyone with super sensitive skin as I felt a slight burning sensation (which means it&#x27;s working) as I used them.  I am impressed that my skin immediately felt clearer, cleaner, tighter and smoother.  I anticipate this product will be a staple for me.  I plan to use it 2x/day for a month to determine the effectiveness.  I removed one star because of the price.  Kinda expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I will update you on how well it works, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> THESE ARE PRICY, BUT ARE VERY USEFUL!</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and still have occasional breakouts.  I purchased the gentle complexion pads and have now added the max complexion to my nightly routine.  At first it is harsher than the gentle so I used them every other night for the first three weeks now my skin is used to them and I am using them nightly.  My complexion has improved, I am not getting as many bumps and have noticed that when I do they heal quicker.  I am using the gentle complexion pads in the morning along with a vitamin C serum.  Its the best my skin has looked in years.  I also bought some for my 23 year old son and have noticed an improvement in his skin as well.  Would recommend after using the gentle pads for a while.</li>
    <li> I love these pads. They keep my skin clear and my complexion even. The only problem is sometimes when I receive my order the seal under the lid is broken. I think it&#x27;s because the acids in the product dissolve the glue that keeps the seal on. Any time I have that problem amazon is always great about the return and sending out a new jar.</li>
    <li> The change has not been what I expected I have used 10% glycolic acid products in the past with better faster results, I will continue to use it but will not be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I love these pads and never let myself run out. These pads make my skin feel so smooth and they don&#x27;t irritate like some others can do. To make them last longer, I&#x27;ll use my regular cotton round and press it on the stack of pads to get some of the liquid and swipe my face with that. I&#x27;ll use the actual pad after I take my makeup off and I substitute the cotton pad when I wake up after washing. It makes it last twice as long if you use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> I had terrible adult acne on my cheeks, both cysts and thousands of tiny little bumps.  After a year of trying different things recommended by my aesthetician, she recommended this.  It was wonderful.  After 2-3 months, those small little bumps began to go away.  Now they mostly gone.  I still get an occasional cyst, but nothing like before.  I have been using this product for a year now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> We love this product, and reorder regularly, as we really try not to run out.  The smell is pleasant enough, and the product is not irritating, and I do have fairly sensitive skin, though I don&#x27;t use it daily.  This is one of our favorite products!!</li>
    <li> These work great on acne but they&#x27;re way too strong. I prefer the gentle version of this product. It really dried my skin out too much.  I won&#x27;t buy this version again.  I&#x27;ll stick to the gentle version.</li>
    <li> Left my face sticky, greasy, burning and flaming red, followed by an acne explosion. POISON.</li>
    <li> My previous comment on this product was incorrectly posted. I chose the wrong item when writing the message.  This product came on time and exactly as described.  I apologize for the negative comment that it was leaking and the seal was broke.  That was for another PTR product I had purchased the same day.  I tried to remove my comment, but was unable.  Again, I&#x27;m sorry for this mistake.  I am completely happy with this product and the service.  Sincerely, Robin Arvin</li>
    <li> I received a defected product. The foil seal had already been opened which caused the product to leak everywhere. Now the pads will dry out extra fast and not be moist enough to make it an effective skin care product...On top of that, it has some weird brown discoloration which I don&#x27;t think is normal...so sad! I thought I was saving $10, but now I&#x27;m out $35 because this is garbage :(</li>
    <li> I like the active ingredients and it works great on cleansing but the scent in the product is way too strong.  Very peach and very smelly.  I wish they made an unscented version.</li>
    <li> This product was opened when I received it.. That is awful,I Don&#x27;t know whether the product was damaged or be replaced!</li>
    <li> Purchased because it was recommended by an esthetician. I had a lot of blackheads and some acne. Saw results in about three weeks. The pads are really saturated so I ended up cutting each pad into twos and using both sides. Still using the product 3 months later. My blackheads have dramatically reduced with this product (and with the help of facials), but I still occasionally break out with acne.</li>
    <li> Good for acne prone skin and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months. It does seem to work as promised. However, since I&#x27;m in my late sixties, I don&#x27;t expect any product to perform miracles. My best hope is that using this product will help me maintain my facial appearance and prevent more and/or deeper wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff but I don&#x27;t know where this particular jar from but it seemed old</li>
    <li> by far one of the best complexion pads i have ever used!</li>
    <li> These were recommended by a dermatologist for day use along with a C/E serum. I use it in the morning after I rinse&lt;br /&gt;my face with warm water.  It makes your skin radiant as well as diminishes fine lines. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> These things are fabulous - I swear by them and recommend them to all my friends. That said - they are strong, maybe even &amp;#34;caustic&amp;#34; would be a good word to describe these pads. I don&#x27;t consider my skin to be &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; but if I did I&#x27;m not sure I would like these so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I use them at night (ever few days) after washing my face with a gentle cleanser and in the morning my skin so SO SMOOTH. They really tighten up your skin, remove any little bumps, even your skin tone and make your skin look bright bc they like slough off dead skin. I am in my late 20s so don&#x27;t have significant wrinkles (just to give you a bit of perspective) but any little thing that I am fixated on is easily gone by the morning with these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these pads bc I was researching Proactiv and trying to figure out what made Proactiv work so well. It turns out it is the combination of salicylic acid and glycolic acid in Proactive that gently clears your skin up over time. This product is one of the rare few that contains both these ingredients and in a pretty high dosage hence the overnight results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One review I read said that they cut the pads in half and use half here and there (since they are both $$ and pack a lot of punch an entire one seems almost unnecessary). If you have sensitive skin you could try that route and also maybe just use on occasion? Honestly if these were a bit less expensive I&#x27;d use them every night.</li>
    <li> I started using these in place of Exuviance daily peels for cost issues. These seem to be doing the same job for my breakouts and they truly do smell like peach bellini. Will continue to use, and the price is very good for the product. Other brands re $60+</li>
    <li> I learn about this product from my aesthetician at my spa-salon. she suggested i try it even though it was not available at the spa at the moment.  So i took her recommendation and ordered it over Sephora. I am in my 30th, have a very oily skin and my clogged pores give me a lot of headache. my cell turnover seems crazy so the skin is never smooth and you can feel it and it&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;So. I am writing this review on the 2nd day of use since I can&#x27;t wait - this product works wonders! I used it yesterday morning and already at night, when i used it again i could not recognize my skin to the touch - it is smooth and soft and the pores diminished.  It has not been this soft for I don&#x27;t remember how long. I used to have a starting blemish on my temple the day before and it&#x27;s gone now. The smell of alcohol is quite strong but it goes away fast. And I don&#x27;t mind it - from a product this powerful and prescription strength you can&#x27;t expect no smell at all or the smell of something nice but useless. I&#x27;m hooked already. And the value is great. I mean for what the product does I&#x27;d be ready to pay twice as much or more.</li>
    <li> smells like straight up alcohol.</li>
</ol>
