      <li>I LOVE this line of body wash and lilies are my favorite flower, so I was really looking forward to this one.  </li>
      <li>On the marketing of the product-it has the bottle shape of the Caress body soap type so it is easily identifiable but I loved the look of the product-the color of the bottle as well as the product name Juicy Escape.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant while using it, but if you are looking for a lasting scent, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lemon or citrus scented body wash that didn&#x27;t smell overly fruity or too sharp. This one hits the mark perfectly. It&#x27;s like a clean, bright citrus smell that makes me feel happy. Can&#x27;t explain why, it just does! I feel clean just smelling it. It&#x27;s not overpowering either.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these Caress washes. This is the only one that I don&#x27;t like. Maybe it will smell better on my skin. Right now, sniffing from the bottle, it reminds me of cat urine. Yeck! What&#x27;s ironic is that I thought that I would like this one the best because I love citrus fragrances. Ho hum.</li>
    <li> Abolutely LOVE it... Will be ordering this always</li>
    <li> A really nice body wash,  cleans well, rinses wll too and leaves a great smell.  Well worth the money! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I personally love body washes, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It has a fresh grapefruit scent that will make you feel very fresh and clean.  I will say that I think that is very comparable to more expensive body washes.  It lathers up well, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely try more of these Caress Body Washes.</li>
    <li> My experience using the Juicy Escape Caress body wash was pretty good.  I found the scent very pleasant.  It had a very natural smell to it which was pleasing to the senses and I definitely got the scent of grapefruit as advertised.  It also felt like it cleaned well and rinsed off quickly.  My issue with this product may just be my personal preference.  I prefer moisturizing body washes that lather greatly and as described moisturize the skin while rinsing off well.  Dial and Tone body washes are my favorite.  The Caress lathers pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t advertise advertise itself as a moisturizing body wash but as a mere body wash.  Acknowledging this I would say the lather it produces is really pretty good and it definitely cleans well.  The strongest selling point for me is the natural smelling scent.  Overall I was impressed and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely scented body wash.  It lathers nice and rinses off well.  The scent on my skin is not too strong and doesn&#x27;t clash with any perfume or scent I might wear during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice big bottle, which is easy to open, and will last for a while.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> This body wash produces a very rich lather and has a nice citrus scent - there are many fake ways of producing the citrus scent, some better than others, but this one is a really nice one. Very satisfied with the product, I am actually looking forward to trying some of the other fragrances they have in this line.</li>
    <li> I Usaully Use dove but around this time of the year i switch too caress because i love dove but when it 93 degress in this california sun i hate the thought of getting in the shower and using dove because its so thick Yea i know im weird lol but anyways this scent is too die for i love love love it so much i will be going back too walmart to stock up on this and the blue one</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be real: this is body wash and it does what all other body washes do: wash your body! LOL  This has a very nice smell and it does not leave your skin dry ... as some can.  You also don&#x27;t need a lot to get a good sudsing (is that spelled right?).  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Is it wrong to love a body wash based solely on its invigorating, citrus-y smell? That&#x27;s the real reason I&#x27;d buy this body wash again. It also cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin - as well as being a brand that&#x27;s a good value for its price - but the grapefruit scent is what really delights me.</li>
    <li> This body wash is nice and thick and it lathers well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin.  The scent is light and pleasant while using it, but if you are looking for a lasting scent, this isn&#x27;t it.  I didn&#x27;t smell anything after I dried off, which is OK by me.</li>
    <li> Somehow this just smells like sunshine (no, I don&#x27;t know what sunshine actually smells like!). The grapefruit is definitely there, but there&#x27;s something else I can&#x27;t place which must be the sun-kissed lily.  I really love the scent even though I don&#x27;t typically like scented products.  The scent dissipates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  And the soap itself is great too with a nice amount of lather and no residue.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be excessively drying for my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really buy citrus-scented anything. It&#x27;s not my favorite smell. This one, however is quite nice. It&#x27;s not overly strong, lathers well and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Caress, and this body wash was everything that I enjoy from them. It smelled great and cleansed well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it seemed to go quickly. Other than that it was a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle and will last awhile, it lathers easily and does tend to leave soft skin.  I really liked the idea of juicy escape smelling body wash - but, for me this one was a little too grapefuity smelling for me.  But, imagine that&#x27;s just a matter of taste.  It is a bright, fresh smell and I&#x27;ve learned maybe I want a little less brightness in the morning.</li>
    <li> I was reading some of the other reviews and was suprised that other reviewers were saying that this product has a bad smell. I think it has a wonderful refreshing smell. Lathered up nice on my washcloth and did not have to use alot to get the job done. On the marketing of the product-it has the bottle shape of the Caress body soap type so it is easily identifiable but I loved the look of the product-the color of the bottle as well as the product name Juicy Escape. It reminds me of a little bit of sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the product-will be buying in the future!</li>
    <li> Love Caress Body Wash and this fragrance did not disappoint either. i use as a bubble bath as well as a body wash. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This smelled nice in the bottle, and was the right price, which were the major reasons why I bought it. It lathers up nicely, but I found that the smell was like a pet shampoo that I used before. Now I feel like I smell like a dog. I won&#x27;t be using this again. I guess if you&#x27;ve never had experience with pet shampoo, you won&#x27;t mind the scent of this wash.</li>
    <li> I was excited about &amp;#34;Juicy Escape&amp;#34; when I ordered it. I love the smells of citrus and prefer it in my home as air freshener. Both my daughter and I really liked the body wash when we first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was clean, not overly lemony but a bright, lovely smell. Then, I noticed that it also smells (and resembles) dishwashing liquid. Now I feel like I could take my pots and pans in and wash them right along with me. Thus far, I have refrained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the smell, while refreshing, doesn&#x27;t linger. I always hope that those fresh smells will follow me throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Nothing is worse than a body wash with a thick cloying scent.  Caress Juicy Escape is the opposite of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caress body wash lathers well, cleans well and smells great.  It has a light, grapefruit citrus scent.  After using, you are left feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a long time now love it will always purchase this products</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful</li>
    <li> This is a lovely smell. The moment I cracked it open and poured a bit on my loofah I knew I was going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells delicious! Unfortunately, I had just finished my Oil of Olay Ultra Moisture body wash and the amount of moisture in this Caress one is nowhere near the level of my Oil of Olay. Which I figured it would be, but there was an instant difference in how my skin felt. Oh wells, this smells way too delicious to not use up!</li>
    <li> Did not care for the scent, dries my skin.</li>
    <li> Great basic household staple delivered directly to your door.</li>
    <li> I was a bit scare about using this product just because I have super sensitive skin and it gest itchy when I use products with fragrance.  I tried this Caress Body Wash, Juicy Escape, and I love it. It did not irritate my skin, it makes me clean and refreshed. I purchased the Caress Body Wash at my local Walmart, and the price was good. I cannot wait to try the other fragrances :)</li>
    <li> Having a number of allergies, I&#x27;m really careful with products that have a scent.  Not only for how it will affect me, but would it affect someone else with the same problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent to be fairly light while washing with it, almost like a diluted lemon (or grapefruit!).  A few minutes after getting out of the shower I could only faintly smell it by holding my arm up to my nose.  A half hour out of the shower I asked the person stuck in a car with me if they could smell it.  He couldn&#x27;t.  So it passes my allergy test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of product provides enough suds for the entire body, so I expect this will last me many months.  It seems to wash off clean, although it&#x27;s not a product that will moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This body wash is okay. The scent is pretty nice and I like it. My problem is that it feels like it&#x27;s any old generic body wash that you could get at the dollar store. It will do the job of cleaning you, but it doesn&#x27;t have the best lather and I&#x27;ve used far better body washes.</li>
    <li> My wife said that she likes it.  She has used many many different liquid soaps and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to get her to explain much more, but I think for her it would come down to price.</li>
    <li> I love this fruity smells. A really perfect body wash, cleans well, rinses easily too.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smells yet...</li>
    <li> It feels silly to me to give body wash five stars, but maybe that says more about me than the body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and the bright yellow color, that I&#x27;ve been using while (not always) patiently awaiting spring. There&#x27;s a hibiscus, I think on the label. It says it&#x27;s &#x27;sun-kissed lily and pink grapefruit essence,&#x27; in tiny type. In bigger type the brand is named &#x27;Juicy Escape.&#x27; To me, that makes no sense. What does &#x27;Juicy Escape&#x27; mean? To me, nothing. Sun- kissed lily might have been a better name. Or golden hibiscus, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this from Amazon Vine in return for fair review.</li>
    <li> This is one body wash that I am completely in love with. By looking at the yellow bottle and its contents you would think it was some sort of lemon scent but it&#x27;s actually grapefruit and smells delicious. It leathers really well and leaves skin feeling cleansed and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this line of body wash and lilies are my favorite flower, so I was really looking forward to this one.  It gets you clean and you don&#x27;t have to use very much, but the smell is a little on the faint side.  I&#x27;d like it a lot better if it had a stronger scent and if you could actually smell the lily.  But, it does smell good and I do love the value.</li>
    <li> Meh it wasnt that juicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just okay, I always want a stronger scent and this one was not that fruity or refreshing. It kinda smelled like dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gel body wash is also tricky, it bloooops out onto your hand and if you arent careful...awww its gone. it also will not stay on skin if you dont lather first. I tried using it to shave my legs and it didnt lather enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my body wash to make me feel clean and smell amazing. This did that but at 20% satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I received this at a discounted price to try and to give it my honest opinion, I love the scent, it was in a tall 18oz bottle.  The body wash is very sudsy, in which I love.  It has a unique smell to me which is different and I just love the scent.  It&#x27; a must get.</li>
    <li> smells great! leaves body feeling nice and silky!</li>
    <li> This Caress Juicy Escape Body Wash is a great fruity scent for summertime. I usually am a bar soap type of person while showering but decided to give this body wash a try since I love grapefruit scented things. The grapefruit scent is quite powerful and it does linger for a bit after you get out of the shower. The description also lists a lily scent however I could not detect it while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash lathers really well when you squirt some into a loofah. It also did not dry out my skin after using it like some other products do. The scent is great for both men and women in my opinion. If you want a fruit, summery scent to use this summer, I&#x27;d highly recommend this body wash from Caress.</li>
    <li> I love the sunny appearance of this product. It&#x27;s a bright cheerful yellow and the word &#x27;juicy&#x27; really evokes an internal smile.  And it amused me that my young teen daughter had the same reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as lather and suds this Caress Body Wash is typical. Nice lather that cleans but doesn&#x27;t leave you totally stripped of body oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our bottle didn&#x27;t have much scent and that was a real disappointment. Not &#x27;juicy&#x27;. Not much of anything, inside or outside of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So RECOMMEND if you like Caress. They make a nice body wash. Just don&#x27;t expect the scent to add to the experience.</li>
    <li> Caress normally has some very good smelling body wash.  I have tried several of their fragrances.  To be honest I do not care too much for their new line.  This one isn&#x27;t an exception.  Product says it smell like sun-kissed lily and pink grapefruit essence.  Pink grapefruit?  It yellow and does not smell like grapefruit at all.  It does lather very nicely and rinses off well.  I just personally would not rate this as one of their best fragrances.</li>
    <li> Juicy Escape is supposed to be &amp;#34;Sun-kissed lily and pink grapefruit essence&amp;#34; scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, They got the sun-kissed lily right. Pink Grapefruit, not so much. I can barely smell the pink grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it does a great job. its lathers well, smells nice, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s too floral smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could give this a full 5 stars if I was able to smell the pink grapefruit more.</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  I think the scent needs to be stronger.  It lathers well, and a little goes a long way.  The packaging looks dated.  A more modern look would make this stand out.</li>
    <li> When it comes to scented body washes I fell into the snobby trap of the well known mall store with it&#x27;s constant discontinuing and announcing. I love switching my scents up and have commitment issues with it. Which means their price point makes it a pain to stay reasonable. So when the chance to try Caress&#x27; new Juicy Escape I figured why not... I love scented body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delight the only thing I wound up not liking about it is that it lacks hydrating ingredients. This is like pouring sunshine into your palm and washing with it. It literally sparkles with tiny bits of mica which for some stupid reason always makes me smile. The fragrance itself is like fresh pink grapefruit and I though I never can quite pick out the lily it&#x27;s sweet smelling and quite invigorating. I would highly recommend this for morning showerers looking for a pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Caress might not quite cure my addiction to pricier mall shop brand body washes I might just start buying more drug store ones from them anyway. I was pretty pleased and think it&#x27;s a nice change of pace from the poor quality drug store brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a mild floral fragrance that doesn&#x27;t leave much if any scent behind to clash with whatever other scent you&#x27;re going to wear. It cleans well, even after the gym, and leaves my skin soft. Contoured bottle is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing after a long day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body wash. It makes lots of lather, cleans well, smells great &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue in my shower. I always get the bright yellow one!</li>
    <li> smells great, is just a bit drying in the winters</li>
    <li> I love how clean this gets me. It also smells incredible on top of that.</li>
