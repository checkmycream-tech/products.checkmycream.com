    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for years. I have very coarse hair, and it is the only shaving cream I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It seems to help soften my skin and hairs, which is also helps avoid irritation.</li>
    <li> I love this shave gel. Best one so far. leaves my face silky smooth.  I would recommend this shave gel.</li>
    <li> I have always had extremely sensitive skin. When I shave my skin can even bleed. Aveeno makes a great product. I like all of their products.</li>
    <li> This gel is the followup to the Aveeno Therapeutic Shaving Gel product that has made Aveeno famous.  It has a better smell than the prior product and it leaves your skin with a smoother feeling.  However, the product advertises that it somehow helps you shave less and the product does not deliver on that promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many products on the market like moisturizers advertise that their products make your hair grow in slower, etc... and that is not true.  Like this product, they just moisturize the hair follicle and make them feel softer.  I find that this does not change the appearance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is just as good as the original and has a great smell.  I suggest it for people who have ingrown hair problems created by multiblade razors.</li>
    <li> This lathers up really well and sticks to my leg until I shave.  It isn&#x27;t so foamy that you have to rinse the razor every other second, but it is just enough to make my shave nice and smooth.  I can&#x27;t say it helps you reduce hair growth, but I think it does the job as shave cream.  It also smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Works so well. Can doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> I love this shave gel! When I first started using it I was a bit skeptical about it&#x27;s claim of reducing the speed of hair growth, but it totally does! It is the perfect consistancy with an amazing sent! WARNING: The gel is under very high pressure. That and the fact that a little goes a long way makes it very easy to over use. However after using it for a couple weeks it is now much easier to get the right amount. It also leaves your skin slightly moisturized, which was a plus. For sure my gel of choice</li>
    <li> Love this product, sometimes hard to find in local stores.  Do feel with longer term use it reduces amount of hair (need to shave), as stated on can.  Wish it didn&#x27;t have parabens in it though.</li>
    <li> It works very well as a shaving cream. It is very soothing against the skin, completely protects against nicks and razor burn. I bought it to see if it really would reduce hair growth. I have no proof that it is working but I want to believe that it works.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I live in Mexico half the year and cry when I run out of this product as men&#x27;s shaving cream is not the same and all the Aveeno line is great.</li>
    <li> I love this it works very great on my skin and my legs feels great just a little bit goes a long way and it smells so wonderful</li>
    <li> not nearly as smooth as &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; type gels. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> In 2012 they discontinued Aveeno shave cream for &amp;#34;design flaws&amp;#34; they said. I went and bought as much as I could. A year later Aveeno came back on the shelves 2 OUNCES LIGHTER!!! It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces. You cannot find any evidence of this on the internet. Evidently they have made a clean getaway. I now buy Target generic. I will never buy Aveeno again.</li>
    <li> Does help, I don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling shaving cream of all time. AND, I barely shave now. I will never change my shaving cream. Obsessed</li>
    <li> This shaving cream seems great so far. This in combination with shea moisture olive body butter, has zapped my razor bumps. Hopefully it is long term. I also notice slowed growth on my legs, but no difference in other regions. Only downside is it contains parabens.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream on the market.  no bumps on my skin after!</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical. a friend told me this gel did wonders but I always thought all shaving creams are the same. How wrong I was. After using it I no longer feel that burning sensation after shaving. It feels so good you can&#x27;t believe it. shaving is pleasurable again. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, and while the difference is slight is smells nice and keeps my legs soft.</li>
