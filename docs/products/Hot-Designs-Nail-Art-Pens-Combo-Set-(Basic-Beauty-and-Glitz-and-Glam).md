    <li> It was a great product,  but it was to expensive</li>
    <li> Love these, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Pros: you get 12 nail polish colors with both brush and pen applicators.  Cons: #1: In most colors, paint is way too thick.  Even after shaking for an eternity, most colors came out goopy or stringy.  This led to uneven coverage, and ultimately led to way too much polish on the nails.  This led to long drying times, many accidental marks even after they dried, and chips almost immediately in the thickest parts.  #2: The pen applicator is very fragile, and will get pushed up into the tip, never to be seen again.  #3: Paint coming out of the tip is full of air bubbles from the shaking.  The air bubbles make it almost impossible to create the designs as mentioned.  #4: Don&#x27;t even THINK about correcting mistakes.  Polish on top of polish, when wiped away, takes both coats with it.  We are returning this product.  It is not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used the white green red orange purple and blue pens for my Christmas design. I have gotten 50+ comments on them. They ask where did u get them at I tell them I did them. Brought the combo pack for several friends for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for anyone who enjoys nail designs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really works! My daughter tried it out on me and my nails have never looked better! My daughter couldn&#x27;t make my nails look awesome without hot designs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people that aren&#x27;t good with nails could use this</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this product. She painted her nails and it looks great. She gives it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received these in exchange for writing a review, I was not paid or told what to say. This set kept my daughter busy for over an hour on a stuck at home snow day. The nail polish goes on easy. You have to wait awhile for the base polish to dry before you apply the designs. the colors are vibrant and she had a ball with them. Its really more like a craft then just a polish kit. She even did mine. Fun!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter  who wanted this for her birthday! I sent it home with her mother so they could share in this fun adventure together.</li>
    <li> These were very thick and didn&#x27;t dry very well.  Even after they had &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; all the way, they would get dints and marks in them if they barely touched anything!  I tried them the day after they were delivered.  They were also difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  I have pink toenails with silver dots</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter on her 12th birthday and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Most of the colors don&#x27;t work. Goes on messy! Though my daughter did use them, so I gave it two stars. Not really worth the money.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> granddaughter was very happy loved it</li>
    <li> grandaughter {13 year old] loves this gift. She is having fun changing the color every few days. she even does her sisters nails.</li>
