      <li>very happy thank you &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them!</li>
      <li>Then I have to touch up the under eye area, which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
      <li>I bought these because I thought they would be a nice alternative to holding a tissue under my eye when applying eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>but once you finish and you take it off it feels like im ripping my own skin off..</li>
      <li>Also making a perfect cateye liner is so much easier because of these.</li>
      <li>They work great and clean up is a breeze.</li>
      <li>I love them...</li>
      <li>It is better than not using anything and getting eyeshadow dust under your eyes...</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find out that Amazon had these for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>Love them, makes the final look incredible</li>
      <li>Cheaper and more accessible.  </li>
      <li>these shields are easy to apply but cause skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>the glue is way too strong for the eye area..</li>
      <li>It sticks on your eyes so strongly.</li>
      <li>The adhesive IS too strong, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>These are great for applying eye makeup on yourself or I use them for bridal parties when I&#x27;m doing a larger number of bridal party makeup.</li>
      <li>the adhesive used is not skin friendly</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t pick up all the eyeshadow, you still have to clean under the eye and re-apply the concealer.</li>
      <li>other than that its good :)</li>
      <li>I am a special occasion makeup artist, and I don&#x27;t know what I didn&#x27;t purchase these sooner.</li>
      <li>I only recieve one pack, but is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s an description error.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>All in all, not a bad purchase</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to get consistent eyeshadow on both eyes.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it promises!</li>
      <li>However, the curve that goes under the eye isn&#x27;t the shape of my eye, so when I apply shadow powder to my lower lid, the shape of the outline isn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>The only problem with these shields is that the glue is very strong.</li>
      <li>These guys are a life saver, I usually just use one per person and does the job, great guide for doing eyeliner as well.</li>
      <li>Love the shadow shields, if you have sensitive skin, try powdering under the eyes before applying the shadowshields so the adhesive doesn&#x27;t pull as much.</li>
      <li>i suggest u stick it to ur hands first twice and then stick it under your eyes..</li>
      <li>The only suggestion is to be careful laying the shields near the outer corner eye if you&#x27;re using it for purposes of a perfect winged liner.</li>
      <li>The first time I saw the shields I wanted to try them</li>
      <li>The curvature of the shadow shield makes for a better application and overall look of the eye area.</li>
      <li>I thought it a great idea, however; it is super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>You need to be gentle when peeling it off.</li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>I usually pull the top layer off after folding the shield in half for a better fit.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>They work better than the torn toilet paper pieces I was using to shield my upper cheekbones from shadow fallout.</li>
      <li>I normally would use tape to aide in the same fashion that the shields do; clean lines, no messy fallout etc.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t reuse mine because after you peel them off, they&#x27;re kind of icky, so</li>
      <li>It protects your face from all the eye shadow that usually fall off and helps you design your eyes better.</li>
      <li>Love these eye shadow shields, no more fall out all over your face.</li>
      <li>Love them, no more raccoon eyes or sparkle face!</li>
      <li>For daily makeup, I have resorted back to the tissue, but if I&#x27;m going out and want to spend a little more time on my eye makeup, I use these.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said, you can make these last more than one use by removing the adhesive covers over only part of the back.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these because I thought they would be a nice alternative to holding a tissue under my eye when applying eyeshadow. However they do take off some of the under eye makeup/concealer when I remove them. Then I have to touch up the under eye area, which kind of defeats the purpose. It is better than not using anything and getting eyeshadow dust under your eyes...that is almost impossible to remove without smudging and having to redo your under eye concealer completely. For daily makeup, I have resorted back to the tissue, but if I&#x27;m going out and want to spend a little more time on my eye makeup, I use these. As other reviewers have said, you can make these last more than one use by removing the adhesive covers over only part of the back. I can get 3 uses out of one set of these. All in all, not a bad purchase, just wish they wouldn&#x27;t remove the makeup from under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The product works well enough, however the  price is somewhat offensive.  You&#x27;re basically paying $10 for thirty stickers, which is supposed to be 15 applications. A little steep. I noticed people talking about how they reuse them...I don&#x27;t reuse mine because after you peel them off, they&#x27;re kind of icky, so I don&#x27;t know where I would store the stained/sticky thing, nor would I want to use it again the next day.  The adhesive IS too strong, in my opinion. I stick it against the back of my hand a few times before applying it to my face, so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much when I try to remove it from my eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for quite some time. I was so happy to find out that Amazon had these for a reasonable price. I bought 4 packs to share with my sisters. They work very well. It&#x27;s easy to get consistent eyeshadow on both eyes. Also making a perfect cateye liner is so much easier because of these. The only problem with these shields is that the glue is very strong. It sticks on your eyes so strongly. You need to be gentle when peeling it off.</li>
    <li> These are great for applying eye makeup on yourself or I use them for bridal parties when I&#x27;m doing a larger number of bridal party makeup. They stay in place and are error proof if they are placed properly.</li>
    <li> OMG! Love these eye shadow shields, no more fall out all over your face. Get them ladies.</li>
    <li> Love the shadow shields, if you have sensitive skin, try powdering under the eyes before applying the shadowshields so the adhesive doesn&#x27;t pull as much. These guys are a life saver, I usually just use one per person and does the job, great guide for doing eyeliner as well.</li>
    <li> This is a must in every Makeup Artist&#x27;s tool kit. They work great and clean up is a breeze. I would definately recommend these.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on some of my clients, it sticks a lot and took of part of the foundation, I had to retouch the make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it didn&#x27;t pick up all the eyeshadow, you still have to clean under the eye and re-apply the concealer.</li>
    <li> I normally would use tape to aide in the same fashion that the shields do; clean lines, no messy fallout etc.  The first time I saw the shields I wanted to try them and I&#x27;m happy I did.  I usually pull the top layer off after folding the shield in half for a better fit.  The only suggestion is to be careful laying the shields near the outer corner eye if you&#x27;re using it for purposes of a perfect winged liner.</li>
    <li> Great product I wish I would have invented this I love them...no shadow smudges or mess. ..&amp; help create a perfect liner line as well .....wonderful I&#x27;m glad I found them!</li>
    <li> Over priced.  Use a post it instead. Cheaper and more accessible.  I think you may be able to get the same affect using a weaker type of bandage tape which is a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> these shields are easy to apply but cause skin irritation.  the adhesive used is not skin friendly</li>
    <li> very happy thank you &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I only recieve one pack, but is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s an description error.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;Im gonna buy it again.</li>
    <li> I thought it a great idea, however; it is super uncomfortable. I rather use my current regime. Not worth buying.</li>
    <li> Love them, makes the final look incredible</li>
    <li> I reuse these for about 5 makeup applications, not using the adhesive backing, just holding them in place. They work great. However, the curve that goes under the eye isn&#x27;t the shape of my eye, so when I apply shadow powder to my lower lid, the shape of the outline isn&#x27;t right. I know they will never make these for rounded eyes, flat eyes, etc, so I guess you just have to deal with it. They work better than the torn toilet paper pieces I was using to shield my upper cheekbones from shadow fallout. I will continue to use them and recommend them.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it promises! It protects your face from all the eye shadow that usually fall off and helps you design your eyes better.</li>
    <li> These shields are awesome.  It does what it said it does. No racoon eyes... Doesnt harm the skin nor mess up the foundation.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Can apply my eyeshadow without any fallout on my eyes and it helps when I am going for the cat eye look with my eyeliner.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a special occasion makeup artist, and I don&#x27;t know what I didn&#x27;t purchase these sooner. I had been using tissues to keep eye shadow dust from falling onto my clients&#x27; faces. The curvature of the shadow shield makes for a better application and overall look of the eye area. They stay in place well, and do not remove any foundation or underlying makeup when removed.</li>
    <li> Love them, no more raccoon eyes or sparkle face! Can even get 2-3 uses out of them sometimes. A MUST have for smokey eye applications. LOVE!LOVE!LOVE!</li>
    <li> it does get the job done.. but once you finish and you take it off it feels like im ripping my own skin off.. the glue is way too strong for the eye area.. i suggest u stick it to ur hands first twice and then stick it under your eyes.. other than that its good :)</li>
    <li> The box in the photo is different to what I received. The quality is also poor.</li>
