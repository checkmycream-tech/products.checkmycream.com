      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better and quicker than sitting in the sun or a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>but i dont love it.</li>
      <li>All in all it&#x27;s a wonderful product as long as you take the time to apply it correctly.</li>
      <li>When I first put this spray on it smelled really good</li>
      <li>I tried it on my legs and it was fine for me...</li>
      <li>I had never self tanned before I bought this product, so I was a little sceptical but after using it I have to so say I was really impressed.</li>

      <li>I love this so much!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>

      <li>and it left me with a gorgeous tan😄</li>
      <li>I love this self tanner, it is so easy to apply and the color is so natural looking.</li>
      <li>Gives great dark color.</li>
      <li>I promise you it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I never look unnatural or orange which is important because I live in Florida and people with &amp;#34;real tan&amp;#34; are everywhere.</li>
      <li>(oh and don&#x27;t forget to really really REALLY exfoliate your skin first!</li>
      <li>at first when I applied the product to my skin</li>
      <li>When first applied it smells like tanning oil (coconuts).  </li>
      <li>To apply it, I spray it on the brush first then \\&quot;paint\\&quot; my body.</li>
      <li>the application was more difficult using the paintbrush than other methods that i have used before (fakebake flawless includes the mitt).</li>
      <li>(Check her out btw, very informative)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really not!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I recommend packing on the product if your wanting a real tan.</li>
      <li>It really helped blend it in and avoid streaking.  </li>
      <li>I find that the color is most developed on the 2nd day.</li>
      <li>, it applies super easy, dries very very quickly, and fades slowly with no weird lines or obvious fading.</li>
      <li>i will be sticking with my tried and true xen-tan deep bronze luxe premium sunless tan.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I hardly noticed a tan, looked more like</li>
      <li>It gives you a natural glowing tan!</li>
      <li>The color is sooo natural, not ORANGE!</li>
      <li>I get compliments about my tan all the time from different people including my friends, mother in law, strangers, and even my very not so observant husband!</li>
      <li>The two best ones out of 7 i tried were Fake bake, and St Tropez the white bottle regular!</li>
      <li>I get compliments on my skin and glow constantly and consistently.</li>
      <li>I have the original and the extreme.</li>
      <li>even when using the applicator, it makes a huge mess.  </li>
      <li>This is my new secret for an amazing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is darker with the spray and since it gives you an instant bronze it&#x27;s so much easier to apply evenly.</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s on your body it stays there until your skin naturally exfoliates.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very dissatisfied with this product and will not be repurchasing or even using the rest of the bottle I bought.</li>
      <li>I find that this application is easier than spraying directly on the body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times so far</li>
      <li>Super dark.</li>
      <li>I will just stick to my old self tanner because it it overall a better product and a lot less costly!!</li>
      <li>but a few hours later it got this really overwhelming gross smell.</li>
      <li>the actual color itself was very natural looking and not orange, which is why i am giving this 2 stars.</li>
      <li>One application last me about a week to 10 days, which is crazy and amazing!</li>
      <li>but it barely made a difference.</li>
      <li>found it was super hard to get to blend in, and it dried too quickly which is somewhat a plus</li>
      <li>I buy a bottle about once every 4 or 5 months because the large 8oz bottle will last me that long!!!</li>

<li> I was surprised that the color wasn&#x27;t even as dark as the fakebake brand</li>
<li> The tan didn&#x27;t last long and had to reapply.</li>
<li> The color did not last long at all!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll usually do two coats of the extreme then one of the original a few days later to keep the color.</li>
<li> I was pleased to see that the streaky dirty look was gone</li>
<li> As long as you take care of it as it says</li>
<li> Also, when spraying directly on the brush, it prevents the product from landing on the floor and having it go to waste.</li>
<li> Some people have been saying it&#x27;s streaky but as long as you blend it well with the brush</li>
<li> I recently just bought the million dollar tan in tan icon extreme.</li>
<li> I would need to do multiple applications to achieve a dark tan.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first time I used it I hardly noticed a tan, looked more like a tiny sun kissed glow. I recommend packing on the product if your wanting a real tan.</li>
    <li> When I first put this spray on it smelled really good but a few hours later it got this really overwhelming gross smell. I ended up washing it off before the full time because I couldnt stand it. As for the color I put quite a bit of this on and I did see it develop a little but it barely made a difference. I would need to do multiple applications to achieve a dark tan. To me the smell is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am constantly on a quest to be as tan as I can be without looking like I&#x27;m a extra from the Jersey Shore. This stuff does the trick! The tan is a wonderful natural color and not at all orange. I have tried both the lotion and the spray from million dollar tan and I think the spray is the best out of the two. The color is darker with the spray and since it gives you an instant bronze it&#x27;s so much easier to apply evenly.Some people have been saying it&#x27;s streaky but as long as you blend it well with the brush it looks fantastic (no one said a spray like this was for tanning beginners! Stick with the lotion if you&#x27;re looking for less of a chore) Also this is one of the only tanners I have used that does not rub off on my clothing or sheets. Once it&#x27;s on your body it stays there until your skin naturally exfoliates. All in all it&#x27;s a wonderful product as long as you take the time to apply it correctly. (oh and don&#x27;t forget to really really REALLY exfoliate your skin first! No self tanner is going to apply evenly on skin that isn&#x27;t exfoliated properly!)</li>
    <li> Super dark. With bronzer so you can see where it is applied. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product. I&#x27;ve seen a number of great reviews on it so I couldnt wait to get my hands on it. I do like the product but i dont love it. The color pay off isnt what i thought it would be. I expected to turn out DARK but that didnt happen. The tan does not last 6 to 12 days as stated on the bottle. I dont know if im doing something wrong but i dont think ill be rebuying this product.</li>
    <li> Good product but still in search of something better. The tan didn&#x27;t last long and had to reapply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched plenty of beauty gurus rave about how wonderful this stuff is.. but it&#x27;s really not!!&lt;br /&gt;I found it was super hard to get to blend in, and it dried too quickly which is somewhat a plus but not when it dries before you can get it rubbed in!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and after i thought i had everything blended, 5 hours later i look like a cheetah with all the streaking i had plus i showered and shaved before i put it on!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a good product AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND !</li>
    <li> I recently just bought the million dollar tan in tan icon extreme. I was really excited to try the product because I&#x27;ve read some good reviews on it. I used to use the fakebake flawless self tanning spray and loved it except for the lasting power of it. I would have to reapply the tanner a few times a week in order to keep the color. This was one of the reasons why I decided to try the million dollar tan spray because it says it lasts between 7-10 days. The color did not last long at all! I was surprised that the color wasn&#x27;t even as dark as the fakebake brand, I thought since I got extreme that it would be really dark but it was not. The color looked blotchy and uneven by the next day! I had also read in reviews that the color fades evenly which I would again have to disagree with. Overall I am very dissatisfied with this product and will not be repurchasing or even using the rest of the bottle I bought. I will just stick to my old self tanner because it it overall a better product and a lot less costly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year now and it exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s better and quicker than sitting in the sun or a tanning bed. I get compliments on my skin and glow constantly and consistently.</li>
    <li> I am a very pale woman, of northern European decent..pale skin and freckles over here! This gives you a very nice glow the next day, but washes off in the shower. I was very sad because people seem to rave over this product, I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it! This is an honest review saying if you need a glow for a night out or something- buy fake bake or banana boat self tanner, it&#x27;s nearly half the price and has the same amount of staying power. Happy tanning.</li>
    <li> first its hard to make it , second bad smell and make u look orang&lt;br /&gt;and if did not shaif ur leg its will look realy bad . .</li>
    <li> Used this on my face all summer and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores. Gave me a nice glow and evened my face tone with the rest of my body. Oh, and I really liked the smell.</li>
    <li> I know everyone says it doesn&#x27;t have that tanning smell, but it does.  However it is EXTREMELY faint.  When first applied it smells like tanning oil (coconuts).  I&#x27;m also impressed with the idea of applying it with the sponge painter.  It really helped blend it in and avoid streaking.  Plus no brown palms!  It lasted about 5 days on my body and maybe 2 on my face due to all the exfoliating washes I use.  All in all I&#x27;ve already been recommending this product to friends.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; I have ever used!! I have been buying it over and over again for 2 years. I buy a bottle about once every 4 or 5 months because the large 8oz bottle will last me that long!!! One application last me about a week to 10 days, which is crazy and amazing! The coverage is builable so if I apply it one day and then the next day the color will be even deeper. I never look unnatural or orange which is important because I live in Florida and people with &amp;#34;real tan&amp;#34; are everywhere. I get compliments about my tan all the time from different people including my friends, mother in law, strangers, and even my very not so observant husband! I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using this tanning spray!!!! Bonus: if you were plastic gloves under your tanning met and then take the gloves off to do the back of your hands you will never get that dreaded &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; hands!!</li>
    <li> It works SO well and lasted me over a month! As long as you take care of it as it says</li>
    <li> Husband tried it a couple of weeks before we left for vacation...was a disaster...splotchy brown spots and orange tint. I tried it on my legs and it was fine for me...didn&#x27;t want to take a chance...will use it again now that we are back from vacation.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve always heard great things about it but had my doubts still. Gives great dark color. If you don&#x27;t want something very dark then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. But I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner, it is so easy to apply and the color is so natural looking. I have tried a ton of self tanners and I think that this one is one of the best!!</li>
    <li> Best self-tanner I have ever used! Does not make me orange, doesn&#x27;t have that after smell that other tanners have.</li>
    <li> I had never self tanned before I bought this product, so I was a little sceptical but after using it I have to so say I was really impressed. It smells good, its not orangy, it applies super easy, dries very very quickly, and fades slowly with no weird lines or obvious fading. Also, I bought extreme and was pretty pale and the tan icon extreme worked really well for me, im absolutley in love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of self tanners, including all of the Faks Bake line, which I loved, but it would start to flake off. I kept hearing wonderful things about this company, and I gave it a try... I love this so much! I have the original and the extreme. Both are amazing! I&#x27;ll usually do two coats of the extreme then one of the original a few days later to keep the color. It fades evenly, which is what I look for in a self tanner. It doesn&#x27;t just come off in patches like others do. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky to me like the Fake Bake, it doesn&#x27;t transfer on my white comforter, like the Fake Bake did. It&#x27;s an amazing color and I&#x27;ll forever keep repurchasing from this company! I have to use tanners that have a color guard, I&#x27;ll miss a spot if I do and it just won&#x27;t look good. This doesn&#x27;t come out orange or green like some do. It&#x27;s an all over wonderful product for every skin tone. Forever my number one!</li>
    <li> After hearing great reviews for this self tanner, I decided to purchase it and THANK GOODNESS I DID!!!! The color is sooo natural, not ORANGE! To apply it, I spray it on the brush first then \\&quot;paint\\&quot; my body. I find that this application is easier than spraying directly on the body. Also, when spraying directly on the brush, it prevents the product from landing on the floor and having it go to waste. I find that the color is most developed on the 2nd day. I apply it before bed, sleep, then rinse off the color guard in the morning. The results are GREAT!! Something else that is amazing about this product is that it fades evenly, not splotchy! I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times so far and I love it more with every use! If you want a nice bronze color, Million Dollar Tan is the way to go!</li>
    <li> i was not impressed with this product. the application was more difficult using the paintbrush than other methods that i have used before (fakebake flawless includes the mitt). also, i was expecting the tan to go on somewhat unevenly because i knew the color guard would wash off in the morning. WRONG! it washed off a bit, but i still ended up streaky. the actual color itself was very natural looking and not orange, which is why i am giving this 2 stars. i will be sticking with my tried and true xen-tan deep bronze luxe premium sunless tan.</li>
    <li> I first saw this being reviewed by one of my favorite YOUTUBE gurus Nicole Guerrero. (Check her out btw, very informative) I was skeptical until my close friend purchased it. I purchased it thereafter, and let me tell you.. BEST investment I&#x27;ve ever made. It gives you a natural glowing tan! No streaks, doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes and looks SO good. It looks like you were on a tropical island for a week. This is my new secret for an amazing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitating.. DON&#x27;T. Just give in. I promise you it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love putting it with my moisturizer and having a nicely tanned face for the day... great product.. get it</li>
    <li> I like the instant color so you can see where the tan is but it is a chore to apply and I would recommend that you use gloves even when using the applicator, it makes a huge mess.  As for the color it makes you look dirty not sure I will use this again.</li>
    <li> So i went on a quest to try all the great tanners from Youtube! This one sucked! It was to orange on my skin! The two best ones out of 7 i tried were Fake bake, and St Tropez the white bottle regular!</li>
    <li> at first when I applied the product to my skin I thought OMG I look so dirty and hoped it would come off but I slept on it and the next morning when I washed it off I was pleased to see that the streaky dirty look was gone and it left me with a gorgeous tan😄&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I didn&#x27;t like the applicator it just seemed to absorb the product so I use a mit and it seems to work better and it&#x27;s easier and faster to apply 😊</li>
    <li> Just got the product but missing the brush it said it came with in the description of the tanning product.</li>
