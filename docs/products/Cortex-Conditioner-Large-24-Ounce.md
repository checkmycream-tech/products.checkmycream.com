      <li>I have thin hair and blow dry every day, I was told to use this to help keep it healthy and I love it.</li>

      <li>I am an African-American with naturally curly hair -- the kinkiest of 4s.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I really like to use this to deep condition after I have done a protein treatment.  </li>
      <li>After the first use my hair was noticeably softer, smoother, and did not look dry.  </li>
      <li>I have really frizzy dry hair from color and chlorine.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it if you have dry, overworked and over processed hair.</li>

<li> Im very picky about hair , have thick  multiracial , afro natural hair ....</li>
<li> i found it in TJ MAXX the other day and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> I would definitely give this a try if you have crazy hair that needs some help :)  </li>
<li> I have very long hair and have struggled for a long time to get it to grow longer, but split/</li>
<li> I agree with all the other posts left about Cortex</li>
<li> If you have dry hair, give this product a shot.  </li>
<li> So I recommend this product if you have frizzies and dry hair.</li>
<li> I like that a small amount goes such a long way.</li>
<li> A little expensive to purchase but well worth the investment!</li>
<li> My hair became rough and coarse, and as a result, stiff and unmanageable.</li>
<li> (I partial dry it in a bun and then let it down</li>
<li> It is hard enough to find already</li>
<li> Not only did this product not work as expected, it actually made my hair worse!</li>
<li> I have thick, coarse, unruly hair and always will, but the shampoo and conditioner have worked miracles on my hair.  </li>
<li> This conditioner will not weigh your hair down at all.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick, coats and repairs; yet it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down.</li>
<li> this stuff is UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
<li> I learned that lesson the hard way.</li>
<li> I bought this about two months ago because I noticed my hair was getting crazy split ends; split ends in the middle of my follicles.</li>
<li> I use it to cowash my thick, curly, kinky, frizz prone hair.</li>
<li> I am so sad to see that the shampoo is no longer being sold and am worried the conditioner may not be too far behind!!!</li>
<li> and I was skeptical.</li>
<li> Wrong!</li>
<li> Not that it was a bad smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I heard so much about this product from my sister that I decided to order it. I tried it immediately and was so impressed that I decided to get another bottle. I guess everyone loved this product that it was sold out on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else on line. Overall, it&#x27;s a product that I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> I bought this about two months ago because I noticed my hair was getting crazy split ends; split ends in the middle of my follicles. I am an African-American with naturally curly hair -- the kinkiest of 4s. I was basically ignoring my hair. I had stopped coloring my hair and thought that I could basically do nothing and it would still grow. My hair did continue to grow, but the split ends were a sign of my neglect. I also stopped wearing as many protective styles. Anyway, I wanted to color my hair again, but knew it wouldn&#x27;t survive without a good regimen. I was in my local Marshall&#x27;s and ran across this product; I read the ingredients and decided to take a chance. I had my hair lightened to a #6 brown with auburn highlights. I have been using this weekly and added a biolage deep conditioning serum treatment every two weeks and my split ends are gone!!! I love this product; it leaves my hair feeling silky soft and detangling is so easy! I use my fingers mostly, but will comb through a bit for good measure. Try this product and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I could rave all day and not praise this product enough!!! I am so sad to see that the shampoo is no longer being sold and am worried the conditioner may not be too far behind!!! It is hard enough to find already so thank you Amazon for selling it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin puffy hair and this product makes it look so healthy and beautiful! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 (I partial dry it in a bun and then let it down and it forms a perfect spiral so if I let it down all the way after it is dry it forms perfect spiral curls.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was loosing a lot of hair in the shower every time I showered and even more when I brushed it - this product strengthened up my hair and 1/20th of the amount falls out when I wash it now. &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in awhile I will leave it in as a leave in conditioner which only strengthens the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This is a must have conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best. I agree with all the other posts left about Cortex and I would like to add I love the shampoo as well. There is nothing that has made my hair so soft and nice looking, even after blow drying it straight. This stuff is amazing!!!! I just wish it was easier to find. I have used redken, biolage among other high end products and nothing has ever worked like cortex. I have even used it on my daughter who is 8 and I can see a difference in her hair when I have used it on her. It just looks healthier and more to life. So I recommend this product if you have frizzies and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Whilst shopping I happened to find this on a sales rack and decided to try it. I am so glad I did. I have been using it for awhile and it just keeps getting better and better. After the first use my hair was noticeably softer, smoother, and did not look dry.  Since then it has been becoming healthier. I no longer have to use leave in conditioners and smoothing serums. I like that a small amount goes such a long way. I am also super impressed with the ingredients list. I will be buying this for all of my sisters and can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair will look like with even more continued use. major thumbs up on this one!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and have struggled for a long time to get it to grow longer, but split/crunchy ends have always been a problem. This conditioner is seriously the best I have tried. It works better than every one of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, and even works better than coconut/grape seed oil treatments. I highly recommend it. The ends of my hair are healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the listed ingredients (especially the avocado) and the reviews. I thought it sounded perfect for my hair. Wrong! Not only did this product not work as expected, it actually made my hair worse! My hair became rough and coarse, and as a result, stiff and unmanageable. I had to redo my hair using another &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; conditioning product. Thank goodness I had some in the house. I will go back to using that product which is much more expensive, but gets the job done well. Sometimes it does not pay to be cheap. I learned that lesson the hard way. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it to cowash my thick, curly, kinky, frizz prone hair. This conditioner is a great moisturizer, and I can see that my hair looks really healthy overall.</li>
    <li> This conditioner by far, is one of the best I have ever used.  My hair is softer, smoother and so much easier to style since I started using it.  My color does not fade using this product and I highly recommend it if you have dry, overworked and over processed hair.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very good conditioner for me. Nor did I like the smell. Not that it was a bad smell. Just not for me</li>
    <li> I found this conditioner at Marshalls and I was skeptical. The pump took me 15 min to get unscrewed so I already had low expectations after that bottle battle. I purchased this because I can pronounce all of the ingredients and it lacks anything ending in &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; as I know to run away from those ingredients. My hair feels healthy and hydrated, I don&#x27;t expect miracles for my split ends but it worked wonders on my winter dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and blow dry every day, I was told to use this to help keep it healthy and I love it. Works for me</li>
    <li> My wife didnt like it. She said it didnt make her hair as shiny as she wanted.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life!  I have thick, coarse, unruly hair and always will, but the shampoo and conditioner have worked miracles on my hair.  This is THE ONLY product I have used that I can actually tell a difference with.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I have noticed a substantial decrease in my split ends.  My hair is much calmer than it has been before. It it just absolutely amazing.  I would definitely give this a try if you have crazy hair that needs some help :)  It has certainly helped my hair!</li>
    <li> Nice slick. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Has worked well for my hair and definitely made it softer.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, can&#x27;t get enough of it. Leaves hair super soft, shiny and manageable. A little expensive to purchase but well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Cortex is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner makes my hair so soft!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s thick, coats and repairs; yet it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down. Freaking amazing!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. I have African American hair</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  Wish I could find it locally.  I have really frizzy dry hair from color and chlorine.  This works the best.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner because it does a great job conditioning  without leaving a film on your hair.  Hair feels great!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great conditioner that gives my hair bounce and volume. My hair feels soft and hydrated. great product!</li>
    <li> Best hair product for curly natural hair on market . Im very picky about hair , have thick  multiracial , afro natural hair ....so product has to be great to manage my thick full head of hair . It does. So good I leave it on and use as leave in conditioner does wonders when Im in a pinch need my hair to look great fast , with out fuss.</li>
    <li> this stuff is UNBELIEVABLE. i have tried probably every product on the market being a hair stylist, and nothing compares. if your hair is bleached/over-processed/damaged beyond repair/dry, this will make it feel like it&#x27;s never been dyed. of course, like any amazing product, it is so hard to find anywhere! i found it in TJ MAXX the other day and was pleasantly surprised. i love this product so much i felt compelled to write a review on amazon! ah!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing conditioner.  You can use it as a 5 minute rinse or deep condition with the product.  I really like to use this to deep condition after I have done a protein treatment.  The honey in this product really draws moisture into the hair.  When I rinse this out, I spray a light leave-in conditioner and after styling, I am left with soft, smooth hair.  This conditioner will not weigh your hair down at all.  If you have dry hair, give this product a shot.  For reference, I have African-American textured 4a/b hair.</li>
