### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
      <li>might as well get shower gloves and make an aspirin scrub to get the best exfoliation.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.</li>
      <li>for the rest of my body my nails still work best.</li>
      <li>I found that it works best for me on you face, but can be used on the rest of your body as well.</li>
      <li>Think it is great!</li>

      <li>so I was happy when I received it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my legs, but I have noticed that the best way to get gunk off my legs is to use water and coat my legs in coconut oil or shea butter.</li>
      <li>It cleans my skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>Also, it works great on my feet, too!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good exfoliator that you don&#x27;t have to replace every month</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>amazing</li>
      <li>The amount of dean skin and grime it gets off your skin is amazing.</li>
      <li>Best after soaking in the tub for ten minutes or so, but it also works great in the shower.</li>
      <li>It is so effective that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it every day -</li>
      <li>I think a good gel scrub would work as well or better.</li>
      <li>Sanitary, handy, and</li>
      <li>Once a week is probably good for most people.  </li>
      <li>I originally got my Le Edge off Groupon on a whim......and what a great whim.</li>
      <li>Great product and arrived quickly</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It works great and does exactly what it claims.</li>
      <li>I scraped very lightly too...</li>
      <li>just the color :)</li>
      <li>It does take off the surface dirt better than a wash cloth or glove scrubber.</li>
      <li>this is okay.</li>
      <li>The directions say to use it in the shower, and that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>I freaking love this thing.</li>
      <li>I love this beauty tool.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get over how much I love this.</li>
      <li>One important thing I&#x27;d like to note...BEWARE!</li>
      <li>Your underlying skin will love it.</li>
      <li>As I did it again and again and with more pressure skin started to come off.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my arms, legs, feet, or torso, but it&#x27;s great for my face, neck, and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>your shower will most certianly get &amp;#34;dirtier&amp;#34; more quickley as you are basically pouring an oilish-dead skin mixture onto it.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s particularly great for my feet -- so much quicker than a foot file or pumice.</li>
      <li>I love Le Edge.</li>
      <li>I even used it on my face lightly and it was amazing.</li>
      <li>i tried too many skin appliances...  </li>
      <li>This works 100 times better than any sea salt or sugar scrub.</li>
      <li>It does it job, works better in nose</li>
      <li>My skin feels better and softer after using it and would recommend it to soften skin.and feel cleaner after a shower.</li>
      <li>I was very close to buying Le Edge based on the great reviews.</li>
      <li>I think it works pretty good on the face, but I wanted it for my body</li>
      <li>(yeah i was surprised he asked for one lol).</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me even though some of the reviews were good.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this for my husband and he loved it so much I had to buy one for me and my brothers!</li>
      <li>If done correctly, you will see your beautiful, clean, clear oil turn to a thicker, darker, muddier...</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and there is no pain.  </li>
      <li>However, I do bruise extremely easily.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>This device is able to remove excess skin and debris more systematically and more quickly and perhaps, more gently.  </li>
      <li>and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>used it in the Morning in the shower right before I shave, and then a very very light scrape after a shave to remove residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face feels so smooth afterward.</li>
      <li>He has eczema and this helps to smooth the skin.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s an incomparable exfoliator.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it with regular bar soap and it works great with that as well.</li>
      <li>To be honest, there isnt much to say about the exfoliator.</li>
      <li>great on back, chest, etc!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This works great, especially if you use baby oil before you get into the shower</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth.</li>
      <li>Although I think the item is bit overpriced (but still the best deal I found was from Le Edge on Amazon), I definitely would recommend the Le Edge Exfoliator for anyone who wants an exfoliator, rather than just a rubbing/soft scrub.  </li>
      <li>it scrapes dirt of better if the skin is prepped right.  </li>
      <li>(I thought it was clean and clear before), and I have a nice healthy and refreshed glow to my skin.</li>
      <li>It does feel nice, just cant quite reach my back very easily.  </li>
      <li>They would exfoliate or use a strigil to slough off dead skin and the oil, then when their skin was perfect, they would go to a cool bath to close pores.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome little tool - the amount of sebum and dead skin that it gets off with every swipe is incredible.  </li>
      <li>maybe even offer a product that would mimic the original strigils?&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> will buy one of these periodically for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have not tried this product. I was very close to buying Le Edge based on the great reviews. But being the skeptic that I am, I decided to read all the reviews and the reviews&#x27; comments. Then I compared the reviews and comments of the blue versus pink color. Well some of the reviews and comments are almost, if not identical, but they were written by different \\&quot;buyers\\&quot;. Let&#x27;s see how long before they edit those reviews/comments after seeing this review.  Amazon really needs to do something about these falsified 5 star reviews made by the product&#x27;s company. Maybe this product really does work for some people but if a company has to go through such lengths to make their product look good, I won&#x27;t be taking that chance. Hope this helps out some potential buyers.</li>
    <li> I am a self confessed product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried everything. I originally got my Le Edge off Groupon on a whim......and what a great whim. My skin is so smooth. It works great and does exactly what it claims. I also travel a lot and this was perfect to take with, small and compact but with a big impact!</li>
    <li> I have three of these now.  I have one in each bath and one in my travel bag.  This is a great exfoliating tool and so easy to use!  I recommend it to anyone who needs to slough off skin in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great little product! I would recommend taking a nice hot bath to get the full benefit of this tool and using a nice hydrating lotion right after for soft supple skin.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d know about these years ago.</li>
    <li> This is actually pretty cool. I use it to scrape the junk out of my nose pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a 6 Months. I use Retin A and use the LeEdge on my face. I&#x27;m not young and have used alot of things under the sun to improve my complexion. This product is great. I use Cetaphil with a wash cloth and then just shave it off, I&#x27;m amazed at the results. probably will it last long.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was initially skeptical...but from my very first time using it I could sure feel the difference in the smoothness and appearance of my skin!  It gently takes off the grease, grime, flakes, etc and leaves the skin looking fresh and young.  Considering I spend hundreds on facials and pedicures, this little baby is a gem of a deal!</li>
    <li> I love Le Edge. I have combination skin on my face which is oily and dry, but I also tend to have really big pores. The first time I used Le Edge I was in the shower, and as I looked on the blade to see what had been scraped off, I was floored. I never wear makeup, and I did it after I had already washed my face. It was so cool and gross to see all the gunk that came off my face. Since then, I noticed that my purse on my face are smaller, and my face feels and looks a lot smoother. I&#x27;ve also used it on my legs, but I have noticed that the best way to get gunk off my legs is to use water and coat my legs in coconut oil or shea butter. It can make the tub a bit messy, but it&#x27;s easily cleaned. Also, it works great on my feet, too! My feet can get a little coarse and dry because I run a lot, and Le Edge takes all of THAT gunk off too. Anyway, hope you enjoy Le Edge as much as I do!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised.  Its one drawback is that it is not long enough to reach all the areas of my back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how clogged my skin could get until I got this - I use it approximately every other day and I have to shave my legs 1/2 as often! great on back, chest, etc!  Think it is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no lady, but this thing works so well at removing dead skin and other debris from my face (and bald head) that I look years younger than I should.</li>
    <li> This does what it says but it isn&#x27;t big enough.  What I&#x27;m really looking for is a strigil (a Roman cleansing tool, strigilis in Latin) and although they used to be available this apparently as close as it comes today.  As I said, it does the exfoliating but it simply isn&#x27;t big enough to use all over, the blade is only about 2.5 inches wide and the overall shape isn&#x27;t conducive to &#x27;wiping&amp;#34; down the arms or legs and it is useless trying to reach the back.  That said, I use it all the time in a sauna and I&#x27;m delighted I got it but I continue my search for something closer to the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if its working.</li>
    <li> My husband had been looking for something like this for awhile.  He has eczema and this helps to smooth the skin.</li>
    <li> Sanitary, handy, and it works. I have a pink one for my feet and a blue one for my body. Best after soaking in the tub for ten minutes or so, but it also works great in the shower.</li>
    <li> EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! I don&#x27;t think alot of people understand how important and simple it is to exfoliate from head to toe. Exfoliation allows skin to breathe, rejuvenate, new cells to emerge, improves blood circulation etc .I&#x27;ve tried the good ole mesh pouf, wash rag, body brush, Moroccan glove (which works well btw paired with Moroccan black soap, for a deep all over scrub &amp; smoothness!) and others.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Caribbean so this environment can leave you a a bit sticky and clammy more than usual so this works great. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I can glide/scrape this baby anytime i am in the shower. After I lather up and rinse off, I use the blade and I scrape the day&#x27;s gunk off. Yup  I do see those dead skin rolls and this climate requires me to lotion up well so that also adds to to the gunk. Now I use it about 2-3 times a week, especially if there has been some tanning under our hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;I even got a 2nd one for my husband to use on his face. It helps get his black/white heads off (yeah i was surprised he asked for one lol). Great buy! Love it! Does the job!</li>
    <li> I love these.  They work like nothing else to exfoliate and brighten the skin.  I wish they made mini ones for the face.</li>
    <li> Works well. Even thought I bought if for myself my girlfriend steals it and uses it routinely as part of her face cleaning regiment.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this thing. I use it every other day, because it makes my showers longer. Seriously, though…it is amazing for sloughing off dead, flaky skin. It works a million times better than any facial scrub or mask I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weird oily skin that flakes in my t-zone &amp; this gets rid of that. My face feels so smooth afterward. It&#x27;s small, a little bigger than a razor, so using it on areas other than the face would take an eternity-&amp; it doesn&#x27;t work so well on other areas besides my face &amp; neck. However, I have found that after I shave my legs, if I run this over them, and do a quick shave after each swipe, my legs are insanely smooth-but, it&#x27;s time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it after washing your face, &amp; wipe it off in between each swipe &amp; you&#x27;ll see just how much gunk you scrape off. Make sure your skin is wet when you&#x27;re doing so. I&#x27;ve been using it since august 2013. I actually look forward to using it too. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite purchases &amp; it&#x27;s cheap too (being the add-on item).</li>
    <li> I love this beauty tool.  I use it on my face and body every day.  It really removes grime and dry skin (that I didn&#x27;t even know I had).  Absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me even though some of the reviews were good.  I think I would save my money and skip this item.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this, but I put a lot of faith in my purchases in other people&#x27;s reviews, and it paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little tool is about the size of the palm of your hand. It has a very durable metal blade, but it&#x27;s not sharp like a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face regularly but for the last fee months noticed that I had black heads on my nose and a greasy forehead. Also a few ingrown hairs on my neck from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 days of using this tool (5x total use over 10days. Every other day) my forehead is not greasy, black heads are gone, and ingrown hairs gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little blade is easy to clean, just run it under the hot water. I definitely recommend you use this in the shower or right after a hot shower. I thought my face was pretty clean... I was wrong. 1 swipe across my forehead and I was disgusted how much gunk came off. I scraped very lightly too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully used the blade for my nose and t section and same thing!!! It was gross how much gunk I pulled off my face, be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with use, if you go too hard you could scrape your self pretty bad. The blade is not sharp but it&#x27;s firm and has a nice edge on it. It will definitely pop Pimples or something if you have them, so be prepared for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the Morning in the shower right before I shave, and then a very very light scrape after a shave to remove residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 days I have gotten compliments and even see it myself: my face looks clean and clear (I thought it was clean and clear before), and I have a nice healthy and refreshed glow to my skin. Hot water an this tool is all I will ever need. Sorry face wash products.... This tool just took my business from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
    <li> This is overpriced.  It is a blunt edged piece of metal attached to a molded plastic handle.  I have used it several times without cutting or scratching myself.  Whether it helps make skin smoother will take a while to determine.  If I find that it works really well I will add a star at a later date.  In the meantime, 3 stars is meant to express the fact that I believe it is overpriced but not junk.</li>
    <li> it does work and i believe the key to it&#x27;s effectiveness is hot water, soap or light oil.  it scrapes dirt of better if the skin is prepped right.  could LeEdge offer different sizes?  maybe even offer a product that would mimic the original strigils?&lt;br /&gt;thanks you&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the kae exfoliating mitt. This was just to time consuming for me. And it didn&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job as the kae mitt. I&#x27;ve used this once and now it just sits in my shower. Guess I should just throw it out because I&#x27;ll never be using it again. For me this just didn&#x27;t work to my liking.</li>
    <li> I was beyond skeptical about this, but it works great! The amount of dean skin and grime it gets off your skin is amazing. I found that it works best for me on you face, but can be used on the rest of your body as well. It really got the oily gunk out of my pores and the proof can be seen on the blade.</li>
    <li> I found it doesn&#x27;t work particularly well when I use it, which is not often because I really don&#x27;t like it. Maybe it works better if you need A LOT of exfoliating, but scraping a dull metal blade against yourself in the shower isn&#x27;t an experience most people are going to enjoy.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this works very well. Just make sure that you use it after steaming your face or showering, that helps loosen all of the dark spots/blackheads.  It is not extra sharp, so there is no danger of cutting yourself. However, if you try really hard I think you can scrape your skin, so go to the point of not feeling any pain from doing it and you will be fine. So I little bit more pressure than when you are shaving, and it will push/pull dirt out of pores really nice.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It works better than my other bone/horn scrapers.  It seems easier to scrape by pulling the blade rather than push as when using horn or bone scrapers.</li>
    <li> Love it! It reduces my Kerotosis Pilaris on my upper arms by 70% in just under a week! Worth the every penny.</li>
    <li> Item just glides across your skin, it does not exfoliate anything at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The results of using this exfoliator are wonderfully disgusting. If you want to see the dead skin (which I do) that is scraped from your body, then this is the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li> I hope I can save someone a few dollars by writing this review. When I got this exfoliator, I followed the directions exactly. The first time I used it I was so excited thinking I would see tons of dead skin on the blade, seeing as I had not been exfoliating prior to this. Well, what I saw on the blade was....nothing, absolutely nothing. I did get some results when I used it on my feet but that was the only area it seemed to do anything.  Complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Simple gadget but does its job!</li>
    <li> Imagine taking an ice scraper and using it on your skin.  That&#x27;s what it feels like and is too time consuming to use.  Will not work for KP.</li>
    <li> Either I&#x27;m using it incorrectly or it was a waste of money. Did not do anything g on my skin.</li>
    <li> I thought maybe, just maybe, this thing might actually work. I have KP and it doesn&#x27;t....not even a little bit. As cheap as it was, still a waste of money.</li>
    <li> To be honest, there isnt much to say about the exfoliator. It cleans the outlying debris and reminds me of how dirty i can be. Lol.</li>
    <li> I purchased because I have the chicken skin disorder of the back of my arms and thighs. I read reviews that said this tool would help with that problem by exfoliating and ridding the top layer of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a poor exfoliator, but it left me with bruises where I had used it. However, I do bruise extremely easily.</li>
    <li> These are offered on another website for 15 dollars. Glad I found this. However, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with product. I think the edge of a credit card would work just as well.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have considered exfoliating my skin. Wow, what an experience this was. At first you would be worried that you miht cut yourself. However, it is very gentle on your both and removes all the dead cells. It is highly recommended that you exfoliate once a week. No more dead cells for me!</li>
    <li> I am pretty amazed at this little product.  I have spent much more on products that do nothing but this gets the job done.  I&#x27;m going to purchase one for all my friends</li>
    <li> Got this as a suggestion for Keratosis pilaris. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really done much at all. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recomend it and one thing I found strange was the blue color was cheaper than the pink. Very odd.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I expected at this price point but it is what it is.  A simple skin scraper.  Looks pretty but frankly you could do the same thing with a putty knife.....(joking)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work just do not expect earth shattering results.</li>
    <li> Aside from how disgusting the little scrapper gets after you&#x27;ve used this, the product works just as well as the reviews and product details suggest.  I&#x27;m a huge fan because I&#x27;ve got a skin condition and after a couple of days it actually seems to be helping to decrease the visibility of the ichthyosis vulgaris.  My skin feels better and, hopefully, after a few more weeks the condition will be even better.</li>
    <li> Does not work - waste of money.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teenage son&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much in the beginning ~ maybe it helped just a little ~  but then it seemed to actually aggravate it. Initially, the KP wasn&#x27;t too terribly noticeable ~ the bumps were visible through certain lighting and actually through feeling them. They weren&#x27;t pink or red. After using the Le Edge for a of couple of weeks, the KP became quite visible ~ red, a bit more bumpy, and really looked irritated. He quite using it, and the KP is back to where it was before. Think twice about this purchase.</li>
    <li> this is okay. It does take off the surface dirt better than a wash cloth or glove scrubber. I use it in the tub after a hot soak.&lt;br /&gt;And here at Amazon you can get it at a very good price 1/3 the cost elsewhere.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this didn&#x27;t work but you just have to get used to it. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this thing. I use it when I take a bath, it is possible after a sauna. My husband did not come. Because of body hair.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating tool worked wonders at removing layer of old dead skin on my ankles and calves after soaking them in the bath.  Very easy to use.  You will be amazed at how much dead skin it removes. Your underlying skin will love it.</li>
    <li> The directions say to use it in the shower, and that&#x27;s OK.  It&#x27;s similar in function to a tool used by the ancient Romans and they sometimes used it with an oil rub.  ( If you use oil, use almond oil.)    My husband took a bath and after a bit I used lotion on his back.  Then I used Le Edge... He had just bathed and a lot of gray sludge was scraped off.  It makes a significant difference. If you use it once a week your skin will feel different.  Try using it on half of your skin and see how you feel over the next day or so.  Feel the difference under your fingertips.  How does your skin feel the next day, and the day after?  Once a week is probably good for most people.  If you use it regularly you will start to notice if you go too long without using it.    I recommend the product.  Get one, and ask your husband to help you with the hard to reach places.      My only gripe is that they need to offer a set:  one with this short handle and another with a long handle like a back scratcher.</li>
    <li> The Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator - Blue is not at all what I expected: no visible/noticable deadskin removal ...</li>
    <li> The Le Edge is AMAZING!!!  I am a 62 year old man and 2 years ago, after getting a new prescription for my reading glasses, I looked at myself in the mirror and did a &amp;#34;Mr. Magoo.&amp;#34;  I just couldn&#x27;t believe what my eyes were seeing.  My entire face, particularly my nose, was covered with plugged pores.  I tried everything and many hundreds of dollars on products and professional facials to help and nothing did as much to exfoliate and help to cleanse these plugged pores as the Le Edge Exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
    <li> I seriously wish I knew about this a long time ago! This works 100 times better than any sea salt or sugar scrub. I really don&#x27;t understand some of the low reviews as this works great. I&#x27;ve been using once a week in combination with Moroccan black soap. I&#x27;ve also used it with regular bar soap and it works great with that as well. You will be amazed at the amount of gunk this scrapes off. It makes you feel like you&#x27;ve been walking around with loads of dead skin forever and you feel so great afterwards.</li>
    <li> not sure if it is actually working</li>
    <li> After a week I can already see and feel the difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers said that this isn&#x27;t sharp enough (like a fingernail) to exfoliate, but they are wrong. This works great, especially if you use baby oil before you get into the shower, then scrape it all off during the shower (as you are supposed to use some sort of oil 15 minutes before exfoliating) - it is based off of a Strigil, which Greeks used instead of towels, actually making them cleaner in the end than using a piece of cloth to smear around skin cells. They would often times sit in a hot bath of water, then dip into oil, and return to a hot bath and soak. They would exfoliate or use a strigil to slough off dead skin and the oil, then when their skin was perfect, they would go to a cool bath to close pores. If you roughly follow this method, your skin will thank you, as dead skin cell build up also causes wrinkles (aside from collagen breakdown and production).</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a strigil, and you&#x27;d like to do the whole &amp;#34;clean yourself using oil&amp;#34; way, this product does the job very well! I haven&#x27;t read the reviews, but if poeple are saying this doesn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re using it correctly. You MUST slather on OIL FIRST...THEN use the &amp;#34;exfoliator&amp;#34;/strigil. If done correctly, you will see your beautiful, clean, clear oil turn to a thicker, darker, muddier...well, full of dirt substance. One important thing I&#x27;d like to note...BEWARE! your shower will most certianly get &amp;#34;dirtier&amp;#34; more quickley as you are basically pouring an oilish-dead skin mixture onto it. (Thing bath tub oil rings). BUT!...the end result is wondorous as you are scraped clean and moisturized at the same time. If you&#x27;re interested enough to have looked this product up, you should for sure try it. Oh...and there&#x27;s no difference between this one and the pink one...just the color :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I used it as directed and haven&#x27;t noticed anything coming up</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that it would help with the dry skin on my legs. I can&#x27;t get it to help on my legs though, it just makes my legs red but I don&#x27;t see the gunk coming off like when I use this on my feet. Instead I continue to use this on my feet when I need a pedicure but can&#x27;t afford to get one. It is scary what comes off on the end!! Takes all the dead skin off. I use at the end of my shower once my skin is softened and it works on my feet so well!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  The only difference I noticed is my legs.  They do not scale as much after use.  It is easy to use and there is no pain.  However, be careful not to use this after shaving as it will sting and shaving also exfoliates.</li>
    <li> Two reasons I bought this. One for my chicken skin (which no steroid has ever treated) and because it&#x27;s summer and my skin is really dry from being outdoors so much. I just needed a refresher for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I just scraped over the surface of my arms lightly. Nothing happened. No skin. No oils. But the. As I did it again and again and with more pressure skin started to come off. I even used it on my face lightly and it was amazing. I had washed my face 2x with a great cleanser and this little baby got tons of &amp;#34;sludge&amp;#34; off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs and arms are smoother and they don&#x27;t itch anymore ...I attribute that to the exfoliation. My ingrown hairs would get horrible and I&#x27;m hoping as I continue to use it, it will help combat that a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would recommend. It&#x27;s a little time consuming so if you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;re whole body, it&#x27;ll take a second. If not a quick once over In the shower and you&#x27;ll be glowing!</li>
    <li> really is like a giant soft finger nail that gets off the dirt. very effective for me when i use it from time to time.  Edit: I just started using a Korean italy towel. Its cheap (got mine off ebay for 2.99) and so much dirt came off and my skin glowed. Its also way easier to use because its a hand towel, and dirt comes off easier. Gonna have to lower my rating on this one since basically falls short in comparison, and the price</li>
    <li> I think it works pretty good on the face, but I wanted it for my body and I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  I like to use it after I do a home pumpkin peel because my skin tends to peel but not flake off; it really helps speed up the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time &amp;#34;scrapper&amp;#34;, and i have fragile weak nails, so when I found this product I was excited, unfortunatly the only part of my body that it actually seems to work on is my feet. for the rest of my body my nails still work best.</li>
    <li> I like this tool.  Usually my lower calves are flaky with dry skin, but using this in the shower eliminates that problem.  It feels good after using it, get blood circulating.  Be gentle with it.</li>
    <li> I started using it immediately after getting it and works very well with other face scrubbing products. am thinking of getting the pink one and see the difference. amazing</li>
    <li> Works some. Not as well as advertised</li>
    <li> It does work, but is still a bit of hassle to drag along the feets. If it came with a slave type person to do the work, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> There is nothing that exfoliates quite like this. My skin gets smoother every day. It&#x27;s particularly great for my feet -- so much quicker than a foot file or pumice. I even like this on my face, it really gets the gunk out of pores. I&#x27;m considering putting these in a few Christmas stockings this year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a 6 Months. I use Retin A and use the LeEdge on my face. I&#x27;m not young and have used alot of things under the sun to improve my complexion. This product is great. I use Cetaphil with a wash cloth and then just shave it off, I&#x27;m amazed at the results. probably will it last long.</li>
    <li> It does it job, works better in nose</li>
    <li> My skin feels better and softer after using it and would recommend it to soften skin.and feel cleaner after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little tool - the amount of sebum and dead skin that it gets off with every swipe is incredible.  It is so effective that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it every day - that top layer of skin is there as a barrier for a reason!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.  For exfoliation, check out Cure Aqua Gel.</li>
    <li> Eh. No discernible results. Didn&#x27;t really exfoliate much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, mold eventually started growing in the little silicone grip crevices. Make sure you store it vertically, and perhaps outside the shower?</li>
    <li> BUYERS BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a product like this and was really excited to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It came and it was smaller than I anticipated, but either way, I really liked the concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the actual usage of this product is alright, the problem arises is how you clean off the dirt that is on the exfoliator. It made sense to me that you just use your finger and gently rub the dirt away, but instead it CUT MY FINGER. It wasn&#x27;t just a shallow cut either, it was a deep enough cut that I needed to get out of the shower and put some Neosporin and a bandaid on it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the BIGGEST FLAW of this product. It&#x27;s sharp enough to break skin and cut your finger, and probably other parts of your body if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
    <li> It was something I needed and not only did they deliver u t to me fast but the product was also at a fair price so I was happy when I received it!</li>
    <li> Great little tool. It&#x27;s so basic that it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be for everyone though. If you don&#x27;t have oily or &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; skin this may be a little overkill and you may not see much from using it. If you have oily gunky skin this will be your new favorite tool. It scrapes it right off with no fussing. It&#x27;s not sharp, so no safety issues. It&#x27;s a good exfoliator that you don&#x27;t have to replace every month and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  Be gentle!</li>
    <li> I thought this would work well but it hasn&#x27;t worked well at all for me.  Doesn&#x27;t get anything off my skin that my shower puff doesn&#x27;t remove. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help exfoliate old skin. I love the way it cleans and makes my skin feel extra smooth. It&#x27;s a great non chemical non abrasive exfoliater.  I use it on my face neck and body.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this thing works.  I did a lot of research before buying this type of exfoliator and even learned that the Romans used something like this in their baths.  When I first used the Le Edge, I was surprised how much gunk came off my face.  I take showers twice a day and just from about 8 hours, the gunk was collecting on the edge every time I ran it across my face and neck.  I could have kept going but was happy with the removal.  Although I moisturize quite heavily in the dry climate that I live it, no soap alone could take this off.  Most of all what surprised me was the color of the gunk it was grey!  All I did is walk outside and sit in an office!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my husband and he loved it so much I had to buy one for me and my brothers!</li>
    <li> I use this to scrape at my keratosis pilaris. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything. Some days in the shower I scrape and scrape and nothing shows up on the blade (blade is very blunt so as not to cut, but just to scrape) and other days I scrape and do get some skin sloughing off. This thing is worth a try but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any major results.</li>
    <li> i like how you can see the skin that it collects when you use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use it to exfoliate my face and it works really well</li>
    <li> i tried too many skin appliances...  this little gem is far better than the $300 i spent on NuBrilliance among others. strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted a water proof back-scratcher for the shower.  The handle is a bit short, shorter than a disposable razor handle.  I don&#x27;t notice much as far as exfoliation.  It does feel nice, just cant quite reach my back very easily.  I&#x27;d give it a 3.5</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. might as well get shower gloves and make an aspirin scrub to get the best exfoliation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only strigil available to buy, so for that alone, it&#x27;s worth buying.  My main issue is that instead of simply coming to an edge, the actual scraping edge is slightly folded over, which means there is a very small area for the dead skin to collect, and it needs to be wiped off-- not rinsed, but actually wiped-- each time you get a decent amount of skin off.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a better exfoliator than anything else I&#x27;ve used, but it certainly is great for drying off quickly, since one swipe leaves a patch of dry skin behind.  It didn&#x27;t take off quite as much skin as I expected, but I&#x27;ll still be using it.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes, having seen it on the Today show.  However, it does not work very well at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how much I love this. It&#x27;s working wonders on my skin; I don&#x27;t think my face and legs have ever been this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took this out of the box I was underwhelmed and already bracing myself for disappointment. Le Edge is rather unassuming, and upon first glance doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll do much. It&#x27;s on the small side (a bit larger than a disposable razor) with a thin edge of stainless steel. As other reviewers have stated, it functions like a large, stainless steel fingernail. It&#x27;s just cleaner, quicker, and more effective at removing dead skin than using your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this right after I shower. You want to apply enough pressure that it&#x27;ll scrape off the dead skin, but not so much that it would be intolerably painful. The edge is dull, though, so you won&#x27;t cut yourself, but your skin will likely turn red for several minutes. I always thought my skin was decent, but it&#x27;s amazing how much junk this removes from my skin. So Le Edge saves me from buying expensive exfoliating scrubs, and leaves my skin feeling wonderfully soft and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> This so-called exfoliator has been much hyped. Unfortunately, I found it as useful a scrapping a butter knife along my skin.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!  I can&#x27;t believe how much gunk it gets off my skin!  I can get a couple of pea-sized balls of dirt and skin off my face and neck by using it every other day.  Definitely only use it in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t work otherwise. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my arms, legs, feet, or torso, but it&#x27;s great for my face, neck, and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it, I would describe it as a cross between an ice scraper, a razor, and a back scratcher.  The blade is thick, but dull enough so that it won&#x27;t cut skin or hair if you get over-zealous.  It really just feels like a gigantic fingernail scratching you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do that much exfoliating.  I think a good gel scrub would work as well or better.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Amazing little tool! Works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I thought I would love this -- periodically, I use my fingernails to shed dead skin layers, and thought it would be just as good or better with a tool like this one, especially considering the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO.  I STILL need to use my nails AFTER I use this.  Can&#x27;t someone invent something with what nails are made up of (keratin?) to do this well?</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my Kerotosis Pilaris over a year ago. The bumps on my arms are slightly smoother, but I really don&#x27;t see a big difference. I mainly use this now before I shave my legs and under my arms, because it helps remove any dead skin I have and gives me a cleaner shave. Overall it was worth $6 considering I use it every time I&#x27;m in the shower to remove dead skin and also before I shave, but I still wish it worked for what I intended to use it for.</li>
    <li> I really like it and I use it on my face everyday. It cleans my skin perfectly. My skin looks much better!</li>
    <li> I use this to exfoliate my face in the shower, it definitely works well for that.  I can use it as often as every other day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Rip-off.</li>
    <li> I mainly use Le Edge for my face, but it works really well on my decollete, shoulders and back.  It feels odd at first because I would use it in the same motion I would use a razor, but when I lift the edge off and take a look at the results...wow...gooey skin cells all over it.  Amazingly, my complexion looks 100x better after only 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Although I think the item is bit overpriced (but still the best deal I found was from Le Edge on Amazon), I definitely would recommend the Le Edge Exfoliator for anyone who wants an exfoliator, rather than just a rubbing/soft scrub.  As noted by other reviewers, it looks and functions similarly to an ice scraper.  It&#x27;s just a bit longer than a hand-held women&#x27;s razor but with a broader handle and a safely dull-flat edge for exfoliation.  This very simple design proves to be extremely effective and efficient at scraping off excess skin, often in small swatches, in a relatively gentle manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely is far superior of an exfoliator compared to the typical body &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; items like loofahs and polyester mesh sponges, as such items still leave large patches of dry, flakey skin in my experience.  I even find this item better than the stiff natural brush (made of palm fibers) that I typically use.  This device is able to remove excess skin and debris more systematically and more quickly and perhaps, more gently.  I have dry, often itchy, scaley skin and use of this exfoliator improved my skin&#x27;s feel and looked significantly and immediatedly.  My skin felt and appeared smoother and brighter (but not irritated) right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only significant flaw I see with this device is that its reach is much too short.  A longer handle would allow for easier reach of the back for those of us who aren&#x27;t contortionists.  Still, it&#x27;s an incomparable exfoliator.</li>
    <li> teeny tiny, takes too long to exfoliate.  Was expecting a much bigger piece.  Should have read more carefully.  Would not recommend.</li>
