      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>but they work great and are a life saver for me!!!</li>
      <li>Best gloves that hold their shape for the money out there!  </li>
      <li>These gloves are incredible.</li>
      <li>Again, they work great</li>
      <li>Great price for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but when I get them on they work great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The materials in the glove is VERY effective at cleaning and exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Much better than a pouf in my opinion and especially great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Good product for what they are.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>A very satified customer!!!!!</li>
      <li>These are nice bath gloves.  </li>
      <li>The gloves fit really good around my hands.</li>
      <li>These are cheap and work just as good.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love these gloves.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>But glad we got them.</li>
      <li>For sure, I would recommend these bathing glove to anyone.</li>
      <li>Did not get any better with time.</li>
      <li>The gloves make sure I apply my exfoliate evenly.  </li>
      <li>A loofah or even terry washcloth works much much better.</li>
      <li>this is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll never get a better wash and your skin feels so refreshed clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and take off while showering.  </li>
      <li>but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>I like these gloves, better then having to hold something, they have stayed on my hands, it&#x27;s much easier applying with gloves then a sponge or luffa..</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t like the super, synthetic, look.</li>
      <li>they will fall apart quick</li>
      <li>I love trying new things, and this item was one of those, but the gloves slip and slide if you press harder to get a good stimulating scrub.</li>
      <li>My body feels so smooth and alive when I am done!  </li>
      <li>Not only did it help keep me clean, it made my skin smooth and even.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;m able to wash them thoroughly enough...</li>
      <li>I do wish they come in more different colors</li>
      <li>Material is durable and fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>but this really gets the dirt off.</li>
      <li>When needed the gloves can be washed in the washer and ready to be used again.  </li>
      <li>Wonderfully effective, not too harsh.</li>
      <li>not really worth the money, the shower scrunchies do the exact same thing if even better most likely would not</li>
      <li>Also, if you are going to use this on your face and you have sensitive skin, be VERY gentle.</li>
      <li>They are gentle, but not too soft either.</li>
      <li>If you ever wanted a great back scratch and the smoothest skin possible then buy a few sets of these gloves.</li>
      <li>a lufa would do the exact same thing without the hassle.</li>
      <li>ordered this for my fiancee whom is in a different country right now he received then in a few days so quicker than expected and says they are good but like all cheap things wont last too long but for only 1cent we cant complain</li>
      <li>These are great if you live in the cold weather like I do.</li>
      <li>The gloves help skin stay soft.  </li>
      <li>but maybe I should have chosen a natural product instead of this plastic glove.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered twice so far.</li>
      <li>they are nice but too thin</li>
      <li>Beats trying to scrub with bare hands or with a luffa.</li>
      <li>Was afraid that buying the cheaper pair that they would not be any good</li>
      <li>My significant other and myself rub each others back every night and if you have trouble sleeping just get your back gently rubbed and off to sleep</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very beneficial for weekly facial scrubs, but using it too rough may irritate your skin.</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste money on the more expensive bath gloves.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, so I would say buy a new pair every 4-6 months.</li>
      <li>Seriously though it does a nice job with out leaving your skin raw.</li>

    <li> DO NOT waste money on the more expensive bath gloves. These are cheap and work just as good. GET EM!!</li>
    <li> I love these gloves.  I use them when I exfoliate my body.  I put them on, add the product I am using and scrub my entire body!  The gloves make sure I apply my exfoliate evenly.  My body feels so smooth and alive when I am done!  When needed the gloves can be washed in the washer and ready to be used again.  They last a long time before they need replacing.</li>
    <li> Great price for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a champ. Beats trying to scrub with bare hands or with a luffa.</li>
    <li> this is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. You&#x27;ll never get a better wash and your skin feels so refreshed clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I like these gloves, better then having to hold something, they have stayed on my hands, it&#x27;s much easier applying with gloves then a sponge or luffa.. It&#x27;s not to scratchy, it&#x27;s the job done, I just rinse the gloves in the shower when I&#x27;m done and wring out the water and lay them flat till the next time I use them. I have used them 5 times, I don&#x27;t see any stretching out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Much better than a pouf in my opinion and especially great for traveling. Not only did it help keep me clean, it made my skin smooth and even. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, so I would say buy a new pair every 4-6 months. My pair stretched a lot by the third month of use, and a hole appeared in one of the gloves.     Also, if you are going to use this on your face and you have sensitive skin, be VERY gentle. It&#x27;s very beneficial for weekly facial scrubs, but using it too rough may irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> ordered this for my fiancee whom is in a different country right now he received then in a few days so quicker than expected and says they are good but like all cheap things wont last too long but for only 1cent we cant complain</li>
    <li> not really worth the money, the shower scrunchies do the exact same thing if even better most likely would not but this again</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I like these gloves for exfoliating in the shower. Sometimes it grosses me out when I think about anything that could be left over after I wash them off though. Hopefully, I&#x27;m able to wash them thoroughly enough...</li>
    <li> I love trying new things, and this item was one of those, but the gloves slip and slide if you press harder to get a good stimulating scrub. I ended up throwing them away. A loofah or even terry washcloth works much much better. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i was hoping for the gloves that are just somewhat thicker than this was.  they are nice but too thin they will fall apart quick</li>
    <li> Wonderfully effective, not too harsh. But, not the color I thought I was buying</li>
    <li> What a different these have made on my skin - softer and clearer.</li>
    <li> These gloves are incredible. If you ever wanted a great back scratch and the smoothest skin possible then buy a few sets of these gloves. My significant other and myself rub each others back every night and if you have trouble sleeping just get your back gently rubbed and off to sleep you go. I also have a set in the shower. I&#x27;ve ordered twice so far. This last time I ordered 5 pairs just in case they disappear. And for just over $5 a pair they&#x27;re heaven.</li>
    <li> It has issues with snagging and unraveling.  Replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;They were really tight around the wrist _. Uncomfortable to wear.  Did not get any better with time.</li>
    <li> Its just like any other shower gloves. They&#x27;re not too scratchy. They are gentle, but not too soft either. Good</li>
    <li> These gloves were just what I was looking for. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive. But glad we got them.</li>
    <li> These are nice bath gloves.  The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the lack of loops on the end of the gloves to hang them from the peg in my shower.</li>
    <li> The gloves fit really good around my hands.The materials in the glove is VERY effective at cleaning and exfoliating.I do wish they come in more different colors,that would be soo awesome too.</li>
    <li> Good product for what they are. I personally found it annoying to put the gloves on and take them off. I feel like a lufa would do the exact same thing without the hassle.</li>
    <li> These are great if you live in the cold weather like I do. Keep that dead skin off and it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get on with the arthritus I have in both hand but when I get them on they work great. Was afraid that buying the cheaper pair that they would not be any good but they work great and are a life saver for me!!! For sure, I would recommend these bathing glove to anyone. Great product. Floks, because they are inexpensive doesn&#x27;t mean that they are no good. Again, they work great and when I need another pair, I will order from this company!!!! A very satified customer!!!!!</li>
    <li> Material is durable and fast shipping.  Does everything I expected it to do and I have no reason to be dissatisfied.  Hasn&#x27;t stretched out yet.</li>
    <li> I know they&#x27;re meant to be exfoliating gloves but maybe I should have chosen a natural product instead of this plastic glove. but does it job for exfoliating my body during bathing. Just don&#x27;t like the super, synthetic, look.</li>
    <li> Or someone elses! Seriously though it does a nice job with out leaving your skin raw. Sounds silly but it works just fine.</li>
    <li> The gloves help skin stay soft.  Easy to put on and take off while showering.  I would recommend these gloves.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I was doing taking showers without these in the past but this really gets the dirt off. I love these.</li>
    <li> Best gloves that hold their shape for the money out there!  Excellent price!  I&#x27;ve tried others but they grew in the shower if you know what I mean.  These are fantastic!</li>
