      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>best bleach out there!</li>
      <li>and this did the job perfectly..  </li>
      <li>so I have to give it the best.</li>
      <li>WHAT AN AWESOME PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I will say that their leave in spray conditioner is the greatest product ever, and you should buy it if you are going to use this!</li>
      <li>Amazing product!!</li>
      <li>The results were very good</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Happy to have found this premixed lightener.</li>
      <li>Well; Joico is great.</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this!!  </li>
      <li>Very nice color.</li>
      <li>Good stuff gives hair a lot of moisture/conditioning during the bleaching process.</li>
      <li>This product was really good.</li>
      <li>AMAZING.</li>
      <li>and I see amazing results even on the darkest hair.</li>
      <li>I used it when I did the balayage technique on my own hair.  </li>
      <li>It is nice and platinum....</li>
      <li>The color was nice but after about a year it all started breaking off.</li>
      <li>Really nice creme bleach for on the scalp lightening.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this lightener- as a cosmetologist, is probably the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Very easy on my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>Very easy on the hair</li>
      <li>OK, so I used this product for over a year now, and I can honestly say its too strong.</li>
      <li>but now I need to pay more to order a 20 vol.</li>
      <li>her hair came out just as healthy as it was before doing anything to it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more forgiving.  </li>
      <li>WAY better for your hair than any powder bleach.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find a better bleach</li>
      <li>I used to use the powder bleach, but this was recommended to me because the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; based type products are supposed to be better.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 1/2 years ago my hair was being a bit more stubborn in lifting and</li>
      <li>love this product great for fast lifting for blonds</li>
      <li>Plus overtime you will have more breakage.  </li>
      <li>It was okay after I got a Wella toner on it.</li>
      <li>then I applied it to the top on the root parts for 15 minutes</li>
      <li>and then 15 minutes all over the top.....</li>
      <li>now feel confident to keep it up by myself instead of having to go to the city every 6 weeks to touch up my roots.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This works better in a 1:2 ratio of bleach to developer.</li>
      <li>This bleach does not make my hair sticky, maybe because we have really good spring water in our city that comes right to our tap.</li>
      <li>At first I loved it.  </li>
      <li>I was happy with Loreal, but a professional hair dresser recommended Joico</li>
      <li>It mixes and applies easily.</li>
      <li>What too strong means is that it can easily leak out and touch any type hair strand and it will immediately start the bleaching process, whereas I&#x27;ve found with the powder bleach</li>
      <li>It did smell really strong, though.</li>
      <li>There might be a better bleach &amp;amp; I&#x27;ll keep looking just for the fun of it, but I haven&#x27;t found one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the back is not an attractive color, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>But over time I noticed light breakage and realized turns out it was from the bleach.  </li>
      <li>If you have short hair already, than by all means, use it and get great results.</li>
      <li>My friend&#x27;s hair came out looking fantastic, I did a balayage driven ombre with babylights on the front to bring some light to her face, by the time I got done</li>
      <li>Watch out, this is very powerful and don&#x27;t leave it on your hair without watching it, it will turn it orange.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to apply,</li>
      <li>and I had to cut a significant amount off.</li>
      <li>This bleach is powerful!  </li>
      <li>What a clean lift.  </li>
      <li>I love with less volume developed and sooo healthy silky and amazingness!!!!</li>
      <li>I loved this bleach so much, i left it on for about 30 minutes</li>
      <li>The processing cap on top of the extra strong bleach started smoking, because my skin was burning.</li>
      <li>my hair lifted completely at the roots!!!!!</li>
      <li>and it did a great job getting me to a light blonde with only 10vol developer...</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>When I mixed it with the matching Joico developer, it smells very strong and bleachy.</li>
      <li>In spite of having tons of previous color applications and the level of my starting color, it lifted very evenly, achieved the perfect inside banana peel pale color and toned beautifully.  </li>
      <li>but they like to buy their things at Sally&#x27;s, the parent company sells this same exact bleach at Sally&#x27;s in a smaller tube called &amp;quot;Age Beautiful Cream Lightener&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried bleaching my hair previously but haven&#x27;t found a product that works as good as this....</li>
      <li>I gets my hair to the desired (light light) shade of blonde</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my hair also.</li>
      <li>A very light blonde, not platinum.</li>
      <li>So I still use this bleach, but I use it properly, and the results are healthy non-damaged hair when I do it, even for 1 1/2 years in a row for me now.</li>
      <li>i got mine pretty close to platinum with virtually no damage.</li>
      <li>and then I applied some more all over for 20 minutes so the total time was 75 minutes with  the bleach.....</li>
      <li>I was able to repeat it later at home.</li>
      <li>I applied in the evening as it&#x27;s hot during these summer days.</li>
      <li>I applied for 15 minutes on the back and sides followed by 10 minutes on the top roots followed by 15 minute all over....</li>
      <li>40 minutes all over the back and sides and the top roots</li>
      <li>Works very well without frying your hair!</li>
      <li>It will get you the lightest color even if you only use a 20 level developer, but I have had more breakage than ever before in my life.</li>
      <li>I did not bag, and I used no heat although it&#x27;s summer here and hot</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy using this method as long as I don&#x27;t overlap when applying.</li>
      <li>helped protect my hair so there really wasn&#x27;t much difference in my hair texture afterwards..</li>
      <li>If anyone wants this bleach</li>
      <li>I spray liquid coconut oil on my scalp the night before, and rub it in really well, and sleep on a garbage bag over my pillow.</li>
      <li>It has no fragrance which is a plus to some people, but I do really like the fruity smelling</li>
      <li>And of all the other cream lighteners, this was the best in ingredients, because the oil is the first ingredient, and potassium persulfate comes afterward; but that is the opposite for all of the other brands I tested.</li>
      <li>It worked very well.  </li>
      <li>So you can&#x27;t try to suggest that it is from too much abuse.</li>
      <li>My hair is brown, and I bleach it to beautiful natural platinum pastel yellow blonde with just 20 volume total (30 volume with a generous amount olaplex #1).</li>
      <li>When I mix it with my other favorite brand of cream developer, it does not smell bleachy.  </li>
      <li>It lifted so clean with only volume 20 on my 5 virgin re growth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The only time this bleach did not work for me, was when I wanted to relax and treat myself to a salon day, so I let a special ~Beth</li>
      <li>The solution didn&#x27;t burn or irrate my scalp, though it was sensitive to heat for 12 hours after, so caution going out on a hot day afterwards.</li>
      <li>So I still use this bleach, but I use it properly, and the results are healthy non-damaged hair when I do it, even for 1 1/2 years in a row for me now.e hair stylist&#x27;s fault for not following the directions.</li>
      <li>Was using powder Loreal Quick Blue and Loreal 20 volume developer.</li>
      <li>will lift too quickly and melt my hair off before I could even finish applying to my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I had my hair in a two tone style with the top golden blond and the sides and back 3n dark chestnut....</li>
      <li>Note that hair will break off using high lift processing if you overlap, just like bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this gets my hair from a level 3 dark brown to a level 10 silver white blonde in one processing without heat its amazing and dont damaged as much as the powder stuff from sallys!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was really good. It did smell really strong, though.</li>
    <li> I have never used cream lightener until last weekend. WHAT AN AWESOME PRODUCT! I will never go back to powder bleach after using this product. My friend&#x27;s hair came out looking fantastic, I did a balayage driven ombre with babylights on the front to bring some light to her face, by the time I got done I was a bit worried of the damage received, just as with any normal bleach... but NOPE! her hair came out just as healthy as it was before doing anything to it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this product with a 20 % when she bleached my roots.  I was able to repeat it later at home. It mixes and applies easily. I live in a rural area and had forgotten to purchase a dye brush to apply thru amazon.  I bought natural hair basting brush from the kitchen dept at KMart and trimmed it by half. It worked very well.  The solution didn&#x27;t burn or irrate my scalp, though it was sensitive to heat for 12 hours after, so caution going out on a hot day afterwards. I followed this, after washing out and my hair being damp, with the toner. I applied the toner to the roots then massaged it into the rest of my hair for the total time of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I now feel confident to keep it up by myself instead of having to go to the city every 6 weeks to touch up my roots.</li>
    <li> Watch out, this is very powerful and don&#x27;t leave it on your hair without watching it, it will turn it orange.  It was okay after I got a Wella toner on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this bleach very carefully on my roots at home for almost a couple years. It is the most gentle and least damaging hair bleach I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to play with my hair and with hair products. I have ordered several other cream hair lighteners, and I even fanaggled a couple other professional-only expensive rare bleaches direct from Italy. I patch tested them on my hair, and tested them on a piece of paper to see which one dries out the fastest, and compared ingredients side by side. This Joico bleach won all of those tests so far. And of all the other cream lighteners, this was the best in ingredients, because the oil is the first ingredient, and potassium persulfate comes afterward; but that is the opposite for all of the other brands I tested. There might be a better bleach &amp;amp; I&#x27;ll keep looking just for the fun of it, but I haven&#x27;t found one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bleach says &amp;quot;For Professional Use Only&amp;quot;. That is a specific legal phrase which means anyone can buy or sell this, and you ARE allowed to use it at home. But if it doesn&#x27;t work or hurts you at home, then you officially waived all rights to sue.  If anyone wants this bleach but they like to buy their things at Sally&#x27;s, the parent company sells this same exact bleach at Sally&#x27;s in a smaller tube called &amp;quot;Age Beautiful Cream Lightener&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works better in a 1:2 ratio of bleach to developer. I spray liquid coconut oil on my scalp the night before, and rub it in really well, and sleep on a garbage bag over my pillow. I use a Taymor Adjustable Floor Mirror to see the back of my head when applying, which was well worth the money several times over. The tube of this bleach says &amp;quot;fragrance-free&amp;quot;, which just means it doesn&#x27;t have extra perfume in it. When I mixed it with the matching Joico developer, it smells very strong and bleachy. When I mix it with my other favorite brand of cream developer, it does not smell bleachy.  I am not able to section and bleach my whole head in time for the bleach to work evenly. So I bleach the back of my head, wash it off etc and keep the front of my head separate in the shower, then bleach the front of my head. When it runs low in the tube, I cut it open with scissors, and scrape the rest out with a kitchen spatula. This bleach does not make my hair sticky, maybe because we have really good spring water in our city that comes right to our tap. I even have to rinse it out with plain water and without shampoo, to put my olaplex #2 on it before shampooing, and I am able to completely rinse this out with plain water. Remember to use a shampoo with sulphate in it on hair bleach day, to get all of the bleach molecules out. Frou-frou organic shampoo won&#x27;t work. I use ApHogee shampoo and conditioner from Sally&#x27;s on hair bleaching day. My hair is brown, and I bleach it to beautiful natural platinum pastel yellow blonde with just 20 volume total (30 volume with a generous amount olaplex #1). Then I tone it with a professional acid-based demi-permanent toner set in the &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; color range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time this bleach did not work for me, was when I wanted to relax and treat myself to a salon day, so I let a special ~Beth Minardi certified bleach blonde Joico salon~ bleach my roots with this same bleach. Big mistake; it was a disaster. The hair stylist insisted on using 30v bleach mix against my stated wishes. Then she put a cap on it to speed it up. She slapped the bleach all over my head overlapping by several inches and completely burning off the right corner of my bangs that day. The processing cap on top of the extra strong bleach started smoking, because my skin was burning. I woke up with blisters the next day. Then my hair started falling apart a couple weeks later - first on the top, then eventually all over by several months later. It is taking a couple years to grow out a completely brand new head of hair. But it is not the bleach&#x27;s fault. It is the hair stylist&#x27;s fault for not following the directions. The label says &amp;quot;ONLY 20 VOLUME OR LESS ON THE SCALP&amp;quot; and also &amp;quot;WITHOUT HEAT&amp;quot;. Yes, this even applies to other people with darker colored hair. You don&#x27;t use stronger bleach for darker roots. You are just supposed to leave normal 20v bleach mix on longer for darker hair. And these directions apply both to at-home use, and especially to licensed cosmetologists since they are doing another person&#x27;s head. So please read the label and follow all the instructions when you use any hair products. Even though people call this a gentle bleach, it is only gentle if you follow the directions. So I still use this bleach, but I use it properly, and the results are healthy non-damaged hair when I do it, even for 1 1/2 years in a row for me now.e hair stylist&#x27;s fault for not following the directions.

    <li> Happy to have found this premixed lightener. Squeeze it out of tube and use with any 10-30 developer. Doesnt damage hair if done correctly.  50 minutes max to be left on virgin hair if using 10-30 developer.</li>
    <li> I have tried bleaching my hair previously but haven&#x27;t found a product that works as good as this.... I&#x27;ve used Goldwell powder bleach as well as have had my hair bleached proffesionally.... All other products have burned my scalp, caused blistering  and have been unbearably painfull....My hair grows very fast and when I bleach it I wear it very short so within 2 weeks you can see my dark brown roots....&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair in a two tone style with the top golden blond and the sides and back 3n dark chestnut.... I first applied the bleach to the sides and back for 40 minutes (cream bleach one part to 2 parts 30 wt Verocolor Veroxidedeveloper) then I applied it to the top on the root parts for 15 minutes and then I applied some more all over for 20 minutes so the total time was 75 minutes with  the bleach..... I washed the bleach off and applied beige toner/10% developer for 30 minutes....... The results were very good but I had some uneven tones that I knew I had to re bleach at a later time.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned my hair with cholesterol deep conditioner for a week and then applied bleach again using 1 part cr&amp;egrave;me and 2 parts 30 developer....I applied for 15 minutes on the back and sides followed by 10 minutes on the top roots followed by 15 minute all over....Then I applied the beige toner for 30 min.....The next day I got my haircut  with a 1/4 undercut all around and long on top.... It looks really professional...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on week #3 of the haircut and just touched up the roots....40 minutes all over the back and sides and the top roots and then 15 minutes all over the top..... It is nice and platinum.... Just used manic panic white toner for 30 min.....  I might hit it with toner in a couple of days or just wait until the bleach touch up and haircut in three weeks</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Like with all bleach, you have to monitor your hair carefully because it lifts quickly.</li>
    <li> Normally I would get bleach from Sallys, but not anymore.. I loved this bleach so much, i left it on for about 30 minutes and it did a great job getting me to a light blonde with only 10vol developer... I had already lightened my naturally dark brown hair to a light brown but wanted some ombre highlights mixed in and this did the job perfectly..  Anytime i&#x27;ve had my hair professionally bleached it was always dry, fried and damaged but the oily, creamy consistency helped protect my hair so there really wasn&#x27;t much difference in my hair texture afterwards.. i&#x27;ve read elsewhere some people felt it was too oily and difficult to wash out but i didnt have that issue. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Can&#x27;t wait to order more. It is so gentle on hair and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. No brass tones and no unevenness. I didn&#x27;t even have to tone!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I used it when I did the balayage technique on my own hair.  It does get a bit thick when combined with the peroxide, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out right away.  It has oils in it to protect your hair from damage, but it also makes it a bit tough to clean up.  Use some dish soap on your utensils when cleaning up.  I used it with a 20 peroxide (Clairol from Sally&#x27;s) and it took awhile to lift my hair.  It can be deceiving when checking the progress because the mixture is white and you can&#x27;t really tell, so use caution. If you want a quicker lift, use 30 volume but be careful on pre-lightened hair and virgin hair.  I&#x27;ve read reviews where this was the go-to product for on-the-scalp lightening because it&#x27;s pretty gentle, but virgin hair always acts differently then previously colored/lightened hair.  Also, it has a bit of violet/blue in it so it won&#x27;t pull much of the brassiness that white bleaches do, but that was my experience with my hair and everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I will write a detailed review as I had trouble finding enough reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 5 N natural brunette, age 43 with about 5% grey. I have been using Clairol Torrids to high lift blonde my hair since the age of 22. Approx. My process was 1:2 12AA Blue base, 40 vol. peroxide, with a bag, under the dryer for 47 mins. This gets me to about a 8G. I did not tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 years ago my hair was being a bit more stubborn in lifting and also I wanted my hair a little bit lighter blonde almost a 10G, depending on what chart you use. A very light blonde, not platinum. The salon was using a bleach but pulling it through my hair to blend during final processing time. I said not to keep doing this yet she did. I was still using the bag, and still going under the dryer for about the same amount of time. Then she would tone it. I don&#x27;t know what products she used, and she tried a few because I was having allergic reactions, nor do I know the strength of the peroxide. The color was nice but after about a year it all started breaking off. I had to cut over 24\\&quot; of my hair off!!! Oh, and I&#x27;d have to take a Benedryl prior to color as the itching was fierce and I would get red welts all over my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to doing the high lift myself for about the past year; (using Clairol Soy4plex 12 AAB HL-B) as Torrids is now discontinued. I was contemplating returning to my natural color but wanted to test this product out. I like the natural golden blonde that my front lifts to but the back is not an attractive color, in my opinion. My hair is healthy using this method as long as I don&#x27;t overlap when applying. Note that hair will break off using high lift processing if you overlap, just like bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I performed on the back as this hair is difficult to lighten. I used 1:2 with the K-Pak Veroxide 40 vol. (peroxide). I did not bag, and I used no heat although it&#x27;s summer here and hot but the a/c was on. In ONLY 14 mins. my hair lifted completely at the roots!!!!! It itched a little but no rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a 5 star but now I need to pay more to order a 20 vol. peroxide (K-Pak Veroxide) because the 40 vol. will lift too quickly and melt my hair off before I could even finish applying to my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I do not know the condition of my hair yet nor the lasting health to comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a lot more expensive than I normally pay and I have to order it online because no store that I can find carriers it. Let me rephrase that: the product is more expensive but the shipping doubles the price. Instead of paying $5 or so for 32 oz of peroxide it is now $17 - $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll now order the 20 vol. Veroxide and then hopefully remember to update this posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I had personally tested a few other bleaches. This one is not gritty and doesn&#x27;t swell (at least in a short amount of time). It is thick and stays in place. I didn&#x27;t have a hard time washing it out as others have stated that they did. I would prefer that it had more of a blue base as I think that it may need to be toned. It has no fragrance which is a plus to some people, but I do really like the fruity smelling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 20 vol. Veroxide. I applied in the evening as it&#x27;s hot during these summer days. I mixed 1:2 ratio. I started application in the back and came forward. It took about 45 mins to apply to all roots. I ended up with hot roots and the front didn&#x27;t lift enough and the back lifted too much. Also, the mix was a bit grainy and difficult to apply; could not use the bottle application as mixture wouldn&#x27;t shake and mix. You would have to pre mix and then put in bottle. I left on for a total of approx. 50 mins. with no heat and no bag. Although I applied as I usually do, it somehow doesn&#x27;t get in between the hairs nicely and left me with some unlightened hair! I would need to tone as the blue didn&#x27;t cut brassiness butI am not going to at this time. I will try Shimmer Lights. I washed it out but today my hair feels really dirty. I am assuming this is what others described. I am not happy with product at this time.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! No more powder bleach from salleys again for me. My hair came out all the same white that I&#x27;ve been wanting. No spots of orange or yellow. It didn&#x27;t burn. And it prices under 30min. I&#x27;ll use this product forever. I&#x27;m in LOVE&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t deal with the sticky, greasy residue.</li>
    <li> This bleach is powerful!  The first time I used it my hair lifted so light - and I have dark, dyed, asian hair.  Also, it didn&#x27;t totally destroy my hair, which is crazy because I&#x27;ve never bleached without seriously damaging my hair.  The 2nd time I used this bleach, everything went wrong.  This is partly my fault, because there was color in it already.  My hair turned blue in some areas, green in others while the rest went platinum white.  I eventually had to go to the salon because the damage was done.  Since I bleached twice and also color corrected, my hair was left very brittle and damaged.</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hard to lift hair and this gets my roots to the pale yellow stage I need it to be before toning.  Very gentle on my hair also.</li>
    <li> WAY better for your hair than any powder bleach. use with 20 developer. i have asian hair and it&#x27;s notoriously hard to lighten without doing severe damage. i got mine pretty close to platinum with virtually no damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a HM blonde.  I won&#x27;t even walk near a Sally&#x27;s.  When bleaching your hair, let&#x27;s face it, much of it is down to the product. L&#x27;Oreal Platinum Professional Lightener is supposedly the Cadillac of bleaching products.  So I tracked it down and used that for on scalp.  At first I loved it.  It lifted so clean with only volume 20 on my 5 virgin re growth.  But over time I noticed light breakage and realized turns out it was from the bleach.  (My colorist does not overlap.)  So back to the drawing board and I researched all cream bleaches and spent a small fortune testing each one on small root areas.  Joico creme lightener beat them all.  Yesterday by colorist did my roots with this and volume 20.  AMAZING. What a clean lift.  No orange or brass.  You put on roots and let it sit for an hour.  She puts a plastic cap over my head.  That&#x27;s the only sort of heat source we use.  We are going to experiment and see if we can use volume 10.  If you are doing root bleaches, you need to research &#x27;low and slow&#x27; regarding developers.  30 and 40 lift fast, but usually only to a brassy look.  Plus overtime you will have more breakage.  Lower volumes take longer to work, but they lift cleaner and clearer.  Meaning less brass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this!!  I&#x27;d read it about it for a while, but I&#x27;m a hair snob.  I find Joico products sort of to the masses and generic.  I mean they are in every shopping mall hair salon.  I&#x27;m still not a fan of their other hair products, but this bleach is BEYOND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they quit making it.  Oh!  We use Wella developer 20 with it instead of the Joico one.  We found joico developer too watery.</li>
    <li> best bleach out there! this gets my hair from a level 3 dark brown to a level 10 silver white blonde in one processing without heat its amazing and dont damaged as much as the powder stuff from sallys!!</li>
    <li> love this product great for fast lifting for blonds</li>
    <li> OK, so I used this product for over a year now, and I can honestly say its too strong. I used to use the powder bleach, but this was recommended to me because the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; based type products are supposed to be better. It will get you the lightest color even if you only use a 20 level developer, but I have had more breakage than ever before in my life. I am a person who only shampoos ever three days, and my conditioner is the highest quality out there right now. I also don&#x27;t blow dry or curl my hair. So you can&#x27;t try to suggest that it is from too much abuse. That being said, it is just this bleach that is so damaging. I needed to post a review so that some people are warned. If you have short hair already, than by all means, use it and get great results. But I had hair almost to my butt and I had to cut a significant amount off. This product isn&#x27;t worth it. I will say that their leave in spray conditioner is the greatest product ever, and you should buy it if you are going to use this!</li>
    <li> I am half-Asian and used this product to lighten my natural level 2-3 hair to an 8-9 with very little damage.  I did not have virgin hair, I did one application about two inches from the roots through the ends, waited a week and applying a deep conditioner daily, then did a second application applying to the roots halfway through processing.  In spite of having tons of previous color applications and the level of my starting color, it lifted very evenly, achieved the perfect inside banana peel pale color and toned beautifully.  I don&#x27;t recommend this dramatic change if you&#x27;re not fairly well versed performing your own chemical processes but if you are this is the gentlest lifting product I&#x27;ve used.  I should mention that the first application was mixed with 30 volume and no heat, the second was mixed 30 volume through the lengths and 25 volume on scalp.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a better bleach I gets my hair to the desired (light light) shade of blonde I love with less volume developed and sooo healthy silky and amazingness!!!!</li>
    <li> Was using powder Loreal Quick Blue and Loreal 20 volume developer. Researched these before I started and these have good/great reviews and long time followers. Went from medium/dark brown to light/pale/neutral blonde (no toner or other color). I was happy with Loreal, but a professional hair dresser recommended Joico so I got the creme lightener and the 20 volume K pak developer. Well; Joico is great. Did not feel burn on my scalp and I was starting to feel a little burn after repeated use of the other products. Joico lightened faster than the Loreal, so I have some uneven coloring now but I will fix that. Very nice color. Very easy on my hair and scalp. More expensive and I had to buy it on line as I can&#x27;t find it in stores or beauty suppliers. Sally&#x27;s near me does not have Joico. I will spend the exta $. I have almost waist length hair so I have to give it the best. Will buy all Joico products. Still less expensive than hair salon.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Just amasing! Works very well without frying your hair! When i washed my hair after it felt moistured as if i had a treatment on not bleaching cream. I will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> Really nice creme bleach for on the scalp lightening. Bought for my sister and she loves it..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this lightener- as a cosmetologist, is probably the best I have ever used. Super easy to apply, and I see amazing results even on the darkest hair. I will never stop purchasing this, it&#x27;s a MUST have.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s less damaging to your hair, but washing this out really is taxing. Having to wash your hair 4-5 times after use makes me think twice about using this again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff gives hair a lot of moisture/conditioning during the bleaching process. Very easy on the hair</li>
    <li> I really do like this product and it&#x27;s extremely gentle on hair, but as previously warned by other reviewers it&#x27;s too strong.  What too strong means is that it can easily leak out and touch any type hair strand and it will immediately start the bleaching process, whereas I&#x27;ve found with the powder bleach it&#x27;s more forgiving.  I didn&#x27;t experience a nasty smell with this and I didn&#x27;t need to use a toner when it was left on for the recommended amount of time.  I was blown away, but then again I was used to powder bleach being forgiving and I ended up having splotches on my sisters in laws hair that I needed to correct.  If you know what you&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s a must, but for beginners stick with the powder bleach application.</li>
