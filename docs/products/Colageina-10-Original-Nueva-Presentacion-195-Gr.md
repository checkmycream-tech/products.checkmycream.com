    <li> Great product. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I am taking for only one month and i like it, but I need more time to decide if it is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Your container is to small, not enough product.</li>
    <li> What I wanted at very low price, it tastes very good and it&#x27;s very easy to prepare. I received my product earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing, this is realy give you exelents results, i will keep buying this product, just try</li>
    <li> Can you provide a product description in English I had to go to another site just to get to know what the product does.  I guess it has Collagen but that is the extent of what I gathered.</li>
    <li> This product, very good, excellent soon&#x27;ll buy other more. I would buy my mom, she is very grateful.&lt;br /&gt;Total Thanks</li>
    <li> Yes, I like the product but there was one change I notice..I had order this same product from you guys before. The flavoring was no longer the same so therefore, I felt skeptical on how it would work.  I do not see a the great effects I had last time.  Did you change formula?  The first time ihad my hair grow so healthy and longer. I am 40 and had difficulty growing my hair. My skin got radiant and did receive many compliments on both things...they all wanted to know my secret for looking so good! Did take colageina for 3 months. Yes I would recomend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> i use this every day and can really tell the difference , it takes at least 2 tubs to start to tell the difference but it works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for your skin</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. It has helped my skin very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have already purchased more of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> I tried to order this product in bulk so that I could take this product for 3 months to see if it would work but was only able to buy 1 months supply :(</li>
    <li> Is really good help me with my nails and hair!</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair was shinier and skin was better.&lt;br /&gt;My hair never grows much past my shoulders without breaking first and it&#x27;s growing like crazy for the first time, and no breakage! In fact it&#x27;s taking me longer to blow dry it because it&#x27;s not as dry anymore. I take a scoop every day in water. No, it has a taste of orange,  the results are amazing. take this every day for great skin, hair and the best ever for my arthritis don&#x27;t have since using this supplement</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in the past, but this time it taste and looks very diffrent hopefully  it will be as good as the others I have bought.  The last 3 times i ordered where not from.  Innova,  I have heard bad thing of that brand. Hopefully it will work. I&#x27;ll keep u posted</li>
    <li> Tastes different than last time, but I love this product</li>
    <li> this product I bought blind folded. I first saw it on tv and I looked for the product on my kindle and bought it. I was doubtful of using this product for me and was thinking on giving it away afraid it was not going to be what I expected. To my surprise, the product turned out to be what was meant to do and I love it. the only negative and disappointing thing that happened was that the product arrived with a different picture but I still gave it a five because I am really not picky as long as it does what was promised</li>
    <li> SI ME GUSTO PORQ YA NO ME SALEN BARROS NI ESPINILLAS COMO ANTES Y MIS UNAS ESTAN MAS FUERTES MI CABELLO ESTA PRESIOSO MI PIEL MEJORO TAMBIEN O NO SABE MAL COMO EL ANTERIOR</li>
    <li> Ingredients include different types of sugars and sucrose as well as artificial flavoring. It might taste better than regular collagen, but isn&#x27;t the purpose to heal the body from the inside out? Too many artificial components for my taste. Also, collagen is bovine. I returned unopened container for refund.</li>
    <li> I am not rating this product on any results, since I have not purchased it.  However, I would like to consider a purchase of it, but there is no information on how much is in the container, no information on how many mgs or grams of collagen there are, and I used my Fire Fox translater on the words written in Spanish and really didn&#x27;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I need a better understanding of this product before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Second time I buy this product I love it. Was delivered in proper time requested.</li>
