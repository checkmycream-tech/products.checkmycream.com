<li> smaller than what I expected!</li>
<li> I bought the 1.6 ounce and a tiny little bottle for travel.</li>
<li> One little spritz will do, so it lasts a long time, though.</li>
<li> I would even accept a watered down version of it if I could find it.</li>
<li> The lid on the bottle was not secure.  </li>
<li> so small it was a gift</li>
<li> the perfume is too small ..</li>
<li> it´s prety small for the price</li>
<li> Are you kidding it is so small</li>
<li> only downside is that with very expensive shipping the amount of perfume I received verses the cost was totally not worth it.</li>
<li> /&gt;I was shocked its smaller than my little</li>
<li> Smells very subtle, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, with a hint of floral, with ever-so-slight undertones of sandalwood or musk?</li>
<li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointment:(</li>

    <li> tiny ..nothing like pic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this perfume!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas.  It was perfectly priced-not $65 at Macy&#x27;s or elsewhere, arrived in plenty of time &amp; is exaclty what she wanted!  Yay!</li>
    <li> Is not what I want to</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! I&#x27;ve searched all over the Internet and in stores and the price is always the same. I would even accept a watered down version of it if I could find it. One little spritz will do, so it lasts a long time, though. I have the lotion and the perfume. I bought the 1.6 ounce and a tiny little bottle for travel. I often just use the lotion on my pressure points so that it lasts longer. Smells very subtle, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, with a hint of floral, with ever-so-slight undertones of sandalwood or musk?</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, but it&#x27;s a good perfume. I would never buy a smaller size again. You&#x27;re better off buying the larger one.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all but I also got the rose one d&amp;g and that one smells great! I guess it just depends on what u like! I&#x27;m a happy Clinique kinda girl... LAMB... Aqua digio... Poppy coach.. :) versace Chrystal</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful bouquet of fragrances, yet very lite and feminine.  I tried it in a major department store last Christmas and fell in love with it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.com at a much more reasonable price...now I can afford the parfum, body lotion and bath gel.  I receive lots of compliments when I wear this parfum, everyone including some men want to know what fragrance it is.  I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. smaller than what I expected!</li>
    <li> The lid on the bottle was not secure.  It could easily fall off.  Love the porduct it just needs a different type of lid.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell I&#x27;m addicted great product fast shipping very light perfume not &#x27;in your face offensive&#x27; smell very unique I&#x27;d stay with it for a while</li>
    <li> Has a rich smell ,wonderful</li>
    <li> R u serious?????&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked its smaller than my little finger!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it now!!!! I dont want and dosent have any smelll water!!</li>
    <li> too much money and not enough purfum...</li>
    <li> She was vary pleases with this product.</li>
    <li> Thank&#x27;s for best supply!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this perfume, very seductive!!</li>
    <li> The bottle is misleading, I thought it would be wayyyyy larger than it is..</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived very quickly order placed 11/16 received 11/21, I even got some sample perfumes and offers included with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that with very expensive shipping the amount of perfume I received verses the cost was totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance, light and flowery not overpowering or heavy like some fragrances that are popular today.  Unique scent too.</li>
    <li> Its so small it was a gift the person I gave it to will have to use it sparingly I should have been warned that it was a teaspoonful of THE ONE and a sample.  It smells great just not big enough for the money hey $20.00 more bucks and I could have gotten a real one.</li>
    <li> Yes I love this was happy with my order ! One of my favorite suble scents classic get alot of compliments on it ! Was happy with seller &amp; purchase !</li>
    <li> I love it I want the big bottle now</li>
    <li> I simply luv this fragrance ..</li>
    <li> Not what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Very flowery scent will use this one or give it as a gift to someone else</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I am in love with it! Its a small tiny free sample bottle sold here for almost $15. I wonder where ppl get it free lol. Anyway, i dont care that i paid $15. Now i know it will be worth it buying the big bottle 😊👏 in love with the scent!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it is womanly, sexy, I get so many compliments all the time!! And this is  little bottle, so perfect for your purse, Love it!</li>

    <li> Dolce and Gabbana is deffinately a quality of fragrances.  This one is lighter than Sicily but the same rich chemistry.  A good choice for perfumes</li>
    <li> good product, good seller.</li>
    <li> they are great! Very happy! thank you!</li>
    <li> No smell at all. I think it&#x27;s water. I have asked several people to smell it and they all said it had no smell. The box is clearly labeled &amp;#34;Free Sample Not For Sale&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love it and so happy that i could purchase this travel size so i could try it out before purchasing the larger version</li>
    <li> i my gosh its worth every cent</li>
    <li> Whoever you order this for will love you forever!  This fragrance is so rich ...not heavy , it&#x27;s  soft&lt;br /&gt;suductive and just the right touch for the discrimenating woman.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance.  Doesn&#x27;t take much because it&#x27;s strong.  I would certainly recommend it&amp;#62;  Test it in the store before you buy.</li>
