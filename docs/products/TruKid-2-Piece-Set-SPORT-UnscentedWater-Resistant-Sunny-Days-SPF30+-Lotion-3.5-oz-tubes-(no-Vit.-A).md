### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!  </li>
      <li>It also smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>This TruKid sunscreen is best reserved for use on the body.</li>
      <li>It does a great job protecting from the sun, I have yet to burn with this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The package came promptly and in good condition.</li>
      <li>We have tried EVERY kind of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreen for our kids and this is far and away the best.</li>
      <li>And I have a skin type that tans very easily.</li>
      <li>But the best part is that I never have to worry about their protection from the sun, and my wife loves that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>I liked the texture; it was easy to spread.</li>
      <li>It does go on thicker than many of the non-natural brands on the market.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than some of the more famous brands of sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Before Trukid, my wife would always harp on me to make sure our sons were covered head to toe in sunscreen before we went out to play at our neighborhood park.</li>
      <li>so you have to rub it in more.</li>
      <li>and they love the scent.</li>
      <li>I love this as a body sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Now, our boys love to put it on themselves because it is so lightweight</li>
      <li>kids don&#x27;t burn, and I feel better knowing I didn&#x27;t just lather them up in toxic chemicals.  </li>
      <li>that made me stop using it as I couldn&#x27;t be sure of its efficacy.</li>
      <li>Let me know if you find a coupon or a better value for volume.</li>
      <li>And most important it has an EGW rating of 1.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and works fine.  </li>
      <li>And it is made without harsh or damaging chemicals, which is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I have tried dozens and dozens of natural sunscreens for myself and my kids, and TruKid is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients and very water resistant.  </li>
      <li>, if I&#x27;m going to slather me and my family with sunscreen to prevent burning, I want it to not be full of carcinogens.</li>
      <li>Just back from a week in the Caribbean, with two applications a day (and sun shirts) on fair skin, no one got burned.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m paranoid about what I put on myself and my kids and this stuff is supposed to be good (without a lot of the extra garbage they put in sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really take that much more effort to rub in either.</li>
      <li>It rubs in quickly without any residue.</li>
      <li>For my friends who are concerned with the same things I am (low chemicals and excellent protection), this is always the sunscreen I recommend.</li>
      <li>The sport version is great because it is unscented so not only do I not have to worry about photoreactive essential oils, I also don&#x27;t smell like a sweet tart when I wear it!</li>
      <li>Even though TruKid SPORT Unscented/Water Resistant Sunny Days SPF 30+ Lotion offers great UVB/UVA protection with titanium dioxide and zinc, I don&#x27;t have to deal with the bothersome white cast that often accompanies all-mineral sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I read some excellent reviews of this product on EWG and decided to try it, because every sunscreen I have used has broken my face out within 1 week of use.  </li>
      <li>I can not recommend this product more for those that have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I prefer a more lightweight, lotion texture for facial sunscreens.</li>
      <li>After much research (Environmental Working Group database is helpful!)</li>
      <li>and my skin actually looks better than when I started using it.</li>
      <li>It does contain dimethicone which I&#x27;ve been reading that you should avoid but honestly, I can live with it to get a sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing on an everyday basis.</li>
      <li>I really like this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It gives whole day protection  in and out of the water .</li>
      <li>Surprising since my family spent every minute of every day at the beach with their nordic heritage and red hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the best sunscreen for avoiding too-small nano-particles, but still able to rub in without too much ghostliness (a little bit if putting on heavily, but the kids don&#x27;t care and I just layer a little powdered bronzer on my face to counter that).</li>
      <li>It leaves a slight whitish cast, but given the high rating on EWG, I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
      <li>Highly rated by EWG, this sunscreen was recommended by a friend.  </li>
      <li>Easier to apply than other 1 and 2 rated sport sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group list but not as easy as some of those chemical laden sport sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>With frequent re-application, I didn&#x27;t even gain that much color to my skin.</li>
      <li>So far we really like this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It is pricey, but especially in the months when the sun is really intense, I am willing to pay for it.</li>
      <li>(many sunscreens say they are broad spectrum but only have moderate coverage protecting you from rays that cause skin cancer).</li>
      <li>Our family--my youngest son, especially--has very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I tried it based on ratings by EWG (Environmental Working Group), which says it is very low in chemicals and very high in both UVA and UVB protection</li>
      <li>It does need to be reapplied frequently--</li>
      <li>and I had no trouble blending it in.</li>
      <li>but I received product that is completely liquid (like water).</li>
      <li>I got tubes for my adult kids and me.  </li>
      <li>We spent a full day at a waterpark this summer in full sun (we look like vampires with our pale skin), reapplied this sunscreen faithfully every two hours, did not use our towels or goggles and no one got sunburned.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit hard to rub in (husband doesn&#x27;t like it on his body hair, kids are squiggly), but worth it.</li>

<li> the back of the bottle says every 40 minutes--but if you aren&#x27;t towel-drying or pulling goggles on and off of your face (actions which will wipe off the sunscreen fairly easily and quickly, unfortunately), you may not need to reapply the sunscreen quite that often.  </li>
<li> Ultimately it was the sunscreen separating (clear liquid would come pouring out, making what seemed like a never-ending mess)</li>
<li> I have used everything from the top of the line commercial products just for the face to very expensive brands at the dermatology office.</li>
<li> It is a little harder to rub in and leaves some white color on the skin if not rubbed in enough.</li>

<li> This is the one that we found that didn&#x27;t have most of the bad chemicals.</li>
<li> I stopped using this sunscreen when it started separating shortly after I bought it, which is unfortunate as it seemed quite promising.</li>
<li> I wore this to the beach everyday on a recent vacation.</li>
<li> Applied at 8 am and 1 pm everyday while on vacation and my family did not burn came home with only the faintest tans.  </li>
<li> Also, extremely greasy.</li>
<li> so after a minute or two there is no white mask left behind.</li>
<li> I feel this sunscreen works well and has less chemicals than others.  </li>
<li> I am a bit wary of regular Sunny Days because of the citrus essential oils in it.</li>
<li> Half the reason for a sunscreen is just not to burn and be in pain, but the other half is to prevent skin cancer, so why bother covering one&#x27;s skin with screens that are known or suspected to be as dangerous as too much UV?</li>
<li> It also has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and pomegranate juice in it.</li>
<li> Not sure what happened during the shipping, temperature changes or something else</li>
<li> Trukid Sport is my everyday sunscreen from now on!</li>
<li> It does rub on thick</li>
<li> safest sunscreen on the market that does not have the bad chemicals that other sunblocks have</li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s not &#x27;perfect,&#x27;</li>
<li> Disappointed with the product, returned.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product!  Have one in my pocketbook at all times.</li>
    <li> I love this as a body sunscreen. It rubs in quickly without any residue. Even though TruKid SPORT Unscented/Water Resistant Sunny Days SPF 30+ Lotion offers great UVB/UVA protection with titanium dioxide and zinc, I don&#x27;t have to deal with the bothersome white cast that often accompanies all-mineral sunscreens. The only drawback for me is that the texture is almost balm-like. I prefer a more lightweight, lotion texture for facial sunscreens. This TruKid sunscreen is best reserved for use on the body. I wore this to the beach everyday on a recent vacation. With frequent re-application, I didn&#x27;t even gain that much color to my skin. And I have a skin type that tans very easily. I will definitely continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I looooove Sunny Days Sport! I am a bit wary of regular Sunny Days because of the citrus essential oils in it. Some essential oils are photoreactive unless steam distilled. I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence anywhere that Trukid uses steam distilled oils in their sunscreens so I stopped using regular Sunny Days.  The sport version is great because it is unscented so not only do I not have to worry about photoreactive essential oils, I also don&#x27;t smell like a sweet tart when I wear it! It doesn&#x27;t really take that much more effort to rub in either. I have blond peach fuzz all over my arms and I had no trouble blending it in. It is one of the lesser whitening physical sunscreens in my opinion. It is not oily, greasy or tacky at all.  It does contain dimethicone which I&#x27;ve been reading that you should avoid but honestly, I can live with it to get a sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing on an everyday basis. Trukid Sport is my everyday sunscreen from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m paranoid about what I put on myself and my kids and this stuff is supposed to be good (without a lot of the extra garbage they put in sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids don&#x27;t burn, and I feel better knowing I didn&#x27;t just lather them up in toxic chemicals.  I know it&#x27;s not &#x27;perfect,&#x27; but it&#x27;s better than some of the more famous brands of sunscreens.</li>
    <li> It gives whole day protection  in and out of the water . I have used for sailing cycling and trekking</li>
    <li> Highly rated by EWG, this sunscreen was recommended by a friend.  It goes on easily and works fine.  I got tubes for my adult kids and me.  The package came promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Works well. No complaints from the boys.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this sunscreen when it started separating shortly after I bought it, which is unfortunate as it seemed quite promising. I liked the texture; it was easy to spread. It leaves a slight whitish cast, but given the high rating on EWG, I&#x27;m OK with that. It stings a little bit when I was wearing it, but not enough that it would make me stop using it.

Surprising since my family spent every minute of every day at the beach with their nordic heritage and red hair.  Easier to apply than other 1 and 2 rated sport sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group list but not as easy as some of those chemical laden sport sunscreens.  Need to put extra effort to wash it off at the end of the day and can be expensive to use consistently. The Trukid Daily is easier to apply than the Sport.  Let me know if you find a coupon or a better value for volume.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been reading and researching sunscreen for kids. This is the one that we found that didn&#x27;t have most of the bad chemicals. It does rub on thick so you have to rub it in more. So far we really like this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> We have tried EVERY kind of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreen for our kids and this is far and away the best. Just back from a week in the Caribbean, with two applications a day (and sun shirts) on fair skin, no one got burned.</li>
    <li> I read some excellent reviews of this product on EWG and decided to try it, because every sunscreen I have used has broken my face out within 1 week of use.  After years of frustration, I have stopped using sunscreen because of fear of it breaking my face out again. I have used everything from the top of the line commercial products just for the face to very expensive brands at the dermatology office. Nothing worked.  I could not be happier with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it every day this summer and am still using it now and my skin actually looks better than when I started using it. It also has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and pomegranate juice in it. I can not recommend this product more for those that have sensitive skin. It also smells wonderful. Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and very water resistant.  BUT this is unwearable.  Does not rub in - you will look like a white ghost.  Also, extremely greasy.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply. It doest not have a smell. And most important it has an EGW rating of 1.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the product, returned. Not sure what happened during the shipping, temperature changes or something else but I received product that is completely liquid (like water). I thought after some liquid the cream will come out but all that was coming out was water. When I shaked the tubes, it sounded like water (no cream) inside.</li>
    <li> Before Trukid, my wife would always harp on me to make sure our sons were covered head to toe in sunscreen before we went out to play at our neighborhood park. Now, our boys love to put it on themselves because it is so lightweight and they love the scent. But the best part is that I never have to worry about their protection from the sun, and my wife loves that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I feel this sunscreen works well and has less chemicals than others.  It is a little harder to rub in and leaves some white color on the skin if not rubbed in enough.</li>
    <li> Our family--my youngest son, especially--has very sensitive skin.  This is the only sunscreen that blocked the sun, didn&#x27;t break out our skin and didn&#x27;t sting our eyes.  And it is made without harsh or damaging chemicals, which is awesome.  It does need to be reapplied frequently--the back of the bottle says every 40 minutes--but if you aren&#x27;t towel-drying or pulling goggles on and off of your face (actions which will wipe off the sunscreen fairly easily and quickly, unfortunately), you may not need to reapply the sunscreen quite that often.  We spent a full day at a waterpark this summer in full sun (we look like vampires with our pale skin), reapplied this sunscreen faithfully every two hours, did not use our towels or goggles and no one got sunburned.  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> safest sunscreen on the market that does not have the bad chemicals that other sunblocks have</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off immediately upon entering the water.  I can tell it&#x27;s still on my skin even after swimming awhile.  It does a great job protecting from the sun, I have yet to burn with this sunscreen.</li>
