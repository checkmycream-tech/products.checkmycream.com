      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase and am glad that I did!  </li>
      <li>I love Acure products: clean ingredients, gluten-free, nice smell, quality, results and great price!</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very impressed with the way it has lightened the lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>How cool??!!</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s helping minimize my fine lines!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>like the Acure Night Cream a lot better as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this company and this product, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>but I used to LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it works better during the summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>do love their face oil serum</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>The company has decided to change the packaging from a pump top to a squeezable bottle.</li>
      <li>I love how this line of organic products was started to support breast cancer (read the story about Acure products on their website).</li>
      <li>Also love their body&lt;br /&gt;lotions</li>
      <li>I was expecting that this would be more moisturizing; it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just a terrifically satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay, but not going to purchase again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients (or lack of ingredients) in Acure products.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read ingredients before purchasing in case you know what you might be allergic to.</li>
      <li>I am able to save them money and get them a better product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more pleased with these results than any doctor assisted treatment for my acne or age prevention</li>
      <li>otherwise, makes my skin feel great and the ingredients seems high quality.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>Helps with the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
      <li>I love Acure&#x27;s ultimate collagen generating creme for its potent blend and its amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;One can&#x27;t find anything in the market that comes close to the quality and potency for this cost.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Happy, at last a product that lives up to the claims.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, natural, cheaper solution to wrinkles, but I would not assume or expect drastic results.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency and do feel a difference in my skin right away.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this in a health food store and knew after one use that I&#x27;d be purchasing this again.</li>
      <li>Nice texture, absorbs well, smelled okay, but the only difference to my skin was an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great underneath my other moisturizers ( using their Argon Oil over this is an essential&lt;br /&gt;daily treatment ---</li>
      <li>As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days</li>
      <li>They have multiple different stuff you can choose from and it is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
      <li>This particular product made me break out, however I am absolutely in love with the Day Cream, Night Cream and Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>But most importantly is if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  </li>
      <li>I recently learned about this brand and love their products!</li>
      <li>have some fine lines on my forehead that I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement on.</li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s reasonably priced, for such a good quality product.  </li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>In the mornings I use the sensitive facial cleanser in the shower (try the Cell Stimulating Body Wash - it smells AMAZING!), followed by the Oil Control Day lotion.</li>
      <li>It is quite a shame that such a good skin care line that promotes good health, good economies, and breast cancer awareness is compromised by such poor packaging.  </li>
      <li>My acne hit the road within a week or two of beginning the regimen, my dry skin is moisturized and the light wrinkles beginning to form around my eyes and mouth have magically receded.</li>
      <li>So glad I can enjoy some clear skin finally while staving off wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like acure better than origins for facial cleansers and  moisturizers</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing--even in the driest of winters!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve got normal/dry skin, expect to use a moisturizer on top of this, especially if you&#x27;re in a cooler, drier climate.</li>
      <li>Feels good on skin, not too heavy.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to purchase the other products that this company makes to indulge myself.  </li>
      <li>Not very crazy about this.</li>
      <li>Very clean and gentle enough to use as an eye cream.</li>
      <li>I can recommend this line for people with aging skin, acne skin, and super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  </li>
      <li>My face was super soft and seemed really moisturized.  </li>
      <li>bottle dispenses too much product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper here or at LuckyVitamin.com.</li>
      <li>60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream.</li>
      <li>Very sticky tacky if you will.</li>
      <li>really cannot handle chemicals or alcohol.</li>
      <li>I am hooked on this WHOLE line.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I use only natural skin care products, love this product line, but did not like this</li>
      <li>Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on nicely, but dries out your skin, like giving you a mask tightening feel not a cream feel.&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel like it did any age reversal or even compared well with other natural skincare</li>
      <li>I have only had this for a matter of weeks, so too early to say if it has a lasting impact on my fine lines, but I do that I love how soft my skin feels in the morning after using this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a minor difference in the fine wrinkles in my forehead and face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and gentle, moisturizes, and overall leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>This was the first all natural wrinkle cream I tried.</li>
      <li>Maintaining a healthy acid mantle (basically the proper skin ph balance) and topical probiotics were both ideas I had read about and felt held up to scientific scrutiny but had yet to find in a product until I found Acure.</li>
      <li>The product comes out white but goes on clear once you smooth it on your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I need to use the product a little longer to make a review.  I really like it so far.</li>
    <li> I love it and I notice subtle changes - my skin is incredibly soft and bright.  Just ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> I am fighting the signs of aging ... or at least trying!  I recently learned about this brand and love their products! I use this cream every night before bed. The cream is a little thicker but absorbs into my skin easily. I feel it&#x27;s helping minimize my fine lines!</li>
    <li> I love Acure products: clean ingredients, gluten-free, nice smell, quality, results and great price!</li>
    <li> I love this product... it&#x27;s such a wodnerful hydrating cream without being oily or heavy.  I have sensitive skin and have had no breakouts or problems with using this cream... maybe because it&#x27;s made of organic materials.  I also like that it&#x27;s reasonably priced, for such a good quality product.  I have thrown out my other brands and will be a loyal user of the Acure skincare line from now on.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to be great.  My face was super soft and seemed really moisturized.  However, it definitely made me break-out, so sadly I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> i like the product but not a huge fan of the scent.  turns me off a little bit.  otherwise, makes my skin feel great and the ingredients seems high quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 months. So far, I&#x27;m very impressed with the way it has lightened the lines around my eyes and mouth. It&#x27;s soft and gentle, moisturizes, and overall leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this in a health food store and knew after one use that I&#x27;d be purchasing this again. There are no harsh chemicals and I can see a difference in my skin...less fine lines and even skin tone. It&#x27;s much cheaper here or at LuckyVitamin.com. I love how this line of organic products was started to support breast cancer (read the story about Acure products on their website).</li>
    <li> I love this company and this product, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> I started using the Acure Organics line of products over two years ago and have seen significant results (i.e. elasticity, skin tone, decreased pore size, clear skin, etc.).  The Radical Wrinkle Complex cream is one of my favorites of the line.  I use the Radical Resurfacing Lotion in the morning and then the Radical Wrinkle Complex in the evening, along with the Brightening Scrub several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream contains an elevated percentage (5%) of Chorella Growth Factor (CGF) which gives your skin extra nourishment and rejuvenation.  I attended a workshop by Acure several years ago and their sales representative mentioned that she would recommend this moisturizer over any one in their brand as it contained 5% of the CGF where all of their other moisturizers only contain 2% or less giving you more bang for your buck.  CGF is one the richest sources of nucleic acids, a necessary ingredient of tissue renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff all the Acure products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice the anti wrinkle effects. It&#x27;s a very nice cream. Very clean and gentle enough to use as an eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has softened the appearance of the marionette lines and the &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34; line.  It is not botox but it does work and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product twice a day (at least) for over a month and have unfortunately not noticed any difference in fine lines and wrinkles. My problem areas are my forehead and around my eyes, and I was looking for a product for sensitive skin as mine really cannot handle chemicals or alcohol. I was eager to try the product and was disappointed with no change in wrinkles; however, it does act as an effective moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and softens any rough areas on my face.</li>
    <li> I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  I was so pleased to find wonderful products without all the chemicals at a great price.  I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice texture, absorbs well, smelled okay, but the only difference to my skin was an allergic reaction. Be sure to read ingredients before purchasing in case you know what you might be allergic to. I am not exactly sure because there are so many ingredients in these products.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! My wrinkles that had started are gone &amp; it has even lightened up my allergy dots under my eyes.</li>
    <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
    <li> I love Acure&#x27;s ultimate collagen generating creme for its potent blend and its amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;One can&#x27;t find anything in the market that comes close to the quality and potency for this cost.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great underneath my other moisturizers ( using their Argon Oil over this is an essential&lt;br /&gt;daily treatment --- each of these in tandem provide the collagen boosting and essential fatty&lt;br /&gt;acids needed for a beautiful complexion ).  This company is so dedicated to providing the&lt;br /&gt;highest quality ingredients and donating proceeds to anti-cancer organizations.  So you&lt;br /&gt;contribute to charities while doing the best thing for your complexion.  Also love their body&lt;br /&gt;lotions that use the complex fruit blend in their formulas.  A wonderful line.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy but I used to LOVE this stuff. Purchased it as a general moisturizer for my entire face and neck. I applied it generously because it was so much less expensive than what I used before, Jurlique. The last two times I&#x27;ve bought this, it smelt distinctively different. I went to my local health food store to check their stock of Acure and it was the same smell, cheap, chemical-ish or something. My sister still had an older tube of the product that I had given her as a gift last year. I compared the smell of each to confirm my suspicion. Long story short, I returned it. Not saying the smell makes the product work any less well but I just wasn&#x27;t happy putting it on anymore.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good cream which provides moisture, but it did nothing for my wrinkles at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product line for almost a year now and find that I can no longer justify the cost and aggravation of getting the last 1/4 of the product out of the bottle!  It is quite a shame that such a good skin care line that promotes good health, good economies, and breast cancer awareness is compromised by such poor packaging.  If they change the packaging, I would perhaps return to buying it.</li>
    <li> Not very crazy about this. Have seen no improvement in skin. Very sticky tacky if you will. Just doesn&#x27;t sink in. Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Happy, at last a product that lives up to the claims.  Makes your skin feel gorgeous and I am&lt;br /&gt;never using anything else.</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin, not too heavy. I like the smell. The price is right and I need very little.</li>
    <li> I use only natural skin care products, love this product line, but did not like this cream.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle dispenses too much product so you waste or overuse a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely, but dries out your skin, like giving you a mask tightening feel not a cream feel.&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel like it did any age reversal or even compared well with other natural skincare creams.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay, but not going to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love their face oil serum - It is great!!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 10 days and it is unbelievable the difference in my skin!  I have had issues with other pure or organic skin cream and have tried all of the well-known brands.  One day while shopping in the beauty section, they were advertising and giving small samples.  I decided to purchase and am glad that I did!  I am thrilled to purchase the other products that this company makes to indulge myself.  Hoping to find out if the shampoo &amp; conditioner are just as wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like acure better than origins for facial cleansers and  moisturizers</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients (or lack of ingredients) in Acure products. I love the day cream but felt like I needed something a little stronger so began using this a few weeks ago. I love the consistency and do feel a difference in my skin right away. Very moisturizing--even in the driest of winters!</li>
    <li> I did not see results like I had with other creams purchased. This was the first all natural wrinkle cream I tried. It did leave my skin non greasy though and has a pleasant smell. So it&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> A local market began carrying Acure and had it all on sale to entice people to try it. I was impressed with the ingredients and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve had acne for about 15 years and while I had figured out that diet was causing the majority of my problems (get your food allergies tested!) I still had 1 or 2 zits at any given time and wanted to get over that last hurdle to clear skin. Maintaining a healthy acid mantle (basically the proper skin ph balance) and topical probiotics were both ideas I had read about and felt held up to scientific scrutiny but had yet to find in a product until I found Acure. I have been using Acure cleansing and moisturizing products since the beginning of April, and have watched my skin improve in every way imaginable. My acne hit the road within a week or two of beginning the regimen, my dry skin is moisturized and the light wrinkles beginning to form around my eyes and mouth have magically receded. I&#x27;m more pleased with these results than any doctor assisted treatment for my acne or age prevention i have received!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the facial cleansing gel at night to remove make-up, followed by the radical wrinkle cream (preceded by Marula Oil, radical resurfacing, or acne lotions as needed). In the mornings I use the sensitive facial cleanser in the shower (try the Cell Stimulating Body Wash - it smells AMAZING!), followed by the Oil Control Day lotion. My make-up doesn&#x27;t slide off, ball up, or get otherwise odd and my face hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 18. So glad I can enjoy some clear skin finally while staving off wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these products has made me break out and none of them are overly smelly - except the shower wash but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger post shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I&#x27;m in no way affiliated with Acure and I bought all the products I&#x27;ve talked about - no freebies for this gal. I&#x27;m just a terrifically satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a matter of weeks, so too early to say if it has a lasting impact on my fine lines, but I do that I love how soft my skin feels in the morning after using this.</li>
    <li> I was expecting that this would be more moisturizing; it&#x27;s not. If you&#x27;ve got normal/dry skin, expect to use a moisturizer on top of this, especially if you&#x27;re in a cooler, drier climate. This may be perfect for oily skin. Perhaps it works better during the summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some fine lines on my forehead that I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement on. Granted, I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two weeks. I think you&#x27;re better using something with glycolic acid a few times a week to make your skin less wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that Acure is cruelty free and isn&#x27;t full of crazy chemicals (but maybe the crazy chemicals will keep the wrinkles away a little longer)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Acure Night Cream a lot better as a moisturizer. I feel that helped with plumping up my lines during waking hours.</li>
    <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;INTRO&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Love Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products. As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days and that&#x27;s where Acure excels and makes their products exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;About 60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream. People often forget that our skin is our largest organ and we need to protect it just as we need to protect our internal organs. There are zero harmful ingredients in their line of products and they travel the globe in search for the highest quality ingredients.  Everything they make is free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives, mineral oil and artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a minor difference in the fine wrinkles in my forehead and face. I put it on my face at night after I wash with the Sensitive Facial Cleanser. This product does have a bit of an odd smell which may require some people to get use to. The product comes out white but goes on clear once you smooth it on your skin. It tends to dry fairly fast so be aware of that. However, I did find that it was a great moisturizer for my skin. My skin always felt very soft in the morning after using this product the night before. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, natural, cheaper solution to wrinkles, but I would not assume or expect drastic results. Overall this is a quality product and is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias./&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> christen cmust not have seen the new packaging. Don&#x27;t give up yet! The company has decided to change the packaging from a pump top to a squeezable bottle. The design allows for 100% usage. I am a bodycare buyer for a major health food store and we started seeing the new packaging before the end of Oct. 2012. I am hooked on this WHOLE line. I can recommend this line for people with aging skin, acne skin, and super sensitive skin. I have had little to no returns on this line, along with COUNTLESS WOMEN (ages 20 and up!)coming back to my store to find me and tell me how happy they are that I found them a product that replaces and surpasses their super expensive products. I am able to save them money and get them a better product. How cool??!!</li>
    <li> Love this face cream; it smells so good!! But most importantly is if you have sensitive skin this would be a product I would recommend for your face. It has taken me a long time to fine a product that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to because I have very sensitive skin. They have multiple different stuff you can choose from and it is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
    <li> This particular product made me break out, however I am absolutely in love with the Day Cream, Night Cream and Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> On my third box of this product. Love it! Helps with the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
    <li> This cream by Acure is wonderful! It is natural. I have been using the Radical Wrinkle Complex for about 6 months. I have noticed changes in not only the tone of my skin but my wrinkles are smoother.</li>
