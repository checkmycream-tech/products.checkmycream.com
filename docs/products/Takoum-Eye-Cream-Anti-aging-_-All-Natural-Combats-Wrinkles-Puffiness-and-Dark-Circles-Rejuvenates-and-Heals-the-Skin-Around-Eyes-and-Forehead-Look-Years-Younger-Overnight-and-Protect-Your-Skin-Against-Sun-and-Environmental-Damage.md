<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received in the mail fairly quickly and loved the product. Will suggest it to friends &amp; family</li>
    <li> Like the description, this stuff is really thick! I cant tell the long term effects of it yet, but it is really moisturizing! I don&#x27;t know if this will replace my regular stuff, but I do like it!</li>
    <li> I love trying new products and was super excited about giving this a try. I bought it because it says it helps with puffiness and dark circles which has always been an issue for me. I tried, I honestly did but I&#x27;m just not impressed. The jar is so unbelievably small and like others said, it was maybe half full at best. The smell isn&#x27;t great. I can only describe it as a minty petroleum jelly smell. It&#x27;s very thick and a little on the sticky side. I know that&#x27;s in the product description but was not quite what I expected. The directions say to apply water to your skin then put this on top to &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34; the moisture. The main ingredients are Petroleum jelly, lanolin and beeswax. If it &amp;#34;traps&amp;#34; moisture, I worry about clogged pours and breakouts since it isn&#x27;t breathable. I&#x27;m just not impressed. Wish I was. I just can&#x27;t honestly suggest someone else purchase this and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.  I notice results very quickly, like overnight quickly.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and I just started notice some undereye discoloration and crows feet coming in.  This took care of it right away within a week they were barely visible.  You only need a little tiny bit, but thats a good thing because the jar is very little.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a sample size because I tried it through Uber-zon but the amounts was very small.  But it works really well.  I guess you have to weigh what&#x27;s important to you.</li>
    <li> Great under eye cream. Truly seemed to turn bad the clock. Only just after a short period of time using it. Plus its all natural and brings down the puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is thick. It does take sometime to let my skin absorb. Once my skin absorb, it feels comfy. The only thing I would say is the size too small for the prize. Otherwise, I like it!</li>
    <li> Impressed with this product.  I saw results almost immediately. I am  in my 50 &#x27;s  and this product really reduces the bags under my eyes .  I will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Does not work on my skin. It&#x27;s really thick and hard to apply. It also breaks me out.</li>
    <li> This eye cream was not what I expected. The smell is kinda like a vapor rub. It is kinda thick . However a little bit does go a long way. It is very heavy. After a few days my eyes were not as puffy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and I have never had a clogged pore.  I can&#x27;t stand petroleum jelly and there is none I have ever seen in this product.  I smear it on every night and my skin always feels great in the morning and I never suffer from dryness in spite of being in the desert or dealing with heating issues in the winter.  It was also the only thing that helped my cousin with her shingles.  Wish it were a larger size.</li>
    <li> Very thick but feels nice on. The skin around my eyes feels SO smooth when I wake up!</li>
    <li> It does work on my under eye bags. It has a smell and a strong tingle. It is a small container.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and is using it consistantly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and rich.  Very small for the price.  Feels really good on your skin.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Small amount for the price. I followed the instructions and left my skin damp, then applied the lotion. It felt sticky on my skin, but eventually soaked in.</li>
    <li> I like it but will have to it for a longer time to give an accurate review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...As I age, I am becoming more aware of those crow&#x27;s feet by my eyes, so I was really hoping this was magic in a jar.  The jar is very small.  It is thick, and you put it on after wetting your skin, so it stays thick for awhile.  I have longer hair, so I found it getting sticky in the eye cream, so now I put it on a few hours before bedtime so it has time to sink in a bit before I lay down and can take my hair out of the pony tail.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement yet, and I don&#x27;t know if the cons will outweigh the pros, but I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
    <li> Really recommend this for use it at night. You can feel the different next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Just the size is smaller than I thought.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It does go on a little different. Follow the instructions and it&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and keeps the under eye bags down. Would definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to get this eye cream at a discount to try for my honest review.  I used it as directed and saw instant results.  I have been having trouble with sagging eyelids and crows feet.  I have been using everything on earth to correct this because I do not want to have any injections nor do I want surgery.  This product works.  I will re-order because I am completely sold on it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  It feels nice around the eyes. The only complaint I have is the size.... It is sample size.  There is very little product in this tiny case.</li>
    <li> I have started developing crows feet and fine lines around my eyes, and I figured i would try this to see what it could do. I like it because its a thicker product but you only need a little bit. It has deminished the look of the lines enough that I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with shipping but the company corrected it fast.  It&#x27;s a little thick but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really notice any results and the cream was so thick I felt like I was rubbing and dabbing way to much.&lt;br /&gt;I even moistened around the eye but it didn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> I love trying new beauty products but I was really disappointed with this one. For being so expensive it&#x27;s really tiny. I used as the directions stated but it smells like petroleum jelly and feels like it too. I was really expecting something different than this. After using up the entire jar I saw no noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.  Some creams I use are so light I felt like there was nothing there.  This however was really thick and creamy I really felt like it coated well. One draw back was the size of the jar. I went through a lot of the cream already.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just what I&#x27;m looking for in an eye cream. Extremely thick cream that sinks in to my skin. Small container but only need a small amount for each use.</li>
    <li> I use it as preventative against wrinkles rather than to smooth already existing ones, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s good for repairing damaged skin. I can say that it is a great moisturizer and I love the way it makes my skin soft around my eyes. It also has a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service by Beauty Strong is fantastic. I made a mistake in the shipping address, and they were more than willing to work with me, even though it was my fault.</li>
    <li> Great organic eye cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
