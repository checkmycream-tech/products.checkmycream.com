      <li>Just tried this combo pack and was more than pleased.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Also for the price, it keeps our hair smelling great, very soft, manageable and light weight feeling!</li>

      <li>This shampoo and conditioner is wonderful for my dry and wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I had a sample of the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; I had to get the full sizes!</li>
      <li>Speedy shipment and my items arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and the smell sticks around, it makes my hair soft, and it keeps my ginger vibrant.</li>

      <li>Once it arrived and I used it for the first time, I was so glad about my purchase.</li>
      <li>We were recommended by our salon stylist and let me say she was right!</li>
      <li>It smells great &amp; exactly the same as the salon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve finally found my all time favorite hair care products, both of which guarantee to be safe for my color treated hair, which is another important feature..</li>
      <li>Just at good as the last one.</li>
      <li>It came in quickly.</li>
      <li>It is paraben free and really work to smooth your hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, shinny and frizz Free!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>But, the Bain de Terre products were far and away better.</li>
      <li>The thing of it is that in the description here it says \\&quot;both liters with pumps\\&quot; right?</li>
      <li>so I am so pleased that this has a soft pretty smell.  </li>
      <li>These are very large bottles</li>
      <li>Smelled ok, but left hair kind of dry and unmanageable.</li>
      <li>My first use of these products was through my hairdresser.</li>

      <li>I gave the shampoo and conditionar a try for the first time last month by ordering it on Amazon and wasn&#x27;t too sure how I would like it.</li>
      <li>Moderately priced shampoo and conditioner with a lovely, not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great product and a great price (just a pain in the butt for someone whose hands don&#x27;t always work due to nerve issues to try to manipulate a large, wet bottle instead of just pushing on a pump).</li>
      <li>I tried several other brands to make sure none were better.</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers so well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like most shampoos do.</li>
      <li>Found it on line and purchased two of each (shamp/cond) of the large bottles.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and how it left my hair so soft!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I gave the shampoo and conditionar a try for the first time last month by ordering it on Amazon and wasn&#x27;t too sure how I would like it. Once it arrived and I used it for the first time, I was so glad about my purchase. Bain de Terre has new packaging and pumps that make the bottles so much easier to use. The shampoo lathers so well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like most shampoos do. And the great flowery scent stays in my hair for a couple of days after washing my hair. :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner for my fine (and highlighted) hair!</li>
    <li> great shampoo smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo and conditioner. I live in high humidity. I wash my hair a lot&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Order arrived without the pumps. That&#x27;s why I purchased this set. 😐</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great service</li>
    <li> Love it - hair is healthy and I swear my color lasts longer with this shampoo</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for color treated hair.  I love how it makes my hair feel.  Does not weigh down my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product from my local salon. I used a different color care shampoo/conditioner for years. I was told that my color treated hair would last longer. I thought why not try it, so I did! I have now made the switch! I love the smell of the shampoo, as well as the quality of the product. You don&#x27;t need much of the shampoo either, a little goes a long ways! I would buy this product again, and again!!</li>
    <li> Color treated or not, hands down best shampoo ever</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells AMAZING and it makes my hair shiny and soft. I highly recommend it! Also, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good price for how much you get. I can&#x27;t wait to try one of the other products!</li>
    <li> I could find these in the salon I use now. Great quality</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this so I just knew I&#x27;d love it. It smells great &amp; exactly the same as the salon so I know it&#x27;s the real stuff but at home it dries my hair out so bad. Guess I&#x27;ll stick with the stuff I love.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!!!  It&#x27;s amazing and a great value!!!!</li>
    <li> shampoo and conditioner used by all the girls in the house.</li>
    <li> Ad says it came with the pumps for both bottles. It did not come with any pumps. These are very large bottles</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my extremely thick Latina hair.  I hate how most color safe shampoos smell like chemicals so I am so pleased that this has a soft pretty smell.  I will definitely reorder and unlike other reviews mine came with the pumps.</li>
    <li> Conditioner fabulous !!!! Can feel hair shaft shrink like in Keritin Treatmeants!!!! Leaves hair soft, shinny and frizz Free! What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  I was always buying the smaller bottles.  Cannot beat this price for both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair smell great and look shiny! It is paraben free and really work to smooth your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price. The bottle leaked in the packaging &amp; pump was broken. I had to take the pump off &amp; now just pour the shampoo for every wash.</li>
    <li> Great Service and product!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner! Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying  samples sent to me in a gift package.  I have had a tough time finding hair products I really like.  The fact that there are no parabens  makes me feel even better about using these.  The problem has been that if I use products that leave an oily residue in an effort to &amp;#34;condition or control&amp;#34; your hair, that leads to a problem with oily scalp - These products don&#x27;t do that - yet they leave my hair shiny and the conditioner takes away the fly away ends.  I would definitely recommend these products.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they smell good also.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Love this product, but the page I ordered it from said they came with a pump... These did not:( feel mislead :((</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and the smell sticks around, it makes my hair soft, and it keeps my ginger vibrant. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, but since it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates in it that contribute to a luxurious lather, that&#x27;s not surprising. It gets the job done very without it.&lt;br /&gt;The four star rating is because it explicitly says the pumps are included and there were no pumps in the box. Other than that, great product and a great price (just a pain in the butt for someone whose hands don&#x27;t always work due to nerve issues to try to manipulate a large, wet bottle instead of just pushing on a pump).</li>
    <li> I like these but the shampoo weighs down my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it left my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase.  This shampoo and conditioner is wonderful for my dry and wavy hair.  Speedy shipment and my items arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair feels and smells amazing after I use it.  My only complaint is that this says it comes with pumps and it didn&#x27;t have any :(</li>
    <li> love, love, love the fragrance of these products!  I have VERY tangle prone hair &amp; this conditioner does a pretty good job at alleviating those nasty tangles.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and according to my stylist I got a great deal on Amazon!! The texture of my hair is so much smoother and the highlights have not faded a bit!  This is an excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these products in cute little travel bottles so I stuck them away for my next trip.  Wow.  I was so impressed.  It left my hair feeling soft, shiny, easy to manage and it kept the frizz down.  (I have thick, naturally curly, color treated hair).  My only complaint is with myself in that I stuck the samples in my travel bag and didn&#x27;t use them until 3 months after I received them.  I came home from vacation and immediately ordered the shampoo and conditioner from Amazon.  The pumps came with the product.  I refilled those cute little travel bottles and now I&#x27;m ready for the next vacation!</li>
    <li> Great for my color treated, fine hair. The best shampoo and conditioner I have found to date. I&#x27;ve tried so many too. This does not weigh your hair down. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> My first use of these products was through my hairdresser. I liked them so much, I asked her to get them in and resell them to me. I tried several other brands to make sure none were better. All of them were &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34;, professional products. But, the Bain de Terre products were far and away better. First, if my hair was more oily, I only needed one application of shampoo which kept the suds going the entire time I scrubbed. Others would give out and the suds would disappear. So, that was a major PLUS. And, the conditioner was actually a recent addition. I&#x27;ve used it about 2 times, and what I love is that you also don&#x27;t need a lot to make your hair manageable and easy to style. So, all in all, I&#x27;m set for life now. I&#x27;ve finally found my all time favorite hair care products, both of which guarantee to be safe for my color treated hair, which is another important feature.. Thank you Bain de Terre ... I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I decided to switch shampoo and conditioner after using Wen for about a year. I loved what I was using but it was kind of pricey so I looked into less expensive options. After reading reviews on Bain de Terre Passion Flower shampoo and conditioner, I decided to give it a try. I do have to say that it kept my color and highlights looking good but it dried my hair out so badly. My hair dresser even commented on how dry my hair was compared to normal and I told her I had switched shampoos. It smells ok but my hair was always a tangled mess after shampooing and conditioning with this prodcut. I hate to just throw it away but I don&#x27;t think I can use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Its a great shampoo and conditioner. It came in quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the greates shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.  Won&#x27;t be without it and a back-up in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells so good and leaves my hair so soft will buy this product again when needed.</li>
    <li> Just at good as the last one.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo/conditioner</li>
    <li> This kit does wonders for my Mothers and I&#x27;s hair! We were recommended by our salon stylist and let me say she was right! Also for the price, it keeps our hair smelling great, very soft, manageable and light weight feeling! We don&#x27;t even have to use a lot as well! We had it for about 2 months now and we both have very long medium weight hair. Would buy again! LOVE Bain De Terre products!!</li>
    <li> I had a sample of the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; I had to get the full sizes! This product leaves my colored hair feeling silky &amp; soft !</li>
    <li> Love how soft it leaves my hair and a nice fragrance. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Product was correct size, but pumps were not included as advertised. &amp;#34;Both liter with Pump!! Bain de Terre Passion Flower Color PShampoo &amp;cond 33.8 oz&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing this out. Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft. Smelled ok, but left hair kind of dry and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> Moderately priced shampoo and conditioner with a lovely, not overpowering scent. My salon uses these products and my naturally wavy hair loves them!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo. The smell of this product is great without being overpowering and everyone comments on how good my hair smells. I also love the way that this makes my hair feel. IT makes it smooth and soft. The reason I give this four instead of five stars is because I find after about a week of using this I need to use a stripping shampoo to make it work 100% again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when my hair stylest used it on me in the salon.  Makes my hair healthy even though I color it.  Great price on line as well.</li>
    <li> The pump on the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried to fix it and nothing will come out of it. I&#x27;m not sure what to do</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for color treated hair.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your color.  I have very fine, thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  The smell is great and it rinses out quick.  Ordering a big size is very economical.</li>
    <li> Just tried this combo pack and was more than pleased. I&#x27;m always going to be a Deva Curl person, but I decided to give this a try and I must say, I was forced to make room in my bathroom to keep a permanent spot for this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!  I bought it at a solon after getting my hair colored and loved it.  Found it on line and purchased two of each (shamp/cond) of the large bottles.</li>
    <li> . I was unable to find this certain shampoo and conditioner at local stores. I got my product from Choice Warehouse Inc. They were quick on senting it and the product was great with a price no one could beat. I would definately use them again and recommend them to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair soft and shinny. It also hold your color longer. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> great products; I have been using them for a long-long time.  Great value as well; I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair so shiny and soft. I love it! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The whole reason I bought this product was because it stated that the bottles come with pumps! Well guess what! I had NO PUMPS I was quite mad, so mad that If I weren&#x27;t out of shampoo I would had sent it back! The thing of it is that in the description here it says \\&quot;both liters with pumps\\&quot; right? Yes. But on my order form inside the box it was printed just like what follows \\&quot;Without pumps!\\&quot; sorry but I am quite pissed about that. I won&#x27;t be ordering from this seller again however the shampoo and conditioner itself is wonderful, more wonderful with a pump!</li>
