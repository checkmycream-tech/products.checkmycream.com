    <li> This cream does wonders for my hands. It&#x27;s unscented and hypoallergenic, but I bought 3--keep 1 at home, 1 at work and carry 1 in my purse. I had really bad eczema with cracking and now it is nearly gone. I have to wash my hands a lot as part of my occupation, which made the eczema worse, but now I apply this after washing and it does wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the best  moisturizer EVER! My GP recommended a few years ago for dry skin and It is far better than lotions or other moisturizers on the market.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin, this is the best hypoallergenic, scent free cream for face and body!</li>
    <li> I have sensitivity to lotions and creams and find that they make my eyes red even though they are nowhere near my eyes when applied to my hands. I guess it evaporates over time and, as I write on paper or type, I get the evaporation rising to my eyes and there they go, burning and red... This stuff does not do that and works very well. Great for winter skin splitting.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for dry skin that is unscented and won&#x27;t clog pores. It was recommended for my daughter that has acne by her dermatologist. I am in love with it myself for Winter dryness.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my dermatologist years ago.  It is very good for dry skin or after shaving.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is getting the last ounce of cream out.  The tube makes it impossible to get everything out.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended DML Forte, and it is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used for restoring moisture to dry irritated hands. The tube available on Amazon fits easily in my purse, so I carry it with me all the time and use it every time I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist insisted I use this as my night cream.  I have rosacea and some adult acne and it was getting worse.  Switched to this years ago and have not regretted it.  Moisturizes while you sleep. Great for sensitive skin.  I used to be able to get it at the drug store but now I was having to have it special ordered every time I ran out.  Finding this 3-pack on amazon was a great time- and money-saver.</li>
    <li> Dr recommended at an EXCELLANT price..</li>
    <li> Perfect cream. Recommended by our dermatologist for my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> cream arrived as expected; I had ordered it before; there were no surprises; thought box was too large and wasteful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for years since it was recommended by a dermatologist. It&#x27;s rich and creamy without feeling greasy. I use it morning and night, and use no other facial moisturizer except coconut oil occasionally. It&#x27;s fragrance-free. I bought some for my sister and she loved it, too. Can&#x27;t say enough about this amazing moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years but find it almost impossible to find in retail stores. When I do I buy whatever I can get my hands on. Great product - best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream....especially if you have sensitive skin, roscea etc....</li>
    <li> Every year I get split/cracks in finger tips, not since using this every morning.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sooo happy!</li>
    <li> The very best skin cream I have ever used. My dermatologist recommends and sell this product, but, his price is way too high. The 3 pack is perfect so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cream for face and all over body moisturizer.  It has staying power and is not greasy. I  gave up my expensive name-brand moisturizers because this cream is far better at less the cost.</li>
    <li> I love the product,but I hate the fact that the tube looks like it hold a decent amount, but it is only half full.I feel like I am cheated each time.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down (pardon the intentional pun) the best product for dry skin on hands and feet.  There is no strong odor like some others and, most importantly, IT WORKS!  Lots of hand washing in the Winter results not only in dry skin, but itching (hot spots) and itchy and sometimes painful cracking.  This can all be prevented by using the DML Forte cream twice daily.  It is worth the cost and is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve used to preserve the skin on my hands through daily use, and even prevent drying/scaling of the skin on my heels.</li>
    <li> A determatologist recommended this moisturizer to me and I have been using it for years. It works great. My face feels wonderful. It never makes my skin feel oily in the summer and it prevents my face from getting chapped in the winter. It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
