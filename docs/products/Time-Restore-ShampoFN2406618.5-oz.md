    <li> i am 29 and do not have brittle or aging hair.  however, my hair is straight and kind of flat.  this shampoo and also the spray in conditioner have added volume, thickness, shine, and smoothness.  i would highly reccommend!!</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING shampoo; I love the conditioner too.  Great for fine hair.  It transforms your hair into healthy hair with body.</li>
    <li> Great product and just what I ordered. It arrived on time and I would definitely order this product again.  Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo a lot!  I am older and have thinning hair, although I do not have bald spots, less hair is a special concern for a me... I would like to keep what I have and this shampoo seems to do the trick...My husband is a fan also....  This product is not always so easy to find. I am sold!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Conditions and makes your hair shine like no other i have used. The Best Shampoo around!</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter tell me this is a great product. And the price is very, very low - about 50% off what it is thru her hairdresser (BTW she has gone to the same woman since 1980!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly and arrived in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They rated this product a 9.5 out of 10 with the price being a perfect 10!. They highly recommend this product&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo...my daughter-in-law loves it...my son&#x27;s girlfriend loves it!!! Leaves your hair feeling great!  makes a great gift for birthdays &amp; Christmas!</li>
    <li> My mom is 93 and has fine white hair. All of her friends comment on how shiny this leaves her hair. She loves it !</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and my hairdresser a while ago and loved it. Didn&#x27;t want to go to my hairdresser to buy it and found it online. It is a great shampoo and my husband loves it. The delivery was fast and the product as the same as showed at the seller&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo. Makes my thin gray hair thicker and got rid of the yellow. I don&#x27;t need to use the purple shampoo anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this line of hair products. I have fine, limp hair so need all the help I can get!</li>
    <li> It made my hair go more dry</li>
    <li> Works great on fine hair. Gives volume and soft texture.</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> This shampoo, while giving fullness, also leaves my fine hair rather dry and, by the second day, frizzy. I color my hair and do not wash it every day. Not a bad shampoo but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for older hair. It restores shine &amp; body. I swear it has helped my husband keep more of his. But then that could be my imagination. It is difficult to find here so I am very happy to find it!</li>
    <li> As a long time stylist, I have used a variety of products over the years.  Few shampoos have any real added qualities beyond just cleansing the strands.  This shampoo is not only excellent for mature, fragile hair but is phenomenal on color, highlighted, and works great with Keratin Smoothing treated hair.  As a multi-cultural stylist, it works wonders with black hair both relaxer treated and natural that has instilled frizziness.  Immediate results felt, added silkiness with continued use.  Try it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smell that it&#x27;s special and I like it. It makes my hail soft and smooth. I would like try other products but in the same brand.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible item! I honestly do not believe it was a real product, I believe it was a knockoff! I used it on my hair 3 times and my scalp would not stop itching!!! I was a hot mess for about a week until I could clear it out!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.  My hair may even be more fly-away than with my usual L&#x27;oreal blond shampoo.  This is what I found about Q-10 and hair on webmd:  &amp;#34;Some people think coenzyme Q-10 will treat hair loss related to taking warfarin (Coumadin), a medication used to slow blood clotting.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s not me.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, but can&#x27;t use it every day as it seems to build up on my hair.  I alternate it with another favorite.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just amazing! The minute you start lathering it in your scalp, you can already feel the difference in your hair. It becomes immediately smooth, alive, moistured and feels so healthy! It detangles your hair just as you rinse it off! My mother rushed to get her a bottle after trying mine only once!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shampoo.  Cleans my hair but leaves it feeling very dry.  Have to use a lot of conditioner afterward.</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf shampoos are my go to choices when others I&#x27;ve tried just don&#x27;t cut it. I have sensitive scalp and lots of thin curly hair. I keep trying to find something new and different but always keep this product on hand if another one bites the dust.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  One of the very best smelling product lines- the shampoo and conditioner are both great! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Indicators that this product is FAKE:&lt;br /&gt;1. Consistency &amp; appearance&lt;br /&gt;- real: is thick and glossy&lt;br /&gt;- fake: dull and somewhat runny&lt;br /&gt;2. Packaging&lt;br /&gt;- real: is text and graphics are imprinted on bottle&lt;br /&gt;- fake: is a sticker&lt;br /&gt;3. Lather&lt;br /&gt;- real: minimal lather&lt;br /&gt;- fake: lots of lather&lt;br /&gt;The fake is more like Pantene. Please BEWARE this is fake product!</li>
    <li> I agree with alex...just opened my bottle as I had several bottles on hand that I purchased from my salon...this is a fake...There was so much lather and suds that the real product does not produce...also,my scap itches...it lathers as much as dish soap or a cheap shampoo. same color but not the same product...save your money and buy from a reputable dealer. wish I did not have to give it even one star...buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Great smoothing shampoo!  However, the conditioner does nothing for me, so I use this shampoo with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Mask.  Nice combo.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I first bought it as a special promotion many years back.  It has the most delicious scent (mild but soo clean smelling).  I noticed that after using this as I got out of the shower, my extremely long and tangle-prone hair was easy to comb through, felt softer, and looked silkier and smoother.  Absolutely recommend this!</li>
