<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality, good price!</li>
    <li> Nice range of oils and well worth it for quality</li>
    <li> Started playing with essential oils and wanted to try a variety of carrier oils. This was perfect. Just the perfect size for trying which carrier oil you like.</li>
    <li> Nice carrier oils, especially in the bath</li>
    <li> Great Product. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried all 5 and the scents are not over powering. Makes your skin very soft and moisturizers added bonus to the effect of you EO.</li>
    <li> Quality product, great variety. I use the coconut oil alone. I find that almond oil  works well as a carrier oil or on its on. None of them have over powering scents. can be used with essential oils, for massage, or to moisturize hair skin and cuticles. i would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love having all the different carriers in one pack for me to try and also to understand the differences in each one!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for baby massage</li>
    <li> Love these! Bought them to try making homemade lotions. I absolutely love every single one of them, but they shine for different uses. Avo and coco are best for hands, almond and apricot are great for all over body, grape seed is super light and really nice for massage.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> um....I don&#x27;t know if these are actually pure oils?  They sure smell and taste and look an awful lot alike....hmmmmmm</li>
    <li> The perfect size bottles for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of carrier oils to experiment with, since I am relatively new to essential oil uses.</li>
    <li> These are great for someone not sure yet which oil they like. They&#x27;re great sizes for storage so you won&#x27;t have a bunch of huge bottles on your shelf. I love them and I can see myself buying this again.</li>
    <li> Over promoted and over processed. A good carrier oil should never be processed till it&#x27;s colorless. There is very little if any quality and value left in these over processed oils. Example: virgin olive oil is green. None of these are as dark as they appear in the ad. They arrived clear. All five.</li>
    <li> Excellent group of carrier oils.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these to experiment with different oils to use with my essential oils. They came sealed, bagged 3 times to ensure they were safe. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these with my essential oils. I like having a variety of carrier oils and these are just the right size.</li>
    <li> The only one I&#x27;ve used so far is the avocado oil.  I blend it with my essential oils to make them go further. I am pleased with the value.</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT Purchase!!  thank you</li>
    <li> Great Product and service would recommend to anyone. Thank U</li>
    <li> I bought these in order to decide which I liked best.  They are all nice but I prefer Grapeseed Carrier Oil and now I buy the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> I like these. When I bought them I did so because I wanted carrier oil options. Now that they&#x27;re here I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever get through them all. Which, I suppose is not really a problem. Just kind of wished I would have bought one or two bottles to start. So far no problems with them. I have really sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no irritation. The label says that they have aromas but I couldn&#x27;t smell anything. It will be a while before I buy more just because I have to get through what I have.</li>
    <li> Love them all...don&#x27;t know which one to try next.</li>
    <li> Wonderful variety pack. I am just starting with essential oils and this has been great.</li>
    <li> A very good package. Useful for around Eyes, skin, and face and the best part is all natural.</li>
    <li> Great if you like half of it leaked out when you get it</li>
    <li> Have been using these carrier oils for some time now and really love the brand.  Quality and is nice to have the option of a multipack, carriers stay fresh since they are used quickly and so many options to make bath salts and rubs and creams.</li>
    <li> All of the oils in this set seem to be of high quality.  Though we would likely not purchase this set again, we would purchase individual oils offered by this supplier under this brand name.  It is a great way to try different carrier oils to help you decide which ones you might want to use regularly.</li>
    <li> Awesome really love these</li>
    <li> Awesome starter pack.  I have enjoyed using the oils for many essential oil projects.  Will buy again, only in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel and essential oils</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great product for natural hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for anyone trying to make their own products (like lotions, shampoos, soaps, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle comes sealed and remember- they are each 4oz.  For me, that was a great size but go find a 4oz bottle and see if it&#x27;s going to be enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;None of the oils smell particularly strong.  If you&#x27;re using essential oils with them then you won&#x27;t notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good starting point.</li>
    <li> Great scents and the oil feels like silk. Packaging was excellent.</li>
    <li> Awesome selection for the beginner essential oiler.</li>
    <li> Great variety pack. I was somewhat new to using EOs and this was a great way for me to experiment with different carrier oils.</li>
    <li> Love these. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good way to try different carrier oils without spending a fortune.</li>
    <li> I really like these oils and find them very soothing and the price for the product was a  real deal.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I wanted to try carrier oils and this seemed a good fit as it has a variety of oils to try. Came perfectly packaged, no leaking oil from any of the bottles and the bottles themselves are nice quality. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Good oils, nice to be able to get a variety pack. Bottles are small but you really don&#x27;t use much at a time anyway. If you are somewhat new to using essential oils like I am, this is a good way to try several different oils without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> These oils are perfect for use as a carrier oil with my Young Living essential oils.</li>
    <li> These oils were purchased to use in combination with some essential oils. None of the oils have a noticeable fragrance, I suppose I was hoping that they did, thus the 4-star rating. The oils are supposed to be pure and fractionated (whatever that means), I&#x27;m definitely glad about the pure aspect.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oils at a reasonable price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great Price and Great Product!! Plant Guru made ordering base oils so easy - I really like the combination pack and have enjoyed learning the differences of each base oil.</li>
    <li> Great quality product</li>
    <li> Very happy with this selection of oils for what I needed</li>
    <li> OILS GOT HERE SAFE, AND IN PERFECT CONDICTION! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I use them all. I love each one of them</li>
    <li> I really like this sampler.</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I wanted in the right size bottles. they came so quickly.</li>
    <li> Good collection, all have their place for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great set of carriers! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> THe Carrier OIl Variety pack is a great assortment of the Carrier oils used to dilute the essential oils. This is a good way to purchase a variety to see which ones you like best. The down side is that some of these carrier oils go rancid rather quickly. So, if you purchase this set, make sure you review the different oils, first, before you purchase the set. You may not use the oils as quickly as you need to, in order to keep them from going rancid.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my oils, I use them to mix with essential oils for just about everything!</li>
    <li> I would definitely purchase this selection of carrier oils again. I love them all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sampling carrier oils. I use these in my essential oil roller blends. It gave me the opportunity to sample each oil, so that I know what works/feels best on my skin. Now I know which ones to order more of!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful starter pack of oils. They are the perfect size and all the oils are great. I love them.</li>
    <li> Bottles leak after the seal is broke.</li>
    <li> I love these carrier oils to use with my favorite essential oils !</li>
    <li> Great oils for a great price.  Nice way to try them all.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal if you want to try a lot of different carrier oils. I love that I can choose which one will work best with my skin. You honestly can&#x27;t beat the price, especially if you are new to this like I am and want to try a lot of different stuff.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my family&#x27;s day-to-day use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> They are amazing! Exactly what I needed and perfect pricing!</li>
    <li> These oils are excellent. I love the variety. The price is right too.</li>
    <li> Love these oils!  Have used all of them either as a carrier oil or mixed in a scrub or moisturizer - love them all!  Highly recommend this set if you aren&#x27;t sure what you&#x27;d like to use.  You don&#x27;t get too much of anything and it will help you decide which oil you would like to purchase more of!</li>
    <li> These have come in handy, a little smaller then i expected but overall still good.</li>
    <li> Thank you! After I received my carrier oils I wished I&#x27;d bought 2 sets! Excellent quality</li>
    <li> Great way to sample various oils and use to create your own blends.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> very nice quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Fist carrier oils I&#x27;ve purchases, but they seem to be high quality.  I&#x27;ve mixed them with Shea Butter, Mango Butter and Cocoa Butter.  They all came out pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about these products being 100% organic oils.  When I compare them with my NOW products, they don&#x27;t share the same consistency or aroma.</li>
