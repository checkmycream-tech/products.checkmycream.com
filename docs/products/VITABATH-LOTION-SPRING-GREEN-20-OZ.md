      <li>you will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the fresh fragrance of Vitabath.  </li>
      <li>Original spring green smells so good and is a good body lotion as well ..</li>
      <li>Lotion is so smooth and clean felling..</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need much and the fragrance is just as potent as it is in the gelee.  </li>
      <li>Still, she&#x27;s happy with it, and she says it makes an old lady&#x27;s skin really soft</li>
      <li>Dries fairly quick and doesn&#x27;t leave you with greasy hands.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed quickly in the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
      <li>Back then, there wasn&#x27;t a companion lotion, which I would have loved as much as the gelee.  </li>
      <li>My husband who rarely even notices the scent of my perfumes always says I smell nice after my daily baths.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t read the description right.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy with the fragrance, thought it would be the original Vitabath smell, not to heavy does feel nice but not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>Being able to buy it this way is definitely a plus.</li>
      <li>I lost access to this product when local stores stopped stocking it and was so glad to restore my ability to buy (on line,) and use it again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a terrific value--MUCH better than some of the products for which you spend mega-bucks to receive just an ounce or two.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve showered with this product for many years after discovering a similar product in Europe in the 70s.  </li>
      <li>I just love the Original Spring Green Body Lotion and Bath Gel.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I tried shaming him by saying it&#x27;s really for women[it&#x27;s not]-</li>
      <li>and it is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is fresh and crisp with a hint of lemon and lime and other wonderful green scents, like fresh mowed hay and green leaves.  </li>
      <li>Spring Green is a classic--fresh, crisp, and clean!</li>
      <li>The Spring Green is a light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Instantly absorbed - just be careful you like the scent as it is strong and although fades quickly can interfere with more expensive perfumes.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Finding my favored Lotion in stores is difficult.</li>
      <li>If you want soft radiant skin and love fresh, green scents, then the original spring green formula is a must have.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
      <li>Smells old or something added to it?</li>
      <li>Called the direct company</li>
      <li>I first came across the Vitabath green gelee in the 80s when my first roommate received a bottle as a gift.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Vitabath for decades and the new lotion is not the same fragrance.</li>
      <li>Calms me right down.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure the fragrance lasts at least a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Vitabath Spring Green body lotion for the last few years and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>It cleans very well without excessive bubbles or foam, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft - even in hard water.  </li>

<li> Seriously.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is NOT the same scent I purchased a while back - it is not a nice scent at all - not like the body wash I purchased from a different vendor.  I will be ordering the correct one and this is in the trash.  Too bad I bought the large one - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  Smells like a cedar sauna and cleans well.  Aromatherapy at its best.  Luxurious and spa like.</li>
    <li> Great product, service was also fine.  I have ordered before and will order this product again.  Excellent mositurizer, smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I lost access to this product when local stores stopped stocking it and was so glad to restore my ability to buy (on line,) and use it again.  So is my skin! Not greasy but an effective moisturizer.  Instantly absorbed - just be careful you like the scent as it is strong and although fades quickly can interfere with more expensive perfumes.</li>
    <li> Great price on a reliable product</li>
    <li> Order error and wrong product sent, returned on Nov.11, as of Jan 1 they&#x27;ve not received it, have called twice.  Sent priority mail, insured and return receipt, going to check with p.o. TOMORROW.   Rest of products from them were fine. American RX, I think</li>
    <li> I just love the Original Spring Green Body Lotion and Bath Gel.   I always feel that I am back in the mountains, that is why I love it.  I also love the way my skin feels after using it. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> You have to at least try this product. I have been using it for years and it works wonders. The Vitabath Bath Gel is an incredible product as well.</li>
    <li> We have been buying this for years.     My husband uses it more than me.           I tried shaming him by saying it&#x27;s really for women[it&#x27;s not]- but he said he does&#x27;nt care.        Claims it \\&quot;refreshes\\&quot; him. Whatever!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other review that stated it is not the same as it used to be. I have been using Vitabath for decades and the new lotion is not the same fragrance. It has a faint similarity but as stated by manufacturer, the formula has been changed. I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on like liquid silk and keeps your skin hydrated. The Spring Green is a light and fresh scent. It is absorbed quickly in the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find.  It smells very fresh and clean. It can be unisex. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitabath Spring Green body lotion for the last few years and absolutely love it! It absorbs well and softens my skin throughout the entire day (and night).  I use it almost exclusively as a facial moisturizer, and it works wonderfully under makeup. It&#x27;s also a terrific value--MUCH better than some of the products for which you spend mega-bucks to receive just an ounce or two. And the fragrance!?!  Spring Green is a classic--fresh, crisp, and clean!</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for over 30 years.  I first came across the Vitabath green gelee in the 80s when my first roommate received a bottle as a gift.  When she used it, the entire bathroom smelled wonderful.  She did permit me to use it occasionally and I absolutely loved it.  The fragrance is fresh and crisp with a hint of lemon and lime and other wonderful green scents, like fresh mowed hay and green leaves.  There&#x27;s simply nothing else like it.  Back then, there wasn&#x27;t a companion lotion, which I would have loved as much as the gelee.  I purchased a set of gelee and lotion at Ulta a few months ago and I was very happy to discover that I still loved the scent.  It&#x27;s very hydrating so you don&#x27;t need much and the fragrance is just as potent as it is in the gelee.  I really love the combo of gelee and lotion and I&#x27;m pretty sure the fragrance lasts at least a few hours.  And my entire bathroom smells wonderful, lol!  I definitely recommend both the gelee and the lotion.  If you want soft radiant skin and love fresh, green scents, then the original spring green formula is a must have.  They are holy grail products for me.</li>
    <li> I hope RichBrands never stops making Vitabath Original!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. Dries fairly quick and doesn&#x27;t leave you with greasy hands.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the fresh fragrance of Vitabath.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found the soap and the body lotion.  I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I meant to order the bath gel for my mother, but bought this instead. Still, she&#x27;s happy with it, and she says it makes an old lady&#x27;s skin really soft (she&#x27;s 93).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. unfortunately it has become somewhat expensive so I treat myself from time to time. I was entertaining house guests and I thought this would be a nice treat for them. the aroma is wonderful. you will enjoy it. it&#x27;s an oldie but a goodie!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest smelling lotion (the shower gel is great too!) and it is very moisturizing.  Love it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful, nice for xmas presents</li>
    <li> Original spring green smells so good and is a good body lotion as well ..I have the shower gel too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitabath in my bath and as an after-bath moisturizer for decades but it disappeared from my local stores. Amazon came to my rescue. I don&#x27;t bathe without it and I find the fragrance very refreshing. My husband who rarely even notices the scent of my perfumes always says I smell nice after my daily baths.</li>
    <li> Smells old or something added to it?</li>
    <li> I typed in what I wanted to buy. It came up on the screen . I placed my order and I received it promptly. Finding my favored Lotion in stores is difficult.Being able to buy it this way is definitely a plus. I will recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> I wanted a refill of the really great pine-scented lotion I&#x27;m running out of.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells like soap instead of pine (rosemary?).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve showered with this product for many years after discovering a similar product in Europe in the 70s.  It cleans very well without excessive bubbles or foam, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft - even in hard water.  I smell wonderful afterward, and so does the bathroom!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Glad I could find it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I need a 12-step program for my Vitabath addiction. This and the gel? Calms me right down. Seriously. And you don&#x27;t wanna be around me when I&#x27;m not calm.</li>
    <li> I love Vita Bath products the Shower Gel is my # 1 favorite...&lt;br /&gt;the Lotion is so smooth and clean felling..Try it !!</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong stuff.  Was aiming for the bubble bath in the same color from Vitabath but got lotion.  That was my bad didn&#x27;t read the description right.  Wife likes this stuff too.  Wish Vitabath would have different shaped bottles for different products for dummies like me.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the same formula as the one I USED IN EUROPE years ago.  I threw it away, no beautiful smell like years ago.  Called the direct company and they said they had to eliminate some ingredient because it was not meeting some standard. It virtually was like nothing to put on, no beautiful smell at all.  Very disappointed, money wasted.</li>
    <li> Not crazy with the fragrance, thought it would be the original Vitabath smell, not to heavy does feel nice but not crazy about the smell</li>
