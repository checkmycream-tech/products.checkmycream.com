<li> If you wash your hands a lot (like I do), adding a small amount to you dispenser prior to adding the antibacterial soap will reduce the harsh dryness left by just antibacterial soap.  </li>
<li> I have short, coily, thick hair that used to retain moisture throughout my work day but by the end of the day my hair was visibly dry.</li>
<li> It was been hard transitioning because my natural hair would get sooo dry and become a tangled matted mess!!!  </li>
<li> My husband has been using it less than a week for his psorosis skin condition.  </li>
<li> I use half glycerine and half water in a spray bottle.</li>
<li> Now that I use glycerine and water, along with the other products that I was using, dryness is a thing of the past.</li>
<li> its not too thick nor runny like other Glycerines</li>
<li> Slick bottle, to me</li>
<li> So frustrating.  </li>

    <li> Great product, so many application. I made home made liquid soap and am so happy. this is a great price, beautiful packaging too. quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I put Glycerine Vegetable in my lotion, body wash, my shampoo and  conditioner I love it I ordered 2 bottles</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this item! It is a great moisturizer.  There are times I also use this on my hair as a deep conditioner</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well when mixed with half water. I have short, coily, thick hair that used to retain moisture throughout my work day but by the end of the day my hair was visibly dry. Now that I use glycerine and water, along with the other products that I was using, dryness is a thing of the past. I use half glycerine and half water in a spray bottle. I saturate my hair pretty good with it. I use it maybe 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly . My husband has been using it less than a week for his psorosis skin condition.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if its working yet, but if it does we will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a while now. Glad I could find it here. Good Price. Slick bottle, to me it was a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix glycerin with water in a spray bottle and spritz it in my hair and twist it up over night and it leaves my hair so soft in the morning! My hair loves it and loves me for it.</li>
    <li> Used for makeup finishing spray(mixed with some bottled water). It works like a charm. My new favorite thing.  A must buy.</li>
    <li> Cap broken but contents just fine, high quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!! I am transtioning for the third time from relaxed to natural and consider my hair texture a 4b/4c.  It was been hard transitioning because my natural hair would get sooo dry and become a tangled matted mess!!!  So frustrating.  I was ready to throw the towel in AGAIN!!  This stuff has transfromed by tight dry curls into soft waves.  My hair is literally baby soft now.  Can&#x27;t believe it.  Made a half/half mixture with the glycerin and pure water and shake it into a water bottle.  Spritz on my hair after I deep condition and let air dry.  Wake up with soft springy wave hair.  This has been a life saver, literally.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  No spillage.</li>
    <li> great product, needed it to make hair care products for curly hair.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described and it hadserved its purpose well, this quantity has lasted a very long time and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> defiantly will order again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it on my natural hair and in my natural hair products to keep moisture in. Will be purchasing again, but perhaps a bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Hardly use it but liked it when I first used it.</li>
    <li> I love this glycerin, just what I needed and works great!! If your looking for glycerin, this is the product to get, no regrets!</li>
    <li> The oil is great.  I received about half bottle full.  In the shipment the oil leaked.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  Glycerine/Glycerin Vegetable Usp Grade 100% Pure 10 oz, meet and exceded my expectations.  It will work nicely in preparing my own bubble bath mixture.  It is also very good to add to Antibacterial Soap for reducing the harshness of the antibacterial mixture.

    <li> good stuff at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> it was as advertised and i was impressed with the quality. i would buy it again. yes i would buy it again,</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m transitioning to become a full on natural, so my hair tends to get very dry! Flakes &amp; itchiness all the time! I  use this product to make a moisturizing hair spritz. I dilute it with water, 2 drops of tea tree oil (for dandruff), 3-5 drops of peppermint oil (for dandruff, dryness, &amp; it tingles!) aloe vera juice (for hydration, softness) and water (more moisture!) Make sure you ALWAYS dilute glycerin!!!!!! If you don&#x27;t, your hair will be even drier and basically turn to straw! This mixture keeps my hair moisturized for up to three whole days! My hair literally feels like a soft cloud when I include glycerin. A must have for your hair! I put it into a spray bottle and spray it on my hair. This stuff is the real deal. Works perfectly &amp; lasts for quite some time, depending on how much you use it. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it &amp; it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. This can also be used to make DIY beauty products like lotion or soap!</li>
    <li> I needed this item to make homemade Vitamin C serum. Mixed it up and works great. Thanks so very much</li>
    <li> Love using this to make my natural products for skin and hair. its not too thick nor runny like other Glycerines I came across</li>
    <li> I prefer glycerin over alcohol for tinctures and this is perfect.  As I make more I will certainly be buying from Dr. Adorable!  Thanks Amazon for good pricing and availability.</li>
    <li> Very nice addition to my water in a spray bottle, keeps my hair moisturized longer plus I love the name of the distributor.(4c natural hair)</li>
    <li> I used this with the l ascorbic acid when I mixed it, works way better than mixing with jojoba or any other oil, I put those oils on after this penetrates. I like this brand.</li>
