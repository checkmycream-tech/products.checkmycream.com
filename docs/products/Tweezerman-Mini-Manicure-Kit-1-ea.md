      <li>Don&#x27;t laugh ladies, I don&#x27;t know what that thing is called, I&#x27;m sure guys don&#x27;t care as long as it works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really want the other two things, but they come in handy at times.</li>
      <li>Nice little mani kit.</li>
      <li>it is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>My wife carries this everyday in her purse along with a nice pair of tweezers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are high quality clippers, very sharp with a nice quality feel to them</li>
      <li>particularly a metal nail file.  </li>
      <li>New.</li>
      <li>The tools are sharp and are the exact basics I want in my purse.</li>
      <li>Nothing is more irritating than a chipped nail when one is out and about.</li>
      <li>I keep the other two tools in a pocket of my travel toilet kit, which leaves the case free to house a group of Q-tips, which used to fray when loose.  </li>
      <li>so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.  </li>
      <li>She really enjoys having it with her for those little hang nails in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works well in my purse/bag. I have nails that seem always to be breaking/jagged -- I hate being without nail-clippers. File and nail tool (&amp; I added tweezers) are also handy to have handy in the see through plastic case. I&#x27;m happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely in my purse</li>
    <li> Came with out one piece. Otherwise good</li>
    <li> In just a few months since I purchased this, the plastic case fell apart.  The file was flimsy.  I do still use the cuticle pusher and clippers, but they sit in a caddy in my desk now, instead of in my work bag as I intended.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, and the case was already cracked when I received it, but the tools work well.</li>
    <li> Great to keep in glove compartment.  Enough room in plastic container to add small tweezers (Uncle Bill&#x27;s sliver gripper), bandaid, and a few other small items.</li>
    <li> I like that it fits in my purse, that&#x27;s what I was looking for. I do not like the nail clippers included however. They did not work every well, and kind of hurt when attemping to use. I&#x27;m going to keep it, but I tossed the clippers and bought another pair at the drugstore to put in there.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> The cases came broken</li>
    <li> And the container was big enough to add a set of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The little container stays closed quite well too.</li>
    <li> My wife carries this everyday in her purse along with a nice pair of tweezers.  She really enjoys having it with her for those little hang nails in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Amazon for most of our purchases and I update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality at a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a small manicure kit for his travel...particularly a metal nail file.  This is a really small kit.  Other than the fact that the file we got was &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;...my husband still loves it.  Price is right for what you get.</li>
    <li> Best travel nail kit ever. And I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Good quality product. I&#x27;ve bought a couple more to give to others. Love the cuticle pusher!</li>
    <li> Nothing is more irritating than a chipped nail when one is out and about. This little kit solves that problem and, of course, has that Tweezerman quality.</li>
    <li> to tell you the truth I only bought this set for the mini cuticle pusher all the reviews and nail technicians say it&#x27;s the greatest one and definitely worth my money it is very sturdy. I think it&#x27;s time to invest in the full size models and it will definitely be worth my time. haven&#x27;t tried the rest of the kit yet but it looks promising tweezer6man is a good reliable brand</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you&#x27;d hope.</li>
    <li> The tools are sharp and are the exact basics I want in my purse. I love the cute little container they come in. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Loved mine, so bought these for my mom &amp; sisters. Great stocking stuffers! Tweeze roman is a fabulous brand that I trust.</li>
    <li> Great little manicure kit! Comes with everything you need!</li>
    <li> This is a great collection for travel.  The file is small enough to pass airport security in the US and Europe, so it lives in my handbag.  I keep the other two tools in a pocket of my travel toilet kit, which leaves the case free to house a group of Q-tips, which used to fray when loose.  An all-around good value for me!</li>
    <li> I bought the full size version from Sephora once. I fell in love with the nail file and used it for years. Couldn&#x27;t find it recently. Decided to buy this on Amazon since it came with clippers also. I pretty much only got it for the absolutely amazing nail file though. I just love it. Very good quality, I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Tweezerman. Their tweezers are top notch quality, and apparently their nail tools are, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great , inexpensive little set. I keep it in my pocketbook. I never thought I&#x27;d use it as often as I do.  All 3 pieces work great. I figured the file would be crappy, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why I got two- to have a spare? Nice basics for a man or woman, any age.  Clipper file and.... What&#x27;re the thing is, cuticle pusher, under nail cleaner. Don&#x27;t laugh ladies, I don&#x27;t know what that thing is called, I&#x27;m sure guys don&#x27;t care as long as it works. Sorry guys. Some may actually know. Comes in a hinged lid plastic case. The implements do rattle once removed from packing, so don&#x27;t take it on stealth operations.</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep in your purse or at the office.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and durability.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Nice little mani kit.</li>
    <li> Nice travel manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for inclusion on a travel kit. It is difficult to find a high quality nail clipper which also has a nail file. This kit suits the need.&lt;br /&gt;These are high quality clippers, very sharp with a nice quality feel to them</li>
    <li> Great for on the go and travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travelling!</li>
    <li> Very thick and solid metal clippers. I didn&#x27;t really want the other two things, but they come in handy at times. The one tool worked as a screwdriver pretty good...</li>
    <li> Nice travel size and works well. It is hard to&lt;br /&gt;find something small enough for travel that&lt;br /&gt;works well~this is it.</li>
    <li> New. Came in less than a week. Must have for nails and cuticles. I love this item so much that I ordered two more. One for desk doing nails , one for my purse , and one for the bathroom. Inexpensive , compact with a carring case , very sharp trimmer.</li>
    <li> The case was not as durable as I hoped; the cover hinge broke soon after I started carrying it in my purse, rendering the two parts unable to stay together.  The tools themselves are of wonderful quality and quite durable so far.</li>
    <li> Made great gifts for my co-workers as a Winter Holiday gift. Practical but also Quality; you can&#x27;t beat Tweezerman products !</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just drop it in your purse, and you&#x27;re ready for a mini mani anywhere!</li>
    <li> Love it! But BE CAREFUL!! Instruments are very sharp!!!</li>
