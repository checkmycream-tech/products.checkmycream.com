<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great. I feel all tingly after my tan. helps darken my tan a lot</li>
    <li> This is the worse tanning lotion I have purchased.  My daughter used this product and this lotion burned her skin.  She applied this lotion and before she went into the tanning bed, she looked into the mirror and she skin was red.  She never used the tanning bed that day, and had to take a very long shower to remove this lotion.  I threw the rest of the bottle away.  Total garbage.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Have used it for years, but if you can&#x27;t stand the heat don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well!</li>
    <li> Nothing gets you tanner! Best stuff out their, hands down! 😃👍</li>
    <li> Gets the job done dark and tan.. doesn&#x27;t smell the best and your skin stays on fire for sometime afterword but its worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion based off the reviews saying how effective it is, and how it&#x27;s not an expired lotion. Idk if it&#x27;s just luck of the draw or what but I received a year EXPIRED lotion. Very disappointing. It&#x27;s still pretty effective so I wonder how good it would be new. Will not buy again. Order if you want expired!</li>
    <li> Okay. This really is a good lotion if: you have dark skin, skin that is tough and not sensitive, or you really get off on pain. This lotion has so much niacin (tingle) it will burn a hole in your soul. They don&#x27;t list the T factor but it is HIGH. It melts cellulite and your will to live. I have to admit, that even with my fair, freckly, sensitive skin that should be kept under lock and key in a cave, or maybe Ireland...I would buy it again if the smell didn&#x27;t make me so sick. If it smelled like coconuts, or even had no smell at all, I would buy it.  I give it three stars because: it stinks, it may be dangerous it&#x27;s so tingle high, and I once made the mistake of covering my whole body with it prior to the tanning bed, and it was so tingly and hot and itchy I later scratched myself to bloody shreds. I learned to use it only on arms and legs. If you can deal with the smell of watermelon vomit, I say get some. If you are fair or sensitive...watch out.</li>
    <li> Always loved the bombshell products and this price beats the salons anyday!!</li>
    <li> I may have received a bad bottle but both my wife and I broke out in horrible burning, itching hives after the first use. My wife&#x27;s skin can be a little sensitive so when she broke out in hives everywhere the lotion touched I was not too terribly surprised.  I, on the other hand, have thick italian skin, been tanning for years so when I used it the next day I was VERY surprised to have had the exact same reaction.  I can&#x27;t remember EVER having a reaction like that. Be aware! Test it on a small spot first or spend the day with cold showers and benedryl.</li>
    <li> great product,as I seemed to be stuck on that so called tanning plato---this product works great and gives a very nice bonzing effect!</li>
    <li> I rotate this stuff with Solid Black,  This stuff is the bomb if you like the tingle. This stuff is for extreme tanners. Would not recommend to beginner tanners, and for the ones who doesn&#x27;t like the tingle sensation.</li>
    <li> Holy cow! Let me tell you, this wad the very first sizzle/tingle lotion I have EVER used.. so I was scared at first but decided to purchase based on other customers reviews on this lotion. SO glad I purchased, this lotion gives RESULTS. Swear on my life, after my second use I am definitely darker. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using. As far as the sizzle factor.. when it kicks in it does get hot and you feel a burning warm sensation. . It turns your skin flame red for a hour at most! It goes away leaving a great tan. A soothing lotion like Hempz is a great after product to calm the sizzle and your skin. Love love this lotion, will ALWAYS use a tingle/sizzle lotion after this. Would for sure repurchase.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is the worst, I had to jump out from the tanning bed because I felt like my skin was on fire. It was a very unpleasant experience. It made my skin so red and stayed like that for hours, be careful not to touch your face after using this stuff.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and a great price.</li>
    <li> great product, same as what you OVER pay for at a salon.</li>
    <li> I guess I just have gotten used to using a bronzer so when I used this lotion, it burned like crazy! I could defianatly tell a differnce afterward thouhgh. I cool feel the heat coming off of me for a long time. I actually like this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for what you are getting.  The bronzer in the lotion is perfect and does not leave that orangy tint that I hate and leave stains.  The tingle in the lotion is mild, which suited me fine since I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the tingle.  It does leave me pretty red for about an hour after I use it, but when it goes away I have a great color with no burning.  Even the scent is great and doesn&#x27;t overpower.  Overall, I love it.</li>
    <li> I am the fairest person on the planet.  My skin is a porcelain as Snow White.  I am not an \\&quot;expert tanner\\&quot; and my tanning salon girl had me try this lotion.  It was the first time I had stepped in a tanning booth in over three years.  The tingle was itchy, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable for me.  I got AMAZING color from that first session. After the first application and tan it took about 2 to 3 hours for that tingle sensation to go away.  But I went back the next day and used the same lotion and it only took about 30 minutes for the sensation to go away.  This is an amazing lotion and honestly, if you want to get dark then you have to spend the money on a good lotion.  I would recommend this to anyone who won&#x27;t mind that annoying itch for a few hours to get amazing, lasting color that lasts for weeks at a time.  It smells so good too! I get compliments all the time about how good I smell even hours after tanning.  I don&#x27;t even need perfume.  With this lotion, your skin will be red and it may even look blotchy for a little bit, but it really ends up settling into a gorgeous tan.  Highly recommended for fair skin people who want to get dark and aren&#x27;t afraid to try a tingle lotion! Happy Tanning Everyone!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Designer Skin lotions for a number of years now and I love them.  However, I&#x27;m always frustrated with how expensive they are to buy at the tanning salon, especially if they don&#x27;t have a package (with tans) running or a sale of some sort.  I have used this particular lotion before, as a sample, and loved it, so was very happy when I found I could get it from Amazon, and this seller for half what the tanning salon was asking for it.  For those of you, like me, who already spend a lot on tanning packages, this is the perfect solution.  The lotion arrived much quicker than expected, and was exactly as listed.  Great product, great seller, great experience.</li>
    <li> Wow seriously hot! Definately do not use if you dont already have a good base tan developed. The smell isnt bad....could be better. But with as hot as it gets and the results that follow...i can overlook the smell. All in all, i like the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Product inside wasn&#x27;t what was on the label. Wont order lotion on here again.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this kind. Now I got a Tanned &amp;#34;bombshell&amp;#34; at home who looks forward to tanning so she can use this stuff!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan, so why should I review this product? Well...    First off, my mother tans, and this looks good on her, you know, after she tans. She looks good, but she&#x27;s a pretty lady anyway.    Second, this gets the blood to the skin. After she tans, she leaves the product on the stearing wheel, doorhandles, etc. Not inentionally, but it just happens, and I always get the aftermath. I have to tell you, one time she went tanning on my birthday, then we sat next to each other to go bowling and when I got out the car, no lie, half of my leg was numb, this was a result from touching her leg. It was hilarious, but seriously obnoxious if you&#x27;re not used to that feeling. Sure got the blood to my skin!     And I lost that game, I blame it on the lotion. ;D</li>
    <li> Sizzling hot and you definitely get bronzy very quick😄</li>
    <li> Gone through a few bottles of this over the years. It&#x27;s not the hottest tingle out there but it smells nice and gets the job done. Betrayal is a better choice if you&#x27;re accustomed to tingle lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different indoor tanning lotions, but always come back to Bombshell! The perfect amount of tingle although I like a strong tingle, and results are almost immediate. Also ordered the new Playboy Hottie Hot tingle lotion so when it comes in we&#x27;ll have to see if my opinion changes.</li>
    <li> Bombshell has been around for a while and is a staple lotion...everyone who tans should have this bottle...its one of the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tingle lotion for people who are just starting to build their tan or want to really improve it. I have bought &amp; used several bottles, and I&#x27;m always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Ok so yes it ssizzles and your skin gets red after, but you will have the most amazing tan ever 2 days later.  I dont use this often only about 1 - 2x a month when my tan is fading or when I havent tanned in a while. If you want to tan fast and be tan ready for any event in 7 days I would do this routine as follows. Day 1: Bombshell,  Day 2: Break and NO TAN - let the bombshell heal, Day 3: Good expensive Bronzer like Black or Illuminary &lt;-- they wont streak, Day 4: No tan,  Day 5: Bombshell with Deep Bronzer like Black or Illuminary, Day 6: Double dip, do a tanning bed with your deep bronzer and then spray tan.. Day 7: ready and tan for any event!!  I have done this and even suggested it to a friend that had to get tan for a wedding. She never tanned before and she loved it. So I warned her the bombshell tingled you will look like a lobster you may burn BUT in 7 days with this regimen you will liik like a million buck!  Love this stuff.  If you want to try it and dont want to spend the salons sell a one time use for $8 but this is a much better buy...</li>
    <li> Favorite tanning lotion but not for beginners. Tingling takes a bit to get used to.</li>
    <li> My product came very fast. I would buy from same company again. My tanning lotion worked as I expected. It is one of my favorite tanning lotions that works fast and effective. Many people tell me this is their favorite tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> One of the best ive used. Intense tingle! Ingredients arent as good as Goddess though. For experienced tanners ( must have a base tan)</li>
    <li> I switch up my tanning lotions every couple months but I have used Bombshell in the past and am currently using it. It is a bronzer/tingle combo, and it gives you an overall gorgeous tan. I love tingle lotions and for me this product has only a slight tingle but for someone that isn&#x27;t used to tingle this might be a little intense. I love the smell of this lotion, it&#x27;s a very fruity kiwi-watermelon fragrance. This product will give you a nice sun-kissed bronze glow without being orange. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Horrible burning sensation folloWed by itching</li>
    <li> Bombshell was everything I was looking for in a tanning lotion. Bombshell has a tingle an accelerator and a light bronzer , which maximizes your tanning experience.</li>
    <li> Very good,very hot tingle tanning bed tanning lotion. One of my favs!! Great price as well! Would recommend to ALL THE HOT AND TINGLE LOVERS!!  Got great color from this lotion!!! ,LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Love this product. Helps my tan develop better and stay longer.</li>
    <li> nothing to brag about no tingle dont know if it was old just not happy with it was hoping for better quality</li>
    <li> This has always bee a top choice for me for tingle bronzing tan lotions. I&#x27;ve used this before, same product.. nothings changed. Gave me a good tan quickly and isn&#x27;t as itchy as some tingles. I would rate this high with Mood.. one of my other favorites! Also great price, much cheaper on here than at store.</li>
    <li> Owned 5 tanning salons and this has always been one of my favs.  I no longer have shops but have in home tanning bed.  I switch between Ed Hardy and Bombshell.  Gives you a great bronze look.  Highly recommend for avid tanners.  FYI.. Best for those who are not fair skinned and not used to high tingle factor.</li>
    <li> So, a couple days before using this lotion for the first time, I used Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Pink Diamond in an Ultimate Bed (45,000 watt bulbs, with 5 high pressure facial bronzers.)  The Pink Diamond was my first tingle lotion, and I felt a little warmer in the bed than usual, and when I got out I felt a little itchy for about 15-20 minutes.  Then I received this and used it in a regular bed (36,000 watt bulbs) with no facial bulbs.  I started feeling warm to hot on my shoulders while I was still putting this on as I got toward my legs, and I made sure to keep this off my face because the Pink Diamond actually caused me to burn and peel a little on my left cheek.  All I can say is after reading the reviews that this was a mild tingle, I was blown away.  Take into consideration that this was my 2nd tingle lotion use ever, but I used it in a regular bed as opposed to an Ultimate with the Pink Diamond, and the tanning itself wasn&#x27;t too bad.  Getting out of the bed, however, was a completely different story.  I felt like I was on fire in several different parts of my body, and my shoulders looked blotchy.  The fire sensation was so strong that I didn&#x27;t really notice much itchiness, but I stuck with it and refused to shower for hours to let the bronzers work.  It took about 2 1/2 to 3 hours before the burning sensation left some parts of my body (namely the front of my thighs because I tan in the buff.)  I&#x27;ve tanned before, and I&#x27;ve been tanning about 3 months continuously, so its not like I went in completely unprepared.  I have one hell of a base tan, and a naturally dark complexion due to heredity to begin with.  I also didn&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff after I tanned...it actually annoyed me, where I can&#x27;t say that any lotion has ever gone that far before.  End results were fantastic though!  I was much darker that evening, and I still see a difference the next day.  I will definitely be using this lotion again.  Screw the pain and the smell, if it gets me through my tanning plateau, which I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with, then its worth it to me.  I&#x27;m still going to use different lotions day in and out, but this will definitely stay in my rotation to help me extend my tan.  And who knows?  Maybe once I get used to this, I&#x27;ll move up to a stronger tingle lotion lol.  I&#x27;m a glutton for self-punishment if it makes me look good.  &#x3D;p</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first. But After I got it and used it the first time.... was totally impressed!!! The tingle was just right and the bronzer leaves a beautiful color after the red wears off. It is a feel good lotion. But caution !!!!!!  Make sure to not touch anyone who might be sensitive to the heat ... Especially Children !!!!!! It will turn them red and freak you out. But it to will fade . Would buy it again and again and again!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! And the shipping is GREAT! I ordered it Friday and it was here that Monday. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a tingle bronzer in the past, but this absolutely rocks!  It smells a little girly, but hey, I&#x27;m a dude using a tanning bed. I leave the bed with a great sensation on my skin and after a few hours I&#x27;m several shades darker!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It is a tingler but it only tingles a little bit. The first time I used it I thought it might have been a little to intense of a tingle but I tried it out for a couple more days and it was perfect! I love my tan:)</li>
    <li> Bought and don&#x27;t like the tingling and burning on my skin, but my husband uses it and likes it very much....other then that excellent product and would recommend to people who like the tingling and burning feeling.</li>
    <li> Ok people this is a TINGLE lotion which means it leaves a burning sensation on you, doesn&#x27;t matter if you say your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, if you&#x27;ve never used this before the. It&#x27;s going to give those effects, this is a lotion for experienced tingle tanners, and anyone who uses tingles knows not to put on their face or touch their face and with tingles you can sometimes breakout in hives if you itch while hving this lotion on, also the reviews that say I jumped in the shower and it made it worse, well if you used tingles you would know you are NOT suppose to shower for a few hours after using because of the ingredients water and tingle factors don&#x27;t mix! Also the people who said there&#x27;s was watery if you leave it in a car when it&#x27;s freezing out, it will freeze and then when you thaw it out guess what watery, plus every lotion you buy has a little lid on the back of the bottle at the bottom that says use within this manyonths after opening! I love this lotion and will forever continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product b4 and really like how it works on me.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommed buying it...it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m fairly experience at high end lotions over the years. This one does a nice job of getting you past your plateau without to much tingle. It does &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; folks, so don&#x27;t misunderstand. It just does so in a nicer way to me. I&#x27;ve had some that felt like hot pepper was poured on my open pores leaving me on fire for many hours afterward. Do not get this on your face though! You will turn red when using this but get a nice golden brown without streaking afterwards. It does have a great smell, and when it touches your skin it starts to melt and gets soaked in quickly. I verified this was the same my salon sold and it&#x27;s exactly the same. Thanks as the price here is so much less.. :)</li>
    <li> Im a serious tanner and already had a pretty good tan befoere i used it but my legs were not as dark as i wanted them to be. After my first use i noticed a difference.I was a little worried about staining but it didnt stain me at all. I will definately keep using this product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this deal on this lotion!  I have been using it for years and can&#x27;t seem to find anything I like as well.  It cost twice as much at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obsidian for the last year and really love the slight warming effect it provided.  I wanted to boost my tan and after researching tinglers, I decided to purchase Bombshell.  Whoa, this product is powerful!!  About 10 minutes into tanning I felt the tingling sensation start to work.  Right after tanning my body was completely red, especially my legs.  The tingle intensified and lasted a few hours later even after showering.  After the redness went away, I was darker, but it didn&#x27;t sustain like I have seen with results from Obsidian.  This may be a great product for truly advanced tanners, but for me it was a little much.  I will use the rest of the bottle though and rotate it in and out with Obsidian since I want to use it up.  If you love tinglers you will probably really enjoy this product.  For me, just a little too strong.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying lotion at the salon!!!!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome. .I will say this though, if you are not a professional tanner like me. .I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. You will be burned alive.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and love it! It&#x27;s just right on the tingle and the bronzers! It&#x27;s cheaper here at amazon then the tanning salon by $30 😄😄</li>
    <li> Somehow I missed the detail that this was a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; product.  I thought I was having a severe allergic reaction and rode all the way home from the tanning salon with the windows open and the air conditioning on full blast.  I was rouge everywhere that I&#x27;d applied this stuff.  Btw, it smelled delicious.  Anyway, I definitely do NOT have sensitive skin otherwise.  I know a lot of people like the tingle products and if you&#x27;re one of them, you&#x27;d love this.  If you&#x27;re experimenting, don&#x27;t start at this level.  I only used it once so I&#x27;m hoping to sell it to one of my tanning friends.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m male 45 and own my own tanning bed, I have been tanning for several months now and while I have a great base tan I reached a plateau. Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX is the first tingle lotion I have tried, The thing that I love most is there&#x27;s no after tan smell that you get from most bronzers and I leave this stuff on for hours after tanning. Now for the tingle does it tingle yes but I find it only last about 20-30 min after applying the product and its really not that bad certainly not enough burning to make me want to take the stuff off and yes I even apply it to my face, I would not recommend using it on your face (product even says not recommend for face) but I have no issues with it, after all if I always did what was recommend I would not be tanning to begin with,  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and my skin is not sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results for using this product only a few times is pretty amazing, and I believe I have already gotten a little darker.  I do notice the less tanned parts of my body (Near arm pit) gets pretty red but my tanned parts I don&#x27;t notice the red as much, The red disappears in under 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is defiantly not a product for beginner&#x27;s, but if you have been tanning for awhile and your looking to get darker I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Yes it burns a ton but you get so tan!!! Totally worth the stinging. Besides you get used to it.</li>
    <li> i love tingle lotions and this one is just not a good tingle but it is a nice lotion and smells good, just not for me!!</li>
    <li> Always used this lotion! Love, love, it! You get your order in just a few day!</li>
    <li> I had already previously used this lotion so knew that it was my favourite one. Good tingle and bronzer so good tan. Price here was the best one I could easily find, much better than paying the amount the solarium asks for!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was slow but received it within the timeframe given so all was good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> Works well for tanning beds.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it works really well an it has just enough sizzle an it doesn&#x27;t make u itch like some sizzle&#x27;s or tingle&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> I just got the lotion in the mail. The shipping was super fast! I went into an 8 min high point machine and my skin felt on fire. This lotion gave me a burnt skin feeling. It is defiantly not for everyone especially people who cannot take the heat. The lotion smells amazing and has a slight tint.I saw color within an hour pop up after the redness has settled.</li>
    <li> I love designer skin lotions, however some of them are so over hyped. Like this one. It does smell good, not that best but its fine and it does make your skin extremely smooth, but didn&#x27;t see any difference in tan. It did not make me darker at all. There are so many other lotions (even without the tingle) that are a lot cheaper and got me darker then this. I&#x27;m also pale, blond hair woman but I&#x27;ve got tough skin so I love tingle lotions but this one isn&#x27;t for me. I reccomend Ruby by designer skin if you actually want to get a nice tan.</li>
    <li> Pros: goes on super smooth. My skin soaked it right up which was nice. It doesn&#x27;t get hot immediately so the experience in the bed was pretty good. It has a nice clean neutral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: about 30 mins after tanning, it heated up to the point of utter discomfort and misery. I&#x27;ve used Ruby which I was told was hotter than this lotion. Idk if I&#x27;m sensitive to a specific ingredient or what.. I&#x27;m still going to use it but I&#x27;m going to have to use it on days when I can get a shower immediately after tanning so it&#x27;s kind of limiting.</li>
    <li> The purchase was perfect, but I regret buying this lotion, since it&#x27;s too tingly for me.</li>
    <li> great product at a great price. It has a good tingle and gives you good results tanning. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it though unless u already have a good base tan</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but i don&#x27;t understand why I get really tan right after and it just fades off that same day. Very aggregating I think.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!!! If you are looking to get a dark tan quick and like the sizzle then this is for you!</li>
    <li> Did not help with tanning. Did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time and works great.</li>
    <li> Best color I ever got from a tanning lotion, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Always a great product! Very fast delivery, thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, cause she has used it before. She tried some other kind, and really didn&#x27;t like it, so I got this for her, and she swears by it. Seller was really good, and shipped the product faster than I thought I would get it. Thanks, and I will use Seller and product again.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have been using designer skin products for years, it&#x27;s petty much the only tanning lotion I use. However, I usually sick with the bronzing only lotions, this was the first time I have used a hot tingle lotion. The first time I used it, I knew it was an intense lotion so I only did half the time in the tanning bed rather than the full time like I normally do. WOW I thought I was going to catch fire!! But My skin turned bright pink because it brings the blood just beneath the surface. I gradually worked my way up to be in the bed for the full time now, I really don&#x27;t notice the heat any more but still get the tingle. If you are looking fir a a plateau breaker like I was, this will do it for you!!  WARNING: FOR EXPERIENCED TANNERS ONLY, DO NOT USE WITH PALE, FAIR SKIN. BUILD A BASE TAN FIRST!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the real deal! I love the tingle, and tans you super fast!</li>
    <li> I am a serious tanner.i like designer skin products,i use them all the time.this one worked well.great color over time.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much it is something that I would recommend! I keep going back to it and love the bronzer, if you like a hot tingle this is the lotion for you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, i love bombshell!!! Its a great tingle and great bronzer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is AWESOME! I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple years now, and this was my first tingle lotion. It is amazing. It smells delish and also works like magic. After one use, and the tingling effect fades away I am noticeably darker. Love it!</li>
    <li> I did not know this was going to be a tingle lotion it is not something I will like  I am sure someone else would like it  it was delivered in a week  great service</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I work in a tanning salon and we get a lot of different lotions into the salon and this is by far one of the best! I love to tingle, and it always makes me feel darker after every session. If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion to get you out of your tanning plateau this is definitely the best one to do so, and it smells delicious. I do NOT recommend using this product as a first time tanner, make sure you have a fairly decent base tan before you use this or you will burn and that&#x27;s never fun! :)</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for over a year now and have tried out so many different types of tanning lotions. I realized I love the tingle lotion so I went about ordering all different kinds to find my #1 favorite and this is most definitely it! It smells SO good, the tingle is really relaxing I&#x27;d say the best tingle I&#x27;ve experienced yet. The bronze is perfect and I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experiences this problem after getting out of the tanning bed the lotion clumps up and gets all over your clothes? Well Bombshell does not do that! It makes your skin so soft and does not clump up after getting out. Very happy with this product and will stick to it for as long as I tan</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Gives you a great bronze right away.  For experienced tanners though, hot tingle sensation! Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a tingler lotion. I walk out of the tanning salon with such a nice dark glow.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that TANS my legs. The tingling effect, I can put up with because it soon goes away but the delicious smell stays around and I&#x27;ve long appreciated that smell due to the fact that most tanning products STINK!</li>
    <li> Works great! If you are new to tingles, mix it with 2/3 regular bronzer lotion and keep adding less regular bronzer until you are used to the tingle. If you&#x27;ve never used one before it can be kind of painful/intense. But it will get you DARK. Make sure you don&#x27;t put it on your face or neck either! It will burn so bad. It&#x27;ll make you red as a lobster after you tan for a few hours but will make you golden and delicious later that day. ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my tanning salon. It wasn&#x27;t any better than some other brands and the smell was awful to me. I ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! works amazing, smells amazing</li>
    <li> FAST TANNING PRODUCT WITH A TINGLE FACTOR. THIS IS ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. OLD BUT EXTREMELY EFFICIENT. FOR A FAST LASTING TAN.</li>
    <li> Refunded expired 12/2014 Caused skin burning and itching at the same time</li>
    <li> This extreme tingle is just that... I forgot &amp; put some on my face... I got blood red on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t affect my legs or arms.</li>
    <li> definitely seen results! the only bad thing was, well it will burn the crap out of you. it hurts. I&#x27;m Indian, I have probably gotten sunburn 3 times in my 16 years of living. I have been tanning for about 2 years, I have a base tan, I tan 2-3 times a week, one of those times I use this lotion. I can really only handle the pain of this lotion once a week! maybe if I tanned more often I wouldn&#x27;t burn as bad, but I really don&#x27;t want to get too dark.</li>
    <li> You obviously have to love tingle. Tingle is not for everyone. but this is great stuff and it got me darker than I could have with a regular bronzer!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really does work wonders for your skin. It is also completely worth the price considering you would pay triple at a tanning salon!! Definitely buying another one from here when I run out!</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion of all time and it&#x27;s the real deal. Great price!</li>
    <li> No where in the information I read on this product did it say the product contained tingle.  After applying, I broke out in a rash.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> Another one of my favorite indoor tanning lotions. Works great with a very mild tingle.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the tingle, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Great sent, and give a great tan that last. The burning sensation does last a little longer than my other tinglers but I am sure that&#x27;s because this lotion is stronger. this is a great product and at a very good price. Shipping got here before expected witch was a big plus!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but I thought from all the reviews that it would have a stronger tingle or be hotter, but its still a good lotion and it does have a good tingle to it. I was not disappointed I just expected more from the reviews. If you are looking for an extreme tingle or are already using a tingler and are already pretty dark I&#x27;d choose something else. I used this and another DS lotion to work up a deep base tan. I no longer feel the tingle and ive reached my &amp;#34;plateau&amp;#34; so onto a new hotter tingle with more bronzing.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to apply, and goes on smoothly. It does NOT have ALOT of bronzers in It but it does give you some nice color, not orange but a natural color. It doesn&#x27;t turn your hands colors or give you streaks and leaves your skin super soft.  I love the smell of it, its not overwhelming or stinky. Id score this as A-  itd be an A+ if it had more bronzing. Id recommend this lotion if you have at least a little bit of a tan and want to get a nice deep golden base tan. But would not recommend if you are trying to get past your plateau and are an experienced tingle user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using tinglers for years and I love my tingle hott. So what might be not so hot for me could be really hot for you. When it comes to tingles, they effect every one different. For those giving this a bad rating because you turned blotchy red and burned or itched, that is what its suppose to do! You dont give a bad rating because a lotion does what its suppose to do and you didnt like it. If you dont like hot or tingle lotion dont buy this lotion or any tingle lotions :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion &amp; it is much cheaper here than at a salon. It gives your skin a warm &amp; tingley feeling but I love that part of it and it works!</li>
    <li> Good, fast shipping, horrible product. This stuff tingled a little bit the first time I used it, but it was very mild and only on my legs. I&#x27;m almost through the bottle and have no color from this. And I wasn&#x27;t dark when I started using it, I only had a base color. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this because I read so many great reviews. Maybe some of you got real bottles but I got a fake. It expires 06/2014. Same month I bought it. This product was watered down, had minimun tingle and bronzer, and was nothing like the bottle I purchased at the salon. Do not waste your money on this. Invest in a bottle you know is real from a salon. Never buying online again.</li>
    <li> We bought this to use when tanning at a salon. It gives great results with dark, non streaking color with the added bronzing agent. It rubs on easily and has a great strawbery like smell. Even after tanning the odor is still very nice. The only drawback to this ilotion is the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; effect that it gives. It definitely helps in achieving a dark deep tan but sometimes can be overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love how this lotion goes on! It makes your skin so smooth and silky:) I really like the smell it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird tanning smell afterwards. This stuff is HOT! Make sure you have a good base tan first or you will burn and do not use on face! The hot/burn feeling does go away within a hour. You will be red after (but you&#x27;re supposed to be because of the increased blood flow) then it will turn into a tan. This gets you shades darker with one use! Shower after with COLD water not hot or you can reactivate it ouch! Do not touch anyone until you have showered and really scrubbed or you will transfer the burn to them! Make sure you hydrate your skin after with a good lotion. This is by far the best lotion I have ever used! Nothing has gotten be this dark this fast!</li>
    <li> I have used bombshell for yrs I love this lotion but if u r not a fan of the hot tingling  sensation would not recommend  it for u I love the tingling lotions</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying no where on the bottle I received was the lotion advertised as a tingle lotion; there was very small print on the back of he bottle that said it was all. I have used tingle lotions before and not really cared for them but this lotion was nothing that I had ever used and in a terrible way! I had to get out of the bed only five minutes in because my skin was BURNING not tingling. My skin was painful to the touch for two to three days and it took me a week before I went tanning again. With that said, it only took me two seconds to throw out this bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product,.it does get hot so if just starting out you may not want to use it right away.  I&#x27;m not getting orange, and it smells really good.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Love the deep dark tan but not the best smelling lotion.</li>
    <li> It works good. It does burn you and will tingle like crazy. In the end it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I wish I had it when I started tanning, I got a beautiful tan so much faster. if you put a lot on it kind of feels like a really bad sunburn for like an hour but then it goes away and everything is fine :)</li>
    <li> Warning to those of you considering purchasing this, this is a very strong tingle and is not recommended for the beginning tanner. I am experienced with tanning and tingles and let me tell you I felt like i was on fire, but that is exactly what I was looking for. Tingle lovers rejoice! This one does not disappoint. My friends nicknamed me the bloodhound because I can identify any smell, and so it is important my lotions smell good since I have a strong sense of smell. This smells like watermelon and kiwis. Very nice scent if you like a sweet scent. The bronzers in it aren&#x27;t very dark though. Actually quite light. But otherwise it&#x27;s great and a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast and received it on time. I&#x27;m Sicilian and an Calabrese Italain; so I&#x27;m naturally tan. This lotion has taken me to a whole new level darkness. The tingle is just right, and overall.....THIS LOTION IS BEYOND RIGHT IF YOU WANT THE PERFECT TAN!! I have finally found a lotion that works and pushes your &amp;#34;base tan&amp;#34; to a new level. One word of caution: YOU WILL HAVE JEALOUS FRIENDS! haha :)</li>
    <li> I  am not  satisfied  with  this  bronzer.  I would  like  to  return  the  products.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!! Gives you a little tingle but nothing you cant handle! :) Like it says on the back of the bottle Do Not hold your little ones until bathing, they will have little red spots all over them!</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion to my daughter because I couldnt handle the tingle. It smells very good and she loves the stuff, but the tingle was way to strong for anyone who can tolerate only mild tingle. She is very dark and raves over the effects.</li>
    <li> I always use Bombshell and or Fired Up, both products are good but the Bombshell has white tea extractin it. Softens your skin.  This time I got a great deal on the price, 2 for less than you pay for 1 at any tanning salon.  Fast delivery as usual.  Will order again</li>
    <li> I have bought this twice, not from this seller but paid full price in a salon which was $60.. I must say this stuff is awesome.. I&#x27;m in love with the smell.. and since you are not supposed to shower for at least 4 hours after you tan (with a bronzer to maximize you&#x27;re results) going to work or going out whatever the case may be right after you tan, you smell so good! I wish there was a perfume of this scent.. only thing I always do after I tan is be sure to use deodorant after.. it wears off instantly after you tan so make sure you apply that after..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are not the experienced tanner.. beware, it does burn.. whether you may feel it right away or not.. you will. ( it always hits me just after I tan) but it definitely gives youre tan a boost and makes it noticeable much faster and there definitely are results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price... is also UNBEATABLE! once I get paid this will definitely be taken out of my &amp;#34;save for later&amp;#34; list so I can purchase this for a THIRD time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I did not give this a 5 star may just be because my skin is this way... using this lotion can be tricky, if you do not apply everywhere, some spots will be red, and some will be white.. as for the white spots and circles I sometimes get due to no lotion.. after I get a certain level of darkness, I get 4-5 white blotchy circles always on my shoulders.. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the lotion, but I have tried to reapply many times over my shoulders with the lotion to make sure I am not missing them... But I still get the white blotches, I think it may be because I have a &amp;#34;pigmentation&amp;#34; in those areas.. if that is the case.. screw the 4 star this lotion still deserves a 5 star!! One of the best lotions I have tried and seen dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I already have a natural dark skin tone, but during the summer I like to be two tones darker all around. After the good reviews on this product I figured I would give it a try. It works well, don&#x27;t get my wrong... But, I just don&#x27;t feel it was as described &amp;#34;the next level up to achieve a darker tone. It does give good color, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell before and after I use the tanning bed. But, it doesn&#x27;t give me (after two tan sessions), a major &amp;#34;level up&amp;#34; darker tan that I am after. I assume if you have a tan very light light brown color it make seem dramatic to use this after two tan sessions. But, with me I have a dark olive Irish complexion already and I like to get darker to a point it is noticeably different I didn&#x27;t feel this gave me what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Always loved this lotion and beats paying over 60 dollars at salon!!</li>
    <li> i chose this tingler because many people told me it was amazing! i havent been using it long but cant wait to see the results</li>
    <li> Despite the negative reviews I decided to purchase it anyways. The tingle is in the perfect middle of too much and too little. The smell is to die for before/after! I will forever purchase this in the future. Make sure you don&#x27;t put this ANYWHERE near your face and try to clean your hands before touching your goggles.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned me on to this.  The bronzer does a great job.  Definitely works well in tanning booth.  Will keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel hot and a tid bit stingy in the bed. Use a lower bulb bed if it&#x27;s too hot for you. I  feel prickly for awhile but the nice bronze color I&#x27;m left with is something no other lotion has done for me before. If you can stand a tingle this is the one to get! I have luminary right now and I have AG Fierce defense and this is my favorite lotion out of the three. In fact, this is my favorite of all  time. The after tan smell is the best and the color is unmatchable. I have been won over as a tingle lotion and this lotion really amplifies the benefits of the tingle lotion.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for my wife and it caused her to break into a rash when she used it ! That&#x27;s her  experience  With this item yours my be better good luck , threw it out didn&#x27;t even  bother sending back for refund</li>
    <li> I odered something new to try and Bombshell does and excellent job in the tanning bed and has a pretty good smell too. It spreads on easy and I was happy with the results I got. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best I have tired for a great price.  The tingle is not as strong as I thought.  If you want a big tingle,  try Pyronic Blaze!  Still a great lotion for indoor tanning.  Will diff buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims it will do. If you read the descriptions of other sellers it states that this particular lotion is recommended for experienced tanners which is also stated on the bottle. You must have a base tan or high tolerance for the burning sensation. Some reviewers claimed they developed a rash after use but I personally had the same issue but its just because the tingler was that effective. after a week or so, your skin will adapt and the burn will no longer occur. I took this lotion with me to a salon and the owner asked what I had used because of how obviously effective the lotion was just after one use. The only downers I had with this lotion is the smell isn&#x27;t very appealing to me and eventually you will reach a plateau if you don&#x27;t interchange with other lotions after so long but that happens with most lotions, just a tip to know, always buy 2. But I highly recommend this lotion to people who can withstand the intensity (not for sensitive skin) IT REALLY IS A GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion so much! Every single time I go tan, they try selling me something new and I have to insist that I love my bombshell too much.  I do tan very easily, but this lotion gets me DARK.  I&#x27;ve been tanning in a level 2 for 3 days, and not even going to the full time yet and this lotion has worked wonders.  After  visits, people were already asking &amp;#34;how are you so tan?&amp;#34;.  I seriously obsess over this lotion and it smells so good!! I am definitely sensitive to the tingle because I feel burnt for about 30 minutes after I tan, but it&#x27;s worth it because once it sinks in I can see result every single time!  It&#x27;s great, I could go on forever.</li>
    <li> This is SUCH A GREAT lotion! This is one of my favorite lotions from Designer Skin. The tingle doesn&#x27;t bother me, as I am used to tingler lotions. I love the color I get immediately after, that deep red. The scent is great, too! GREAT COLOR from this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is not to be taken lightly, its an extreme tingle, which means when you get out of the tanning bed you will feel like you have a allergic reaction itching sensation all over! but give it about 45 minutes and you will have the best bombshell tan EVER!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion on and off for year as. Love it.. Was so happy to see it for less than $80</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion I love this stuff</li>
    <li> this is what i needed it makes you tingle but works great well worth the price i willbe buying some more</li>
    <li> I bought this product wanting a very strong tingle, but this was not the case. I put a decent amount on, and had a moderate tingle, mostly in my legs. I was very red afterwords for about two hours, but once it cleared up I had a great tan and it seems to be working very well. Also, I would start with a base tan before you use this lotion. Still a very good product.</li>
    <li> It was a nice smell before I got out of the tanning bed, then it made me smell like icky baby powder.. my boyfriend was a little grossed out by it. It had my legs bright red for the rest of the day but I did end up with a semi-decent tan. The girls at my tanning salon both had had a bottle of this lotion (bought from a salon where I live) and they said they do not recommend it because of the smell and greasy feel. I tried the i-Tingle instead now and it was awesome. TIP: TRY PACKETS BEFORE YOU BUY BOTTLES!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Instant color! I love the smell and this bottles seems to last a long time. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Not too much tingle and nice base tan after first use :)</li>
    <li> Used this for years.Love It!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I have tried applying it twice and both times broke out in a rash with welts all over my skin which lasted for hours. Designer skin has new owners and is no longer a trusted brand in tanning salons like SunsUp. I have never had problems with their products until the new management. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Since I have received this 3 days ago I&#x27;ve used it twice and I&#x27;ve gotten amazing color! the tingle is equal to the pain of a lip plumping gloss. It stings slightly but not immediately. It isn&#x27;t an unbearable pain. It&#x27;s very doable! I used it in a 12-minute stand up and I don&#x27;t notice the tingle until 6 minutes into the session and it isn&#x27;t that intense! I recommend it! Just a tip, don&#x27;t rub your eye for a few hours. It leaves red marks where you touch your face. A little lotion DOES go a long way. Incredible.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a tingle tanner, and I&#x27;m not as impressed as I&#x27;d like to be.  The first time I put it on, I didn&#x27;t feel anything until 3-4 minutes into my tan - then my arms started to burn - a lot - followed by the rest of me.  When I got out of the booth, I looked like I had a really bad sunburn and was radiating heat.  Pretty uncomfortable - but I&#x27;m willing to suffer a bit for vanity :)  I ultimately used it 3 times in a 5 day period, and found that the tingle became more bearable each time.  Unfortunately, my tan faded while using this.  Sure, I had the tingle-caused redness right after tanning (that lingered for a few hours), but &#x27;sunburn red&#x27; is not my color goal.  I switched back to my old 5X bronzer, and started building color again.  If this had worked for me, I&#x27;d be its biggest fan - but to combine discomfort with lack of results? I will not buy again.  It gets points for good smell, and it does appear to work well for others.</li>
    <li> This is hands down, the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought! You can see and feel it working, and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This had way too much tingle for my liking (and I was a seasoned tanner). It actually made me break out in a very red rash that would linger for at least a day. It did accelerate my tanning, though. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  It has just the right amount of tingle.  Enough to know its working but not so much that your burning for hours.  I am a huge fan!  The bronzer is also amazing.  It has given me a beautiful tan.  Thanks amazon :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is another long time favorite of mine. Has a moderate tingle to it with a good bronzer built in. Produces great results. I&#x27;ll put this lotion on before I get to the tanning center, and then apply a second lotion when I arrive at the tanning salon itself. The tanning results are even better. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this product has an AMAZING smell, but it was so strong that when I went to pick up some food the lady across the counter told me how \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and strong I smelled. The smell also lingers for a while so I don&#x27;t recommend this if you have to go somewhere that very day as it is VERY strong. I personally don&#x27;t mind it because it has a candy/cherry type of smell, but it isn&#x27;t ideal because it also leaves the scent on all my clothes and basically everything I touched. Other than that the tingle isn&#x27;t too strong, but it definitely is there so it&#x27;s a great lotion for beginners who are ready to try a tingle. This gave me great color, I was a really nice brown and there was no orange what so ever! The packaging is also cute so that&#x27;s a plus. Make sure you DO NOT use this on your face! It will burn and tingle way more as your face is more sensitive than the rest of your body. Also avoid touching smaller children as the irritation of the tingle may get on their skin. Overall I really liked this product, the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really would&#x27;ve liked to see a darker color pay off, but I hit plateau at some point so I think I may try the Modern Bombshell 300XX next time!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and use different lotions regularly so that I can give feedback to customers. I used the authentic product and was extremely excited to use because I know people who use it daily and love it. I went from Ed Hardy Body Shots to this and I was quite disappointed. I wanted a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tingle and I did not get that. Bombshell never even made my skin red, whereas Body Shots and Ed Hardy Obnoxious turn me extremely red and leave me with a gorgeous dark tan. This product seems really pleasant and has a high amount of bronzers. I will probably continue using this as a bronzing lotion since I have already purchased it. If you want an extremely good tingle, go buy Ed Hardy Body Shots. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Compares with the others at tanning businesses. Used same product much more expensive, this was over half price. Thanks</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Gives her the best tanning.  Beware!  This gives a pretty intense tingle.</li>
    <li> A lot of people on here have seemed to make the mistake of using this tingler as their first tingle lotion, which is the mistake. Tingles are meant to make your skin red and feel itchy, etc, but a first time tingle user shoudl not start with this lotion. This is a high tingle lotion - you should start with a low sensation tingle and work your way up (I suggest packets so you can work your way up to a regular bottle and save yourself some money). An experienced tingle user should be fine with this lotion. It works well, smells decent, and is a good price.</li>
    <li> One of the best tingler, bronzers I&#x27;ve used. Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> I used this tanning lotion yesterday for the first time and it made my skin feel like it was on fire.  It was horrible.  I do not have sensitive skin (although I usually do not use tingle lotions) and did not get sunburned.  My skin didn&#x27;t stop burning until about 5 hours after I used this.  I woke up this morning and now my skin is itching like crazy.  It is absolutely miserable .  I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this product to anyone unless you like pain. The only good thing about this product is that it smells good, however, I will never use this again.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, as far as, getting a great even tan. My problem was the smell. This is the worst smelling lotion I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> the only complaint i have is that it does not come in a larger size. i have several people come to my house to tan, and it just doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> I have fair skin with strawberry-blonde hair &amp; do not tan from just the sun. I do love to be outdoors in the summer, so I have to build a tan in the tanning bed. I have researched to find the best tanning lotions &amp; Designer Skin products are always at the top of the list. I started off using Luminary, which I love. After getting a good base tan, I switched to Bombshell for faster results. Because some of the reviews complained about the tingle, I only used it on my legs first. After making sure I could handle it, I gradually began to use it all over. Bombshell is now my favorite! Who would&#x27;ve ever thought I could have such a great tan in such a short period of time? I will continue to order &amp; use Bombshell, but will always start with a lotion without tingle.</li>
    <li> First off before i jump into this review (since i have a lot to say), let me note this is coming from someone who already had a decent tan prior to using bombshell. By &#x27;decent tan&#x27;, i mean about a nice medium golden colour. I wasn&#x27;t incredibly brown or anything and was stuck in a tanning plateau (which is so annoying). When people in reviews say they&#x27;re \\&quot;dark now\\&quot;, their level of dark usually goes unspecified so you&#x27;re left kind of clueless since they don&#x27;t bother to explain what they started out as before using a lotion. I feel explaining that gives a better idea of the product&#x27;s true potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this today in a lvl 3 bed for 10 minutes, and man I am the darkest i have been in a long time. Brown, not orange.  It smells the same after tanning as you first put it on but no gross smell. Has a cherry scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is pretty moderate in terms of the tingle factor. It was hot but, not unbearable. And I was overestimating it a bit. It actually isn&#x27;t that bad. I personally enjoy feeling hot when i tan, because I actually feel im getting a good tan. Afterwards, i was really pink and felt hot. I didn&#x27;t feel burnt or tingly. Just my skin was warm to touch for a bit. Lasted about 4-6 hours then i was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out how much i liked that it dried pretty fast after i applied it. Id say about a good 45 seconds. I hate having to wait for lotion to dry before i can get in the bed. Sometimes with other lotions, i have to dance around or accumulate some kind of air flow because the lotion takes forever to dry. And its annoying. I know im not the only one who has that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistancy was smooth and not thick. I didn&#x27;t have to empty half the bottle to cover my whole body. A little covers a good amount of surface area. That&#x27;s a plus which means it&#x27;ll last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already tan when i started using this, but was majorly stuck in a plateau for a while which is what made me buy this lotion. I read if you&#x27;re in a plateau and are having trouble getting darker, try a good tingle lotion. I got this one because of that reason and also partly because i am not a fan of cheap lotions whatsoever. They do nothing but waste my time and money. It sort of reminds me of the tattoo saying \\&quot;cheap tattoos aren&#x27;t good and good tattoos aren&#x27;t cheap\\&quot;. A good lotion will not be cheap. Flat out. Especially if you&#x27;re already tan, and are looking to get darker, you&#x27;ll need to spend a little extra but this one was definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant, please don&#x27;t be. Its worth the money and gives a very deep brown tan. As for people just trying to build a base tan, i would not recommend using this to do that only because it is not for that. This is to trigger a richer tan after you got the base tan going on. Use something milder to build that good base tan before moving up to this. You will just end up burning yourself badly and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you don&#x27;t burn easily. Everyone still does and CAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t ever use a tingle lotion on your face. You&#x27;ll cause blood vessels to break under the skin since its so delicate. Not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Bombshell is a major plus lotion and I am a very pleased customer. Seriously. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.on.

    <li> As described. Have no worries! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works well enough, not sure if I was as amazed as the others that reviewed it.  One thing I did like was the way it worked outside.  Was home from a knee surgery  and sat outside a couple of days using the bombshell.  I couldn&#x27;t drive, so wasn&#x27;t able to go tanning.  I am happy to report it worked very well in natural sunlight .  I would possibly buy it again though.  I didn&#x27;t  like the fact it wasn&#x27;t packaged when I received it, unlike other tanning products I&#x27;ve purchased.  The seller for this product sent it to me super quick though... I was impressed with that fact.</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s a bronzer plus tingler, giving  you a deep tan. Works great! One of my favorite tanning products!</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far. I know some people are adverse to tingle, but after tanning with regular lotions, and coming out looking no different than when I went in, I tried this lotion and it works to achieve a dark tan! Yes, you will look red when first coming out of the bed, but the redness will fade within a few hours and you will have a nice dark tan. Plus, this lotion smells awesome :)</li>
    <li> the best lotion for indoor tanning</li>
    <li> This was my first tingle lotion and I love it! It was really hot the first time I used it but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. The first few times I used it I mixed it with a bronzing lotion so it wasn&#x27;t so intense. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about two years now. I love using it in the tanning bed as well as laying pool side. Just be careful if you haven&#x27;t had much experience with tingle lotion. You can easy burn you bum ;)</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on this lotion was very low.  The worst part about the lotion was that it smelled like fruit roll ups when I put it on, and reeked of burnt fruit when I got out of the bed.  It did darken me some, but not worth the smell and nasty feel.  The next day I had the \\&quot;oompa loompa\\&quot; orange look going on, and I have never had that with other lotions.  I immediately returned it and will not touch it again.  If you are looking for a better tingle, try the Modern Bombshell here on Amazon.  I did order it from Amazon and they were fantastic about the return.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tanning lotion for years. I like the level of tingle, its not painful. And the lotion has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Love the tingle . Really got me to the next level of tanning.</li>
    <li> arrived nice and quick</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice but gave me a rash but I have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Great lotion!! gets hot and smells great.</li>
    <li> Burns too bad I don&#x27;t think it is safe.. my skin so red hot. . Then goes away. . Can&#x27;t be good for the skin</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend. My other lotion had gotten me to a certain point and then stopped. I was not getting any darker. This  lotion gave me immediate results, could see the difference after one use. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on the color this produces. You must, however, be willing to endure the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that occurs during tanning.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect lotion! This was my first tingle lotion and I absolutely love it! I get such deep color with this and my color lasts so much longer!</li>
    <li> This is the way to go if you want to avoid the high cost of tanning lotion in the salon. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Can u use it outdoor?</li>
    <li> This lotion smells nice and works great. It helps you tan so much quicker than other tanning lotions. It also has tingle.</li>
    <li> Love this product it did expired last year so was afraid would not work like I&#x27;d hope but it&#x27;s great! And love the smell not to strong of a tingle but than again I&#x27;m used to high powered tingle. If your looking for great color I recommend this</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years and have tried hundreds of lotions! Results after 1 session are incredible. Very light tingle. Will be buying this monthly. This is the lotion I have been looking for!</li>
    <li> I love this tingle lotion. It smells wonderful. I tried other lotions but I come back to this one every time!!!!</li>
    <li> I own three tanning beds, have been tanning for several years and am very adept in the practice of tanning.  I&#x27;d heard a lot about this product and finally tried it this week.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  This stuff does zero bronzing.  It feels like a watered down lotion and it made me itch everywhere....not a tingle, an itch.  Not a product I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product came very quickly and it works wonderfully.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about ordering tanning lotion on line but it came in and I tried it out and I now have a glowing tan!</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today so I just had to see how well it worked. I LOVE this!!! I&#x27;ve used another tingle/bronzer lotion which did great, but after I tanned today, I can see a massive difference in how dark I am already. The tingle isn&#x27;t very bad, just feels like you&#x27;ve been working in the sun all day. I was leery about purchasing it, but I am SUPER excited that I bought it and can&#x27;t wait to tan again. If you&#x27;ve been tanning for a while and want to get super dark - USE THIS!!!! The girls where I tan even said I was darker today than I had been after previous visits and they asked me what I used!!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product! The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons! It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic, so by no means is my skin sensitive. I&#x27;ve been tanning for months, and I want to break through my current tanning barrier. This one let me but MY GOD, it burned. I thought I was allergic or something. Great color, but 30 minutes of pain. I use it every once in a while when I need a boost but I can&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> The seller does not tell you this is a TINGLE. some buyers need to know this is a TINGLE because 90% of the tanning population can NOT handle it and they break out or have an allergic reaction. Tingles are the fastest to tan you but also the quickest to age you. Also this seller forgets to tell you the \\&quot;ingredints\\&quot; are wrong.(meaning the seller has added their own)plus this lotion is expired meaning your basically tanning with jergens lotion. (IT DOES NOTHING FOR YOU)</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t think the sizzle would immediately sun burn my skin or rather turn it bright red before the tanning bed even shut off. I am still red 5 hours and a shower later.  I guess it isn&#x27;t meant for fair skin.</li>
    <li> nice smelling lotion and I got color fast. I wasnt sure about the tingling factor but it was tolerable. All in all a great product</li>
    <li> Product was received as described, but both my girlfriend and her mother broke out in hives and welts after using the product for the first time. Your results may vary, but be aware it caused a skin reaction on both of them.</li>
    <li> Great product and received it quickly! Thanx.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing !!! I love a tingle bronzer combo ... This is by far the best !!! It is a very strong tingle but it&#x27;s not overpowering !! Definitely not for someone just starting to use tingle lotion ... It&#x27;s a great bronzer too !! I saw a difference with 1st use !!! Buy it !!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, product arrived in packaging no damage and full.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite tingles, and I get tons of color using it just twice a week! Kudos to your great price and product.</li>
    <li> I have worked in a tanning salon for about 3 years now, so needless to say, I have gotten pretty dark, tried every tanning bed, and many lotions. I started using Bombshell and was instantly darker! Yes, it does cause tingling that at first kind of felt like an Indian burn (you know, when kids at recess twist each other&#x27;s arms and it kinda burns their skin). But within a few tans, I no longer felt the burn at all! Your skin just has to get used to it. Obviously everyones skin is different so some people may feel the tingle every time, but I have VERY sensitive skin (like if I press my thumb on my arm, it leaves a red mark for 20 minutes..seriously) and Bombshell is awesome for me!!! The smell is good, kinda like bubblegum and noticeable but not overpowering. Once you&#x27;re done tanning, you and other people around you will hardly notice the scent. And it&#x27;s not unpleasant after tanning like some lotions are. (I&#x27;ve used tanning lotions that smell like Fritos and tequila after I get out of a bed....um, no thanks) This lotion has gotten me the DARKEST I have ever been (think George Lopez colored or darker) in only 3 tans! And it seems to last through tanning plateaus. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I recommend it.DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product.  If you like tingle and bronzer this gives you the results you want.</li>
    <li> smells great,i tan alot idk if its the best one ive tried.but its in top 5 .great buy tho.for the money</li>
    <li> SO i got this for in and outdoor, but only use it on my legs and stomach because it burns like freakne CRAZY and I stay red after a couple hours later so I need t take a cool shower to and I&#x27;m still flushed.  I don&#x27;t tan from chest up and use self bronzer, but I have to get some color on my legs and this is a really good product.  I actually bought this in 2011 and used only a few times, because I love my the Iluminating bronzer one, but I&#x27;ve used it 3 times in the pass 2 weeks and it still works Great!  You don&#x27;t really have to worry about tanning lotions like this going bad because the only thing that expires is stuff with SPF, which obviously you don&#x27;t want to use to get color.  I feel like my legs and thighs are in a hot sweatsuit sitting in a Hot steam room though.  If you can tolerate the heat, I&#x27;d say get This.. THe first few times you use it, you may itch, but it all depends on th person. I do HIGHLY recommend triple washing your hands with good soap and then using baby wipes and then washing AGAIN, because It&#x27;s hard to get off and even small trace amounts left behind and BURN the heck out of your face or if you rub your eyes.. Even after precautions of washing, I still managing to be a bozo and rubbed my eye and was dying..lol  DON&#x27;t  buy this at the salon even if they say sale untle it&#x27;s under $30.. The cheapest I&#x27;ve seen this in salons even good salons deals wast $68 and that was last week.  I like to price my stuff. I always buy  my Designer skins on Amazon and have yet to have any issues with any of them.. Ebay has good pricing, but they are not consistent in their price value.</li>
    <li> I liked it.  I love a strong tingle and it gets u dark</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of reviews prior to ordering this stating the tingle along with the burning sensation was too much. It wasn&#x27;t to much for me and I have not used one before. The sensation of burning and tingling lasted around 30 minutes for me. By the time I was out of the tanning bed I no longer felt it. However, it didn&#x27;t tan as dark as I thought it would. I had also bought Ed Hardy&#x27;s Black Elixir Silicone Bronzer and it really adds a deeper and darker tan with no tingle or burning.</li>
    <li> almost burned the 1st time i used it then i read the instructions.  this definately works</li>
    <li> product very well noticeable difference in tan in just one use everything it promise it worked but did cause very strong burning tingling sensation more than I expected</li>
    <li> This stuff made my skin itch and feel creepy for days.</li>
    <li> I have used (and wasted so so much $$ on different lotions bc I&#x27;m fair skinned)...but this is the BEST EVER!!!! Tingles enough you know it to accelerate,yet doesn&#x27;t fry u like flames shooting off of you.lol.I refuse to use anything BUT this,and pray it never discontinues for any reason.I&#x27;m so pale,yet when I began w/ this,I am golden brown dark,which completely shocked my family &amp; friends bc it took me till  nearly 30 yrs old to find the right combination w/ the lotion &amp; tanning beds.No they are not good for you...but it&#x27;s a chance we all take for beauty.We just have to be as careful as possible to prevent skin cancer from the beds.But I&#x27;m now 48 and no spots,no skin cancer.This product has been my best ever in nearly 18 yrs of tanning.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for the money.  Always though with any lotion that has &amp;#34; bronzes &amp;#34; , wash your hands after putting the lotion on.  I spray my hands good with the tanning bed cleaning that&#x27;s usually Available to clean the bed.  Dry hands good an rub between fingers when drying making sure you get it all off. It will  leave a color on fingers.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I am fairly &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; naturally  (Italian) I have olive tone skin so I tan fairly well and fast. But with this lotion it is immediate!!! I will say it has a tingle but it&#x27;s not bad unless you are sensitive to it.  It has a nice smell even after you get out of the bed.  I have always liked designer skin products.  This stuff works great and fast. If you have fallen into the crappy &amp;#34;tanning plateau&amp;#34; this is definitely the symtuff to get you out of it.  Buy this stuff and you won&#x27;t regret it I promise!!!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion about a week ago and just started using it! It smells so awesome and I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> So excited super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Works very good!!!</li>
    <li> I received it quickly and works great. The smell is pretty good and as for tanning it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.  I have bought several bottles from Amazon and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.  Great Tingle!!</li>
    <li> This is the first tingle I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I love it! I love the feeling of it heating up on my skin. It&#x27;s very mildly uncomfortable, definitely not painful. I use it every 2nd or 3rd tan. It definitely turns you bright red for a couple hours, so I alternate it with a standard bronzing lotion (currently using jwow one and done) for the days that I have to be somewhere right after and don&#x27;t want to look like a lobster. I get a really great bronzed skin color with using this. It looks darker, but more natural than when I use a bronzing lotion alone.</li>
    <li> Was looking for an alternative to hot to trot, which seems to have gone out of production.  This worked nearly as well and the end result was quite good.  Works best with already hot bulbs.</li>
    <li> this makes me darker in just one session, and it smells really good. very easy to rub in too. :)</li>
    <li> this stuff really worked!! it does have a slight tingle in it and made me SUPER red..the red went away after an hour and it turned to tan! love it!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, brand new &amp; in perfect condition, &amp; works VERY WELL! Highly recommended lotion</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for the first time today, and LOVE it!!! I have a nice starter tan and today I&#x27;m darker than I was!! It is great! I recommend this to everyone! :)</li>
    <li> I have used bombshell plenty of times. this bottle i got isn&#x27;t the same. it doesn&#x27;t have the tingle in it like the omes i have bought before.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion to use when I want to get dark quick. You do get quite a bit of redness with it, but you do with any tingle lotion. But if your looking to get dark fast this is the lotion for you. Only thing is that the tingle is not that strong.</li>
    <li> I threw away 25 bucks ! I put it on my body thank goodness I didn&#x27;t on my face ! I got into my tanning bed and with in  3  mins my skin started burning and itching I jumped in the shower  and washed it off  that didn&#x27;t even help after an hour and a half my skin finally stopped burning and itching! Beware of lotions that have the tingling effect ! By the way ... i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have been tanning for 20 + years and used dozens of lotions. i should have heeded the warnings on here from customers complaining about the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; as these tanning companies call it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion....get great color!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works amazing! I got noticeably tanner within a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, but pretty pale and it browned me right up nicely. The tingle helped tremendously. You should definitely get this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love the tingle. Gives me a fabulous tan. However the smell is disgusting. It smells like a burning chemical smell. your clothes will smell like burnt fruit dipped in nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. 6 days I was as tan as if I spent the whole summer laying in the sun. I love the tingle also. Feels like a slight sun burn. A little goes a long way on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great tingle lotion!!! First tingle i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;m highly addicted, Smells great goes on smooth skin feels great during and after tanning. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> loved it...didnt have to pay an arm and leg for it&lt;br /&gt;also ive used other designer skin products, they always deliver.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, never orange always brown, love the hot tingle.</li>
