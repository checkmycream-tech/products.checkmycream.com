      <li>Great under makeup</li>
      <li>Worked great - we didn&#x27;t burn but</li>
      <li>This sunblock is amazing!</li>
      <li>I am incredibly fair-skinned and burn easily.</li>

      <li>Very satisfied customer. :)</li>
      <li>Since I live in Florida, that means that during the summer time I am best friends with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most sunscreens, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and hope it will be on the market for years to come.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>Zinc-oxide is one of the better sunscreen ingredients out there as it is a barrier that bounces the suns rays off like a mirror t he dermatologist recommended a barrier sunscreen to prevent skin cancer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a perfect sunscreen for my girls, we have tried another brand from a cosmetic consultant, good coverage however due to our allergies that did not work for us, so thus the hunt was on for one that was fragrance free or that had a scent that is/was tolerable</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin, this is a great way to block the sun.</li>
      <li>Great for people with sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want their sunblock to have an odor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunblocks and one problem they all have is they burn your eyes (even when it states on the package tear free)</li>
      <li>sure that&#x27;s the zinc oxide), but blends in fabulously with make-up.</li>
      <li>It was recommended by our pediatrician for our 6 month old and it did the job and well - easy to apply and great protection in and out of the water.</li>
      <li>I feel safe putting this sunscreen on my face and body, a good replacement for the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands including high end sunscreens, but I&#x27;m happy enough with this line that I&#x27;m sticking to it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works better than other products out there, my friends ended up borrowing mine for their kids because it was that good.</li>
      <li>We were so happy to enjoy being active without burning eyeballs!</li>
      <li>year, my dermatologist gave me a sample of this Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free sunscreen.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>works very very well and plan to use it all the time</li>
      <li>If anything, I think it actually makes my skin look better since it&#x27;s also moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Baby \\&quot;Pure and</li>
      <li>My freckles are now much lighter, my skin is softer and smoother.  </li>
      <li>Used at the beach and worked really well.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like that I have to really rub it into her skin else</li>
      <li>Gently rub and rinse immediately.</li>
      <li>that is the whole point</li>
      <li>It really put a damper on all of the beach volleyball and water sports we like to engage in.</li>
      <li>though it can happen if you use too much or don&#x27;t rub in enough)&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sunblock rubs in nice and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind.</li>
      <li>I love some of the other neutrogena sunscreens but I can&#x27;t put them close to my eyes because of the watering and stinging.</li>
      <li>our faces at all but did get a very light tan (granted we typically didn&#x27;t reapply).</li>
      <li>I bought this item with high expectations since it is said to be the number one dermatologist recommended sun block.</li>
      <li>I can rub it on my one year old without too much resistance and</li>
      <li>Then proceed as normal with toner and/ or moisturizer, etc...</li>
      <li>but I thought it was important to mention for anyone using this or any other sunscreen for their face.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
      <li>My son didn&#x27;t burn at all after a long day on a very sunny, hot beach.</li>
      <li>Even while struggling with a 2 year old who won&#x27;t keep her face still, I was able to get it on and not showing with just a few wipes.</li>
      <li>We recently went on vacation with bunch of our friends with kids, after first day and lots of screeming, everyone was using my Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>he&#x27;s 2 1/2 years old.</li>
      <li>My dermotologists recommended this to me to use on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>much cheaper than cotz and about the same.  </li>
      <li>there was no reaction to the sensitive baby skin, it wasnt oily or anything.</li>
      <li>far as break outs go, I&#x27;ve discovered I would always break out no matter what sunscreen I used until I began washing with baking soda.</li>
      <li>This is the only type of sunscreen we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s and kids&#x27; eyes during normal use (or when swimming or sweating).</li>
      <li>It also seems to last whole day just like the regular ones.</li>
      <li>I use my favorite cleanser, rinse, then, while skin is still wet,  rub in a baking soda with water mixed to a little more waterier than a paste but still thick enough to get on finger tips.</li>
      <li>recently went to hawaii with my 9 month old, and she didnt get burned at all.</li>
      <li>Free\\&quot; is not only free of fragrance, it only uses the physical sunscreens (unlike some other \\&quot;baby\\&quot; brands) and it goes on white, then clears to transparent when you apply it.</li>
      <li>If you look at the ingredient list on \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; sunblock, you will often see the same chemical sunblocks as in regular formulae, but the difference is that fragrance is eliminated or reduced.</li>
      <li>This product is the first one I&#x27;ve found that protects my face without being too heavy and making me break out, feel greasy, sting, or make me cry when it gets in my eyes, all the while providing me with 50+ protection.</li>
      <li>But as it happens, I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of the sunblocks used in sun protection, so I am limited to \\&quot;physical\\&quot; sunblock, which is titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, two metallic oxides that essentially reflect and block the sun&#x27;s rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;This is a small tube and can go in your purse, ready to put on if you are outside.</li>
<li> It does leave a faint light whiteish glow to your skin</li>
<li> /&gt;i would recommend this for long exposure without makeup ... like long trip or on the beach</li>
<li> We have tried at least five \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; sunblocks for him with only one not resulting in hives and a rash.</li>
<li> This is a little grittier than the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock</li>
<li> If you do not want your face to look pale white, do not buy this.</li>
<li> (so I wouldn&#x27;t use this for anything other than on vacation) but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
<li> one complaint is that it goes on very white, so you have to spend some time rubbing it in, and be very careful not to get it on your hair or eyebrows -- otherwise you&#x27;ll look like a ghost for the day.</li>
<li> We vacation in the Caribbean frequently and were SO annoyed with every sunblock running into the eyes and stinging.</li>
<li> /&gt;It should be noted that I don&#x27;t typically have \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin, however when it comes to sunscreens on my face, I have a problem with the fragrances affecting my eyeballs.</li>
<li> So even though it&#x27;s a little expensive it will last you a long time!</li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> I waste my money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a woman and wear sunblock every time I leave my house no matter what the weather is, but doing that everyday has always had its problems (stinging eyes, acne, too oily ...</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s a minor complaint, so I&#x27;m still giving this five stars!</li>
<li> but no more.  </li>
<li> No more itchy skin and no teary eyes with this.</li>
<li> even after makeup the skin appears thick and dull .&lt;br</li>
<li> Like every other sunblock I&#x27;ve tried there is some acne, but it isn&#x27;t that bad when compared to the other</li>
<li> I was very disappointed later because this sun block literally applies to your face like a white mask.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
<li> Made my poor baby&#x27;s eyes water a lot.</li>
<li> They eye watering and fussing was sad though.</li>
<li> But unfortunately the sunblock that worked is difficult to find, so I tried this one.</li>
<li> But I hate wearing sunscreen if I&#x27;m just going out for the day (and not specifically going to the pool or beach).</li>
<li> and I hate that,</li>
<li> it comes out creamy but is horrible to rub in, almost as if I&#x27;m rubbing my girlies</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dermotologists recommended this to me to use on my sensitive skin. Worked like a charm. Very satisfied customer. :)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Didn&#x27;t cause any skin break outs</li>
    <li> This sunblock rubs in nice and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind. Even while struggling with a 2 year old who won&#x27;t keep her face still, I was able to get it on and not showing with just a few wipes.</li>
    <li> Zinc-oxide is one of the better sunscreen ingredients out there as it is a barrier that bounces the suns rays off like a mirror t he dermatologist recommended a barrier sunscreen to prevent skin cancer.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin -- I don&#x27;t tan, I turn into a lobster. But I hate wearing sunscreen if I&#x27;m just going out for the day (and not specifically going to the pool or beach). Sunscreen always feels gross, smells gross, and makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, my dermatologist gave me a sample of this Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free sunscreen. I tried it out, and it felt great, didn&#x27;t smell, and best of all didn&#x27;t make me break out. If anything, I think it actually makes my skin look better since it&#x27;s also moisturizing. And yes, it works for preventing sunburn -- that is the whole point, right? It does tend to run a bit if I&#x27;m playing tennis or exercising outside, but all sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it goes on very white, so you have to spend some time rubbing it in, and be very careful not to get it on your hair or eyebrows -- otherwise you&#x27;ll look like a ghost for the day. But it&#x27;s a minor complaint, so I&#x27;m still giving this five stars!</li>
    <li> We kept running into problems with every sunblock because of my sons allergies and he is always rubs his eyes.  We haven&#x27;t had a problem yet with this one! Goes on and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a little grittier than the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock but I needed a sun block for my face that wouldn&#x27;t make my eyes water. This is perfect. It will leave a white residue when using alone(I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the zinc oxide), but blends in fabulously with make-up. It provides the protection I need without the scent or irritation of others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that I don&#x27;t typically have \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin, however when it comes to sunscreens on my face, I have a problem with the fragrances affecting my eyeballs. Even if I only apply sunscreen to my cheeks, it will somehow irritate my eyes, making them watery and bloodshot. I figured a baby sunblock would do the trick and I&#x27;m so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as break outs go, I&#x27;ve discovered I would always break out no matter what sunscreen I used until I began washing with baking soda. I use my favorite cleanser, rinse, then, while skin is still wet,  rub in a baking soda with water mixed to a little more waterier than a paste but still thick enough to get on finger tips. Gently rub and rinse immediately. It removes the residue from cleanser PLUS it exfoliates and removes anything clogging up pores. Then proceed as normal with toner and/ or moisturizer, etc... I do this every morning and night with excellent results. (I would recommend only using at night if you&#x27;re just now trying this technique).&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the BS (baking soda) side note, but I thought it was important to mention for anyone using this or any other sunscreen for their face.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sunscreens. This product is great.</li>
    <li> opened box. the number of product does not match with its box</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. It works well. I can rub it on my one year old without too much resistance and yet it is not runny.</li>
    <li> Will not aggravate your skin nor will it leave a scent. Great for people with sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want their sunblock to have an odor.</li>
    <li> I receive the product  on september and i want to use it for vacations this january 2014 after 3 months the product arrive, and the product expires  on november 2013.... I waste my money. The supplier must check the date of expires before send it. Dont buy this to cosmetic liquidations</li>
    <li> If you look at the ingredient list on \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; sunblock, you will often see the same chemical sunblocks as in regular formulae, but the difference is that fragrance is eliminated or reduced. But as it happens, I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of the sunblocks used in sun protection, so I am limited to \\&quot;physical\\&quot; sunblock, which is titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, two metallic oxides that essentially reflect and block the sun&#x27;s rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baby \\&quot;Pure and Free\\&quot; is not only free of fragrance, it only uses the physical sunscreens (unlike some other \\&quot;baby\\&quot; brands) and it goes on white, then clears to transparent when you apply it. I stayed out all day at the harbor in Baltimore during \\&quot;Sailibration\\&quot; (bicentennial of the War of 1812) and didn&#x27;t even get a tan, let alone burned. I lent it to one of the friends along for the event, who put it on scalp, arms and face and he also did not get burned--and he&#x27;s fairer than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small tube and can go in your purse, ready to put on if you are outside. I&#x27;d even suggest, if you drive a lot, put it on your \\&quot;drive\\&quot; arm to give extra sun protection. If you have very sensitive skin, this is a great way to block the sun.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist as she has molluscum dermatitis. I think it works but I don&#x27;t like that I have to really rub it into her skin else it would leave her skin white. She has a tan complexion.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey my husband and I needed to try something different so we gave this a shot. And oh how happy we were with it! We vacation in the Caribbean frequently and were SO annoyed with every sunblock running into the eyes and stinging. It really put a damper on all of the beach volleyball and water sports we like to engage in. This sunblock is amazing! You only need like a half-dime size amount to cover your entire face. So even though it&#x27;s a little expensive it will last you a long time! It does leave a faint light whiteish glow to your skin (so I wouldn&#x27;t use this for anything other than on vacation) but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s very thick so it&#x27;s not runny at all but the times it did get in our eyes it didn&#x27;t sting AT ALL! We were so happy to enjoy being active without burning eyeballs! Worked great - we didn&#x27;t burn but our faces at all but did get a very light tan (granted we typically didn&#x27;t reapply). As a side note, we just used regular sunscreen on the rest of our bodies to save money. Just used this on faces and hands. We are very satisfied with it and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> much cheaper than cotz and about the same.  Has way more chemicals than cotz but its really good for a day at the pool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a perfect sunscreen for my girls, we have tried another brand from a cosmetic consultant, good coverage however due to our allergies that did not work for us, so thus the hunt was on for one that was fragrance free or that had a scent that is/was tolerable....I do trust J&amp;J however with this one it comes out creamy but is horrible to rub in, almost as if I&#x27;m rubbing my girlies skin off just to rub this in it also leaves a white film in spite of rubbing for dear life, so now we are on the hunt again, thank you but no thank you :0(</li>
    <li> it gives a white flash and residue like there is something oily on the skin . even after makeup the skin appears thick and dull .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this for long exposure without makeup ... like long trip or on the beach</li>
    <li> works very very well and plan to use it all the time</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen, it works well, doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy, and keeps me protected! And best of all no stinging eyes!!! I love some of the other neutrogena sunscreens but I can&#x27;t put them close to my eyes because of the watering and stinging. This eliminates the problem, love it!</li>
    <li> Used at the beach and worked really well. Works better than other products out there, my friends ended up borrowing mine for their kids because it was that good.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sunscreens, but not this one.  I feel safe putting this sunscreen on my face and body, a good replacement for the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Made my poor baby&#x27;s eyes water a lot. Also left white color on skin which is traditional of baby sunscreen I guess. They eye watering and fussing was sad though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunblocks and one problem they all have is they burn your eyes (even when it states on the package tear free) Both my kids and I hate that, but no more.  I used Neutrogena and it gives very good protection from the sun and it does not burn our eyes.  We recently went on vacation with bunch of our friends with kids, after first day and lots of screeming, everyone was using my Neutrogena. Love this product and hope it will be on the market for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and wear sunblock every time I leave my house no matter what the weather is, but doing that everyday has always had its problems (stinging eyes, acne, too oily ... you name it - I&#x27;ve dealt with it). I&#x27;ve tried many brands including high end sunscreens, but I&#x27;m happy enough with this line that I&#x27;m sticking to it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No stinging eyes&lt;br /&gt;- No irritation whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;- Great under makeup&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t smell!&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy&lt;br /&gt;- No white cast (though it can happen if you use too much or don&#x27;t rub in enough)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Like every other sunblock I&#x27;ve tried there is some acne, but it isn&#x27;t that bad when compared to the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s such a pain to rub/brush it correctly when it gets on the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;- Rubbing it in to avoid the ghost face can take some time</li>
    <li> recently went to hawaii with my 9 month old, and she didnt get burned at all. there was no reaction to the sensitive baby skin, it wasnt oily or anything. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am incredibly fair-skinned and burn easily. Since I live in Florida, that means that during the summer time I am best friends with sunscreen. This product is the first one I&#x27;ve found that protects my face without being too heavy and making me break out, feel greasy, sting, or make me cry when it gets in my eyes, all the while providing me with 50+ protection. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works great, covers well. The only reason it got 4 stars from me is the &amp;#34;zinc look&amp;#34; that never rubs in. We used it on our faces when we went to Belize, (from MI) no sunburn!</li>
    <li> My son didn&#x27;t burn at all after a long day on a very sunny, hot beach. The sunblock does look white/pinkish on his brown skin, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all and neither does he... he&#x27;s 2 1/2 years old.</li>
    <li> This is the only type of sunscreen we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s and kids&#x27; eyes during normal use (or when swimming or sweating). Suggest using on backs of hands &amp; arms in addition to the face for the kiddos so when they inevitably wipe their face/eyes, they won&#x27;t complain of burning eyes.</li>
    <li> No more itchy skin and no teary eyes with this. Yes, it looks like you have painted your face white, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I use it when hiking or biking and my looks don&#x27;t concern me. What matters is that when I sweat this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It also seems to last whole day just like the regular ones.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunblock for about two years.  I have to use sunblock in both summer and winter.  My freckles are now much lighter, my skin is softer and smoother.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with high expectations since it is said to be the number one dermatologist recommended sun block. I was very disappointed later because this sun block literally applies to your face like a white mask. I have very fair skin, and I can&#x27;t bear with this. If you do not want your face to look pale white, do not buy this. Or else, I believe it works well to protect your skin from the sun.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by our pediatrician for our 6 month old and it did the job and well - easy to apply and great protection in and out of the water.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunblock because the ingredient list was very similar to a sunblock that worked well for my son. We have tried at least five \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; sunblocks for him with only one not resulting in hives and a rash. But unfortunately the sunblock that worked is difficult to find, so I tried this one. However, this sunblock resulted in hives and a rash that lasted for five days even with treatment with an antihistamine. Not for the ultra-sensitive....</li>
