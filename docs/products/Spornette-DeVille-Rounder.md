      <li>Works great and is durable.</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>great for drying you hair to give it some curl.  </li>
      <li>Out of all three brushes the 1 1/2 inch work the best for her, and she prefers to use this one the most.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have been more perfect.</li>
      <li>It is a nice choice for hair brush, but I don&#x27;t find it outstanding - I can&#x27;t find an awesome one.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not as good at rolling it as the gal who does my hair.</li>
      <li>A good boar brush for the price.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find this brush on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Great quality for a real Boar bristle brush,  great price.  </li>
      <li>it is a nice handled brush.  </li>
      <li>The wood is well made and cleans up nicely.  </li>
      <li>So far, thought, it seems quality and gives me a perfect curl up the ends of my hair.  </li>
      <li>One was OK</li>
      <li>i would love it</li>
      <li>The bristles catch and hold while I&#x27;m drying under to create a &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; - the bristles hold just fine (better than plastic bristles).  </li>
      <li>A boar&#x27;s hair brush isn&#x27;t something to get excited about, but this is a really good one &amp; the size is just right.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>The brush itself was fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used brushes before (including boar bristles) and I like this one just fine.</li>
      <li>this brush is great for giving them lift and achieving the same look</li>
      <li>Good construction and natural boar bistles.  </li>
      <li>A natural brush- my favorite!</li>
      <li>I would love it if would have the white strong teeth to help make the hair more stable</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this brush.</li>
      <li>Not as good as larger version</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Amazon did a simple refund which I&#x27;m glad.</li>
      <li>she has short, fine hair</li>
      <li>It is a lightweight brush but seems to be very well made.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s just my experience.</li>
      <li>Looked hi and lo for this brush to replace a 30 year old original (yes, thirty years old brush!)</li>
      <li>I think I would like it even better if the handle were a little bigger around, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>#312 really helps me dry them straight without a flat-iron.</li>
      <li>The old brush I have has no name on it</li>
      <li>She prefers natural brushes beacuse</li>
      <li>So far I am sticking with this one.</li>
      <li>The boar bristles are more gentle to my hair and they don&#x27;t produce the awful static that plastic bristles can and do produce.  </li>
      <li>i was looking for a wooden/boar bristle brush, it works better to distribute oil and grab thin or short hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is short and very fine and thin, and I have a brush that will blow my hair dry and in style, but when I try other brushes, they catch in my hair, or do absolutely nothing.  </li>

<li> I love Spornette brushes, have never had a bad one yet.  </li>
<li> I certainly am not having any luck.</li>
<li> Works well for little stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t blow dry in place.</li>

<li> but the other had some missing hair.</li>
<li> Round wooden brushes with 100% boar bristles are hard to find ...</li>
<li> Wish it was slightly longer to get all my bangs</li>
<li> I mean bunches of hair were missing and there were some loose hair in the bag as well!</li>
<li> I have been searching for a small found brush to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
<li> it allows me to do small curls.</li>
<li> not sure how either..  </li>
<li> Wish someone could suggest a brush that is small with plastic bristles and a cushioned handle like this one I purchased.  </li>
<li> actually they are impossible to find in my area, and I have looked for years.  </li>
<li> so that makes it impossible to find.  </li>
<li> so I won&#x27;t feel bad about this getting beat up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased 2 brushes one smaller,  and then this one.  Same seller. Love them both!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well for little stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t blow dry in place.</li>
    <li> This review is from a female* -&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a haircut and i have bangs that need to be styled, otherwise they just fall flat on my face. this brush is great for giving them lift and achieving the same look i had when i left the salon.  i was looking for a wooden/boar bristle brush, it works better to distribute oil and grab thin or short hair.</li>
    <li> Not as good as larger version</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a small found brush to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for years.  My hair is short and very fine and thin, and I have a brush that will blow my hair dry and in style, but when I try other brushes, they catch in my hair, or do absolutely nothing.  This brush was that for me.  Did nothing.  Became tangled and couldn&#x27;t use.  Also purchased another at the same time in a different style hoping that one would work, but not so.  Still looking.  The old brush I have has no name on it so that makes it impossible to find.  Wish someone could suggest a brush that is small with plastic bristles and a cushioned handle like this one I purchased.  I certainly am not having any luck.</li>
    <li> A natural brush- my favorite!</li>
    <li> Looked hi and lo for this brush to replace a 30 year old original (yes, thirty years old brush!) and was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be the same. Couldn&#x27;t have been more perfect.</li>
    <li> A good boar brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I have bangs and this brush #312 really helps me dry them straight without a flat-iron. Wish it was slightly longer to get all my bangs but it definitely still does the trick!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s just my experience. Have very short hair and I&#x27;m not as good at rolling it as the gal who does my hair.</li>
    <li> It is a nice choice for hair brush, but I don&#x27;t find it outstanding - I can&#x27;t find an awesome one. So far I am sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> I would love it if would have the white strong teeth to help make the hair more stable i would love it</li>
    <li> The brush itself was fine.  Good construction and natural boar bistles.  It was just smaller than what I thought it would be.  I need a bigger one.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I was concerned that the boar bristle would pull my hair or get entangled in it. So far I&#x27;m loving this brush. It is a lightweight brush but seems to be very well made. I&#x27;ve used brushes before (including boar bristles) and I like this one just fine. I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so if anything changes, I&#x27;ll add to this post. So far, thought, it seems quality and gives me a perfect curl up the ends of my hair.  The bristles catch and hold while I&#x27;m drying under to create a &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; - the bristles hold just fine (better than plastic bristles).  I would buy this brush again!</li>
    <li> Does the job. Would purchase again if I needed one.  it is a nice handled brush.  it allows me to do small curls.</li>
    <li> I ordered two Spornette No.312 Deville Hair Brushes. One was OK but the other had some missing hair. I mean bunches of hair were missing and there were some loose hair in the bag as well! Amazon did a simple refund which I&#x27;m glad.</li>
    <li> Round wooden brushes with 100% boar bristles are hard to find ... actually they are impossible to find in my area, and I have looked for years.  I was thrilled to find this brush on Amazon.  The boar bristles are more gentle to my hair and they don&#x27;t produce the awful static that plastic bristles can and do produce.  The wood is well made and cleans up nicely.  I use this brush when I am drying my hair as it curls my bangs without my having to use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> A boar&#x27;s hair brush isn&#x27;t something to get excited about, but this is a really good one &amp; the size is just right.</li>
    <li> I purchase the 3/4 inch, the 1 1/2 inch and the 1 3/4 inch brush by Spornette for my mother because she want to replace her current brush. She prefers natural brushes beacuse she has short, fine hair and they work best for her. Out of all three brushes the 1 1/2 inch work the best for her, and she prefers to use this one the most.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a real Boar bristle brush,  great price.  Who needs a designer brand at double or triple the cost.</li>
    <li> This was for my mom, she&#x27;s been needing one as she has short hair. Works great and is durable. Great price so I won&#x27;t feel bad about this getting beat up.</li>
    <li> I wanted a brush that was just a little smaller around than the one I use everyday, and this one is just what I was looking for.  I love Spornette brushes, have never had a bad one yet.  I think I would like it even better if the handle were a little bigger around, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> it just what I wanted</li>
    <li> to the point.  exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Always just bought something from the drugstore...  This totally eliminates any frizz, not sure how either..  I&#x27;m sold and have bought the larger size as well...</li>
    <li> this was just what i was looking for.  great for drying you hair to give it some curl.  would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> perfect size and good quality.</li>
