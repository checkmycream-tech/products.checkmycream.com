<li> The blushes can suit a wide range of complexions and the bronzers and the highlight are buildable and blendable.</li>
<li> the blushes are really hard to get on the brushes.</li>
<li> a few of the shimmers are a little sheer and muddy looking and everything smells like baby wipes which ist bad but rather weird</li>
<li> I think this is fake...</li>
<li> You would have to keep on applying the blush to even get a faint amount of color on your cheeks.</li>
