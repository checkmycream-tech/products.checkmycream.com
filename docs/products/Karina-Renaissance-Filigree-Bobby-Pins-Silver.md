      <li>Simple, yet something unique...</li>
      <li>I was really quite surprised at how pretty these bobby pins were.  </li>
      <li>Have received tons of compliments on these beautiful pins, but the one drawback is that the ridges are on the wrong side.</li>

      <li>They hold pretty tightly as well.</li>
      <li>they are pretty but one of the flowers is welded on uneven nothing that you will notice unless you look.</li>
      <li>These are beautiful - a tiny bit heavy for thin hair, but the clip part is tight so it stays in place well.  </li>

<li> Bought these for my 6 year old little girl.  </li>
<li> These silver bobby pins are about 2 inches long.</li>
<li> and I think they look much more expensive in person!  </li>
<li> The round attachments are bigger than I thought.  </li>
<li> I still use the other though wish I had both.</li>
<li> My only issue is they are very stiff and hard to open to clip in your hair.</li>
<li> One of the pins arrived with it&#x27;s center stone missing.</li>
<li> I really like them and now only have one usable Bobby pin!! :(</li>
<li> I wear these to dress up my everyday and work attire.</li>
<li> They are a bit heavy on one end and tend to slip.  </li>
<li> A bit heavy, fall out of my hair.  </li>
<li> When I try to use them to hold a small section of my bangs off to the side, the heaviness of the filigree decoration causes the pin to slide down.</li>
<li> have a shorter hair cut, so it&#x27;s difficult to find a spot with enough hair for one of the pins to stay put.</li>
<li> I have thick wavy hair, and theses babies hold my hair in place all day.</li>
<li> I lost one unfortunately but the other I wear often.</li>
<li> If you have thin hair, these pins may not be for you.</li>
<li> They stay tight in your hair, and do not fall out !!!!</li>
<li> Not impressive!</li>
<li> However, they were packed horribly and arrived broken!  </li>

    <li> They&#x27;re cute, decorative and do the job.</li>
    <li> I think that these are very pretty and old fashioned at the same time. The Bobby pin is taut and stays where you put it.  Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll still give these pins 5 stars because they are beautiful. Not too big or showy for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shorter hair cut, so it&#x27;s difficult to find a spot with enough hair for one of the pins to stay put. If you have thin hair, these pins may not be for you.</li>
    <li> I have purchased pins and barrettes the last several months to fix my now-longer hair. These fasteners are just lovely. They are perfect for elegant evening wear and for the modern hippie style that I also love.</li>
    <li> They look excellent in light brown hair.  They are a bit heavy on one end and tend to slip.  However, a few adjustments during the day and they still work great!</li>
    <li> I use these pins to keep my prayer veil on.  They do not distract from wearing one, and it does add a nice touch to it. They stay tight in your hair, and do not fall out !!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, and will recommend to buy. Just one thing it is a bit too big on my test, anyway I like it.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy, fall out of my hair.  Others might not have the same problem.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty to accent a bun or chignon.  I&#x27;ve had them quite a while and they haven&#x27;t discolored or lost stones.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. A bit larger than I thought they would be but relieved that they are good quality and look like they will last.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as picture.  The round attachments are bigger than I thought.  They are well made.</li>

    <li> These silver bobby pins are about 2 inches long. Each filigree decoration is 1 inch in diameter. Very pretty with an antique feel!</li>

    <li> So pretty and I had high hopes but the flower broke off one! I still use the other though wish I had both.</li>
    <li> nice prompt delivery but when i opened the package the two hair accessories are the same design and size but two noticabley different colors. they are pretty but one of the flowers is welded on uneven nothing that you will notice unless you look. i wont send them back because i dont want to fool with it.</li>

    <li> They are so darn cute!!!! I just recieved them todaty and I can not wait to wait them!! I&#x27;d recommend them to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I now how have used these Bobby pins twice.  Today the pretty filigree part broke away from the pin.  What a shame!!! I really like them and now only have one usable Bobby pin!! :(</li>
    <li> Have received tons of compliments on these beautiful pins, but the one drawback is that the ridges are on the wrong side. They need to be secured crosswise with regular bobby pins. Still great flair, but flawed.</li>
    <li> very pretty - the wife loved them.  They are a perfect size for a little accent in the hair.  She wears them all the time.  One of the gems did fall off, but i hot glue-gunned it, and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
