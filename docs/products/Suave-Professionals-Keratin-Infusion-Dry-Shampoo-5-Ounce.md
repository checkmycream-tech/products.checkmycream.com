<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells amazing, but makes my hair feel a little too much like I have product in it. I prefer the &#x27;Psssssst Dry Shampoo&#x27; much more because even though it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or with a lot of product in. My hair is more shiny and voluminous with Psssssst and Suave makes it look more dry and a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> this product is great. i will be purchasing this again! it is just what i needed! does not leave your hair looking greasy but does just what it needs to giving your hair a boost for that extra day</li>
    <li> This is one of the best dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. I used to have it on subscribe and save but it is not longer part of that program. I&#x27;m having  a hard time finding it in my area and I wish that Amazon would bring it back. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> Smells awful, doesn&#x27;t work.  Wish they&#x27;d bring back the good one w the yellow cap :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and it seems to work very well on my hair.  I don&#x27;t see any white residue that you get from other brands.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product, I get a new can sent to me every two months. The smell is pleasant and it does its job. I can go days without washing my hair and not have it look dirty or greasy. I have dark hair and as long as I rub it in the roots and brush it out there isn&#x27;t any visible residue. I absolutely love this stuff and am halfway convinced it&#x27;s magic in an aerosol can.</li>
    <li> I have been using a salon shake in product for volume, at 4 x the price. This gives me much more control of product application, and is not sticky, or &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; feeling in my hair. Just enough to keep fine hair from falling flat in Arkansas humidity.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at least it did the one and only time I tried it, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the strong scent that reminds me of \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; hairspray. Not interested in smelling like that, myself. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Yep! You read right! I&#x27;ve tried the salon brands and the drug store brands, but this is the best product out there. I don&#x27;t have blond hair--more of a light brown--so I spray it on at night right near my part (but under the top layer!), as well as in other strategic places like right above my neck and in a line at ear-level, and it works wonders. My blowout lasts for 4-5 days using this product and my hair feels clean and voluminous. A little goes a long way, and duh, don&#x27;t spray it on your part in the morning. Plan ahead and you will be rewarded!</li>
    <li> It feels fresh when you spray it on your hair, but no noticeable difference. The smell is great though.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a smaller spray bottle than I imagined and gets used up quite fast.</li>
    <li> You spray this on &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; hair. It does really well, except that it is a little bit &amp;#34;hairsprayish&amp;#34; in texture.</li>
    <li> If you color your hair, you know how expensive it can be, and what a pain it can be to keep up with the colorings...especially if you&#x27;re like me and color your hair auburn or red. It will fade. To help with this, you can actually extend the life of your colorings by using dry shampoo in between washings. If you&#x27;re not a teenager and don&#x27;t have super oily hair, you really don&#x27;t need to wash it every single day. You really just need a refresh every other day or so. By using dry shampoo on the in-between days, you can double the life of your coloring. It won&#x27;t do a thing for the roots, but it will stop half the fading you would normally get, which is what makes your roots show up so badly. I found this out when I got gout (of all things) and had to basin-bathe for a couple weeks (I know, I know) and had to use this on my hair because I just couldn&#x27;t stand it (and literally, I couldn&#x27;t stand up on my foot)...my hair was clean and smelled fresh, was soft and silky and I felt fine about it. Not to mention, I noticed that my red hair did not fade out. So I decided to tell my friends, family and colleagues...and now YOU...you should keep a can of this on hand. If you have long hair, like I do, it will last about 3 or 4 good &amp;#34;shampooings&amp;#34; but for $2, that isn&#x27;t a bad deal. Plus, it&#x27;s an awesome deal here on Amazon. Honestly, it&#x27;s cheaper here than at my local drugstore. I&#x27;ve tried different Suave dry shampoos and they are all about the same for cleaning, but this one seems to add a luster that the others don&#x27;t, possibly due to the keratin. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My hair gets oily very quickly, which meant that I had to shower daily. This spray helps me stretch that out to every other day. I don&#x27;t think I can go without it now!</li>
    <li> I wanted to give dry shampoo a try but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works in that it got rid of the oily roots and gives tremendous volume. However, the scent is so overwhelmingly strong that I just couldn&#x27;t bear it a couple of hours later. I needed to wash it out before I got a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only they could make this product fragrance free or at least change the current smell. Just awful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on different dry shampoos. This one is one of (if not) the cheapest I&#x27;ve bought and it works better than the others. Most cans I&#x27;ve purchased run out after four or five uses. This usually lasts about ten or more. I have shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: As with ANY aerosol, don&#x27;t hold the sprayer down. You&#x27;ll end up using way more than you need to and running out faster. Spray in short quick bursts aiming where you need product. By holding it down, you&#x27;re coating and recoating areas you&#x27;ve already hit. It&#x27;s an easy way to ensure you use less product and hit only the areas you need to hit. This works for everything from spray paint to glass cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the negative reviews...&lt;br /&gt;- Some people say it doesn&#x27;t last long. It lasts just as long as every other dry shampoo on the market. I&#x27;ve tried most. Try spraying \\&quot;shots\\&quot; of product instead of just holding the sprayer down like I mention above. This one is at least on par with other products. I think better.&lt;br /&gt;- Some people have said the smell is nasty or overpowering. Makes me wonder how much they&#x27;re using. I like the scent, it&#x27;s floral, possibly a bit \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; smelling but it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;- Some people say it turns their hair grey especially noticeable on darker hair. If I notice that it seems to have lightened my fairly dark hair, I just brush my hair until it blends in. I mean... the reason this product works is because it&#x27;s spraying a powder onto your hair. The powder absorbs oil. If you can see the powder on your hair, there&#x27;s no oil to absorb and you didn&#x27;t need to use it in the first place. Still I think most all hair is oily enough to absorb a reasonable amount. Try using less by spot spraying like I mentioned above and then go from there.&lt;br /&gt;- Some people have said it changes the texture of their hair. I don&#x27;t disagree with this. If you use too much it will probably dry your hair out. (Temporarily until you wash the product out of your hair.) It&#x27;s a powder that&#x27;s meant to absorb moisture so it&#x27;s SUPPOSED to dry your hair out. It only makes sense that you shouldn&#x27;t overdo it or you&#x27;ll overdry your hair. Using this product makes my hair feel thicker and look \\&quot;bigger.\\&quot; It does feel a little dry, but not like straw as some have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the problems people have with this product are due to overuse or not understanding the product to begin with. It&#x27;s called a dry shampoo, but it is not washing your hair, it&#x27;s just absorbing oil. Some of the residue can be brushed out, but the product definitely stays in your hair until you wash it with liquid shampoo and water. If you don&#x27;t like this product, you&#x27;re not going to like any dry shampoo. As far as dry shampoos go, this is one of, if not the best.</li>
    <li> the smell is extremely terrible. I had read other reviews, and a lot of them complained about the smell. If you still want to use it, I&#x27;d advise spraying it in half an hour before you mean to go out, and just let the smell evaporate so you dont smell weird.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Has a nice smell to it and leaves your hair flowing nicely and adds body to it.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great product and I can&#x27;t believe it has taken me this long to discover dry shampoo! I have medium blonde hair, very thick hair that looks greasy on day 2, so this allows me to touch things up on day 2 and even get 3 days out of a wash and condition! The spray does come out white but it brushes into my hair color just fine, but I could see how dark hair might have trouble. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is VERY strongly scented. I am not overly sensitive but I turn on the bathroom fan to help counteract it.</li>
    <li> Works great to fluff up hair when dull and/or dirty. Comb and style after spraying on.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a very high-end salon product. I love that it adds body to my fine hair and when I make a mistake and put too much serum or other styling oil to my hair, I can immediately \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the problem with Suave dry shampoos. Can&#x27;t beat the price and it works like a dream.</li>
    <li> great to use when you can&#x27;t wash your hair or after gym if you need to return to work.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! I use it in conjunction with the Suave&#x27;s Dry Conditioner and whenever I do, my hair becomes softer, smoother (no frizz) and generally just feels incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mixed, so generally I only wash my hair once a week - I use this product mid-week to get rid of the oil, add volume and just keep my style fresh. It works like a dream, whether I have my hair straightened or keep the curls.  I would definitely suggest trying this if you haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
    <li> I have tried other dry shampoos, and I keep coming back to this one.  The others I&#x27;ve tried were more expensive, but they somehow made my hair more ratty and less glossy when I&#x27;d use them.  This Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo does exactly what it should - takes away the oil, and it even volumizes the roots nicely, and it seems to leave the hair with a nice gloss.  The only negative is that it smells like a freaking chemical bomb.  The smell is absolutely nasty, I can&#x27;t stand it.  But like I said, I&#x27;ve tried others, and I keep going back to this despite the smell because I like this one the best.</li>
    <li> Suave makes the best dry shampoos! Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands. These ones work, smell great, are a great price, and are nice big bottles. They clean my hair great on days I don&#x27;t wash it, and add great volume and texture.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo for the price. Give my hair texture and fullness and take a away all the grease. For dark hair you do have to brush it out a lot but that is to be expected with any dry shampoo that is not invisible or tinted.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the overpowering smell that some other brands do.  Very happy with that.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Works better than the powdered stuff but the hair still doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. people ask me what kind of shampoo I use. i have other brands, they don&#x27;t smell as &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i have used so many different dry shampoos and this one is the best in this price range! I&#x27;ve bought really nice brands that are $20-$30 range and they are great, but no better than Suave&#x27;s. Some dry shampoos show white flakes even if you barely spray any on your hair. But this product takes a good 2 coats before white flakes start showing and even if they do, they are only noticeable when looking very closely. I have medium to dark brown hair if that helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great and adds volume!!! The volume doesn&#x27;t last as long as other products like Big Sexy&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s 2nd best to that product and is at least $12 cheaper. I have really fine hair, so I&#x27;m not sure if it has the effect to thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t stop searching for any type of product until it meets my high nearly if not completely perfect expectations. I have tried MANY dry shampoos and spent a fortune on this journey only to find out I could have been hardly paying anything for an amazing one! My hair gets oily after even one day but I have it died red so I don&#x27;t want to wash it more then once or twice a week. I know that is a tall order for any dry shampoo but this one Actually rises to the challenge and meets my expections! Stop wasting money and just move on to this one! You can buy it at Walmart for under three bucks too!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair looks absolutely matte. It starts to look like a cheap wig. Scent is horrible. All your clothes will have this cheap heavy scent...</li>
    <li> I love suave products generally.  While I do stock my shelves with higher end cosmetics, I have nothing against saving a buck or twenty... IF it works.  I really wanted this to work, but have been spoiled using &#x27;Not your mothers Clean freak&#x27; dry shampoo&#x27; that is basically scent free and has zero buildup.&lt;br /&gt;I used Suave (because, let&#x27;s be honest, there&#x27;s a big difference between $2.50 and $9.00 for some of us) Keratin infusion dry shampoo that is compared to Bumble and Bumble, and found the following:&lt;br /&gt;1) performance -&lt;br /&gt;succeeded in absorbing excess oil&lt;br /&gt;2) buildup -&lt;br /&gt;product stayed &#x27;wet&#x27; on my hair longer than other products, and left a white powdery residue that resisted my &#x27;rubbing it in&#x27; to my hair&lt;br /&gt;3) scent -&lt;br /&gt;it may be a personal thing - and in general life I don&#x27;t enjoy heavy perfumed scents, but am by no means a scent freak who starts turning my nose up at the slightest fragrance.  This products fragrance was heavy and unpleasant.  Nothing foul per se, just not pleasant.  It was so perfumed, that my attempt to escape it even mildly led to a midnight shower since it was preventing a peaceful slumber.  It was this strong from the deployment of two medium length bursts of product.  Nothing excessive, but enough to give it a real assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have time to waste your hairdo with wet product (those of us who straighten our hair will be disappointed), have light colored hair so as to blend the leftover residue, and have no sense of smell?  This product is for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try since it was cheap and I have super super thin hair that gets oily/greasy within 12 hours and sometimes get frustrated having to take a shower every-time before i go anywhere. I tried it as soon as i got it, with my last hair wash being less than 12 hours prior (and all I did was sleep and sit around). It made my hair FEEL not greasy, made it LOOK only slightly not greasy, and did nothing for the flatness and &#x27;stiffness&#x27; (doesn&#x27;t flow, kinda keeps form when you mess with it) that comes with greasy hair. Also, after a few hours, my scalp felt itchy. This probably works for others, and would maybe work for me if my hair was a lil less greasy. Like i said my hair is super super thin so that&#x27;s my problem, and this wasn&#x27;t a 3$ miracle.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the reviews and price.  However, it does not seem to work as well as the one that I bought from Walgreens.</li>
    <li> This will work on a 1st day of no hair wash, but on a second day of hair wash it really does not do much.  You might think that it would add volume, but that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;This is a low cost product, so do not expect miracles.  For the price, it is acceptable.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this in my hair and my husband immediately began to cough and gag from the overpowering smell which reminds me somewhat of a nursing home air freshener. I know it&#x27;s inexpensive but smelling cheap is not chic!! You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I&#x27;m not that picky on scents and the scent itself is OK but WAY too strong. Within minutes after using it I start sneezing and once my husband even asked (in a skeptical tone) \\&quot;did you get a new air freshener?\\&quot;  Bummer since not-yet-aired-out air freshener wasn&#x27;t what I hoped for.  I tried it several times and it seemed to work in terms of removing oil and adding body to my hair, but I ended up having to wash it off within less than an hour so I can&#x27;t say for sure. Seems like others like it so maybe I got a faulty item?  Wish I&#x27;d checked it out in the store first.</li>
    <li> Not Impressed, made my hair look like I put baby powder in it,  ended up having to wash it anyway.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoos.  Klorane is my absolute favorite, but it&#x27;s a little pricey and since you have to order it, not always readily available.  This is definitely the next best thing in a pinch.  I was a little hesitant bc I am not a fan of the other Suave dry shampoo, but this one is much better.  I&#x27;ve tried many others available at the grocery store and none of them compare.  The smell is a little strong, but then again I tend to be very sensitive to scents. Well worth the three bucks!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair which I wash every other day but it gets greasy sometimes. I love this product, it gets rid of some of the oil and smells great. I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere so I resorted to buying it online and paying for shipping. In the end it was worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great when you are in a pinch for time on washing hair</li>
    <li> This product is good for a quick, out-the-door spray on a busy morning.  It is not, however, my usual standby.  It does not absorb the oils as well as other products and I prefer the colored spray options that other brands offer. One great thing -- smells great.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this product.  I like the old one that doesn&#x27;t stink.  Don&#x27;t buy this one. I wanted to get away from myself after I used it!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy, naturally medium ash blonde European hair.  While living in Hawaii, I had a bad experience with a colorist who treated my hair as she would have treated a Polynesian&#x27;s hair and to make a long story short, I ended up with kinky, snarled, Hulk Hogan-yellow hair after a bad color job.  She treated it with a keratin product called Kerastase ($15 for .41 oz!) and then talked me into buying the shampoo and conditioner in the Kerastase line ($30 for shampoo, $60 for conditioner.)  I used these products for a month, while going in for weekly demi-color applications (at no cost) to bring my hair back to a normal condition.  It didn&#x27;t get there.  I was still battling frizzy hair and the color wouldn&#x27;t stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since moved back to the mainland and while visiting my sister, used Suave Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of use, my hair looked and felt better than it had in years!  I stopped using it after our visit ended, but a month later, bought the Suave line (including the leave-in conditioner) and my hair has truly never been this happy.  For under $10, I have a full line of THE BEST hair care products I&#x27;ve EVER used (and being a hair color addict, I&#x27;ve used them all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product for as long as it exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;ve been using it for a month with no buildup issues.  My hair continues to be manageable and healthy after every use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought two of these and have used it for those days where I didn&#x27;t have time to shower (I have bangs so washing my hair everyday is a must) and on camping trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t always wick away the oil all the way and makes my hair look a little chunky. Other than that, it works pretty well and is much cheaper than the alternatives.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says it does. It wont exactly make your hair look freshly washed, but it will take away the greasy look and feel that hair sometimes get. Plus, it adds volume. I plan on buying it again (unless I happen to find something even better, of course!)</li>
    <li> Your hair won&#x27;t feel clean, but it&#x27;ll look less greasy. Great. The biggest drawback? I really didn&#x27;t like the strong smell.</li>
    <li> It smells good, if you&#x27;ve used any of the other Suave Keratin products, similar scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not to impressed with the product itself. Yea it gets rid of the oily roots but it leaves your hair rough. If you spray a little, your hair doesn&#x27;t get rough but it doesn&#x27;t remove any oil. So in order for it to work you spray more, getting rid of the oil but leaving you hair super dry &amp; rough...then you have to follow up with another product to moisturize. Eh, like I said it&#x27;s OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and only apply at the roots.</li>
    <li> What can I say besides I love this product - nice smell, and it keeps my hair fresh in between washings - perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> This product works better than other dry shampoos I have tried.  It makes it look cleaner and flufflier, gives it body.  The instructions even say that you could use on clean hair to give it some body which I can understand.  HOWEVER, it has a smell that I do not like so I would never put it on clean hair!</li>
    <li> I like this better than a more expensive brand that I tried. I have medium brown hair and do need to be sure to brush some of this out. My hair is always very flat and oily the day after I wash it. This lets me go an extra day if I am short on time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I usually buy from the salon. But this is just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It smells great.. But it doesn&#x27;t do the job for me. I never recommend it anyway, it&#x27;s not natural. Just picks dY out of the week to take care of your hair the normal way. :)</li>
    <li> Okay, doesn&#x27;t quite do all it claims to do, but it does clean hair a bit.  Seems like hair is still a tad oily but not like an oil spill.</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo, however, I would recommend this one over any of the other cheaper ones. But if I would HIGHLY recommend getting the Big Sexy Hair if you can.</li>
    <li> My grocery store stopped carrying this, so I went without for a while. Then I realized Amazon sells everything, and found it on subscribe and save. Using this dry shampoo is the only way I can go a day without washing my hair without feeling like a greaseball.</li>
    <li> I tried to cancel, but received anyway, this product smells awful and looks like I put caulk in my hair would neverrrrrrrr buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sold on dry shampoo, but will compare brands.  This does add some lift to my flat hair, but I&#x27;m not happy with the dullness that comes with the lift.  And it has a fragrance stronger than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used - kind of gets in the way of my cologne (which I typically spray on my hair).</li>
    <li> It smells great and it makes your hair easier to manage when you don&#x27;t have time for a full shampoo. Works great for girls that are always on the go with sports and school activities.</li>
    <li> The dry shampoo works amazing and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have long, dark, medium- thick, straight hair that tends to get oily very fast. As a result, I cannot go a single day without washing. However that will soon change all thanks to this product. It did a great job of getting rid of the oiliness and added a great deal of volume. The smell was pleasant and not all overwhelming. The only thing I did not like was the way it made my hair feel, a bit chalky texture wise (no white residue at all!). But I prefer my hair to feel a bit chalky than disgustingly greasy. As for the longevity of the dry shampoo, on the 3rd day my hair was still oil-free which would never be the case. I was really blown away by this product and would highly recommend to girls with my hair type. This product is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried out quite a few of the dry shampoo products, ranging from this at most affordable, to more expensive products like Bumble and Bumble. The Suave dry shampoos have been the most satisfying as far as spraying into hair with even distribution that covers well. Refreshes hair and helps to add some body. Doesn&#x27;t look like you used it unless you really go to town spraying it on. I like this one better than the silver Suave can because that one smells like some kind of mango tropical explosion, whereas this one has a tasteful scent that meshes with other products that I use. Thank you for not making it baby powder fresh, either. I order a few cans of this one Amazon every so often because it&#x27;s a nice thing to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I guess i paid what is worth.. it leaves my hair full of white powder. i know you have to brush it off, but my hair looks dusty after i brush it. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and works well with my dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo.  It works great.  I don&#x27;t know where these have been all of my life.  Sometimes you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair every day.  On the days between washes this is great to use on your roots.  A real pick me up.</li>
    <li> I need dry shampoo in my purse at all times, after a few hours of sitting on my face my bangs are in desperate need of a shampoo again. Spray on and watch your bangs go from greasy and stringy to clean and fluffy again. The smell is not my favorite, it isn&#x27;t bad smelling (like chemicals), I just don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the hair powder I normally use and I didn&#x27;t have time to get the brand I prefer. I tried it this morning and the product made my hair look worse than it did before I started. Not only did it still look slightly oily, but my hair also had a grayish tint to it around the roots that no amount of brushing helped.</li>
    <li> I got this product back in February (it&#x27;s July now) and I have been using it on and off. It certainly works- just spray it in your roots, massage it in, and you&#x27;re good to go. Don&#x27;t spray too much in one spot though, because then all the powder will concentrate in one area and will make a white spot that&#x27;s pretty hard to rub out. I get oily hair after one day and this works well and gets rid of the oil . The smell is absolutely horrible. It smells like a really strong floral perfume, and reminds me of retirement homes. It&#x27;s hard to get rid of and I could smell it on my hair all day.</li>
    <li> Works well, pleasant smell! I don&#x27;t like that I have to put so many words in these reviews. La La</li>
    <li> I thought this product was AWESOME when I first got it. Definitely helped the oil and added body to my limp hair. I would&#x27;ve given it a 4 or 5 until I went to use it for MAYBE the 4th time. Mind you, I have thin and relatively short hair...so I haven&#x27;t used that much...and the stinking can is empty! It was definitely full last time but I can tell by feeling it, it is almost empty. I even tried declogging the sprayer and a few other things with no avail. I then went on a google search. turns out, some cans are defective and have a pinpoint leak in them. Tons of people have this problem. I guess it is sort of ok since it is so cheap, but seriously?! I used it 4x max! I will definitely wait to buy again until the can is fixed.</li>
    <li> Works really well when your hair is dirty and you don&#x27;t have time to wash it. Sprays on like a powder. Even though it sprays on white-ish, I have dark hair, and it doesn&#x27;t show at all after you brush it. Great for camping too.</li>
    <li> I just received this product for review on my site and I instantly fell in love with it. If you are a curly haired or wavy haired girl that loves to blow dry your hair this is perfect. The multitasking product freshens your hair in between washes while the Keratin smooths it out. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> I really disliked this dry shampoo because when I used it the day after washing my hair, my hair looked more dirty.  Not to mention the added chunkage in my hair, it was terrible looking where I had to jump in the shower just to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. My hair looks and feels better between washes, and it also gives it more volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple dry shampoos including [[ASIN:B002WTC370 TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo]], [[ASIN:B003NW8M1Q Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo]], and [[ASIN:B0071HIE94 Acure Organics Dry Shampoo Powder]]. Like the others it will leave your hair looking a little on the dull side from the powder but I like the smell and the price can&#x27;t be beat. I find it lasts a good amount of time and I have not had any problems with the product leaking out as I have seen with other brands. If the smell is not your cup of tea [[ASIN:B004DBUAGQ Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray, Beautiful Clean]] smells grapefruit-y and is basically the same as this product. Dry shampoo has become indispensable to me as my  hair will start looking greasy after just one day and I only like to shampoo every other day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Saves me from having to wash my hair every day ....which you&#x27;re not supposed to do anyway.  And using baby powder just didn&#x27;t cut it.  I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive dry shampoos and Suave is just as good.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different cheap dry shampoos.  I would say this is the best of the cheap.  The smell is marginally more pleasant than other products under $10, and it comes out of the bottle with good force - meaning there&#x27;s not as much room for that powdered hair look that can come with a slow spray.  Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This works moderately well -- it does freshen up oily roots and will do in pinch. However, it it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle very well -- you have to hold it exactly upright -- it is quite powdery and leaves a grandma-smell. There are other better options for even at this price point.</li>
    <li> I recently tried 4 dry shampoos. I have keratin straightened hair which also happens to be oily, and I was looking for a way not to have to wash it so often in order to preserve the treatment. I purchased the following brands: Batiste, Oscar Blandi, Argan Magic and Suave. The most expensive was the Oscar Blandi, and it was the one I liked the least as it had an awful furniture polish smell. The other 3 smelled just fine, kind of a powdery scent, and all worked very well. I will stick with the Suave, however because of the price. It just can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
    <li> STINKS!!!!  I did NOT like the way this stuff smelled.  It was a combination of bad perfume, deodorant and other fragrances all swirled into what equates to smelling like someone who hasn&#x27;t bathed in 3 days. Its now the fourth day and it smells like someone masking their stench by putting on a different perfume every day.</li>
    <li> Works, but has a weird smell. I would rather use the regular dry shampoo by Suave than this Keratin infused one. It&#x27;s not a bad smell perse, but it definitely smells a little chemical-y</li>
    <li> I tried this dry shampoo because it was cheaper that the other one I love.  I have stoped using this one and gone back to the other brand.  There is no comparison.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair maybe once a week, if that.  This stuff takes the grease out in between as advertised.  Not as good as Klorane dry shampoo, but close.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to adhere as well - puffs out more when you spray it on, so you need to use a little more than you would if you were using Klorane.  But for the price difference, sure.  Works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a smell, but it&#x27;s not crazy like all the reviews say - it&#x27;s just like whatever kind of smell when you walk into a hair cut place.  Those reviewers must be using too much, and/or not brushing it out after a couple minutes.  If you do that, it&#x27;s fine, you barely smell it throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product is great, lightweight and easy to use. Goes on easily. It smells really nice too, I love it!</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair looking nice, but it gives it an odd texture somewhat like hairspray leaves. I was looking for something that would leave my hair soft and grease free, but I was probably hoping for too much. I have found that it can give my hair some nice body and I will probably use it to create a crazy hair day look. It was a good price so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal that it didn&#x27;t work out. If you are the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t touch their hair much this will probably be great for you, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Works great, and is priced extremely well on Amazon. I have dark hair but this doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast when rubbed in. It runs out after about two months of regular use.</li>
    <li> Love it!This dry shampoo is the best!! You can use it day after day, and the Keratin in the product makes sure your hair looks terrific - and the price cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. I saw it recommended in a magazine or two and then it had good reviews on here so I decided to give it a try. My somewhat thin, blond hair felt like it was covered in gunk after spraying this on and brushing it through my hair like I do with the other dry shampoos I like. It also smelled really weird. I used this 2-3 times and then just threw it out. Life&#x27;s too short for nasty feeling/smelling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo or Batiste Dry Shampoo Blush Hair Shampoos instead.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! Adds so much volume to my hair, keeps my hair looking great all day, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> Was so so excited for this after reading all of the emails and because I have some oily hair if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. The product worked great at first for doing everything you would hope a dry shampoo would - gave it lift, made it look not oily, etc. But after less than an hour my hair returned to its normal state of being oily and it looked as if I had used no dry shampoo. I have yet to find a better product but just wanted to share my experience!</li>
    <li> Great dry shampoo and great price!  Smells good too!  My only complaint is that I go through the bottle very quickly.</li>
    <li> Decent inexpensive dry shampoo. Make sure to shake it well and spray it at a distance, otherwise you will end up with white hair!</li>
    <li> so I&#x27;ve used probably 5 or 6 different shampoos and this is my favorite. the smell is light and refreshing. it sprays out very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave huge spots of random whiteness. it combs in and my hair is still manageable. love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Really bad... it is cheap but it is really bad product. DO not expect much... as good as you pay for it. Leaves my hair look even more dirty and sticky...</li>
    <li> My hair annoys me often.  It&#x27;s pretty thick and long and has to be blow-dried, so drying it is a pain - it takes at least 30 minutes post-shower.  And because it&#x27;s long, it gets oily at the roots long before the ends need washing.  I used to wash it about every other day because of the oil; it looked gross otherwise.  I&#x27;d tried Oscar Blandi dry shampoo but I might as well have been waving a plastic fairy wand over my hair for all the good it did.  I tried this product after reading a positive review on some website.  And lo and behold, glory hallelujah, a dry shampoo that DOES SOMETHING!  It actually just zaps the oil at the roots of my hair!  I now wash my hair half as often as I used to because in the mornings, I just hit my hair with some of this in the oily spots and it looks good as new, and gives nice volume!  Occasionally, when I first apply it, it will leave some white residue in a few places.  But if I rub that spot a little and then comb there, the whiteness goes away and it&#x27;s no problem.  I love this product.  I love it so much.  It means I spend less time angrily combing my tangled wet hair.  And this costs like 1/8th the price of fancypants Oscar Blandi.  I highly recommend it!  Updated review Nov. 2015:  I still use this dry shampoo exclusively.  I can get by washing my hair only once a week with it, which saves me so much time and aggravation.  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> After the first use, I was very happy with this product. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it does the trick. My hair did feel a bit coated but I&#x27;ve come to expect that from all dry shampoos. However, after a second use of the product the bottle was completely empty. While it is inexpensive, the bottle should really last more than two uses. Similarly sized bottles of dry shampoo from other brands have yielded many more uses for me - I&#x27;m not sure what the problem with this product is. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter first bought this at a local store.  She has been using dry shampoo for several years and was hoping to find an inexpensive alternative to the one she had been buying.  This ended up being just as good as the others and when she went back to purchase more, the price had almost doubled.  When I came to Amazon I was pleased to find it at a reasonable price and it also had a coupon available at that time.  We will continue to buy it here and I hope at some point that it is added to Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
    <li> Seriously, it works better than half of the expensive dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and manages to refresh my hair without completely getting rid of the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> Is great for the hair and the smell and leaves as natural as possible the hair. Totally recomend it.  a</li>
    <li> I have long dark fine hair and normally have to wash my hair daily or it looks too oily for my liking.  I like that I can wash my hair and use this that same day (to give it a lil body and texture to work with) or use it on the second day and style my hair as needed w/o washing it.  For my dark hair I have found that if I spray it around my roots and then let it sit for a bit and do my make-up, get dressed, etc...then when I&#x27;m ready to fix my hair I rub my hands through it like I&#x27;m washing it and all the &amp;#34;white powder&amp;#34; look goes away.  This has a nice smell to it as well.  This is a product I will probably always buy &amp; I&#x27;m always recommending it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great price and it works. It can turn hair white/grey if too much is applied. But as other posters have said brushing through it will help. The smell isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d choose as a perfume, rather powdery, but not overwhelming or nasty. Nothing is perfect. I&#x27;ll take smelling slightly of powder over having my head look like an oil slick. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Even better than some of the more Name brands. It works great and smells great and is a really great price. If you&#x27;re looking for a general dry shampoo, than I would definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> The worst of the 4 dry shampoos I have sampled (Oribe&#x27;s dry texturizing spray is my favorite but I have been trying to find a less expensive option). I have medium brown hair with some lighter highlights, and this dry shampoo leaves huge white patches that do not brush out every single time I have used it. I&#x27;ve tried letting it dry and then brushing it out, using heat and styling tools after using it -- but to no avail. I have to get the entire area wet, wash it out, and blow dry that section to get the whiteness out. . .which defeats the whole purpose of dry shampoo! A total waste of money and ended up in the trash after a handful of uses.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this isn&#x27;t the best. It leaves a sticky residue in my hair. For what it&#x27;s worth, my favorite in Batiste. It&#x27;s a life-saver.</li>
    <li> Good dry shampoo, but not as good as Garnier Fructis Volume Extend Instant Bodifier Dry Shampoo. That one is my go-to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it works when I need it, so I didn&#x27;t buy a more expensive version</li>
    <li> This works and the smell is strong at first then get better. Personally, the smell for me is fine. And it dose its work.</li>
    <li> The main issue with any dry shampoo, for me, is the fact that you are coating a great deal of your hair in a substance that is meant to stick around... which means the smell sticks around. So you better love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo does a good job, but I don&#x27;t like the smell... sharp, chemical-y, perfume-y. I gave it away and bought the Fructis one, which suits me far better.</li>
    <li> Works better than another dry shampoo I tried. It has lasted longer, too. I like the way it smells. My husband does, too! He commented on it smelling nice and asked me what the smell was in my hair. It works well and I can even use it on clean hair to add texture. If it looks to powdery I work it in a bit or brush it through. A must have, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo before so I have nothing else to base this off of beyond this particular bottle.  I love it.  I read that people were complaining about the smell but honestly, as a girl who is super sensitive to perfumes and strong smells, I didn&#x27;t even get a headache from it once...which is saying a lot.  What a god-send on days where I had to skip my morning shower.  I can&#x27;t even go one day in between washing my hair without grease, it&#x27;s just my hair type.  But this eliminates the second-day grease look and works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have used the Dove kind for a while, which smells worse, but seems to work a lot better?&lt;br /&gt;this one definitely sprays white onto the hair</li>
    <li> As far as degreasing my hair, it worked, but it also made my scalp a little itchy.  I have never used any products with Keratin in them before, so maybe it was just a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even add up all the money I&#x27;ve spent trying dry shampoos. I bought this on a whim while traveling and was thrilled to see it on amazon subscriptions!</li>
    <li> I realize this is not a salon quality product, but I don&#x27;t think this works at all - not even a little bit.</li>
    <li> When I first decided to try a dry shampoo, as well as ordering Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo, I also ordered six or seven other types of dry shampoos.  After trying each product, I found the Suave Professionals Keratin Dry Shampoo is definitely the BEST!  Also, as it states on the back of the can, the product can not only be used as a dry shampoo but it can also be sprayed on washed hair to give extra volume and texture, as well as absorbing oil throughout the day.  This is a huge extra PLUS as is the fact the scent is really nice as well!  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I usually use a very expensive dry shampoo, but I need to have a more economical one for inbetween and if I need to share.  Suave is the best thing next to the expensive stuff -- doesn&#x27;t make your hair a different color or leave stuff on your scalp.  I started using this brand when I read in a magazine that it was the best value in a &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; product, and I totally agree.  I have used some other low priced brands and they don&#x27;t do anything.  Since I can compare it to something expensive that works, this is my #2 choice.</li>
    <li> I akin this to baby powder in an aerosol can. It has a very strong baby powder smell that took some getting used to. I use this the day after I straighten my hair to add some body back in and combat the limpness I get on day 2. It works great.</li>
    <li> By far the best dry shampoo I have ever used. I am disabled so showering and washing my hair is nearly an impossibility. This product is very reasonably priced and works wonders. It helps me stay clean and fresh instead of just hiding or covering up being dirty. Thank you Suave and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is cheap and I think it works great.  I have brunette hair and it doens&#x27;t make it look really powdery like some of the brands. My boyfriend hates the way it smells (but he&#x27;s really sensitive to all smells and hates most perfume).</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to. However, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it thus far (I&#x27;ve been using it for around a month.) You do have to be careful to spray either directly on the roots, or from a distance because it can create white splotches. They are easy to wipe away with a damp towel though. I also use it frequently just to create volume if I&#x27;m putting my hair up in a french twist or something similar, and it works wonderfully for that as well!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is one of the best. The sent is clean and pleasant and after trying many more costly products, I always return to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always super busy &amp; don&#x27;t really have the time to wash my hair everyday. I was using baby powder LOL - so obviously this is better and easier to use. My only dislike is that the spray comes out white and you have to pat it to blend it into your hair. Other than that, great value for the $.</li>
    <li> This stuff saves me on a regular basis. Most moms of babies can relate to the shower sacrifice routine. Being a mom of four, ranging from 8 months to 11 years old, I am always last in line when it comes to getting a shower. Squeezing a shower in every day, or every other day just doesn&#x27;t realistically happen; enter Suave dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and hands down suave is the best. Its quick, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad ( some of the other ones smell awful, which leaves you having to weigh your options; greasy hair or stinky hair? hmmmmm....). It does the job, adds tons of volume, and very well worth every penny considering it is magic in a can.</li>
    <li> Does it work? Kinda. Does it smell stinky? Yes. Is it less than three dollars?! Heck yes. No matter how much I put in my hair it&#x27;s still going to be greasy. My hair&#x27;s better after using it, but not outstanding. Other brands smell and work better, but if you&#x27;re in a pinch financially this stuff will do the job. I&#x27;ll probably only buy it again if I&#x27;m desperate. Not Your Mother&#x27;s is only a couple of dollars more and works much better.</li>
    <li> Smells great but dried out my scalp so terribly it was an embarrassing recovery! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using at the root of your hair but could probably be used as a cheap texturing spray</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean scent of this dry shampoo!! It seems to remove oil from hair fairly well and makes your hair feel nice and soft! It is reasonably priced and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> She tells me this is great for some sort of hair style. All I know is the price is much better than local stores.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but I don&#x27;t like to wash it everyday. This brand of dry shampoo works wonders. I get more compliments than ever on my hair when I skip washing and use this -- especially if I can go three days without washing. That seems to be the magic number. And then, when people ask, I say that not washing my hair is my dirty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I push dry shampoo on all of my friends, but I chose to review this brand because it&#x27;s my favorite. I used to use a far more expensive brand, but this product is super affordable, works great, and smells great too (the more expensive brand smells a bit better in my opinion, but I&#x27;ve used some less expensive brands that smell like baby powder to a sickening degree). This is a great in between option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for dry shampoo, definitely give this a whirl.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo did give my hair nice volume, but there&#x27;s no substitute for washing your hair.  When I combed it through my roots, the bristles created visible stroke lines.  It looked like I had product in it.  I tried using fine and wide tooth combs, as well as a brush, but my hair didn&#x27;t have that just-washed, tangle free look that you get from actually washing your hair.  My hair did look less oily and had more volume, but it didn&#x27;t quite lay right.  I&#x27;ve used regular baby powder and had similar results.  Bottom line: you can use it in a pinch and see some improvements, but if you want your hair to look really clean, just wash it.</li>
    <li> Does not work well...two poeple tried it and the white would not come out and was forsced to wash hair after all</li>
    <li> This product is an  amazing product ! If you are always in a hurry this product will help you a lot!</li>
    <li> This is for sure would be a 4-star if it didn&#x27;t smell like pledge. Does not work well for darker hair colors as you can see the white powder on your hair. But for $2 you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo- it is very easy to use and leaves my hair shiny and with lots of volume.  I have very dark hair and had no problem with any white residue.</li>
    <li> I use the product when I&#x27;m running late.  The difference is remarkable - spray just a little bit, quickly work it through with your fingers (&lt; 10 seconds is sufficient for me) and my hair looks like it was freshly washed.  Not exaggerating - looks better than it does after a normal wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Quick, easy, smell not too overbearing (like normal hair spray), and cheap (pennies per use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  *Huge* temptation to sleep late and bathe less.  If they made this product for laundry the world would be in big trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it appears that the product&#x27;s powdery residue can be an issue for those with dark hair, which is more than half of the population so this isn&#x27;t a minor point.  My hair is thin, straight and medium brown - those of you with darker hair may want to give it a trial near a shower before a public debut.</li>
    <li> On shoulder-length hair that was beginning to get visibly greasy, I felt like I had to spray a lot of product into my hair to get it to the point where the greasiness was mostly only noticeable to me. It did nothing for the total lack of volume at the back of my head that tends to result from 2-3 days of oil buildup. I won&#x27;t buy this again; the Batiste spray I used previously smelled much worse but did an incredible job.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown almost black hair.  I&#x27;m an instant believer in dry shampoo after a few sprays of this product.  No residue, chemically hairspray smell disappears quickly, and the VOLUME!  On day 2 my hair tends to be silky, straight, untextured and FLAT, and this gave me the ability to just scrunch with my finger tips and my hair has volume again!  I may start using it immediately after a blow dry on clean hair just to keep it from falling flat.  I&#x27;m going to need a bigger purse, this stuff is coming with my everywhere.  Definitely got rid of the oily roots as well.  I can easily feel/see where I need to apply more just by the clean vs dirty texture at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 hair - I feel kind of dirty, but definitely don&#x27;t look it.  My hair looks freshly cleaned with just a little more texture than it would, like I used a light hairspray.  So it doesn&#x27;t shine, but come on its Tuesday morning and I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 48 hours and no one but me can tell!</li>
    <li> It seemed like there was hardly anything in the can.  It ran out of stuff after about 2 uses.  Buy Batista instead.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done; smells like a hair salon fairly strongly, but it&#x27;s tolerable for the awesome price. Easy to spray and mists evenly, unlike some other more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> adds volume: 4 it works fine, blends well into my black hair&lt;br /&gt;freshens hair: 3.5 my hair looked mattified with this dry shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t necessarily feel like it had&lt;br /&gt;fragrance: 0 completely overpowers everything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of product before,so I knew what I was expecting. This just didn&#x27;t measure up to my expectations, will not purchase again. Made my hair oily  :(</li>
    <li> This works great!  I don&#x27;t wash my hair but every other day.  I use this between washes and it keeps my hair fresh smelling and hides the henna smell too.</li>
    <li> It smells bad! It also dries so white!!! Worse buy everrrr! And i bought two! ugh. Dont waste your money folks.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is great for the price. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white powder or waxy residue in my hair like other dry shampoos have done. It also smells great and adds a little bit of volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> awful smell.  I applied it once and I ended up smelling like my dog after taking him to the grooming salon.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoo, but only after I found this one! It smells really good and works so well. I have naturally oily hair, even straight after a shower and a blow-dry, so I use this daily on my scalp (in addition to shampooing normally 4x a week) and it makes my hair so much more manageable. Plus, my hair has way more volume since it&#x27;s not weighed down by the oils left over from shampoo and conditioner.  I love how easy it is and how effective. I have spent SO much money on name-brand or celebrity endorsed hair products but this one is by far my most favorite find ever!!</li>
    <li> The skybox service said that is was a harzadous material ,so they kept it, i never received it. They had a short time frame for me to respond on what i wanted to do, i think it was two days, and i did not see the e-mail until after.</li>
    <li> I have read a bunch of reviews and the smell seems to be a point of contention. In my experience, I have found that it does in fact smell up my room/bathroom and it isn&#x27;t very pleasant. When I would spray my hair, the dry shampoo would seem to spread around the air making it hard for me to breathe. Often times I would spray my hair then move away just to avoid the smell. Other than that, I guess it works ok for my hair; I felt like I was using a lot to achieve any improvement. In the future I&#x27;ll most likely stick to baby powder or cocoa powder though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this issue my whole life; oily roots the day after washing. You always hear that you aren&#x27;t suppose to wash your hair everyday, that&#x27;s a no-no right? Right. So your options are dry shampoos like this one, or fixing your hair in a way that no one notices. Of course you&#x27;ll know that it&#x27;s oily and you&#x27;ll assume everyone around you can tell. Dry shampoos or wash your hair anyway? So I bought this, hoping like hell that it&#x27;d work. It does. It works I mean it does what it says it will do. The fact that it works paired with the fact that it smells good make it even better. But, you have to massage it in and your hands will have a powdery residue on them. So you&#x27;ll have to wash your hands but if it&#x27;s on your hands then that must mean... yes! There is powdery residue in your hair too! You can massage it to try and get it out but you can only do so much before your hand oils make their way to your hair. Eep. Well, that sucks. Brush and brush all you want, you might be brushing for days. All in all it&#x27;s a good product and maybe, like many other issues, it&#x27;s only noticeable to you. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This cheap dry shampoo may get you out of a bind. I still have a bottle way in the back of the bathroom closet for those days that I ran out of my other dry shampoos or even cornstarch. It says it adds keratin but that stuff leaves your hair mysteriously more oily. hm.</li>
    <li> works great- smell is strong/ kinda awful but i spray perfume over it after and its totally fine. makes hair look gray and blonde but it actually works compared to more expensive brands that don&#x27;t absorb the oil. 5 star!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few brands -- some of them spray a white powder and some just go on clear.  The ones like this that use the fine white powder always seem to work best.  But you have to make sure to comb or brush the powder out so it takes a bit more time.  If you want to know what using a dry shampoo will be like, just take a paper towel and rub your hair vigorously in all directions for about 2 minutes.  That will remove most of the oil.  Comb your hair and notice that, while your hair and scalp do not feel any cleaner, your hair combs better and looks cleaner -- but never as clean as it would after a real washing.  The dry shampoos are a notch better than the paper towel trick -- and they provide a good emergency option.  This one works better than the 4 or 5 others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  works brilliantly for when your just too tired to take a shower and don&#x27;t want to completely embarrass yourself. Soaks up all the oil and gives my hair texture and volume.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It puts a lot of powder in your hair. I have trouble with that- but I find if I get my hair damp too it helps dissolve the white powder. If you are going for a straight look, you would just need to brush until the powder is gone. I&#x27;m going on my sixth bottle of this stuff. I gave my dad a bottle when he was in the hospital too.</li>
    <li> Better off using baby powder, this stuff is horrible and makes your hair hard to brush through. I have long hair and I hate to dry it everyday and wash it. Just wanted something to use near my forehead to freshen it up...had to take a shower right afterwards. I have light hair and you could see it. Someone with dark hair it would be worse.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get overly oily hair, but I bought this on the off chance I couldn&#x27;t get a shower one morning...my hair didn&#x27;t look or feel any less oily. It instead felt crunchy. I didn&#x27;t spray on a ton either. I followed the directions on the bottle, but, eh...I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> I have since discovered the same product by Suave but for colored hair and I love it even more.  For most of my life, I have washed my hair everyday.  Since purchasing Suave dry shampoo I now only need to wash it every 4 - 6 days!  I LOVE this dry shampoo!!!!  It gives my hair body and it doesn&#x27;t have an odd smell as some other brands I have tried have.  Seriously, my hair looks freshly shampooed even after 7 days.  I once went 9 days and honestly my hair looked good. So happy that I only need to spend 3-5 minutes styling my hair everyday.  I packed my hairdryer in the closet and haven&#x27;t seen it in months!! :)</li>
    <li> This product made my hair greasy and did not work as expected. It did smell good though. I have only used it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> This works great! I had tried the tresseme version and disliked the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; it left on my hair. This product disappears after you rub it in and leaves your hair looking refreshed.</li>
    <li> Works great for in between showers to keep my hair looking fresh. It really does absorb the grease and adds volume to my hair. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the smell, but it is like any standard hair product smell.</li>
    <li> Maybe I anticipate too much. I have to save I prefer another brand I used earlier. This one didn&#x27;t work out with my oily hair.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper than most brands, and it seems to do the job well.  I have very fine hair, which gets greasy quickly, and dry shampoo helps keep it down.  It works best when you spray from at least 8 inches away and comb through.  It tends to not work as well when you spray closer, as it gets clumpy feeling on the hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this as much as other dry shampoos - smells funny and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Batiste, for example. Not sure why not.</li>
    <li> Leaves you hair white and stiff. Smells weird too</li>
    <li> Totally useless. Smells WAY too strong and basically added oil to my hair. Good ol&#x27; baby powder works way better than this crap. Thank god it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
    <li> It smells nice (not overpowering, a clean smell) and it works. What else do you need? The price is definitely right. Spritz in sections near roots and don&#x27;t hold the nozzle down for too long. &amp;#34;Brush&amp;#34; out with hand. Easyyyyy and necessary for someone with dry ends but oilier roots.</li>
    <li> Like any aerosol, this is a strong product (use in well ventilated area) and is not for the granolas out there (stick with talc) but for those occasions when I want to go mod-granola or don&#x27;t have time to wash and style my hair, I will use this. I bought it for the price; I&#x27;ve breezed through these cans in the past and always bemoaned the price I paid for a product I could use so few times (and I don&#x27;t have that much hair). It&#x27;s a great price, smells lovely, and doesn&#x27;t leave bursts of white spots that other product have left, making me look like I have bride of Frankenstein birthmarks on my brown hair. Like other dry shampoos, don&#x27;t expect your hair to look shiny after using this, and be cautious to use it in the underside of parts and only on the roots. I am overall pleased with this for the occasional uses when I need to refresh my style, or prevent oil if I know I&#x27;ll be having a long day in a humid climate and want my morning style to last throughout the day, or if I want to make my hair smell nice but not like hairspray (which I don&#x27;t use, especially when using a product like this which effects the same desired outcome).</li>
    <li> decent product for the price</li>
    <li> after using this, i cant tell what this thing does for my hair but to leave white dandruff lookin things.</li>
    <li> With my friend, who also used it, we came to the conclusion that this is not for oily hair. it is for stinky hair. The smell is so strong, so it gives you a fake impression of freshness and hides bad smell if you do have one, but it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look clean or dry. It was silly of us to expect more out of 3 dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have for those mornings you wake up late.  Short bursts, at the root, will give you the best result.</li>
    <li> Smells like my grandma&#x27;s hairspray. Awful! I was expecting more and my hair gets white after I use it. Not nice!</li>
    <li> This is a good dry shampoo to get rid of the oiliness without having to take a shower, it gives your hair volume. My only issue with it is that it&#x27;s too smelly. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I just feel like my head is reeking with its fragrance however I turn and makes me feel very self-conscious! If you don&#x27;t have a problem with the fragrance being too powerful, you will love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different dry shampoos and this one does a really good job of fixing my oily, fine, next day hair and giving it a little body. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave that fine residue that other dry shampoos seem to leave in your hair. I would have given it five stars but the smell is not so great, not terrible, but just not the most pleasant. I will definitely be using it again!</li>
    <li> Suave is well-known, and I&#x27;ve used their products in the past. I have never tried a dry shampoo, but found that this did not much to help shampoo my hair. It may help others but i will not order it again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell that it works. Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t take away any moisture at all. Would go with a higher quality product</li>
    <li> i put this in my hair expecting it to absorb some oils but it left white residue in my hair even after brushing it . I had to wash it out, it smelled very bad and didnt work for me</li>
    <li> I already found my holy grail dry shampoo but it is so expensive, so I wanted to try a cheaper option. This works ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to keep greasy hair at bay for long and the smell is so strong. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different dry shampoos (Dove, Psst!, and Frederic Fekkai), and this was the worst by far. It can leave that dreaded gray powder look if it&#x27;s not applied very carefully and the residue tends to look like dandruff flakes later in the day. I could also feel the residue in my hair. Again, I&#x27;m no stranger to dry shampoo, so I know how to apply it, etc. This stuff is just yucky. Buy something else. Dove and Psst! are my faves.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have only ever used this brand of dry shampoo, so this may be a little biased. However, for how cheap it is, how good it smells, and how effective it is, I don&#x27;t really feel like I need to try any others. It is so easy to use, as I said, smells great, and has a lot of uses in one bottle. After buying 1 bottle, I bought 3 more just to have so I never ran out! The only thing is, for those of you out there with brown hair (I have dark brown hair) you need to put this on in front of a mirror or you run the risk of leaving you house with skunk stripes of white in your hair! It is easy to get out, you just simply have to rub the white into your hair, but I just wanted to give fair warning! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> so good product...  when you have your hair ironed and you do not want to wash it&lt;br /&gt;it is very easy to use and good</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a chemical spill in my hair and only worked so-so. I think Suave need to go back to the drawing board on this one. I will not purchase this again</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have hair that HAS to be washed daily or the roots are super oily. I have really long hair though, so it takes a lot of time. This product allows me to skip a day here and there. It smells nice and absorbs the oil adding volume and texture. I usually  have to add extra conditioner when washing it out as it is a bit drying. Funnily enough, I always get compliments when I skip washing and use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked around for other Dry Shampoos, and my daughter recommended this one.  I was surprised that it worked so well.</li>
    <li> Wow! I sprayed this in at my roots when my hair is oily, and I got two more days of great hair before I needed to wash it! Love this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells super gross. Like a really cheap hooker. I ended up throwing mine away after one use. I definitely do not recommend!</li>
    <li> It smells bad and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair out of oil long enough as well. My hair is super oily during summer so I used it everyday but it works for the first week then stop. (plus, the smell is badd that makes me dizzy). I keeps your hair out of oil about 1 hour top and still look oily when used. I don;t think I wanna buy it again</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  I have to wash my hair less often when I use this wonderful product. and it comes out light and fluffy.</li>
    <li> I really wish they would make dry shampoo with more natural scents. This one is especially strong. But it cleans for those in-between shampoo days and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used only 1 other dry shampoo (in addition to straight baby powder), and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt; I have very oily hair (I can&#x27;t take a shower \\&quot;the night before\\&quot;, my hair is oily when I wake up.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip- Use this when your hair is clean, and it will stay clean for 2+ days. Didn&#x27;t work for me when my hair was already oily.&lt;br /&gt;Wash, blow dry, use the dry shampoo, brush through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;Works well---if used when hair is clean to PREVENT oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;EWG rates the toxicity a 6 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Did not work for me once my hair was already oily.&lt;br /&gt;Smell while spraying is very chemical-y and makes me cough.&lt;br /&gt;Shows up white in dark hair, until brushed out. -If you&#x27;re curling your hair, you can&#x27;t brush it through or you will brush out the curls. I recommend wash, dry, spray this, brish through, then curl.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the white doesn&#x27;t fully brush out.&lt;br /&gt;Not much in the bottle. If used every 2 days, this would last MAYBE 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a residue when you wash your hair. I&#x27;ve had to wash 2x to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;Keratin in cosmetics is an animal product, as in, made from crushed up animal parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again only if I can&#x27;t find a less hazardous shampoo before I run out. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I do not want to spend a lot of $ on a dry shampoo, this is perfect!! Plus it does not have a strong odor like the regular Suave dry shampoo. The &amp;#34;Suave Professionals Keratin Dry Shampoo&amp;#34; has a very mild smell, and it does not linger for hours like the original Suave dry shampoo. I will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I have very dark, very thick hair. It sucks to wash it every day, and from what I hear that isn&#x27;t even healthy. So I use this dry shampoo the second day on oilier parts of my hair (my bangs usually). There is never any residual powder or anything like that. No &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; looking residue, no buildup. It is perfect!</li>
    <li> Its an okay dry shampoo but I would not buy it again because it leave a white residue on my hair and most people can tell.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Great for in between washes and your hair is like fresh washed again.  But for me, will only last for a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of aerosol dry shampoo (Tresemme, Batiste, Dove, a few others) and this is my favorite, especially because it is very affordable. The scent isn&#x27;t as strong (to me anyway) as the Tresemme and it&#x27;s a very neutral smell. I find this blends very easily into my dark blond hair also; I don&#x27;t even have to brush it in most of the time, I can just rub with my fingers. For that reason this is my go to dry shampoo when I wear my hair wavy and can&#x27;t brush it out.</li>
    <li> Has a hairspray type scent to it instead of  the clean hair scent. I like the Algemarin Dry Shampoo better, it&#x27;s not available on Amazon Prime and costs a little bit more but so far seems worth it to me. This Suave product will clean your hair, my only problem is the scent.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a dry shampoo for the first time because they seem to be all the rage now and I&#x27;ve always just used baby powder. It took a few tries to actually get the product to come out of the spray can. It comes out feeling cold and leaves white dust all over my bathroom, much more so than my simple baby powder method. It makes my hair look white at the roots, and even the baby powder doesn&#x27;t do that. It did soak up the oil in my hair but after using this I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair. It smells pretty good. Since trying this, now I can notice when other girls have used their dry shampoo because their roots look white. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my baby powder!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo before. It works nice and smells nice. I will recommend this to everyone. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Granted, it does the job decently, especially considering the price. However, the smell is nauseating, like old lady perfume, and lingers for a VERY long time. Even after I showered.  Buy this one instead: [[ASIN:B004DBUAGQ Suave Professionals Shampoo Spray Beautiful]] It works just as well, and smells MUCH better. :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new because I was getting tired of paying $16 for a small bottle of Matrix Clean Remix dry shampoo. So when I stumbled upon this and saw how good the reviews were, I decided I would give it a try. While it does work, (I&#x27;ll give it that) the smell is just unbearable. I literally had to step out of the bathroom and I usually tolerate most hair sprays or dyes. I bought two bottles, so I&#x27;m stuck with it for a while. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get used to the smell, but I&#x27;ll probably end up going back to the Matrix.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I received and used this since it went on so white, but it was fine once I brushed it out.  I used it on day 3 after shampooing (longer than I ever go), curled my hair, and went to a baby shower.  People kept telling me how amazing my hair looked- so that tells me that this worked well!  Allowed my hair the texture and subsequent style that dirty hair gets, but no one knew it was dirty.  I&#x27;ll keep using this amazing little trick, especially since it&#x27;s so cheap!  Just wish it came in a size I could bring in my carry on luggage.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. My hair is really fine, and it caused it to have static build up, and my hair would fall flat with static cling.</li>
    <li> This is working out fine.</li>
    <li> Used it once, it worked pretty well, I could see the body in my hair was better than normal. Then when I blow dried my hair I knocked it off the counter and it leaked all night and was empty the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, but seemed to disapear after a while.</li>
    <li> I recently tried treseme, I will be going back to Suave!!  This is a great product. I just wish I could return the other one.</li>
    <li> Meh.  This dry shampoo was just okay for me.  I&#x27;ll break it down by pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-It zapped the oil ok.&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t have any problems with powdery white residue/it went on great!&lt;br /&gt;-It is excellent at adding volume and a little &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-I was not thrilled with the smell. It is bearable...but it is definitely not pleasant and it does linger.&lt;br /&gt;-I hate how it left my hair feeling.  It almost feels like some weird hairspray residue or something...it just makes me want to wash it out.  After using the product, my hair does not feel smooth and feels...gross, for a lack of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great for use of small areas (like bangs) or to add volume, but I wouldn&#x27;t go overboard with it, or else your hair will just feel disgusting.  At least such was my experience.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time this morning and let me say that this product works AMAZINGLY well.  Smells horrible but most hair spray and dry shampoos do.  So I looked at the ingredients to see what was in it and the second main ingredient in this stuff is PROPANE!  I just looked at the Amazon listing and it has the ingredients listed.  The warnings say to avoid inhalation....I am not sure about everyone else but I do not know anyone who goes outside to apply a hair product, they always spray it in their bathroom.  So I guess it comes down to your health or your hair....everyone loves an awesome hair product, at the time of this review I see that it is listed as the #1 product in dry shampoos....come on Suave take the propane out of this and then I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The product works fine, however it has an unpleasantly strong powder/soapy scent to it. It smells a little like outdated perfume, something that a very elderly woman would wear.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair everyday but on the few days i skip I use this. It works great. Absorbs all the excess oils and leaves my hair looking and smelling fresh. I have medium length, dark blonde hair</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that gets oily very easily. I have always been an everyday  shampooer because even in a pony tail it still looked really oily. Thank heavens for dry shampoo! With 4 kids I just don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair everyday. I do have blonde hair so I can&#x27;t comment on whether this works on dark hair. But for my hair it has been perfect. I have also tried the Tresemme dry shampoo, but was paying almost $9/bottle for it. This stuff works just as well and is a fraction of the cost. I agree with others that say the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long. But I usually get several weeks worth of hair-do&#x27;s using this every other day. At $3/bottle it doesn&#x27;t seem that unreasonable to me.</li>
    <li> My roots get oily super fast, so I love the fact that this one has keratin in it. It gives my hair volume even after it&#x27;s all limp and oily after one day (which is the norm for my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a very fine white powder (not as white as flour) on my hair like other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has (I&#x27;ve used Batiste before, and that one was terrible for me for some reason). If you spend a little more time patting down the powder it should go away. I ask my friends if they see any white stuff in my hair and they say they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is it has a very strong hair-spray-like smell. I&#x27;m willing to live with it, but some of my friends with sensitive noses have told me it&#x27;s really strong and chemical-ly, so I usually put it on early, stick my head out of a window, pat out the powder, and wait a while so the smell can dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate my scalp, does not cause hair loss, and it&#x27;s cheap, so I can tolerate the smell.</li>
    <li> This smells great, isn&#x27;t sticky, and leaves your hair feeling fresh.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but for this incredible price - why would I?  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white film in one&#x27;s hair either.  The only suggestion I would give is that if one uses a lot of hairspray during the day, and don&#x27;t brush it out, this may not work very well.  I did that one time, and the hairspray combined with the spray looked like I had white stuff all in my hair.  I believe it was more the hairspray, than the Suave Dry Shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal for the price. It doesn&#x27;t work as good as other dry shampoos but it works well enough.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo has a really nice smell.  It also works really well and I like that it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
    <li> I wish the smell was a little more pleasant and not so old lady. Originally, I used this for a camping trip. I worked great, but the strong floral perfume smell attracted knats. I still use it  in occasion, i woukd just love a more normal shampoo smell vs. strong floral perfume.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo helps me get through one more day when I don&#x27;t have time to shampoo. I like the fragrance - not too strong but does give a clean smell. My only negative comment would be that it does give my hair a slightly heavy feeling. My hair is not flat but it does feel slightly heavier than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Not enough to stop me from using it.</li>
    <li> I just tried this about an hour ago.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at my local giant for $3.49 (price was comparable to amazon and I didn&#x27;t have to wait for it to come in the mail).&lt;br /&gt;When I came home, went to the bathroom and started spraying at my roots.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how well it was absorbing the oil.&lt;br /&gt;However after about 2 minutes of spraying my boyfriend comes in and goes &#x27;what are you spraying in here it smells terrible&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Now, personally to me the smell was not bad at all. However, my boyfriend thought otherwise (hence the 4 stars, I may have to switch dry shampoos just because he hated the smell that much.)&lt;br /&gt;I asked him to tell me if he smelled it later while we were laying in bed (since thats the time he&#x27;s closest to my hair anyway), if he doesn&#x27;t smell it I&#x27;m keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, It works great, I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos that haven&#x27;t worked as well. And this has also been the cheapest I&#x27;ve tried thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall it works great, just beware you may or may not like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my very first Amazon review, which I am compelled to write because this is literally the most amazing product I have ever put into my lanky, fine, stick-straight hair. For years I have had to keep my hair super short because once it hits about three inches long, nothing can make it look good. Pomades and waxes for short hair just weigh it down. Washing it makes it ridiculously fluffy. Not washing it just makes it look greasy. Now, THIS. I am growing it out! GROWING IT OUT, PEOPLE! It&#x27;s almost like it has transformed me into a different person, a person who can have a bob that people don&#x27;t feel sorry for. A person who can be in public with unwashed hair and have co-workers say to me, &amp;#34;Did you just get your hair done?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazeballs, and I don&#x27;t use that word lightly. I have ordered this stuff many times from Amazon and recently found it at a couple of Target stores for $2-$4.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  I used to have to wash it either every day or sometimes I could go two days.  Now I can easily go three or four days between washes which means less damage done to my hair (less blowdrying, which is also good in the summer when it&#x27;s too hot for a dryer).  This product makes my hair look freshly washed, but it&#x27;s much easier to handle than when my hair really is freshly washed and too soft, impossible to style.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I can go a day without washing my hair now!  Doesn&#x27;t make my head hurt or feel heavy.  Smell is a bit strong to start with but I&#x27;m not allergic to it like everything else and scent fades fast.  Hair still feels a bit greasy to the touch, but doesn&#x27;t look it it!</li>
    <li> this hair product its amazing it takes the gross right out of your hair i am very pleased i recamend it</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the stellar reviews and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  It&#x27;s definitely not going to replace a shower if you have super dirty hair, but it perks up 2nd day hair pretty well.  Plus, it&#x27;s super affordable so definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Often times the white powder deters people but it is kinda needed to soak up the oil if you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair every day. Its not too powdery and does the job also has a nice smell :)</li>
    <li> I found that the shampoo had an odd perfumy smell. However, the smell didn&#x27;t linger for long. It definitely absorbs excess oils! I also found that the product didn&#x27;t give as much volume as I had hoped. I thought for just under $3 it was definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great substitute for washing your hair when you don&#x27;t have the time.  One can lasts longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works wonders on a morning where I don&#x27;t have time to shower or even when i&#x27;m wanting to add a little oomph to the top of my head! I am blonde and I love that this seems to brighten up my hair even.  I only spray it at my roots mostly around the front of my face and then where I part my hair, rub it in for a min and in seconds it looks fresh!  I like to use this especially when I am curling my hair because sometimes even with freshly washed hair.. the top can look flat.. this helps give it that something extra that hairspray and a comb just can&#x27;t do.  LOVE this Product, if you haven&#x27;t tried it, give it a shot!! SOOO worth it!</li>
    <li> Not bad, but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY dry shampoos. This is one of the better ones and I wanted to write a glowing review of it...but I can only find it on Amazon for $8.77, which is way more than this product is worth. I like it a lot and if the price goes back down to $3 than you&#x27;ll see my review immediately update to 5 stars (and wish it could be more!), but at that price, NO WAY!!!</li>
    <li> Best Dry Shampoo EVER! and I have tried soooo many! Fast shipping! Love!</li>
    <li> This is one the best moderately prices dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> Suave has a lot of cheap hair products, and this is the only one that I would say matches up to the other higher-class products of the same kind in terms of quality, protecting hair, and results. I use this sparingly, spraying my roots a bit between washes whenever I feel like the oil is coming out and there&#x27;s too much of a shine. It usually doesn&#x27;t leave a white powder residue; however, if too much is used then yes, you might look like you have dandruff in your hair. This is by favorite dry shampoo and I probably will keep buying this just because I&#x27;m please with how well this works considering the very low price.</li>
    <li> Dry Shampoo and I have had a rocky relationship. I LOVE the idea of dry shampoo but find it often doesn&#x27;t execute well. This Dry Shampoo is the best Dry Shampoo I have used and I have been all over the place in the land of Dry Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells pretty good&lt;br /&gt;-Less white residue then other brands (shake the bottle well to avoid white residue)&lt;br /&gt;-Really good at creating volume in the hair. I like to spray this on the scalp and it prevents my hair from having that matted down greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes your scalp feel clean (you will want to wash your hair less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-As the bottle got towards the very end I did notice that the white residue became more of an issue. In the beginning I had no issues with white residue. Towards the last 1/3 I had to shake well to avoid heavy white residue. Remember to shake and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue experimenting with Dry Shampoo but I will always have a bottle of this one hand. It works wonder with greasy, sweaty hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! It smells great and makes my hair look washed but it does leave my hair feeling weird but all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried do that too</li>
    <li> I use it after working out. It prevents odors good but leaves white residue on my hair and make it look gray.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s dirt cheap... I just got notified that I can&#x27;t get it auto-shipped anymore and I&#x27;m so upset! I can never find this in stores.</li>
    <li> Too fragrant, and not in a good way. Strong cheap fragrance that stays with you all day- better if it just had no smell at all</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried at least five other dry shampoos. This is the ONLY one that actually makes my hair look clean. And not only does it look clean, it oftentimes looks better than when I&#x27;ve just shampooed and dried it.</li>
    <li> Ugh. I&#x27;m so disappointed my $4.00 went to waste. I have incredibly thick long hair. Washing it nightly is a pain the butt, as it takes forever to dry and uses a ton of my expensive shampoo/conditioner. I bought this after reading good things about it and was thoroughly disgusted. First off, it made my hair SUPER oily looking, rather than soaking up the oils. If you happen to go a little over board (it has an extremely thick/wide spray) your hair will look grey in that spot. It worked better as a hairspray than my BIG&amp;SEXY spray does.&lt;br /&gt;It does smells good, I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
    <li> Works well between washes.Spray at scalp where oil collects and rub hand through. Style as usual. Still use thermal protectant if you are flat ironing</li>
    <li> I have recently been using dry shampoo as it helps me cut down on the amount of times I need to wash my hair each week. I have very long, thick hair that does not need to be washed each day, but looked a little limp the day after I washed it.  Dry shampoo has really helped keeping it look more fresh, but it can be expensive.  I have been looking for a more reasonably priced dry shampoo, and for the price, this does the job.  While it isn&#x27;t the best dry shampoo I have ever used, it does make my hair feel more clean, and it absorbs some of the oil at the roots.  This dry shampoo works best if you are going to put your hair up in a pony tail on day 2 or 3 of dirty hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well if I am just wearing my hair down.  It also makes my hair a little dull looking, but I think that is typical of most dry shampoos. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting an inexpensive dry shampoo for every day use, and to someone who has lighter hair.  This might not work on really dark hair because it is white and powdery.</li>
    <li> I tried Suave&#x27;s other dry shampoo and liked this much much better.  The smell is really nice, although a little strong.  Very reasonably priced and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos and this one is my favorite, but similar enough to the regular Suave dry shampoo with the yellow cap that I&#x27;ll buy either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and the finish is natural after you&#x27;ve brushed it into your hair. My hair is naturally more oily and I&#x27;ll use this in between shampoos or if I&#x27;m trying a style that needs more volume. You don&#x27;t need to use half a can to get the right effect the way some other shampoos are, and if you over-spray a little it&#x27;s easy to brush out.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and to wash, blow-dry, and style it everyday takes a lot of time and is rough on my hair! However, if I don&#x27;t wash it daily it gets greasy. This dry shampoo does what is says and takes the grease look out and gives more volume, but if you spray too close it can make your hair look white. Also, the smell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it smells like strong hairspray. For someone who doesn&#x27;t use hair spray that is a bit of a negative. It does what is says though and works when I have no time to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> The one thing I couldn&#x27;t live without in my beauty arsenal is this dry shampoo. I wash my hair no more than twice a week and haven&#x27;t ever had trouble with greasy, oiliy hair. I have very straight, limp hair, but live in Texas and love that big Dallas hair. As a working girl, I found myself washing only my bangs, because I didn&#x27;t want to loose volume with washing, but still wanted to look polished. This dry shampoo has resolved all my hair issues. It adds volume, keeps my hair ready for styling, and smells great. I get complimented on my hair all the time and have even been asked to show a group of women my perfect ponytail secret, which is simply this spray. If overused, you will get a white powder, but blondes don&#x27;t have to worry about that. Just spray it around the crown of your head and at the base of the roots. A bottle usually lasts me 2 months and I use it almost every other day to maintain the volume that I like. I don&#x27;t know how any other Texas woman can last through the summer without this!</li>
    <li> I just dyed my hair bright blue so I can&#x27;t wash it as often any more. I bought a bunch of dry shampoos to help in this regard. Honestly, besides smelling good, this doesn&#x27;t do much. Baby powder works much better.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. In my opinion it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Dove dry shampoo. This product tends to tangle my hair more and my hair seems harder to wash after using it.</li>
    <li> It worked very well, it comes through when you need to shampoo your hair really quick and you don&#x27;t have  time to wet it your hair up.</li>
    <li> Perfect product!! Recommended! I like it. It does clean your hair. Use it before going to bars, and it has a good scent.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and I will not order it again.  The scent is very overpowering.  I annoy myself!  It weighs my hair down, makes it feel unclean, brittle, and it feels as though it has a heavy and somewhat sticky film over each strand.  It makes my hair clump and look unclean.  It may take the greasy look out of the roots but it makes the entire head of hair look, well, gross.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love the ability I have to go a day longer without washing my hair. I will spray this in, wait for a couple minutes, and then massage it into my hair until the white residue is gone. It works well at plumping up my hair and making it look fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It has a citrus like scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair so I can&#x27;t tell see any leftover residue but it does take away my natural healthy hair shine where I use it. (Of course after I wash it out it&#x27;s back to normal)</li>
    <li> great product, doesn&#x27;t leave white residue or bad smell.  it&#x27;s a good amount of product for a very fair price.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well until about halfway thru and then sometimes no powder sprays out. Nice smell. Better price than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 3rd or 4th purchase of dry shampoo - this one works fine. Not any better or worse than the others, although I like the smell of some of the other ones better (this one smells pretty neutral, so I guess it&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t need to cover up any smells or want it not to interact with other perfumes you are wearing).</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Absorbs oil and leaves hair shiny and refreshed and the keratin seems to improve the condition of hair. . The smell is pleasant too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this dry shampoo as much as the regular version. I wanted to try this one since it is infused with Keratin... But after going through the entire bottle... I have since gone back to the original formula. This one has a different smell that I don&#x27;t like too much and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. It made my hair feel a bit sticky and brittle. Same great price though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this before from target and walmart and it smelled fine, but the batch of 4 that I got from Amazon smelled just foul. It could have been spoiled/expired but of course there is no way to tell on the can. Threw all 4 out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have Asian hair of medium thickness but can be flat and dull. I use this as both a volumizer for wet hair and a dry shampoo on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I have replaced my usual $30 volumizing spray that I usually get from Sephora (which itself is a great product) with this due to a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the smell at all so I wonder if the other reviewers had a bad bottle. Only thing to watch out for is that to not tousle your roots to much as you style or else you end up with fingers covered in white powder.</li>
    <li> If I put this product in my hair around 6 am my hair will feel okay until around 8am. For some reason my hair feels greasier after I spray this into my hair, but doesn&#x27;t show as greasy for two hours. I end up using this as a quick fix if I need to go out grocery shopping and do not have the time to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not really find the smell pleasant, but other people will tell me my hair smells nice. After paying attention to it I think the initial smell after you spray it into your hair is weird, but it is nicer after 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> This might be an item I would take camping with me at a place where there is no shower, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s very effective at sucking up excess oil, which left my hair feeling strawlike.  You could potentially use other products to counteract the dryness.  It combed through nicely so you couldn&#x27;t see the powder after a good brushing, but I only use this if liquid shampoo isn&#x27;t an option, or I am trying a style that specifically requires day-old hair.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and an ok dry shampoo; I&#x27;ve definitely had better for only a bit more money. However, I can&#x27;t even finish the thing because I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I heard from some other people that they like the smell but I can&#x27;t understand that at all. It&#x27;s a odd artificial citrusy smell, but unike any other thing i&#x27;ve smelt.</li>
    <li> One of my top dry shampoos love suave and dove are my top two!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo not only smells weird, but it also doesn&#x27;t provide the clean feeling that I&#x27;ve gotten from other dry shampoos.  I suggest spending the extra few dollars and getting a better brand.</li>
    <li> Ok I have this product. No chemically smell, no chemical bomb smell, I think the bad raters got a bad can of it. Mine has no white residue neither. I used quick \\&quot; shots\\&quot; or \\&quot; bursts\\&quot; it brushed right thru! No oiliness, no residue, no nothing! This stuff really does work! I&#x27;d recommend buying it at Wal-Mart like I did though. It was totally worth $3 I spent. I tried Pantene dry shampoo. I hated it. It had tapioca in it. Left white on my clothes, sink, and hair. If it has tapioca in it, don&#x27;t buy it! It&#x27;s not worth the embarrassing white residue. Sorry some of you hated this product, but, I&#x27;d take my advice and go buy it in the stores.</li>
    <li> This product is not very powdery and is effective. Smells fresh and clean. Definitely good for in between washes to cut back on damage of hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and nothing seems to work very well to add volume.  This product is the BOMB!  Love it and am addicted!</li>
    <li> Holy crap this stuff really woks! I have long thick coarse hair that takes over an hour to dry and style. I&#x27;ve been using this on my roots for two weeks now and it extends my time between washes to 3 days easily! It&#x27;s weightless and smells fresh and light. And the best part... IT&#x27;S THREE DOLARS!!!</li>
    <li> I had never tried a dry shampoo before, but a friend recommended it.  Immediately turned off by the heavy perfume scent of this product.  Plus it did not give me nice day 2 hair, it just felt like more product in my hair! I have fine hair that gets slightly oily at crown if not washed daily.  This product didn&#x27;t mask or get rid of that oil, it just weighed my hair down more.  I&#x27;ll stick to washing it daily with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review but ... This product is smells so gross and toxic.  It also doesnt do anything  I bought it to bring to the hospital with me when I have my planned C/Section but it will be going in the garbage before it hits my &amp;#34;to go bag.&amp;#34; I thought I may just be sensitive to smells because I am pregnant but even my husband freaked out and asked what I was spraying.</li>
    <li> 1st time trying dry shampoo. I love it so far. Soaks the oil right out of your roots to leave it fresh looking. The price for it is reasonable and I  can tell it will last for awhile. Thumbs up on this product!&lt;br /&gt;*p.s. don&#x27;t hold too close to hair otherwise it will make it white and splotchy looking.</li>
    <li> I love my Suave shampoos but this product is a total disaster. There&#x27;s hardly any substance coming out of the can and when it does, it smells pretty bad and doesn&#x27;t do much to my hair. Maybe i got a bad can but the whole concept of a spray can for this purpose seems like a bad idea now. I think i&#x27;ll try the liquid version.</li>
    <li> Have you read the ingredients?  Propane in a hair product? And it is flammable.  There are safer hair products, trust me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How scary.</li>
    <li> Hello there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously that woman-pal (or perhaps it is YOU in your own life) who feels compelled to try pretty much most hair/other beauty products that come out in order to find out if any of them might make a difference in one&#x27;s beauty routine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ignored this Suave dry shampoo on one of my beauty product&#x27;s shelves for awhile (ok, admittedly over two years)--well that was STUPID ON MY PART!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I saw it on the shelf recently and thought, &amp;#34;hmmm I should give that stuff a chance...let me try it and see what I think&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I made a low part on one side of my head and from about 6 or so inches I sprayed a bit of a blast back and forth pretty quickly--then I made another part in the middle and did the same thing...meanwhile I was becoming very, VERY pleased with what was starting to happen with my hair; it started to look fluffy and more thick (dimension-wise) as well as being more like my hair was when I was in my twenties (sadly, not many products do that anymore--not that I want to go back to those days (they were personally hellish for me) but to have that beautiful hair again...NIRVANA...! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t brush it out, I simply made another part on the other side and did the exact same spraying routine.  Then I lifted up my hair around the top of the back (the crown) and did the same thing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I very gently fluffed my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, It has been about 1/2 hour without me messing with it--I just went back in before the mirror and sort of fluffed up my hair gently again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it like this for a few days:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY LOOKS TERRIFIC! Whose hair is that?? Heeee! And YAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am astonished!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are two things I need to tell you about my own hair/scalp and my personal situation (that perhaps could help you with this decision regarding buying it or not for your own hair):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY, VERY dry in part because that is what I inherited from my parents (ugh, lucky me) BUT especially because I am addicted to the beautiful (albeit complicated) foiling process which gives me more blonde highlights than my own hair will naturally  impart but it can also be a little tough on my hair (of course not nearly as horrible as lightening my hair myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so that&#x27;s one part of what&#x27;s going on with my hair...the other is that due to an annoying recent (past year) scalp condition I need to apply this (THE HORRORS~!) medical product from my doctor to my scalp on top of my head that is very greasy. So it makes my hair look greasy like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a couple of years...well THAT&#x27;S attractive (not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, I said it for everyone to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, as truly annoyed as I have been having my head look like I slathered it with Vaseline the night before--guess what! This Suave dry shampoo makes it look like NORMAL PRETTY FLUFFY FULL HAIR when I use it in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooooo to make a long story short, try it, if you&#x27;re in a situation similar to mine, i think you will be quite happily surprised by what happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. When I brushed it out to some degree the results were still thick and pretty. And for people who have been complaining about the strong smell--well, I admit I am NOT especially fond of it either, and I don&#x27;t blame you. I TOO wish Suave would come out with the exact same product but have either ZERO SCENT or at the most a VERY subtle scent. But this stuff does such a remarkable job of making one&#x27;s hair look thick and non-greasy and truly wonderful I suppose for now I&#x27;ll just deal with the &amp;#34;perfumification&amp;#34;...but, yes, ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave, are you listening??? Please offer us that option if possible! Your dry shampoo product with keratin is wonderful, can you make another option that is scentless or at least has a more subtle scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my experience shared above is helpful for myfellow Amazonites! Take care!</li>
    <li> I have always been the kind of person with naturally oily hair. I had to wash my hair sometimes twice a day. I wanted to stop washing so frequently so that my hair can replenish its natural oils and grow faster, so I tried this stuff. I really like it. I can go 3 days without washing my hair now and I never thought that would be possible. It also gives my flat hair a little OOMPH so it has more volume, which is nice. I&#x27;m really glad I gave this a try. I will definitely be buying it again, but probably not here only because I think I could find it at a local drugstore for the same price or cheaper.</li>
    <li> it did not absorb all the grease in my hair and it made my scalp flaky</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job, smell is ok.</li>
    <li> Its ok, but leaves white flakes. Makes me look like i have dandruff. So, my hair looks washed, but full of dandruff. Great!</li>
    <li> It did not clean my hair at all the powder was very hard to remove giving my hair a greyish look</li>
    <li> I have very thin, straight hair which tends to get super oily-looking if I don&#x27;t shampoo everyday. I&#x27;ve used one other dry shampoo before this (forget the brand) and could get away without washing my hair for a day. This one, however, didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but make my hair smell funny and feel a little dirtier. Maybe this only works well for certain textures of hair, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> Bought this when I ran out of my bottle of Bastiste, (which lasted me years), and it is not as good as Batiste. It smells very strong, kind of hairspray like, but soapy. It does an okay job, but I would say I like Batiste better because it is colored powder and smells better.</li>
    <li> I was using a dry shampoo that smelled like oranges and it drove me crazy!!! This stuff smells really good and works well also. I was disappointed when it was not available on subscribe and save anymore. So I will be trying other brands and will let you know</li>
    <li> Made my hair white and was basically like spray in baby powder. Pay a lil more for a nicer brand (I now use Batiste around $6 at walmart) and it won&#x27;t turn your hair white or make your scalp gunk up with stuff.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is not as effective as other brands in absorbing the oil  but it is still good, especially for giving the tired style a boost.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always have time to wash and re-style my hair in the morning, so I decided, upon multiple recommendations, to try dry shampooing it.  This product has worked pretty well for me, although I&#x27;m wondering if a different product might be a better fit for my oily hair.  I would recommend this for normal to dry hair, but by the end of the day, even when I use this product, my hair still feels that kind of soft that is borderline greasy.  It works well if I&#x27;m going to pull it up, but if I&#x27;m wearing it down, it doesn&#x27;t always keep the super clean look that I somewhat obsess over.</li>
    <li> I have pastel pink hair and upkeep is very tiring, shampooing is something that strips a lot of color so I only do it a couple times a week. I needed a good dry shampoo I could use inbetween washes and this is the stuff. It not only removes excess hair oil but leaves hair feeling soft, looking voluminous and smelling great. A lot of other reviewers commented that they didnt like the smell and while it is very strong, its not much different than hairspray, and I dont think its a bad smell.  All in all, I really liked it and for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I am probably going to order more- I hate stopping off at the market just for this stuff, and I always for get to buy it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it worked really well. Maybe I was using too much, but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have thought. But, I was doing a no wash my hair for a week experiment, which actually turned out well- more body and beauty using this stuff than washing all the dang time.</li>
    <li> This is a great spray to sort of rejuvenate your hair. Use sparingly, as it can make it a tiny bit crunchy, but I like using it to give my hair one last boost to survive the rest of the long work day. The smell is a bit strong, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell per se. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it does the trick!</li>
    <li> better than the Tresemme brand which I had been using.  No waiting for it to dry, just spray and brush.</li>
    <li> While it does work well to eliminate greasy roots, the smell is awful, and it STAYS. If I use it, I feel like I am inhaling rubbing alcohol all day.  No thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as a desktop raiser and love it. I think it would be fabulous as a tea holder too.</li>
    <li> I actually think this dry shampoo works better than the twenty dollar oscar blandi ones, but it smells way too strong. If you can get over the smell, then it is a pretty good product that adds more volume and texture to limp hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, and thick, and tends to be dry &amp; frizzy.  It takes hours to air-dry, and the resulting look is something akin to &amp;#34;Crazy Mountain Lady.&amp;#34;  I NEED to style it, and that takes a long time.  As days go by, the roots get a bit greasy but the rest of my hair looks great with almost no effort.  So dry shampoo is clearly THE ANSWER.  This Suave Keratin stuff is a godsend.  It does the job, it doesn&#x27;t look gross on dark hair, it adds root volume, and it&#x27;s CHEAP!  I hope they NEVER stop making this stuff!  The smell is strong while applying --- i spray and then leave the bathroom for fresh air --- but it dissapates quickly and i don&#x27;t smell it on my hair all day.</li>
    <li> Only works if you spray it on the night before. Leaves your hair an odd texture and has an over powering smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for a little touch up after a busy day.</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well, but the smell is awful. It permeates the air and lingers for a long time. Breathing it in makes you feel like you can taste it.</li>
    <li> I usually use Bumble and Bumble colored hair powder in white for my blonde hair in between shampoos in order to get rid of my oily roots. The product works great, however, it is $35, so I have been exploring alternative, cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave is &amp;#60; $3 a can, you can&#x27;t beat that.  The fine mist did absorb some oil around my hairline, however, i did not achieve the volume that bumble and bumble provides.  However, I will continue to use it, just becuase it is such a great value.  I can buy 11 cans of Suave for the price of one bumble n&#x27; bumble spray!!!</li>
    <li> The Suave brand is less expensive than many other brands but I find that it does the job just as well and even smells better than most other brands. Win-win.</li>
    <li> Not the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and not the worst either. I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel after a couple hours, but it does give my normally limp second day hair more volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the price and it proves you get what you pay for.  This does absolutely nothing except leave an awful smell on my hair.</li>
    <li> This spray actually makes my hair heavier and greasier - bummer since it had decent reviews. I used it about 4 times...haven&#x27;t used since and will probably throw out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s my first dry shampoo and I love it. It gives my hear some fresheness. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter together with another brand to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;She loved this product over the other  - which was also quite good.  The many rave reviews of this product is not an exaggeration.  My daughter absolutely loves this stuff.  I am on another trip to LAX and just placed an order for 6 more of this.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this as there are a lot of great reviews, but it was horrible. I&#x27;ve tried it several times, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much oil from my hair and the smell is so strong. It&#x27;s not exactly an unpleasant smell, but more like you bathed in very strong perfume and it lingers for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. After reading all the bad reviews i was a bit afraid to purchase it but actually it&#x27;s way better than what i expected. No white powder and bad smell whatsoever in my hair! The scent will fade in a few hrs anyways. The Tresemme Freshstart does have a bad smell and adds a bad texture to you hair but not this one with keratin. And Suave is cheaper too.</li>
    <li> it smells really nicely but it doesn&#x27;t give the hair body or take much of the &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; away. I recommend Kenra</li>
    <li> Works wonders on slightly oily hair.Look like you showered -when you are not able to. Perfect for after a light workout.</li>
    <li> OK for az quick fix that won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Favorite dry shampoo... I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen or so.</li>
    <li> Yes, the product has a very strong smell. It is not unpleasant but not pleasant &#x27;per say&#x27; either. However, it does work better than many others on the market. Pick your priorities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and it does what it says. However after spraying it, the fumes fill the room, even with an open door. I had to start holding my breath while using it so I wouldn&#x27;t inhale it. It coated my lungs more than my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after brushing repeatedly, the white spots stay in my hair, leaving it looking gray. Not to mention all the residue it leaves behind on my scalp, making it look like bad dandruff. But, I put up with that because my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy if i decided to skip washing my hair for a day. The final straw was when my forehead started breaking out along the hairline. Then the breakout spread to other parts of my face. I don&#x27;t use much makeup or other hair products and if I don&#x27;t use it, my skin clears up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using baking powder and it works way better, and it&#x27;s cheaper. I don&#x27;t have to inhale it, I can just spread it on my palms and rub it in. There&#x27;s no residue left behind and it actually helped keep my hairline and scalp from getting greasy without making my hair feel like it&#x27;s coated in clay.</li>
    <li> This works quite well for adding body to clean hair, not as well for absorbing oil for in between washes.  It is also pretty difficult to brush the white powder out of the hair so you do not have white spots at your scalp.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a trial for marketing, and I LOVE it.  I usually can&#x27;t go more than one day without washing my hair.  I&#x27;ve never been able to really skip days without feeling a little grimy.  This stuff WORKS.  I&#x27;ve been able to keep my blowout for THREE days.  I could probably keep it for longer, except that I go to the gym and get sweaty a few times a week.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It smelled okay.  And my hair looked okay, less greasy and limp.  But, it gave me this weird gritty, crunchy texture.  I spend the rest of the night running my hands through my hair and thinking it just wasn&#x27;t right.  From here on out I&#x27;m sticking with Freeman, their dry shampoo is a little more expensive but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> When you just have to use these products, this is the best I have found so far!</li>
    <li> This works well. Will buy again. I usually just use it for my bangs so they don&#x27;t separate. I wash my hair everyday so I don&#x27;t use it as an in between shampoo</li>
    <li> love it! love&lt;br /&gt;love the price! especially love the comparison to the infamous hair guru Bumble &amp; Bumble!&lt;br /&gt;My choice will be Suave every time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on the days I&#x27;m running late and have no time to wash my hair. It does nothing. A waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product that gets rid of greasy hair and makes your hair full of volume and body spend a little more on Batiste.[[ASIN:B003N20AD4 Batiste Dry Shampoo Blush Hair Shampoos]]</li>
    <li> The reason I gave only two stars is because I do not like the smell .&lt;br /&gt;And because of that I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and makes my head/scalp feel &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; It adds body and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I especially enjoyed the scent! Overall, it&#x27;s a great dry shampoo. It shipped pretty quickly and i received it in perfect condition! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the more pricey brands I have had, and if you are not careful it comes out white leaving a slightly chalky looking color on your hair. But for one third to one quarter of the price of the stuff I have bought at salons, I guess its not too bad. Just be careful and spray lightly. You won&#x27;t get to skip more than one wash with this brand; I have used some that were so good you could skip up to three washes.</li>
    <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the other reviewers- it works really well but I personally probably won&#x27;t buy it again because of the strong fragrance. If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t mind fragrances, it might work well for you. I will continue to look for something more subtle as far as smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not because it smelled so awful I had to rinse it out... kinda defeats the purpose!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t find any huge change after I spray on my hair. I am wondering whether it really clears my hair</li>
    <li> I get oily hair every once in a while, and it&#x27;s only my bangs most of the time and I was sick of having to wash it so much for it to stop looking oily and baby powder just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I found this dry shampoo just to test out and see if I like it, 4 months after using it and I&#x27;m addicted. I liked it so much that I actually prescribed to have it sent to me every 4 months which is not bad at all. It&#x27;s great in my hair and drys it up real quickly. If you have black or brunette hair, I don&#x27;t suggest you get this because the dry shampoo comes out white and I have really blonde hair so it fades in with my hair and you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Suave&#x27;s original dry shampoo (the yellow cap \\&quot;Beautiful Clean\\&quot;) so when I saw this \\&quot;new\\&quot; product I was excited to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed as I normally do with my other Suave product and my hair was still oily. So I sprayed some more. And some more. I could feel the product in my hair but running a comb and fingers through it just made it appear more oily, even though it didn&#x27;t FEEL oily. Figuring maybe it was just an \\&quot;off\\&quot; hair day I figured I&#x27;d try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a half dozen different times to make absolutely sure this stuff was food for my garbage(and to get my money&#x27;s worth!) and ditched it for the original tried and true which I LOVE. Thankfully they didn&#x27;t replace it with this.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for the price.  My favorite is still Batiste at $8 a can, but this Suave brand is also great for around $3 a can.  I usually order 2-3 cans at a time.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and a lot of them have a grainy, gross texture.  This Suave one is very light and clean feeling.  Also smells really fresh.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i love the way this smells. it wors great for my hair, which is naturally thick and wavy. great for between washes.</li>
    <li> The first dry-shampoo I used was the original Suave in the silver can with the yellow lid. I liked it a lot for the money and the smell and for my first try! I didn&#x27;t like how quickly it ran out and how its powdery self showed up wayyy more in my brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands since, but the fumes were just way too strong to handle. The original Suave had the nicest smell, but it wasn&#x27;t doing the job really well. When I heard about the Keratin Infusion, I really wanted to try it after reading the reviews about how it helped keep that shine. I have to say it is definitely the best dry-shampoo!!! The fumes are tolerable, but still pretty stinky. I am not sure why they can&#x27;t create a nicely scented one that works well too! Oh well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who think it&#x27;s gross or weird to not wash your hair everyday have no idea what they are talking about! I only wash my hair about every 3 days, and sometimes I go longer. I have really nice healthy hair that doesn&#x27;t drip with oil after a few hours. People who wash their hair everyday are stripping their locks of important nutrients. That&#x27;s why your hair is a grease pit. Please, stop ruining your hair and making your head an oily mess!! This does not mean \\&quot;Stop taking baths or showers\\&quot;... just wear a shower cap!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, no more ranting... but if you are trying to make things right with your hair by giving it a break, start with an every-other-day wash, and use this to cover up any oils that make their way through. The cool thing about dry-shampoos is that they do not block oil, but they just cover it up. This means that your head is not getting signals to replenish oils, because for all it knows, it is still there! By using dry-shampoos you can \\&quot;train\\&quot; your head into thinking it only needs to replenish oils every few days instead of every few hours!! I am a total believer in these dry-shampoos, and I love that they are becoming mainstream now!! I just want some fruity scents or something! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with this dry shampoo. It can have a little bit of white if you spray a lot at a time without brushing it in, and the smell isn&#x27;t THE best in my opinion, but it does it&#x27;s job and is great for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dry shampoo to use as a way to add more body to my hair prior to styling it.  The addition of a light spray of this before curling my hair really made a big difference, as the curls lasted all day and looked great.  You can&#x27;t tell that you sprayed this on, unless you hold the can in one spot for too long, but even then the powdery appearance comes out with a brush.  I&#x27;d recommend this product for others trying to get volume, or hard-to-curl hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! It makes my hair look so much cleaner and gives a bit of texture. My hair is very fine, sleek, and straight so I like products that give some texture. My previous dry shampoo was tresseme, which made my hair feel very dirty. This shampoo does not have that effect which is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> Works well on my second day of no shower, but it has a strong smell. I returned it because of the smell. It&#x27;s a mix of baby powder and a nasty floral smell. Would have kept it if it weren&#x27;t for the stink! Like an old lady</li>
    <li> After I read the reviews about this product, I was really excited to try it. I think my expectations was really high, which might be the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product in different days when my hair was washed yesterday, the day before, 2 days ago etc. Of course it get&#x27;s harder to make it clean as the time passes. However, this product failed me even at the first day. It doesn&#x27;t clean and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clean. The ends of my hair still shines because of the oil and the feeling says it&#x27;s still oily. This is definitely not an alternative to a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it smells great!!! That&#x27;s why I gave two stars. Also, it&#x27;s very cheap so I suggest you to buy and try it yourself. Everyone has different hair types, hormone glands and an understanding of &amp;#34;cleanliness&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I tried this two days after my last wash and my hair was only mildly oily. So I shook the can, and sprayed 8 inches away from my roots, there was a fine mist. Well that&#x27;s good, that way I know there wont be clumps of white powder, and there wasn&#x27;t it was very invisible, and it smelled alright. I let it sit for 30 seconds, rubbed in the assess and combed out. My hair didn&#x27;t look any less oily. It didn&#x27;t really remove that little bit of oil I had. It did look a bit more fluffy. Thinking I might have done it wrong, I tried it again. Same thing. In fact it got a little bit oilier if you do it too much. Overall it wasn&#x27;t too effective at its job, but it makes an okay refresher for those who wash every other day, but it&#x27;s no good for anything above mildly oily. I suggest you practice using before you wash your hair so that you can get a hang of it, and do it the way best for you. It didn&#x27;t work for me, it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product despite the reviews because it was cheap and I wanted to try dry shampoo. I also bought the Dove dry shampoo at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Good: not an overwhelming but pleasant odor. The texture of my hair was if I sprayed light hair spray on it. Got rid of all grease. Gave my hair body.&lt;br /&gt;Bad: I have medium brown hair. I followed the directions and sprayed my hair approx 8 inches away. I used very little and went on my hair white. I brushed it as recommended but it did not go away. It made my hair look white/gray and I was so embarrassed I had to wash it. I would not recommend this to anyone with dark hair. I am terribly disappointed, but for about $3 I guess I should have expected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove dry shampoo works much better and it&#x27;s just a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It works really well.  It smells very good.  The price is awesome.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> my first time using dry shampoo. I did not like the way my hair felt.</li>
    <li> Yuck, my hair looks worse. I have fine, straight hair and it consistently does nothing to help my hair when it&#x27;s greasy other than add to the problem.</li>
    <li> It works, smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t really give you that dry shampoo look.  The hair still looks greasy, and that&#x27;s why you would use dry shampoo isn&#x27;t it???</li>
    <li> Used it once and went back a week later and there was nothing left in the can.  The one it did work it did everything it said it would.</li>
    <li> Works really  good! Just have gotten on the healthy side so dont know if I will use it anymore !!!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this dry shampoo from an article that I read online because I wasn&#x27;t happy with my current Tresemme dry shampoo. This one has a bit of an odd smell, but it does the job amazingly! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent, I feel like I need to spray lots more than recommended to correct my roots, after skipping one day, I am brunette so that could be why.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all, and it has a weird smell which I don&#x27;t like. I just used it once and will never use it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but it does white powder in your hair if your not careful. I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this at our local Safeway store because it was on sale and a name brand (Suave). It literally does not work at all. I have used other dry shampoos that work fine (e.g. Klorane brand) but was hoping to find a product that was inexpensive and reliably available. The Suave product is so remarkably ineffective that one must wonder whether it was part of a defective batch. If anything, it makes the hair look more greasy and lifeless, rather than the reverse. However, I&#x27;m not going to risk even a few dollars giving it another try. A little plain baby powder is much more effective (on light hair like mine anyway.)</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it claims. My only issue is that sometimes too much product is sprayed out at once.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! With working constantly and on the go whenever I&#x27;m not, it&#x27;s a little difficult to wash my hair all the time. At least with this, I can make my hair look presentable in between washes and not damage my hair in the process! A++++</li>
    <li> At the risk of grossing everyone out, I only shower about twice a week. I have fine light brown hair, and it gets greasy easily. I started using baby powder years ago to help manage oil on the days I don&#x27;t shower. I wanted to give this a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it really wasn&#x27;t as good at drying up the oil as the baby powder. I&#x27;ve heard that if you have darker hair baby powder isn&#x27;t as much of an option, but if you have lighter hair that gets oily easily, baby powder is definitely the way to go. They even make different scents of baby powder now so you won&#x27;t go around smelling like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I did love what this did for the texture and volume of my hair. The baby powder is great at absorbing oils, but it can leave hair a bit flat. I like to start with the baby powder and then spritz some of this on top to give it that extra oomph. The smell is also nice.</li>
    <li> I never have tried a dry shampoo before. I didnt like the way this made my hair look...not so clean. I have dark hair and thought wow on those days when I cant instantly wash my oily hair wouldnt this be great? Maybe if the shower goes out and I cant shower Id use this prodict but otherwise Ive got to shower twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have long brown hair that gets oily fairly quickly but I don&#x27;t like to wash it every day because that dries it out too much. I have tried several dry shampoos including Baptiste and Garnier and other Suave ones. This is my favorite in the price range. Smells good, works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my brown hair covered in white powder. I keep one in the car.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It adds volume to my newly washed hair and extends my washes by reducing oil at the roots. I spray the product directly to my crown for volume and then temporal area when its get oily. Its definitely the best dry shampoo I have tried for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice now and it does seem to dry up the oily areas so I can get by another day without shampooing, but only for a day or so.  Great product for travel or when you absolutely can&#x27;t wash your hair and it looks a bit greasy.  I didn&#x27;t notice an increase in volume that other reviewers mentioned, but that is okay as volume is something I have plenty off and in fact I am always trying to tame my wayward hair!</li>
    <li> This product is almost miraculous! It smells good and helps with oily spots that develop during the day or overnight. I just spray a little at the root and my hair is instantly freshened up. I can actually skip shampooing it every day with this helpful, dry shampoo! My two daughters and I use it and we all like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got fine, thin hair and an oily scalp so I&#x27;m constantly searching for products to give me lift and body without making my hair greasy. I really, really love this stuff. I shake it up really well, hold about  a foot from my head, and spray my roots after my hair is mostly styled. After 5 minutes or so I tousle my hair and it looks so full and healthy. I feel like this helps control my oily scalp too, my hair doesn&#x27;t look flat and gross at the end of the day anymore. I have no problem with this being visible in my hair (my hair is a dark ash blonde). I like the scent of this product too, kind of powdery and soapy, a very clean scent that quickly fades unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different kinds of dry shampoo to &#x27;&#x27;touch up&#x27;&#x27; my hair when needed.  This product has been the least expensive &amp; works just as good as the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This is a good dry shampoo for the price, however the smell is strong.  The alcohol smell lasts for hours.  I prefer Batiste Tropical dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair and had to wash it out. The smell is horrible. It might be a good product but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
    <li> Have been using Pssssst Dry Shampoo for years and decided it was time to try something new. This product is great! It smells good and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it feel sticky. Works great to add volume after a regular wash/blowout, and works just as well on days where I want to skip washing. Can&#x27;t beat the price either...</li>
    <li> this product smells TERRIBLE and gave me a big headache. i had to take a shower just to get rid of it. it also does NOT add volume whatsoever. going back to batiste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the more expensive dry shampoos and find the Suave one to be one of the best.  It leaves my hair with a soft scent that I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on and gives it volume and absorbs the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me the opportunity to wash my hair every other day.  Previously, I had to wash it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just got extensions and I can&#x27;t wash my hair every day so this is perfect for an extra day and with beautifull, clean and good smelling hair.&lt;br /&gt;definetly reccomend</li>
    <li> It is ok especially for the price,just as good as high end salon products. i am still looking for the product that cleans and doesnt make your hair feel crappy and dull.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel more greasy after applying it then it did if i didnt wash it. Would prefer using baby powder</li>
    <li> This smells awful and doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair when it&#x27;s greasy. It&#x27;s better for adding texture when styling, but be careful not to use too much - your hair will look grey! Especially if you have dark hair.</li>
    <li> There are many other brands out there to choose from now so don&#x27;t bother with this one. However the other suave dry shampoo that is not keratin infused is my go too. Try that one!</li>
    <li> An earlier review remarked that this dry shampoo smelled like a chemical bomb. They were completely accurate and I am left wondering if some reviewers (such as myself) were sent expired bottles or something.  I simply cannot fathom how such a large amount of reviewers were not only okay with the smell, but enjoyed it.  As soon as I sprayed it, I felt like I couldn&#x27;t breathe - something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other hairsprays or dry shampoos.  The stuff hangs so heavy in the air and fails to dissipate even after hours.  It is LITERALLY, as someone said, a chemical bomb.  If you want to cough for five minutes after each use, this spray is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it also didn&#x27;t work better than other brands of dry shampoos I&#x27;ve purchased.  This fact, along with the absolutely poisonous smell, has made me regret my purchase.  I will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Note- I am actually suspicious that my bottle may be expired even though I just ordered it. If I do find an expiration date on it, I&#x27;ll edit my review to include that info.</li>
    <li> Works! It does the trick when it comes to dry hair shampoo. It absorbs the oil in the hair to keep your hair looking clean.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and board straight and gets greasy on day two after washing.  Fear not!  I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos for years - even conducting my own informal market test of the good, bad, and the putridly perfumed- this one is easily my favorite.  And hey- it&#x27;s also one of the least expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a medium brown and it can get ghosty if I spray it on too heavily in one spot.  However when you brush it out all is well.  I&#x27;m also smell-picky and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The level of perfume it has quickly dissipates.  Go ahead and subscribe and save.  ;)</li>
    <li> It seems to work alright but the smell is so horrible I can&#x27;t use it. It smells like smelly soap.</li>
    <li> Cheapest and best dry shampoo on the market that I have tried.  Never used any Suave product before but I needed a cheaper alternative for a dry shampoo and saw the great reviews for this product. I have long, black, thin oily hair and have to wash it daily. There are days when my hair doesn&#x27;t get too oily for a wash but I hate that icky oily feeling. Using this dry shampoo makes my hair feel fresh and gives it more volume! When you spray it on, it leaves a white residue that I just brush out or use my hands to mix in. My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily all day. I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on $20 dry shampoos anymore!</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive! It does show a little &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; color when you spray, but if you comb or brush throught it, it&#x27;s not noticeable</li>
    <li> Product was defective. The aerosol cap was missing so there was no way to dispense the product. Do not waste your money!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Allows me to skip a hair washing day!  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look white!  WOrks great on blonde hair</li>
    <li> works well to avoid washing hair, but I have very oily hair and can only extend by about another 12-15 hours. If i wait too long between washings and use this product in bewteen, my hair and scalp are a disgusting oily mess by the next shampoo/shower. It does smell good and makes a big difference when you use it, but it didnt last all day for me</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo, and read about this one in a magazine recently. It&#x27;s ok, CHEAP, but leaves a ton of white when you spray it on... Hmm... Other expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t. I have heard of dry shampoos having this effect before tho. Would recommend this if you are looking to try a cheap dry shampoo. You CAN run out the white with quick back and forth scratching motions made to ruffle your hair. The white then goes away and you are left with great texture and body....and your hair looks styles and clean! Great addition to a person&#x27;s gym bag.</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews on products. But this product is so bad I just had to. IT DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT BUY IT! I have natural strawberry blonde hair and it&#x27;s not that dark. When you spray the shampoo it shows up PURE WHITE and the smell is very potent. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even soak up the oil. If you are looking for the best drugstore dry shampoo, I recommend Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo. It is very cheap and actually works!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I bought it and used it soon after. I loved the smell and it seemed to be a lot easier to use than others I had used previously. I have darker hair and didn&#x27;t have any problems with it showing up. The bottle still had product in it right after application and felt full after I used it. I set it aside and came back to it a few days later only to find it empty. No one else used it. Just empty. After ONE USE. I am so frustrated. I have purchased other more expensive brands before. I still have a sample bottle that has been used at least ten times and is still full. And yet I got one use out of this. Sigh. I feel so cheated.</li>
    <li> I mean, primates didn&#x27;t wash their hair (or shower!) every day, right? So if I don&#x27;t wash my hair, few puffs and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Takes out grease, but leaves hair stiff, and unmanageable. Scent is fine. I much prefer Batista. Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, just smells a little weird. But It works amazing!! Was skeptical because I usually don&#x27;t get this brand, but I was happy with how good it works</li>
    <li> The price was decent and the reviews were good. Decided to give it a try, you know, for those days when the hair doesn&#x27;t look like you have washed it an hour ago, but it&#x27;s not oily enough to wash it again, or for those days, when there is no time to wash it, but you need to look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the package is comfortable to use. I shook it for a about a minute and shook during the use. But it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, except leaving white residue that was not easy to get rid off. Tried it several times, with same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it can not be sent back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless stuff. You can put  some  talc in your hair and achieve better results.</li>
    <li> this does a pretty good job.  the smell is nice and kinda hangs with your hair all day.  doesn&#x27;t last more than 8 hours, however, i do have hair that tends to get oily rather quickly.  i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell. If you plan on spraying it indoors, be sure to keep some windows open. I have the biggest headache from this product. Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;d like to keep your brain cells.</li>
    <li> Great dry shampoo. I haven&#x27;t used many, but this was not expensive at all and definitely does the job. roughly 2$ cheaper than i found in the store. i&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and still have a bunch left in the can. i don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever tried! I am blonde and the whiteness of the powder blends in really well for me, however, if you have darker hair you might have a problem.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo. I love this keratin one, and the original one in the brighter gold bottle. It is under $3 each, and you will not find a cheaper dry shampoo. I went through several brands, and even some of the super expensive ones clogged after a couple uses, and it was too much of a pain to soak and clean the nozzles. I&#x27;ve never had one of these clog up. When you spray it on dark hair, you may see some of the white powder, but if you work it in, it goes away. I&#x27;m blonde so it isn&#x27;t really an issue. Since using this, I&#x27;ve been able to cut down my shower time, my water bill, I can get out the door faster, and my hair is actually healthier and keeps its color better by not washing it every day. Love love love this. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I get tons of compliments on my hair, since it is a little &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; I can style it and it will keep its shape really well!</li>
    <li> Bought this for work.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need to add a white/grayish color to black hair, and this does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t store a lot of uses.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews so I tried it but it&#x27;s not for me. When I used it my hair wasnt even really dirty, i just wanted to give it some volume. It left a white residue and didn&#x27;t make it look any different. Didn&#x27;t give me volume or make my hair any cleaner. I&#x27;ll stick to the regular shampoo and volumizing moose.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it might be better than the other dry shampoo by Suave that I took back because it was useless. The only difference was that I tried this on my straightened hair which had just started to get greasy at the roots. The scent is not as strong as the other which is a MAJOR plus but it did not do anything for my oily roots at all, even after brusing through. Disappointed with this product! I guess it proves that you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> My hair looks, feels and smells great when I use this on days I don&#x27;t shampoo! Even my husband commented on how great my hair looked!</li>
    <li> This arrived today and I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in two days so I gave it a try.  I have dark hair and it made my hair look wonderful!  It really feels nice and fresh, it soaked up all the grease.  It works just as well if not better than more expensive dry shampoos such as batiste, got2b, or even Oscar blandi. I&#x27;m never paying $20 for a half empty can again!</li>
    <li> Comparable to more expensive dry shampoo&#x27;s.  The product has does not smell strong or sweet like some of the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo for the money.  I remember using dry shampoo as a teenager (in the 1970s) and was thrilled to see that it has made a comeback.  Suave Infusion works wonderfully and the price is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have fairly long thin hair, and my scalp gets oily extremely easy. The ends of my hair are dyed blue and are fairly damaged from bleaching so as you can imagine I&#x27;m dying for a product that can extend the days between washing my hair. I bought this at Target hoping it would help. I followed the instructions, and it didn&#x27;t seem to help my hair at all. I&#x27;m a brunette but there was no white residue (as long as you hold the can out far enough as the instructions say, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem).The smell is overpowering, as many have noted. This dry shampoo is not worth a single penny.</li>
    <li> If you are like any other woman on earth, we all have bad hair days. Maybe you had to skip a shower (running late, don&#x27;t feel like messing with it, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here&#x27;s your answer. This stuff really does work. It stinks a little (I hate the smell of hair spray -it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Just me&amp;#34;, or so my daughter says.) . It can take her greasy hair only 2 days after her shower and completely make it disappear,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple, it works. I have it 4**** because it stinks. Just My Opinion.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.You can also use it on clean hair for extra volume and add texture to flat hair.</li>
    <li> The first second I applied it I just knew it was terrible. It made my hair more dirty looking and greasy. Do not waste your money on this ladies. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would allow every other day wash. It did no such thing.  My roots still look so oily and the product just feels stiff in my hair. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again. My hair is very long, thick and coarse.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my long hair every day - it gets too dry and it takes too much time.  I use this in my bangs and roots so my straight hair won&#x27;t look greasy.  My hair is dark brown so if I hold it too close when spraying you can see the &#x27;powder&#x27; but a minute of brushing fixes that.  It also adds volume to the roots, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a drug store for its intended purpose only to discover, to my great delight, that it is THE BEST EVER VOLUMIZING PRODUCT FOR THIN HAIR! And I&#x27;ve tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very thin, pin-straight, fairly lifeless hair. It takes A LOT of work to get it to look good. More work than I care to put in most days. But this stuff - holy cow! I use it daily, after showering and blow drying my hair and I INSTANTLY have beautiful, sexy, voluminous hair! It&#x27;s actually kind of surreal - like something you&#x27;d see on a commercial and you&#x27;d know it was just too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is for real. It&#x27;s super light, so doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, doesn&#x27;t make it greasy, and can be combed through fairly easily. It adds wonderful texture in addition to volume, so not only does my hair appear to have more volume, it also (incredibly!) has life and personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! And the fact that I can buy it for under $3 just makes me giddy. If they ever stop making this stuff I will probably cry like a baby! J/k! But I WILL be pissed! I fully intend to use this product every day into my old age and have gorgeous, flowing, voluminous gray hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note:  1) Yes, I do have to hold my breath while I spray it on so as not to asphyxiate, as it is a very overwhelming aerosol.  It&#x27;s worth it! and&lt;br /&gt;2)  I don&#x27;t mind the smell and neither my kids nor my husband have complained that I smell awful after using it and believe me, if I did, they would!</li>
    <li> Works great for touch ups, or if you get caught in the rain. Careful to not hold it too close, or spray too much, or you&#x27;ll look like you have a powdered wig!</li>
    <li> This is the worst dry shampoo ever!  It goes on super white and powdery and then instead of making my hair feel clean it feels caked on with product.  This is the second dry shampoo product that I have tried and I was curious because the price was so affordable.  Unfortunately I am very disappointed.  At least it didn&#x27;t waste too much of my money.  I am putting this product on my products I regret buying list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo before and my hair is very oily -- I wanted to get something for those days when I just don&#x27;t feel like shampooing, drying and styling my hair though. I combed my hair out in the morning, sprayed this on it as instructed, and it looked really great. I could still feel that it wasn&#x27;t washed and there were a few spots that stayed more oily than I&#x27;d like, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect (it&#x27;s still dirty hair!). Be sure to really comb it through/rub it in, because otherwise you will see some noticable powder (but I think the package says this). For the money, you really can&#x27;t beat what this prodcut does. I&#x27;d pay double or triple I think and be just as satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff all the time and it&#x27;s amazing!  It really does a great job of reducing oil and shine.</li>
    <li> My low rating isn&#x27;t because the product doesn&#x27;t work. It produces the desired effect, (as does the &#x27;regular&#x27; Suave one - without Keratin) but the smell is overwhelming. I don&#x27;t even use that much of it! It&#x27;s not that the smell is stinky or anything, but it is REALLY strong.  I&#x27;ll be sticking to the regular Suave formula from now on. Plus, I can get it on subscribe and save now!</li>
    <li> This does what it says - soaks up oils and freshens your hair up. I like to use it if I am running late to work and don&#x27;t want to wash my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. However, it is not as good as TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret. Granted, Dirty Secret is very expensive and they&#x27;ve been having an issue with the cans leaking but the actual product itself is far superior to the Suave. Overall, I would say I&#x27;ll probably stick with the Suave until something better comes along. For the price, it is a much better value than Dirty Secret.&lt;br /&gt;An aside, I recommend you not use dry shampoos if you can&#x27;t use clarifiers. They bind to your hair and you must use a clarifying shampoo to avoid build up.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel nasty and it&#x27;s all staticky and goes every where I hate it</li>
    <li> This works, and makes my hair voluminous and shiny, but I can&#x27;t stand to be in the room with myself after use. The smell is ridiculously strong. Really offensive. I can picture being the cause of many many allergic reactions wearing this. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice but the first time I used it I thought I found the secret to not washing my hair every day but then I used it a second time and it wasn&#x27;t the same. I ended up having to put my hair in a dirty bun. It does have a very chemically smell but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind not washing there hair every day but I just cant go a day without a wash.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of clean hair, so I tend to overwash it.  This product has helped me refresh my locks to an almost clean feeling, allowing me to get extended use out of my straightings efforts.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair looking clean in between washes, which is all you can really expect from it. The smell is pretty overwhelming and a lot of people might not be able to handle it. Do not use if you&#x27;re overly sensitive to chemical smells. I would suggest you have the bathroom fan on and/or use this in a well ventilated room.</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver for days when there isn&#x27;t enough time for a wash but your hair needs a pick me up.  Since recently becoming a mother, I have found this product to be invaluable.  It gets the job done, and is your best friend when you are in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I have much better results with corn starch!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell. It smells a lot like flowery hairspray. It seems to work pretty well but it&#x27;s also the first dry shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> My first dry shampoo &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo really works! I have long, fine, highlighted blonde hair that I need to wash every other day because it gets so oily on the &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; days.  I can go longer without washing now and my hair doesn&#x27;t get stringy and greasy-looking.  And, it smells great, like you just came out of a salon.  With other dry shampoos there&#x27;s always that strange thickness that occurs after spraying where you can&#x27;t even run your fingers through your hair, and there&#x27;s none of that with this stuff.  It makes my hair so soft and full, like it was just freshly washed and styled. Great product, great price, and prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> This does what it is supposed to, it makes my hair look fully and not oily on the second day after shampooing.  However, it has a funky heavy perfume smell.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume to work and so was conscious of the smell all day.  It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> My favorite dry shampoo since it&#x27;s a great price and works the best out of all the ones I have tried. I use it at least every day and it usually can add a day or two to my shampoo. Great for bangs since I find mine get greasy so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you haven&#x27;t tried dry shampoo before, this is an inexpensive trial run, no need to spend $15+.</li>
    <li> I was using the other Suave Dry Shampoo and LOVED it.  Imagine my surprise when I tried this one.  It SMELLS and WORKS even better than the regular Suave Dry Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I adore this spray, it is a 5/5. Makes my hair more volumous and gorgeous. Even adds color and lightens as desired! Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I dont understand how people dont appreciate this dry shampoo. ive used other dry shampoos and this one is by far the best and the cheapest. my only complaint is that it doesnt last the whole day, i put it on the the am and my .hair looks good throughout work, but when i leave work if im going somewhere i reapply, sometimes i reapply through out the day. 100% total oil coverage immediately, no white reside, no bad smell, and it makes my hair look much better and softer. great for those late days where i dont wake up in time to wash my hair! worth the price and much cheaper then in the store. i buy in bulk!!!!!</li>
    <li> •*¨*•.¸¸♥ ¸it was great not fair make it more words short sweet unless it wasn&#x27;t what you had in mind.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive dry shampoo this does the trick. It has a non-cloying smell and you can easily brush out any over-application &amp;#34;oops-now-I&#x27;m-a-gray-haired-lady&amp;#34; errors. Prefer this to the other drug store brands, including Psst (stupid name, yukky smell), and Tres Semme (strong, clashing scent).</li>
    <li> I use this to freshen my hair on the days that I don&#x27;t wash it.  However, I also use it on the days that I do wash my hair because it actually adds volume to my very fine hair.  I sent a bottle to my mother (from whom I inherited the thin hair) and she actually ordered 10 more so that she wouldn&#x27;t run out.  It has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid for more expensive dry shampoos, and this one does just as good of a job, if not better and for a much more favorable price.</li>
    <li> This product soaks up oils in your hair amazingly. I was able to go almost a week without my hair looking oily because of this product. However, because it sprays out SO strongly and quickly, it leaves a lot of build up on my scalp. I washed my hair and it looked like I had TERRIBLE dandruff. I had to wash my hair multiple times, which is terrible for colored hair. I will not buy this product again. I will be throwing it straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I LOVE this product! It works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to, and just as effectively as the $30+ brands. I would recommend this to every women. My hair is brown &amp; blonde with highlights and it is invisible in my hair, not sure if it works for really dark haired women though.</li>
    <li> Maybe if you have oily hair this stuff works like they say- but on regular or slightly dry hair it feels weird and made my hair feel heavy - and certainly it did not make it feel clean. I usually like Suave products but for normal hair, I don&#x27;t think this is the right product - at least not for me.</li>
    <li> Totally love it. It works perfectly for me. Once in a while is absolutely necessary and it saves you. B</li>
    <li> I have bought dry shampoo in the past and been really disappointed. A lot of times it seemed like I only could use it a few times and the can was empty. This has lasted me way longer than other brands and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily hair. I wash my hair everyday so I only bought it to freshen up during the day. It has a weird perfume smell but it&#x27;s not that bad. Would I recommend this? Maybe. Like I&#x27;ve said, my hair is really oily so that&#x27;s probably why it didn&#x27;t work. I would suggest buying elsewhere though. I paid less than $3.50 when I purchased few months ago.</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp and every time I wash my hair, it would take me more than an hour to blow dry then straighten it. Now I just use this dry shampoo between days I wash my hair to keep it looking fresh and clean. I can also wash my hair half as often as I used to. It absorbs oils in the root very quickly. I just need to spray and blow dry a little since the smell of this dry shampoo is too strong for me, so I blow dry down the smell. I am so far very satisfied with the result.</li>
    <li> This worked just as well as any other aerosol dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried (if not better), but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Perfect. On my off days I don&#x27;t have time to wash, this does exactly the trick.  I don&#x27;t like powder getting on my clothes, but this works!</li>
    <li> Best ever for its price.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo smells good and feels good when you use it.  It helps for in between washing your hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different dry shampoo. I think this one works well, but it has an overpowering perfume like odor to it, which makes my allergies go crazy. I wish the scent wasn&#x27;t so prevalent so I could continue ordering this through Subscribe and Save-its a great value if you can stand the smell!</li>
    <li> Works great. Sucks up oil and adds volume to hair. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for my teen daughter. She loved it, so I bought more. I&#x27;ve started using it too. Great purchase, great price!</li>
    <li> I have used many dry shampoos but this did not work for me. I have long, straight, fine hair and this made it look greasy. It also had a bad smell to it, although I have noticed a smell with all aerosol dry shampoos. I prefer powder dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> It actually makes my hair MORE greasey, not less. And that defeats the whole purpose of buying this dry shampoo. I don&#x27;t often give one star reviews, but this product really stinks.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every 3 days or so, and this keeps my hair looking great in between. Also good for after the gym etc. It&#x27;s the only dry shampoo I use :)</li>
    <li> powder dry shampoos are easier to comb through. however they have to be brushed in. this does not need brushing in and it doesn&#x27;t smell. the one i used before smelled lemony like pledge. this is ok but it makes your hair feel back combed.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It leaves no white powder residue and gets rid of any oil in your hair and it gives a great volume effect. it smells ok but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long so thats a plus. If you have your hair styled (straightened) and you don&#x27;t want to wash it but you want it to be clean and not oily then this is a great product for you. you can clean your hair without the hassle of getting it wet and having to blow dry it  and style it again only to repeat the process over and over. The reason i give it 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5 is based purely on the smell its not awful and it goes away but it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing.</li>
    <li> This does the job and absorbs the greasiness in my hair if I don&#x27;t have time to wash it.  The problem I have is with the spray.  I have to always spray some into the sink to get the product going which is annoying.  There is a strong perfume fragrance to it which I don&#x27;t mind.  Considering that I use it when I can&#x27;t wash my hair, I&#x27;m always self conscious that my hair stinks.  I have black hair and it will look grey if I don&#x27;t work in the dry shampoo enough.  Otherwise, this is a decent dry shampoo.  I might try something else when this runs out to see if there&#x27;s anything better.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair a lot and like it to last as long as possible, so being able to skip washes is important. The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it does do what a dry shampoo is supposed to without causing any undesired effects to my hair.</li>
    <li> its exactly what I was looking for keeps your hair dry throughout the day its better to apply before the hair starts getting oily</li>
    <li> Did a decent job but also made my scalp too dry and started to notice an increase in my hair fall. Stopped using it</li>
    <li> This is. Probelly  the best smelling dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had! It really volumizes my hair but it also weighs it down. But besides weighing my hair down a bit it&#x27;s pretty good!!</li>
    <li> Bought this at the store for a couple of dollars. The product itself works fine, but don&#x27;t pay more than $3.</li>
    <li> My hair felt as if, I had powder or dust in my hair. It did not make it feel clean at all. It is now sitting in my bathroom. Never again!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of dry shampoo - some of which cost upwards of $16/bottle. After reading a recommendation on a blog about Suave Dry Shampoo, I decided it was definitely worth a try for the low cost. And I have to admit, the product exceeded my expectations by far. Not only does it have a very pleasant scent, it also works great. I would have to say that it works just as well as the expensive name brand bottle did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> So happy I came across this dry shampoo! It is easy on the wallet, smells good, and freshens the hair. I have dark brown hair, so second day hair shows easily. Using Suave&#x27;s Dry Shampoo helps my hair feel lighter, gets rid of the unwanted greasy look, and gets me ready for another day. It works!</li>
    <li> I have never reacted to anything before, but I used this product once and I have had a painful allergic reaction on my scalp. It&#x27;s been 5 days and it&#x27;s still very painful. I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. It is hands down the best (and cheapest) dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried a few others, including B&amp;B white hair powder. Typically I would be more apt to buy B&amp;B because I *LOVE* their products, but in this case Suave Keratin is way better - especially when you factor in the price. I think  B&amp;B&#x27;s white hair powder is upwards of $35 - $40. Try it! Even if you don&#x27;t like it, you are only out a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> Want beachy hair? want to get rid of oily day old hair? This stuff works really well at a decent price point. It does leave some white streaks if you spray to heavily in certain areas, but if you run a brush or your fingers through it enough, it should get it to blend alright. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is actually a pretty great product. I started using it this year on my week long camping/fishing trips. It really does make your hair feel clean between washings. I jump in the lake to clean up mid-week, but the water is pretty chilly. So, this was a nice luxury to take with.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it seems to work ok. But the smell is a very strong chemical type smell? It tends to give me a minor headache after using it...</li>
    <li> The first day I used it I got a bad headache from the smell after only an hours wear. I tried it out a few more times, putting less and less on to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just overusing it. The smell is an intense one, and boy does it LINGER. I had to wash my hair after every use just to free myself from the polluted cloud.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not the best dry shampoo as far as freshening up the scalp, but hey, you&#x27;re only paying 2 bucks and change</li>
    <li> Freshens hair. Adds a bit of body. Good price for the size of the container. I will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> The smell of this hair product is over-whelming and unpleasant.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s considered hazardous material.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and thick so washing it is a twice a week ordeal that involves half an hour in the shower and eight hours of wet hair. Between washes, I maintain the look with the dry shampoo so that I can enjoy my non-hair-washing days.</li>
    <li> Smells good and give my hair volume.  Sprays nicely and evenly and clean bottle.  I ordered this for when I was in the hospital for labor and have ordered it since!  Esp. now that I have a little rugrat, I find it hard to take a shower everyday, yes I will admit that.</li>
    <li> This has an odd smell that my family doesn&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t really notice it after I finish spraying. I stopped my subscribe and save, though. I&#x27;m not sure that this works very well. My hair still seams a little oily. I have fine hair that gets oily when I need to wash it, so I&#x27;ll probably finish using what I have and just wash my hair instead of trying to save time and cheat using some shampoo in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I am still looking for a good dry shampoo....as this is definitely NOT it.  While it performs quite well and absorbs oil; it smells so terrible and I can&#x27;t even stand to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one day I did use it and left the house, I ended up having to tie my hair back.  Even still I noticed one of my coworkers specifically avoiding me.  I know they would never say anything, but it was pretty obvious when they got close to look at my computer screen and immediately stood way back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only recommend this, if you have no sense of smell, if you like to wear heavy perfume, or if you want to make those are you sick.  For me, this is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo. I have tried many and this works just as well as the more expensive brands (and I think the bottle lasts longer too!)</li>
    <li> I love the original Suave Dry Shampoo (grey and yellow bottle), so I thought this one would be awesome because it has keratin in it too! Um....no! This one is awful! Smells horrible! When I was thinking about buying this, I bought it without smelling it at the store. I did read some reviews here on a amazon. One person said this smelled like a chemical bomb went off. I thought they were just exaggerating, but no! That is actually how this smells! And the scent will stay in your hair ALL DAY! I became super self conscious while wearing this! In addition to reeking, this product just did not perform as well as other dry shampoos. My hair looked just as oily after using it as it did before (and I did apply it correctly.) So I do recommend the original Suave Dry Shampoo, but never ever this one!</li>
    <li> This will do the job in a pinch, but I found a better option in Suave&#x27;s REGULAR dry shampoo. It comes in a silver canister and has a light grapefruit smell instead of the Keratin version&#x27;s overly perfumy smell. For that reason alone I can only give the Keratin version 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have never used dry shampoo before, but this was really cheap on Amazon once so I tried it.  I LOVE it!  I have fine hair, and it&#x27;s short..above shoulders most of the time.  This stuff is like miracle spray!  You don&#x27;t even see it come out of the can or on your hair, so it makes me wonder if it&#x27;s real HA!  It gives me hair incredible volume.  It&#x27;s awesome in the summer too after you&#x27;ve been swimming and your hair is dry and flat and ugly.  I lift my hair and spray this under and then just use my fingers to mess it up and it works like a charm.  I like the smell of this..although it doesn&#x27;t last..goes away after a short while.  I want to compare it to something fruity-ish...like VS Lovespell.  Sometimes I even use this after my normal shower, shampoo and blow dry just to give extra body.  It only takes maybe 3-4 sprays...not much.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo! it smells good and u can&#x27;t beat the price! i have used some more expensive ones and i actually prefer this one:)</li>
    <li> I have used this product one time so far. As far as I can tell, it works in that my hair doesn&#x27;t look quite as oily. However I will never use it again because the product smells absolutely horrid!! The best way I can describe it is a mix of industrial strength cleaner and your grandmother&#x27;s perfume. So while your hair may not appear oily, you stink to high heavens which is trading one negative for another. I&#x27;ll stick with the oily hair.</li>
    <li> This product is gross. You spray it on and it gets in your lungs and leaves you smelling bad and coughing for the next hour. I&#x27;ve never tried any other brands of dry shampoo but I bet plain baking soda works much better and isn&#x27;t as hazardous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times, and for the price, it&#x27;s decent. I have blonde hair so I can&#x27;t really talk about the white powdery effect it might give other hair colors. It&#x27;s slightly white on my roots when I spray it, but it disappears mostly after combing/fluffing.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest thing with the product is the smell. It&#x27;s definitely a chemical/soap smell, and I realize that is a strange description, but mostly you should note that it is STRONG. Like my bathroom smelled like it for 3 hours. And I used it, ran errands, went to yoga, and the entire time I could smell it. It&#x27;s overpowering in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;But as far as how it functions, it&#x27;s average and a great price.</li>
    <li> I have bangs and an oily face, so my bangs will get oily within a day. I first tried this product after coming home from the gym, and my hair looked completely revived and oil-free. My bangs looked like they just came out of the shower. The product definitely will absorb the oil, but my bangs did feel a little stiff when I straightened them. I definitely could feel build up in my hair too. I suppose that&#x27;s an issue with most dry shampoos though. But overall I&#x27;m happy with Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this 3 times now.  I have to say that i am impressed.  i have fine, thin hair with a slight curl that is easily flattened.  Because my hair tends toward oily, i usually need to shampoo every other day to keep any sort of loft and curl.  I was also looking for a way to make a coloring job last longer and save me some time each morning.  I reviewed dozens of dry shampoos.  Initially i was looking for the foam no rinse shampoo that i saw used on my mom in the hospital last year.  i didn&#x27;t find that one but after careful review decided to try Suave Professionals.  I was pleasantly surprised after the first use.  I spray it on at the root (parting my hair in sections) and then gently rub it in with my fingers, fluffing as I go.  I got instant loft and volume.  The scent is not unpleasant, and not heavy so isn&#x27;t any problem.  There is a tiny bit of residue on my scalp but not noticeable- I can feel it more than see it.  I used a bit of mousse to crunch in some curl again and I was good to go.  What a time saver!  The next day I reapplied a bit more and got satisfactory results again but put it all up in a clip as it wasn&#x27;t a work day anyway.  It looked fine.  I did notice during the next shampoo that my hair felt a little dryer than normal and probably could have used some conditioner.  I don&#x27;t know if this product is going to cause a drying out of my hair- as i said i tend toward oily anyway- so thats not an immediate problem.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy this again.  I love the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have never used dry shampoo before and it soaked up all the oil.  And it&#x27;s so cheap!!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown, very long fine hair and usually only wash every other day. The trick is to lift your hair up in even sections and spray UNDERNEATH hair from at least 6 inches away, spraying any closer will leave you with white residue (but nothing that brushing it out a little wont fix)  For me, spraying it on CLEAN hair works best at preventing oil build-up, instead of trying to absorb oil the next day. I have tried at least 10-12 other salon brands that were much more expensive, and they didn&#x27;t work any better than suave did, so save your money! Also, it smells amazing! I can see where people are saying the smell is strong, but it is a light, fresh scent that i really like when I&#x27;m going to skip a day of washing. I will def. continue to use Suave!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of Suave products usually. However I have oily hair that needs washing every day. Of course that isn&#x27;t good for it, so  I try to find a products that will help. I have hated every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, until this one.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but my hair did look better than when I have used other products. It didn&#x27;t look powdery and the spray gives a lot of volume. I like that it works so quickly too. I am not in love with the scent but it is not unpleasant just stronger than I want. I shampooed my hair as normal day 1, day 2 used Suave Keratin infusion spray, and could possibly have tried day 3 without shampooing again, but did not want to risk it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use dry shampoo about every other day when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  This product is okay.  It does add some nice body.  It smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t take away the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; in my hair all that well.</li>
    <li> Heard all the raves about dry shampoo in those beauty mags...couldn&#x27;t find it in stores near where I live. Ordered this because of the reasonable price. When I tried it, it was like spraying baby powder on my hair. While it did absorb some of the oil, it left my hair a grayish color for a while (I have black hair) which was not my desired effect. Brushing it in helped. Did not live up to the hype, IMO.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a dry shampoo for my daughter who inherited her dad&#x27;s oily hair. I bought one from a beauty supply store for around $10/can and it made her hair white and smelled awful! Shopping Amazon, I found most had positive and negative reviews - none stood out and some were $19! Finally, I decided to try this one. How could I go wrong at this price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it! No white residue and it smells good too. She has started using it to freshen up her hair in the morning (she shampoos at night). I will buy this from now on. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this dry shampoo for days that I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning.  I have used a similar product that is way more expensive.  I do not think it was any better than this cheaper version!  The only down side I can see to this product is for people with dark hair.  It does leave a white chalky tint to hair when first applied and this would be more obvious on darn hair.  My hair is dirty blonde and the white hue goes away as long as I brush my hair after applying.  Not sure if it would totally go away with hair darker than mine.</li>
    <li> I usually shampoo every other day and this definitely gives my roots a boost on day 2.  The scent is nice and fresh without being overwhelming.  I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;, but it does freshen unwashed hair.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s review- I used to have to wash my fine, thin, oily hair daily.  I have been trying to only wash every other day, but when I wake in the morning, my roots are usually glued to my scalp with oil.  I started using this product at the suggestion of a friend. I didn&#x27;t expect much, having tried rubbing baby powder &amp; corn starch into my roots with no results.  Having paid less than $3 for it, I was surprised that it actually does absorb the oil at my roots, providing volume and I have actually been able to leave the house without washing daily without looking like I dumped a bottle of olive oil on my head.  At the end of the no-wash day, my hair certainly feels gross &amp; shows some signs of oiliness, but for the first time in my life, I am able to only wash my hair 4-5 times a week instead of 7.  And apparently that&#x27;s supposed to signal to your oil glands not to produce as much oil, so we&#x27;ll see if that really happens.  BTW, only applying to my roots, I have gotten about 8 uses from the can thus far.  I think I may get 2 more uses from my current can until it is empty.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is very dark brown and black at the roots. In order to take care of my hair, it&#x27;s all about moisture, so a lot of products I use have olive oil, argon oil, or other stuff that looks nice for a few days, but after a while the hair gets too oily and stringy-looking. Washing my hair every time it looks too oily, or times when I accidentally put too much product in it is just not an option. I am too busy with my schedule, not to mention that it takes a long time to wash, condition, dry, and flatiron my hair.. just don&#x27;t have that kind of time, especially on weekdays. So, I had been thinking about trying dry shampoo for a long time, but so many reviews for various brands made it sounds like it just something for people with thin, blonde hair who may normally want the hair to be almost totally oil-free but don&#x27;t want to always wash it. I&#x27;m so glad I finally tried this affordable dry shampoo instead of letting an expensive brand be my first dip into this realm, because this cheap stuff WORKS. I purchase it about a week ago and have already used it 2 times and I am very pleased. It&#x27;s so easy! And I&#x27;m not seeing any \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; or \\&quot;residue\\&quot;. I spray it far from my hair but try to focus on the oily roots, then I just toss my hair a little bit with my hands, and I walk out the door. Today specifically, I had just washed my hair, but I had accidentally followed it up my over-doing the argon oil. So I flat-ironed my hair and this time sprayed the dry shampoo more liberally, but again, far from the hair (maybe 10 inches away), and just kept tossing it around a bit with my hands, and again, it totally worked even with LOTS of oil in my hair. It came out less stringy, it took away excessive shine but not all of the shine, and my hair looks totally fine. All in all, it works great for me and I would recommend that anyone try this product. It&#x27;s so cheap too! So even if you don&#x27;t like it, you only lost like $3, instead of like $30 for those salon brand dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> As an African-American woman, I am always looking for ways to keep my hair looking nice and presentable while maintaining a healthy lifestyle, i.e., exercising!  Yes, my hair sweats out badly when exercising; however, I have found that certain oils help to soften and manage it, but then you get the greasy, build-up look.  That&#x27;s where this dry shampoo by Suave comes into play!  Spray the roots and hair followed by a warm/low hot blow dryer and the hair is straightened again, with softness, body, and sheen.  A great alternative to burning the hair daily with the flat iron!  You can get away with using the flat iron twice a week concentrating on straightening the roots - not the ends so much...creates split ends and breakage.  Use hot rollers to add curl and volume each morning, followed by re-wrapping to give hair a fairly fresh, bouncy look.  BTW, I have &#x27;Oprah-type&#x27; hair and it works for me...so, it will work for you too.  Since incorporating this regimen, my hair is past my shoulder (thanks to the regular oiling of scalp and hair!  Most of us have gotten away from doing this, and many of us really need it!), healthy, continuously growing, and is on my back.  I love brushing it vigorously and not having a sink or floor full of hair when done!</li>
    <li> This is the only dry shampoo that works for my very fine hair and oily scalp. It helps that I can use it on my &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days from washing my hair and I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m drowning in oil. I also like the keratin protein - it gives hair a little extra &amp;#34;oomph.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried (and I have tried A LOT) where you can see the powder coming out and it&#x27;s not just perfume and chemicals. It will lighten your hair so be sure to rub it into your scalp and roots and it will absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this as it&#x27;s reasonably priced and works!</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it but a couple times, I intended on using it but I just can&#x27;t go without washing my hair to be able to put it to good use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will be prematurely gray (it leaves a white powdery residue - the powder soaks up oil). It smells ok, better than others I&#x27;ve tried, and gives the hair nice body and volume. Sometimes I just use it for the volume when my hair is freshly clean. Styles hold well with this product in my and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this dry shampoo as much as others, I feel like my hair still looks greasy after using it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Fresh and clean. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it leaves a powdery residue that needs to be brushed out.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. I have long, thick, black hair and it does not leave any power residue. It adds texture and volume to my hair, so I use it even on freshly washed and dried hair. I think it smells good- very fresh!</li>
    <li> This product does make hair less greasy. However, the smell is really strong. So bad I cannot wear it to work. Also makes hair look gray.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying dry shampoo, and this product does work, but it has some significant issues.  Next time, I&#x27;ll try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Takes away oiliness, just like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Strange feel &amp; strange smell!&lt;br /&gt;You really have to scrub in the shower to get it out!&lt;br /&gt;Hair does not look washed, or blow-dried, as others have said.  This dry shampoo gives it a funk of it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product doesn&#x27;t really get me another day before I have to wash.  It&#x27;s insufficient if I have to go to work, but if it&#x27;s just a run to the grocery store, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied with this product, but I think for the price you can&#x27;t really beat it. I use it sometimes after I blow dry my hair to add a little extra volume. I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of the smell and I find that after I use it my hair feels heavy and still oily, but again for the price it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I wish I could have a lifetime supply of this product! Some dry shampoos smell really bad, but this one doesn&#x27;t. It works really well too! It has saved me from a number of messy hair/needs-some-love-and-freshening-up situations. I highly recommend this product over other dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good dry shampoo, especially for the price. It definitely works for one day. Not really more than that.</li>
    <li> Ok. The scent is really overpowering and way too floral for my taste. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times because I find the smell to be too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair that&#x27;s a pain to wash, but my roots get greasy sometimes so I thought this would help between washes. Boy was I wrong. Instead of feeling greasy, my hair actually feels dirty and gritty. I can&#x27;t bear to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, this stuff STINKS. It smells like old Aquanet hairspray from the 80s and the scent doesn&#x27;t go away -even after a full day. I go to bed and I can&#x27;t help but smell my hair when I use this stuff and I want to gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; keeps your hair clean is that as soon as you use it, you long to wash your hair for real, so it will make you clean your hair ASAP.</li>
    <li> I did some research on various dry shampoos that were available for less than $10 and decided to try this one. Bought it at Target for about $3 and have been using it for just about two weeks now. I have very thick frizzy/curly hair that I flat iron often and was looking for a product that would help keep my hair clean so I could leave my hair straight for longer (aka I didn&#x27;t want to have to wash my hair every few days and have to flat iron it again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked like a charm and did exactly what I wanted. I was able to leave my hair straight for about 5 days longer than before without this product. It absorbed all the oil and smell, and left my hair feeling and looking soft and fresh. I used the spray in my hair every 2 days, and used either a lot or a little each time, depending on how oily my hair was. I would say roughly 13 days is the longest I can go with this product without washing my hair. Some people may be able to go longer depending on their personal hair types and how quickly their scalp gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this product does have a rather strong smell when you spray it, but it doesn&#x27;t smell any different than a typical hairspray to me. But it is potent, so I suggest using it in a well ventilated area if possible. It almost smells like Static Guard combined with a fruity/flowery hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is an excellent dry shampoo and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you flat iron your hair and are looking for a way to keep your straight hair clean for longer without having to get it wet.</li>
    <li> How can this be only $2.87 ?? It works great and just as good as any other dry shampoo I have tried at Sephora.  It also lasts pretty long considering its an aerosol.  ALready on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> It does not spray out very smooth...too many clumps of powderish stuff.  prefer the Rockoholic brand over Suave this time.</li>
    <li> The smell is overpowering and lingers for hours after use. I usually use a dry shampoo powder but thought I would switch to something new. This came with high reviews overall. I&#x27;ve been using Oscar Blandi powder and although more expensive and maybe I&#x27;m just used to it, the smell is a light lemon frangrance and it&#x27;s simple to apply and definitely does a great job disguising any oily residue. I try to wash my hair every other day and with this product, I felt like I needed to wash it several hours after use. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Good price, but I am waiting to see what the new Garnier Fruitus looks like.  So far this one does not absorb as well as the other more expensive one that I tried.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the same time a a much more expensive product.  I wanted to compare.  This is easier to use and works great.  I have very fine hair and it gets stringy half way through the day, so going two days without washing is not an option.  This product keeps my hair looking good the first day, and passable for a second day.</li>
    <li> I use this product in-between shampoos. Overall it works well and is fairly priced. I have used much much more expensive brands but this product is equal to performance to brands in which I have paid $15. It has a pleasant smell and I have never had an issue with the contents not coming out of the can. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very perfumey. Can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but every time I use a dry shampoo it leaves me itchy. Within 5 minutes my scalp starts to itch. This product was no different...on to the next one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help keep my hair fresh between shampoos and settled on this one based on reviews and my use of Suave products in general.  My hair is normal to dry, now drier due to age; naturally curly; color treated (roots) every few months.  I’ve used it for several months and it’s not for me.  It dries my hair out even further and the smell is overpowering.</li>
    <li> The product works as it should, absorbing the oil from slightly oily hair.  The reason I don&#x27;t like this is because it smells like old lady feminine product.</li>
    <li> This product definitely has a learning curve! I&#x27;ve been using Pssst! Dry shampoo for quite a while, but because of its price and how little use I got out of it, I decided to look for something else. I found this brand from Suave, and I think I may be a new regular user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t like it. I definitely leaves some texture to my hair that I wasn&#x27;t used to with the Psst! brand. However, the next time I used it I used slightly less and sprayed it from farther away. The texture was much less noticeable. If I give my hair a good brush-through after I&#x27;m done using it, I don&#x27;t notice it at all. I have very thin hair and am very picky about the product I put in it because any little bit of grease shows. However, I really think this is a great value. The other bonus is the SMELL! I absolutely love the smell. It&#x27;s very perfume-y, but after leaving the bathroom and walking through my living room, my fiance commented on how good I smell :) I&#x27;ve also a brief spray of this in my hair after spending some time with a friend who smokes in her car. A quick spritz on my hair masked the smoke smell immediately, so I didn&#x27;t have to walk around smelling like an ashtray the rest of the day. I will definitely keep using this!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the strength of other reviews.  It does what it says.  I have medium fine hair that gets oily at the scalp and dry at the ends the day after I wash it.  Not having to wash it every morning is a plus for many reasons.  1) saves time in the morning 2) saves wear and tear on the ends and 3) helps preserve my temporary color longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a strong scent.  It really hits you full force since the spray trajectory of the fine mist is so broad. It smells like a shampoo or hairspray smell.  Nothing crazy or offensive to my nose....just a bit much (especially first thing in the morning). Having said that... I would buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I also bought a bottle of Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray, Beautiful Clean, 5 Ounce.  Here&#x27;s the bad news...the scent is overpowering.  To my nose it smells like a chemical version of overripe bananas and mangoes that have been spoiling in a small, airtight Volkswagen for a week.  The smell is so overpowering I was worried it was going to make my cat keel over!  My husband said it smells like dryer sheets to him.  I do not agree.  I actually like the smell of most dryer sheets.  I would LOVE this product if it smelled like Method dryer sheets.  The verdict on product #2...I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone who has a nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I do not recommend either product for a person who has allergies, scent induced migraines, chemical sensitivities, or a partner with allergies, scent induced migraines, chemical sensitivities....</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m going to be extremely honest here: when I first saw the description of this product I was more than a bit skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, really? Dry shampoo that smooths your hair, absorbs oils and doesn&#x27;t leave it all frizzy? Oh, I highly doubt that. It&#x27;s just some powder in spray form, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;Boy, did I like finding out I was wrong this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really does all of this. It just makes my hair look refreshed, clean, and feel good too.&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this product.</li>
    <li> Works better than the regular Suave dry shampoo (with the yellow cap). Decent purchase for about three dollars. Get it!</li>
    <li> This does a fairly good job of helping me feel like I can go another day without washing my hair, but it has a perfumey scent that makes me sneeze so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> the keratin really helps especially if you hair is prone to drying out</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Wal Mart after seeing it on amazon.com and for $2.74, I am amazed!  I am trying to grow my hair out and in doing so, am limiting my hair washing days to every-other day.....which, because I have oily hair does not work all that well.  I used this for the first time this morning and knew I needed to review it and let everyone know that they should order this and save their $$$!!!  It may run out quickly; however, just like most other hair products you replace it every few weeks anyway.  Smells decent and works great!  Go SUAVE!</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff several bottles at a time, because it&#x27;s my most-used hair product. I actually find that it works better when applied immediately after washing, instead of waiting until my hair looks dirty and then using it. I put it in my hair immediately after washing and drying, and it makes my hair stay cleanish for 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also adds volume and texture. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well. Scent isn&#x27;t bad. I used it way too much when I was sick (more than 1 bottle) and it really dried up my hair. My hair recovered after I treated it with a really expensive hair reconstructor.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite dry shampoo. It completely eliminates oiliness &amp; it smells great.</li>
    <li> If you have allergies this is not the product for you because the smell hurts.  Other then that its the best dry shampoo even at its price.  I would be willing to pay salon prices for this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos and I always come back to this one. I love it.</li>
    <li> Really works well on those between shampoo days.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and great for the price</li>
    <li> Bought this as I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out (after a way too short cut) and read that the less you wash it, the faster it will grow.  The first 3 times I used this dry shampoo, there was no issues and my hair looked great.  I have dark brown, fine hair that will look so greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every 24 hours.  The smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The product did not show in my hair.  It didn&#x27;t look like it was freshly washed, but that&#x27;s ok because technically, it wasn&#x27;t.  It definitely absorbed a lot of the oil from my hair that I would normally get so I did like it for that reason.  The product did stop spraying on the 4th use.  However, I&#x27;ve been using hairspray for many years and recognized it was a clog right away.  I took the spray part off and ran it under hot water for a minute or so.  I then popped it back on and have had no problems.  You&#x27;d think Suave would have tested this out prior to releasing to the public, but not so much.  That&#x27;s why it has 4 stars.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it really should have been addressed by them.  But I will say, for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Imagine a spray-on shampoo that is water-free and will freshen and restyle your hair back to life.  Dry shampoos are great for in between washes to absorb oils and dirt and make your hair look clean and refreshed. I am Latina and have thick dense hair so I never wash my hair everyday. Over washing my hair can dry it out and cause my hair color to fade out more quickly so I typically wash it every two to three days. I have tried the expensive salon brands and honestly Suave has given me the same results for considerably less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use in a well ventilated area and hold the can at least 8 to 10 inches away. Aim the spray to your scalp and then rub the product in with your fingertips and brush your hair afterwards.  The powder will soak up the oil and dirt on your scalp where your hair looks the greasiest.  Contains no sulfates which is great for Keratin or color treated hair.  It leaves my hair looking clean and shiny but not a greasy oily look.  Sadly, I have never tried a dry shampoo that smelled great and this is not one of them.  It does not have a horrible smell, but the odor does start diminishing after bit.  It is just really strong smelling coming out of the can.</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;And i will bey form you net time&lt;br /&gt;and i will see what do you have by visit your store&lt;br /&gt;sorry for late</li>
    <li> I am a dry shampoo addict-- I&#x27;ve probably tried 8+ brands.  I use it at least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate Suave&#x27;s Keratin Infusion as follows --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;worse than TIGI/Rockaholic, worse than Got2B&#x27;s rockin it, about as bad as Got2B&#x27;s fat-tastic, worse than Klorane, better than Salon Graphix and PSSSSST...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vs. Batiste I think is a matter of preference (and which one-- I like the \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; Batiste the best though blush and original aren&#x27;t my favs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness with oil:&lt;br /&gt;not as quickly effective as Got2B or Batiste or Rene Furterer or Klorane-- goes on more slowly-- but the upside is less white powdery residue.&lt;br /&gt;more effective than the other low residue alternatives (Salon Graphix and PSSSST... which are low residue but not as effective-- both of those are a waste of $$ IMO).&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have to spray more of it on than with some of the higher residue ones-- but it still works and it&#x27;s $3/can.  Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keeping this on my shelf-- but will likely combine use with a stronger more powdery option for when my hair needs serious help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for mid day refresh.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a sense of smell, this product is good. It works really well and gives my fine hair good volume and \\&quot;grit.\\&quot; Now, the scent of this product is incredibly strong. Every time I use it, everyone in my house complains! It&#x27;s difficult to breathe when you spray it and it&#x27;s definitely a \\&quot;chemical bomb.\\&quot; On top of that, the scent does not fade quickly. It&#x27;ll linger for hours. I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, even for $2. It&#x27;s kind of like a very strong chemical-baby-powder-soap scent. Had to throw this away.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair that tends to be dry, but I tend to have oily scalp and roots. This product allows me to freshen my roots and eliminate oil in between shampoos. It smells great and does not leave a white residue (some products have left my hair looking grey!).</li>
    <li> I feel like this worked for my hair when I got it, but as time has gone on the absorbing power has decreased. For the price it is a good deal!</li>
    <li> I tried this based on other customers&#x27; reviews. This product works great and makes my hair look clean and fuller with a quick comb through. I&#x27;m grateful I can get an extra day out of a blow dry and do less damage to my hair. I would have given it 5 stars if the smell were a little better. It isn&#x27;t terrible, but it def makes your hair smell like product.</li>
    <li> it smells really, really bad after you spray it on and the smell stays in your hair...so you have to wash it out that same night. i wouldn&#x27;t use this again.</li>
    <li> It does make it look less greasy but it doesn&#x27;t feel less greasy. I have very thick hair- so perhaps its not good for people with as thick and long of hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I have fine, thin blonde hair; consequently, it looks greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, which is damaging in and of itself. This product allows me to wash every other day.  EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works well enough, but nothing too impressive. BUT the smell is AWFUL. Very strong and artificial and chemical-ish. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> It does not work well. I have dark brown hair and when I used this it looks like my hair is grey.  It might work well for someone with grey hair or if you want grey hair for a costume.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this as well as the Batiste dry shampoo and I&#x27;d say I definitely prefer this one.  That being said, I don&#x27;t love it.  When I use Suave, my hair looks fabulous.  I have very thin hair that looks very greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  This dry shampoo eliminates the greasy look and adds fantastic volume to my hair.  However, my hair feels almost sticky.  Batiste, on the other hand, makes my hair feel fabulous - but it looks dull and lifeless.</li>
    <li> Nice dry shampoo and doesn&#x27;t dull your hair. I did not notice a difference from other dry shampoos I tried and the keratin. All I noticed was it was more natural looking and didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I dusted my hair with baby powder instead.</li>
    <li> my name is Rya I&#x27;m a African American with very thick hair do you think this Is a good product for me?</li>
    <li> This product is great if you do not have time to wash your hair sometime or live in a really humid climate.  You can even spray it on before a workout to help keep sweat away from your hair in the first place.  The only complaint I have is you have to be a little careful not to get it streaky.  But if you are careful your hair will look great.</li>
    <li> Not as chalky white as some (but still on the white powdery side).  Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all dry shampoos, I plug the sprayer with poster putty to prevent the contents from leaking out.  If you do that, dry shampoo will last you probably 30 uses.</li>
    <li> i used to wash my hair daily otherwise they will get really oily the second day. but frequently wash and blow-dry cause my hair a lot of damage. this product really saved my ass!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was traveling to MI for a winter vacation. It&#x27;s dry that time of year and I needed an alternative to washing my hair everyday that didn&#x27;t involve a leave in conditioner that would make my finicky hair oily. This worked perfectly to keep my hair oil free between washes, stop the static from the dry air, and provide volume. Thought I would only use it for the vacation but being a busy mom I use it more regularly at home as a pick me up for my hair when I don&#x27;t have the time/energy to style or wash it. Wish I had discovered this while I was pregnant and my hair was oily from all the hormones.</li>
    <li> Completely turned my hair white on areas I sprayed and didn&#x27;t blend well in my hair at all. I have never had this problem with any other dry shampoo. I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
    <li> I would have thought the can was empty if I didn&#x27;t know any better. I bought 2 bottles of the Suave because my dry shampoos go pretty quickly, and it was only $3. This is the third or fourth dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and it was by far the worst. I would spray it on my hair, just as instructed, and a few hours later my hair was back to the way it was when I started. If you are in the market for a dry shampoo that can actually get you through a full day, try any of the batiste dry shampoos. I&#x27;ve already switched back to them.</li>
    <li> I was buying an overpriced redken spray couldnt afford it anymore tried this out and it smells really good so I dont worrie about my hair works great I tried it waiting two days to wash my hair and it still looked good</li>
    <li> The shampoo sprays on white, which is somewhat difficult to remove.  The smell is completely overwhelming and chemical smelling.  Also, my hair feels very dirty afterwards.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, other than it does really help with the greasy hair look.</li>
    <li> if you know how to use this product it is a life saver. the bad reviewers don&#x27;t know how to use this product</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! Using baby powder works way better than this. I saw no difference when I sprayed my hair. And i used a lot to try to make it work. It smells bad as well. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Before this product, I used KeratinComplex Lock Launder Strengthening Dry Shampoo. That dry shampoo was AMAZING, but not a good deal for the price (Only lasted 2 weeks). While that product was great, it was too expensive, however this product is not effective enough. This dry shampoo does not reduce the oiliness of my hair nearly as much and will only work on day 2 after a shower, by day 3 the dry shampoo can&#x27;t keep up. I will try another product.</li>
    <li> I loved the product though it smells very, very strong. But after 2 uses its almost gone and i used it 10 inches away and not much to test it. Disappointing</li>
    <li> I tried this product since I have been looking for a good dry shampoo.  I previously used Batiste Blush scent but the smell is so off putting for me and felt like I wanted to scrub my head clean everytime I use it.  This on the other hand is really, really good!! It made my hair appear clean, volumized and it felt soft and healthy.  It didn&#x27;t feel sticky at all, I didn&#x27;t have any hair product on my hair, maybe that is why the other people had that issue.  The smell was actually good, I guess it&#x27;s a preference thing, I didn&#x27;t think it had an old lady smell at all, Batiste did, I thought Suave smelled fresh.  Overall very satisfied, must try!!! For the price, it&#x27;s truly a bang for your buck</li>
    <li> I have a fine greasy hair, that I had to wash every single day, no exception. I decided to give it a try, and I don&#x27;t even know how could I live without it until know! Not only allows me to wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, but it also gives more volume. Before I couldn&#x27;t even think about leaving the house without washing my hair on day 2, now my hair looks better the second day!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several more expensive brands, and this one works the best and is cheaper. Love it, will def use it a lot this summer.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands, one that was from the Bed Head line called Rock Star (or something) and this product that costs so much less is better! It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as Lulu Organic hair powder, but the price is great.  I have somewhat oily hair, but can&#x27;t manage a shampoo every day with three little babies.</li>
    <li> The smell is too overpowering to actually use unfortunately. I&#x27;ve used this once and although I felt it worked fine, I could not stop smelling the awful smell all day and got a headache. It&#x27;s a shame...</li>
    <li> It works pretty well and keeps the shine away for a full day. My only problem with this product is that it has a very strong scent and can get overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife who had to have major surgery 15 weeks into her pregnancy.  We received it, and looked at the label.  The product list is scary for a pregnant lady to use.  It is a dry shampoo, so it has various gasses in it to help evaporate, things like propane, etc.  Seriously?  THen when we tried to return it, Amazon refuesed to accept the return saying that it was a hazardous item that could not be safely shipped?  Ok....if it is so hazardous, how did you ship it to me?  Also, if it is too hazardous to go through the mail due to containing explosize gasses, WHY NOT HAVE A WARNING ABOUT THIS ON THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AO, we ended up getting stuck with it.  I just had surgery on my knee, and cannot get it wet.  I remembered this, and decided to give it a try. HORRIBLE!!!!!  It smells awful, and makes your hair feel dry.  It sprays a powder that is supposed to absorb hair grease.  It smelt so horrible, and felt so horrible, I had to bathe my hair over the kitchen sink while standing on crutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst products that I have ever spent money on, and there is NO SUPPORT from Amazon on this product.</li>
    <li> I like the Suave regular dry shampoo.  I tried this because I wanted to see what the difference would be with the Keratin Infusion.  It worked almost as well as the regular Suave Dry Shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t blend as well as usual.  I have really light blond hair that is fine and oily, so the white residue the regular one leaves behind actually blends in fine.  This one didn&#x27;t have as much of a light color residue so I think it would be better for darker haired girls who are looking for a more natural coloring from their dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> This will definitely absorb oil from unwashed hair. It will also add volume to hair, washed or unwashed. However, this product has very strong smell -- not necessarily bad, but definitely overwhelming. You have to let it sit for quite awhile to dry, after which point it leaves a stubborn white cast you have to brush out. With other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past, I can simply finger-comb or tease my hair at the roots with my fingers to remove the cast. That&#x27;s preferable to me because I usually use dry shampoo when I wake up late and need to be out the door!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ll say that this product definitely does what it promises and is a steal at this price. I bet it would work really well on people who have particularly oily scalps. Personally, though, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase because I prefer other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used this kind of dry shampoo so I&#x27;m not sure how to compare it to others but I love this stuff. I have really thick frizzy hair that takes forever to straighten or curl so doing either of those every day is a major pain. With this product I can spray it in and leave my straightened hair alone for a few more days. It can leave a white dust but if you brush it out it usually goes away. Occasionally I&#x27;ve had to run a wet brush to get rid of the dust but even doing that did not ruin my straight or curly hair. It give lots of volume and I like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> It works like it says. It does not leave any powder behind, does not smell bad. Also very economical. Love it!</li>
    <li> ugh, this stuff is terrible. It does the job, somewhat, but it turns your hair white where you spray it (unlike other brands i&#x27;ve used, ugh, it&#x27;s not inconspicuous at all) and the smell is nauseating. i have to open all the windows in the house if i ever use it - which i never do any more. I used it 2 or 3 times, but now it just sits under my bathroom sink and i already bought another dry shampoo spray from Target that is way better.</li>
    <li> Once again, Suave is marketing a loser with a big L!</li>
    <li> Over the past year, I have been trying different dry shampoos and decided to share my experience in hopes that it will help others find the right one for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant about me: I have twin babies and don&#x27;t have time to shower and wash my hair in the mornings like I used to. I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing. Here began my quest to find a dry shampoo that worked for me. I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair. It looks pretty good all day and doesn&#x27;t need refreshing which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: It works pretty well. When sprayed lightly, it dries up any oils and refreshes the hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat so that is good. It blended in well with my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: THE SMELL. I had read reviews that talked about the smell but thought, &amp;#34;meh, I&#x27;m not that sensitive to smells. It will be fine.&amp;#34; However, the smell is really bad. It is SO strong. I mean, my husband once walked in the bathroom while I was using it and declared that I would most likely die of cancer if I kept inhaling this. (Note: He is NOT a doctor and this claim cannot be verified). It also cannot be verified because I no longer use this product and the main reason is the smell. It has a very strong chemical smell that is covered up with a very strong (slightly unpleasant) perfume smell. When I used it, I could smell it on my hair most of the day. Also, if sprayed too heavily, it would turn chalky and kind of stiff and weigh the hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weighing these good and bad points, I give it 3 stars. It is the one I used for several months before Ifound Salon Grafix - Play it Big. (You can see my review of this one on its product page). The main reason I switched was not because of how Suave dry shampoo worked, but simply because of the super strong lingering slightly unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene dry shampoo - Worst one I&#x27;ve tried. Didn&#x27;t refresh hair. Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme dry shampoo - A little better than the Pantene. Refreshed somewhat but didn&#x27;t last all day. Didn&#x27;t smell as good as Pantene, but had a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salon Grafix Play It Big - This is the dry shampoo I currently use. I like that it has color tinted options, refreshes hair well, and smells fine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo this morning so I just sprayed a little on my problem areas and enjoyed instant volume for the rest of the day. I will say that I really didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, to me it was just a little too strong but it did seem to fade fairly quickly and didn&#x27;t cause any problems with my allergies, which is always a concern with scented products. Over all it&#x27;s a handy product to have around for those times that you can&#x27;t shampoo and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This works well. I believe that biolux worked better though.</li>
    <li> I have been on a dry shampoo roller coaster trying to find just the perfect one. This one was okay but I have experienced better outcomes in the same price range. Sadly, dry shampoo is like so many other things, what works great for one person might not work so well for you. My experience was fair. I would say its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a dry shampoo.  I tried this today (purchased elsewhere) and It didn&#x27;t make the cut for me,  it is heavily perfumed and it lingers a long time.  I will be looking for a lighter scent or an unscented product.  That being said, if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like you&#x27;ve just sampled the entire perfume counter at the drug store, go for it, this was made with you in mind.  However,  if you&#x27;re like me and prefer unscented or very fresh and light scents I&#x27;d keep looking this is probably not going to work for you either.</li>
    <li> Ok everyone....this is a miracle formula for people with fine, thin hair. I even use it when my hair is clean to add more volume and thickness. Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was great for those in between shower moments you have. I like to use this after I have a light workout and a quick shower where I can&#x27;t wash my hair. It&#x27;s very handy and works well with my fine hair that tends to get oily in between washes.</li>
    <li> Great item it came fast in the mail. Can&#x27;t complain just wish I would of waited for the thing to be sold in stores it would of been cheaper</li>
    <li> Great. This dry shampoo works like a charm and adds incredible volume. It is the best one I&#x27;ve tried (including salon brands) and, for only $4, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> My wife has purchased all kinds of brands of these, all at 5x-10x the price.  She tried this one out after my continual griping at all the $$ I see floating in the air as she blasts through these things and she actually likes this one!  As you might imagine, we are both ecstatic!  Also found it on the aisle of our grocery store for not much more than on here.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Smells great and transforms my straight oily hair that goes limp and loses body easily the day after washing, into voluminous and clean hair. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few dry shampoos and this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> It works! It helps get extra oil out of your hair! I don&#x27;t really think the Keratin part of it really does anything, but it does get rid of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more product in the bottle. That&#x27;s my only complaint. I feel like I went through it really fast, but since it&#x27;s so cheap it&#x27;s not a big deal. I still think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I only shower every other day since its bad to wash your hair every day. I don&#x27;t have super greasy hair on the second day but it also doesn&#x27;t look super clean. After flat ironing my hair in the morning, I spray this on my roots and brush it through and it takes away my grease! It&#x27;s like a shower in a can!! I love this stuff! The aerosol in the can is pretty smelly so use it in a bathroom with a fan or window, but it&#x27;s totally worth the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a dry shampoo, and, after reading a bunch of reviews, decided to try this brand. My scalp is a little oily, but my hair tends to be dry. As a result, I felt like I had to wash and heat style my hair daily, occasionally skipping a day here or there, thus making it even drier. With this product, my blowout can easily last three days, and my hair looks better on the second and third days than the first. I have a ton of volume and great texture. A few people have noted that the smell is a little chemically, but it isn&#x27;t bad. Also, yes, the product is white you first spray it on. However, just wait for it to dry, brush it out, and it will disappear. Trust me on this - I have black hair. As far as dry shampoo goes, I&#x27;m a total convert. FYI, I&#x27;ve scoured the web, and you can&#x27;t beat the $2.88 Amazon price.</li>
    <li> When I use this in my hair one it smells great and the other it takes any oils out of your hair if needed. I usually don&#x27;t have to use it all the time as I shower at night most of the time and my hair is not oily the next morning but I do notice it has done it when I was sick and couldn&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple days. (eww I know gross). Enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and will absolutely order again. It&#x27;s not the absolute highest quality dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve used, but for the price it&#x27;s a great product that I can use regularly without breaking the bank. For those who have issues with scent or residue- definitely keep in mind that less is more, and that you really do need to hold the nozzle far away from your head (I basically fully extend my arm) to get the best results.</li>
    <li> i used this because of my difficulty getting in and out of the tub.  i needed to wash my hair more often and this did an excellent job.  then my granddaughter used it after ear surgery.  she was very pleased.  since  she is 12, you can see that any kind of approval means a lot!</li>
    <li> Good for one day only if you have a greasy hair like mine! I found it more helpful holding my hair style when freshly washed. Strongly recommend it for such cases.</li>
    <li> I bought Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo, 5 Ounce Normal quality. The only thing I do not like Now that the leaves of black hair The white dust ever</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have just discovered dry shampoo! I love it.  The roots of my hair get oily when it&#x27;s 2nd or 3rd day, but my hair gets really dried out if I wash it every day and it takes forever to blow dry and style.  This stuff also gives my hair some texture which makes it easier to wear my hair in a poof or braid because it behaves.  Just be careful not to spray too much because if you do, it can be hard to rub it in your hair ends up looking lighter on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller I purchased it from took weeks to get me the product (not sure why it took forever before they shipped it out) and I did later find it cheaper at Wal-mart but haven&#x27;t seen this in all the normal drugstores/grocery stores.  I will probably not buy online again, but otherwise this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD:&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few months I wanted to try the other brands.  I tried a couple others, including a salon brand that costs $18 a bottle (Tigi), and this is still my favorite!  I found the other brands&#x27; product quality &amp; ease of usage about the same (or worse), but the fragrance was overwhelming and nauseating for me.  Suave has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> Bumble &amp; Bumble makes by far the best hair powder but it is very expensive. Suave comes the closest in my opinion and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. Only wish it came colored like B&amp;B.</li>
    <li> It works okay but the smell is so overpowering and terrible that I simply cannot use it. Good thing it was cheap.</li>
    <li> It smells nice at first but the smell lingers until you wash your hair and becomes very annoying, however it does what it promises and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Alright, so I am definitely one of those people who has to wash their hair every day. I swear, pretty much every morning I wake up with greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m always in a big rush in the morning, so it&#x27;s not always realistic to wash my hair, and that&#x27;s where I discovered dry shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried some dry shampoo from my aunt&#x27;s salon (Brocato Dry Shampoo), and it was pretty good, but left some white residue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I went on Amazon to see what people were liking the most, and this had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wasn&#x27;t all that crazy about it after the first few uses. I mean, it mostly gets the grease out, mostly. But it doesn&#x27;t smell that great and leaves my hair stiff and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again, and I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;ll finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I might just switch back to Brocato, they seriously have a great hair product line.</li>
    <li> I normally use big and sexy dry shampoo, but I also use this quite often. the 2 are different. but I do like them both. I really like this one, I normally use it after swimming, or as a pcik me up for my hiar throughout the day. It can also be used as on 2 day hair, and to switch your hair style. I really love this stuff, and it makes my hair feel great! also it is a great price, and I get it on here on the subscribe and save, which saves me 15% more, which makes it cheaper than at the store, which only sometimes have it in stock anyway... I recommend this to everybody! it is great stuff!</li>
    <li> Bought on Amazon due to the more positive reviews, but this isn&#x27;t a product for me.  I have thick hair--not entirely sure if that&#x27;s the problem--but when I use this product, it leaves a residue in my hair and feels gross to the touch.  It does get rid of the smell oily hair has and it looks pretty presentable, but it won&#x27;t be replacing me washing my hair every day.  Sad.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this. It is my first time using dry shampoo, which I have been looking into ever since someone suggested it to me because certain types of hair curling styles look better second day. Now some oil is really good for your hair, and you shouldn&#x27;t really wash it every day anyway. But even though my curls looked better, my scalp was a little too oily for my taste and, worse, it flattened. This does so many things well: it adds volume, it absorbs oils but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair lackluster, and it smells amazing....clean and light, but enough to not make you feel grungy. And did I mention the volume?? If you have problems with hair flattening out, I&#x27;d use this even during styling on a wash day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought this for my trip to the UK, in case there were places and times I couldn&#x27;t get a full on hair wash. I&#x27;ll have to see how it holds up there, especially in Scotland&#x27;s climate, but while in the States I&#x27;m loving it! And for under $3, it is a product I can use all the time without all the guilt. I love it as much as my aquage, bumble and bumble, and matrix products!</li>
    <li> I have never used a dry shampoo before, but a friend raved about this one so I thought I would try it.  I have very fine, straight hair that I wear in a short, layered cut.  Up until now daily hair washing was part of my routine because my hair would look too flat if I skipped a day.  This product allows me to skip a day.  I spray it on the roots, fluff up my hair, and it looks great - a little miracle in a can for just a few bucks!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to use this product after reading so many awesome reviews. I have thin to normal hair and this made my hair more greasy after using (like several other reviewers stated). Also, Amazon will not issue a refund for this product, because it is flammable; they only recommend that you throw it away. Very disappointed overall, but it was cheap, so oh well.</li>
