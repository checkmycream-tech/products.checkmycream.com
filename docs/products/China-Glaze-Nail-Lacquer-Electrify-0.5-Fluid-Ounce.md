      <li>It was very nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still very happy with the quality, as it doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as a lot of glitters and the coverage is great in two coats.</li>

      <li>No need to add anything to make it more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>so I will probably wear it anyways :)</li>
      <li>Luxe and Lush fit its name perfectly...</li>
      <li>This color is absolutely amazing, and it is so unique.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t so good on it&#x27;s own since it&#x27;s basically clear polish with a bunch of glitter</li>
      <li>she will enjoy it more</li>
      <li>The most beautiful color I have seen in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I used it over black for October and it looked awesome.</li>
      <li>I love this, but was excited to be able to wear it right now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably a bit too intense to wear on your fingernails if you work in a professional environment, but it looks brilliant on a pedicure.</li>
      <li>This is such a great color</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great over solid colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep it because it was cheap and returning it will be a hassle.</li>
      <li>I love it,the colors really capture the hunger games, and</li>
      <li>Fast Track is probably my favorite</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t return it because it would be cool for a funky event.</li>
      <li>Lots of glitter, very bright and just what I expected from China Glaze def order more in the future!</li>
      <li>Electrify is a new favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I made this purchase without seeing the polish in person, which I rarely do.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a Hunger Games fan it will be doubly loved by you for its extremely close association to Katniss, the Girl on Fire.</li>
      <li>jump off at once from being touched on the right</li>
      <li>I painted my nails black with this on only the tips (awesome effect) but it felt like Christmas!</li>
      <li>I like the China Glaze nail polishes, goes on nice and stays on long.  </li>
      <li>I love the autumn-esque colors and the sparkle is simply enchanting.</li>
      <li>Plus, it would take many coats to make a solid color.</li>
      <li>The red pieces are my favorite.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I wore it when I saw the movie for the first time</li>
      <li>i wasnt expecting it to have a bit of red to it, but it just makes it better.</li>
      <li>and I do love it, but the pictures do not clearly show the color.</li>
      <li>Usually when we purchase glitter nail polish you have to put on 3-4 coats to make it look good.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty, though, and covers completely in two coats.</li>
      <li>it goes with so much.</li>
      <li>Going to have to buy another bottle soon with how much I use this one.</li>
      <li>Not as much color as I was hoping</li>
      <li>I really like this polish.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had whole nails of this polish</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m excited to try different colors.</li>
      <li>One negative (haha) is that you just won&#x27;t be able to quit looking at your nails !  </li>
      <li>Color was great and did not easily chip off nails although it did take longer to dry.</li>
      <li>Its such a fun glitter mix and it covers my nails very well.</li>
      <li>The red glitter within the gold is a bit more prevelant than the photo leads on, just FYI for future buyers.</li>
      <li>Definitely a high quality polish</li>
      <li>im seriously about to buy every one because i love this color so much!!</li>
      <li>But I went ahead and ordered Fast Track, Electrify, Dress me up &amp; Luxe &amp; Lush anyways....</li>
      <li>I dont like that when yu put the polish on its rough and its snags on everything.the color is mostly gold and red glitter.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a mix of glitter resulting in a copper hue, however, once I received the polish I realized that it was purely gold and red.</li>
      <li>Had to give to a friends nine year old daughter.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be completely mesmerized.</li>
      <li>While I am not as big of a fan of this color because the glitter is almost too thick, I do love that it really represents The Hunger Games</li>
      <li>The product looks just like the picture, it applies easy, but it&#x27;s so hard to take it off.</li>
      <li>i might give this to my sister who is an art major mabey</li>
      <li>For any age, you would love it and if not, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments.</li>

<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> This shade is extremely glittery/sparkly.</li>
<li> though it was going to be a slight brown color.&lt;br</li>
<li> I just received this product in the mail a few minutes ago and immediately put it on.</li>
<li> Could probably use two or three topcoats as it is not smooth to the touch</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried it on bare nails, over other polish, and with a rubberized base coat - nothing makes it stick.</li>
<li> Color is awful and so much glitter that it is way too messy.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t look too bad</li>

    <li> This color is absolutely amazing, and it is so unique. One negative (haha) is that you just won&#x27;t be able to quit looking at your nails !  You&#x27;ll be completely mesmerized. If you&#x27;re a Hunger Games fan it will be doubly loved by you for its extremely close association to Katniss, the Girl on Fire. I wore it when I saw the movie for the first time and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about it ! This is a keeper, I wish I had 20 bottles so I&#x27;d never run out.</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail a few minutes ago and immediately put it on. It is absolutely gorgeous! Other nail polishes like this would need numerous coats to cover the entire nail but this one, I found, only needed one or two. It definitely reflects everything about the Hunger Games and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Color is awful and so much glitter that it is way too messy. Had to give to a friends nine year old daughter.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality nail polish. Usually when we purchase glitter nail polish you have to put on 3-4 coats to make it look good. With this product one coat looks good and two coats covers the nail to the maximum you would want. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this polish. The color and sparkle is amazing. No need to add anything to make it more noticeable. A basecoat..maybe for lasting power and a topcoat to add shine.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish everr!!! I love it,the colors really capture the hunger games, and im seriously about to buy every one because i love this color so much!!</li>
    <li> After finding out China Glaze had a Hunger Games collection I knew I had to have it. I looked up multiple reviews on nail polish blogs I was a bit deterred because it only got average ratings. But I went ahead and ordered Fast Track, Electrify, Dress me up &amp; Luxe &amp; Lush anyways.... And let me say the odds were ever in my favor!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE The colors! Fast Track is probably my favorite it looks so elegant! It reminds me of how they dress Katniss up and make her \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; But she still has her fire! Its a neutral taupe-ish color with sparkles that look like gold dust!!! Luxe and Lush fit its name perfectly... It looks like shards of diamonds on your nails!!!! Dress me up is a prim and proper mauve... For some reason it makes me think of a garden tea party!!!! Electrify embodies Katniss&#x27;s fire... While I am not as big of a fan of this color because the glitter is almost too thick, I do love that it really represents The Hunger Games so I will probably wear it anyways :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying more of the collection!</li>
    <li> Love this color!! Lots of glitter, very bright and just what I expected from China Glaze def order more in the future!</li>
    <li> pretty color will be fun to use in the fall when warm tones are perfect for my nails.  thank you</li>
    <li> This polish is a mix of red and yellow glitter, not brown/gold like the photo. It is very pretty, though, and covers completely in two coats. I get compliments every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef with it is how it flakes and chips. I&#x27;ve tried it on bare nails, over other polish, and with a rubberized base coat - nothing makes it stick. It lasts about two days before pieces start popping off. I&#x27;ve even had whole nails of this polish jump off at once from being touched on the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color, but be prepared to touch up the chips every night.</li>
    <li> Electrify is a new favorite of mine. I love the autumn-esque colors and the sparkle is simply enchanting.</li>
    <li> This is such a great color it goes with so much. I get tons of compliments whenever i do. I would recommend this to any person that likes nail polish.</li>
    <li> The most beautiful color I have seen in a long time.  It compliments everything. Glad I found here because they don&#x27;t have this in the stores.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase without seeing the polish in person, which I rarely do. The color was not quite what I was expecting. I was expecting a mix of glitter resulting in a copper hue, however, once I received the polish I realized that it was purely gold and red. I&#x27;m still very happy with the quality, as it doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as a lot of glitters and the coverage is great in two coats.</li>
    <li> If you love the Hunger Games or if you love glittery/eye catching nail polish, this is for you! Even if you aren&#x27;t a Hunger Games fan, this polish is literally electrifying. For any age, you would love it and if not, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t so good on it&#x27;s own since it&#x27;s basically clear polish with a bunch of glitter but it&#x27;s great over solid colors. I used it over black for October and it looked awesome.</li>
    <li> Color was great and did not easily chip off nails although it did take longer to dry. Could probably use two or three topcoats as it is not smooth to the touch</li>
    <li> I love this! The red glitter within the gold is a bit more prevelant than the photo leads on, just FYI for future buyers. But it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gold bronze nail polish. when i got in the mail i was on the fence.I dont like that when yu put the polish on its rough and its snags on everything.the color is mostly gold and red glitter.I though it was going to be a slight brown color.&lt;br /&gt; Although it looks great and you cant tell if its smuged. i might give this to my sister who is an art major mabey she will enjoy it more that me.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I was expecting a copper color according to the picture. It is yellow and red specks. However, I didn&#x27;t return it because it would be cool for a funky event. The color and glitter POPS when you look at it. I just wish it was the copper color!</li>
    <li> i was looking for a winter/christmas color for my nails and this was a great one! i wasnt expecting it to have a bit of red to it, but it just makes it better. would be great for valentines, too. beautiful!</li>
    <li> This color looks like fire on your nails, I have to squint when looking at it in the sunlight! It takes about three coats to become opaque, and it lasts about a week on the nails. Going to have to buy another bottle soon with how much I use this one. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I like the China Glaze nail polishes, goes on nice and stays on long.  All of the colors are great.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish! Accidentally bought two of these, so I decided I will just give one away as a present instead of returning it. Bright color and I think it&#x27;s perfect for all fans of the Hunger Games. The shipping was awesome and got it two days before the estimated delivery date. Will buy again and I&#x27;m excited to try different colors. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It was very nice. Not as much color as I was hoping but it looks very good with the RIVETING nail polish.</li>
    <li> The actual color of this polish is a gold and RED glitter. Not at all what I anticipated. Plus, it would take many coats to make a solid color. I&#x27;m going to end up giving this away.</li>
    <li> I got my China Glaze Hunger Games Specialty Color Electrify today, ran downstairs and ripped it open. Only thing, it&#x27;s not bronze and gold glitter as seen in the picture. It&#x27;s red and yellow glitter. It doesn&#x27;t look too bad but it&#x27;s not what I expected. I&#x27;ll keep it because it was cheap and returning it will be a hassle. So if you&#x27;re hoping for something bronze/gold, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The product looks just like the picture, it applies easy, but it&#x27;s so hard to take it off. Not to mention it chips.</li>
    <li> This shade is extremely glittery/sparkly. So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then this is the product for you. I absolutely love this color. It&#x27;s probably a bit too intense to wear on your fingernails if you work in a professional environment, but it looks brilliant on a pedicure. It&#x27;s a great color to have peek out of a great pair of peep toes or sandals. Perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> Its such a fun glitter mix and it covers my nails very well. The red pieces are my favorite. Great job China glaze</li>
    <li> I love this, but was excited to be able to wear it right now. I painted my nails black with this on only the tips (awesome effect) but it felt like Christmas! I will only use this polish around the holidays due to the RED RED RED glitter. It looks different from the picture. Definitely a high quality polish and I do love it, but the pictures do not clearly show the color.</li>
