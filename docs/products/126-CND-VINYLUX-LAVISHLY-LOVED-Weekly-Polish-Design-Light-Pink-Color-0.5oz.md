      <li>A more opaque color option would be nice.</li>
      <li>easily a week of wear even when I am at the lake in the summer!</li>
      <li>Somewhere I had read that Witch Hazel, wiped on clean nails with a cotton ball, is a great nail prep - as well as cheap.</li>
      <li>This color is very light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
      <li>Looking for something more opaque.  </li>
      <li>It lasted close to 2 weeks before I saw any notable deterioration in finish.  </li>
      <li>It was sticky and clumped around the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>The best thing is it last and does not chip.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>You must use the top coat.  </li>

      <li>Vinyl Lux was purported to endure for 2 weeks with just a weekly top coat...</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>use a Vinylux top coat and remove with Acetone ( place soaked cotton ball on nails wrap with tin foil and let it set for awhile.</li>
      <li>I used the Vinylux polish and the top coat.</li>
      <li>outstanding nail polish.  </li>

      <li>So beautiful in the bottle, but even after 3 coats I could barely see it.  </li>
      <li>I  had the light cured professional nail polish for a  wedding and it was great</li>
      <li>On vacation an easy 7 days.</li>
      <li>Easy on and easy off.</li>
      <li>Goes on so easily.</li>
      <li>Hands down, the best!  </li>
      <li>Gorgeous light, classy color</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>WOW, I love, love, love this.  </li>
      <li>love the polish, last a good week.</li>
      <li>The color is great, and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle of this in London and was panicked I could not get any more.</li>
      <li>I am so excited, I bought 10 bottles.</li>
      <li>My favorite shade, very feminine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to French and is much easier to do yourself.</li>
      <li>I want something that does not chip so quickly</li>
      <li>My new favorite nail polish.</li>
      <li>Love this product and color is very natural.  </li>
      <li>After 2 months of continued use, I actually have nails and they are strong and healthy</li>
      <li>The Lavishly Loved polish was easily to apply and with one coat, the result was a natural French manicure.</li>
      <li>This method is a little time consuming but has great longitvity.</li>
      <li>Color is almost sheer, but is nice.  </li>
      <li>Since I have to pay extra to use the ones at the salon, I decided to buy the colors I liked and bring them with me.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stay on my nails a full 5 days without chipping but came pretty close.</li>
      <li>this polish seems to be the answer to my problems of having a manicure not last one week - nice shade</li>
      <li>it stays on and looks fresh longer than others I have used.</li>
      <li>lovely color, but so sheer that I needed 4-5 coats, but still the perfect sheer pink color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>By using this polish and the Vinylux top coat, it really did last a full week.</li>
      <li>I love this color for my everyday nursing job-but used Red Goddess color for the holidays and it was gorgeous.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know if the witch hazel prep made the difference, the polish and top coat made the difference, or the sun curing process made the difference, I only know that when I continued using these products and this routine, SOMETHING made a difference.</li>
      <li>Like many folks, I am allergic to formaldehyde resin, the ingredient that traditionally gives nail products their hardening and staying power.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love this. Beautiful clean color. Goes on so easily.</li>
    <li> The polish color was as expected; however, the product appeared to have been used. It was sticky and clumped around the top of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous light, classy color</li>
    <li> Did not like this. Color wasn&#x27;t bad but no matter how careful I was or what technique I used or how many layers I applied, you could see the brush strokes and any overlapping strokes would cause a visible mark.  I kept trying it and even had a nail tech friend apply it for me with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> This nail polish works! On vacation an easy 7 days. 4-5 days if I&#x27;m not cleaning or forgetting to wear my cleaning &amp; dishwashing gloves. Love! I&#x27;m a huge fan! I wish they had more colors!! 3 kids/mother and it works great. Not as great as shellac, but who has time or money for that!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product, made my nails very brittle.</li>
    <li> I hate going to get my nails done because I always manage to mess them up within 30 minutes of leaving the salon, even if I sit under the UV lamps for 30 minutes. This product dried insanely fast, so fast that when a little fiber got onto my nail it was hard to get it off even after have just applied another coat. This color is very light. two shades basically matches my skin tone. I am excited to order more bottles!</li>
    <li> Love itttttt ... This color to me turn out look like bubble bath by OPI which is very popular and it does stay on well&lt;br /&gt;👍</li>
    <li> By using this polish and the Vinylux top coat, it really did last a full week. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it except I had read other reviews so I ordered it. Love it!</li>
    <li> I actually got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will have to let me know what she thinks of this product.  I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
    <li> Love this product and color is very natural.  Very gentle on natural nails and truly does last 7 days or even longer, depending on how much abuse your hands take.  Only complaint is the product leaked during the shipping process.  Lost about half of product and a real mess to clean.</li>
    <li> Vinyl Lux was purported to endure for 2 weeks with just a weekly top coat...At the end of day 3...the polish started to peel and needed to be totally redone...Great for primadonnas with nothing better to do ...than doing their nails....There ought to be a law!</li>
    <li> Great polish and it stays on and looks fresh longer than others I have used. A little pricey but worth the money I think.</li>
    <li> My new favorite nail polish. It does last a long time. With the lighter colors, let them dry a slight between coats for an even finish. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping it would at least last 3 or 4 days without chipping. I have a job where I must constantly wash and sanitize my hands with harsh alcohol-based gel.  My manicures always get dried out and chip, so it&#x27;s completely not worth it. I love having my nails painted though! So, I tried this on the off chance that it might work and I&#x27;m on day 4 with no sign of wearing off or chipping.  It comes off with regular nail polish remover, and it&#x27;s not the shellac which I can&#x27;t really use either as I don&#x27;t like having the nail bed scuffed.  It is what a regular nail polish should be! I love it!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews. However, this polish deserves one. I cannot keep any polish on my nails, no matter what I do...they chip the next day! I bought my first bottle of this in London and was panicked I could not get any more. This is amazing nail polish. It&#x27;s been on over a week, and still counting. I am so excited, I bought 10 bottles. I can&#x27;t wait to get manicures now....and it is priced SO well. What a find!</li>
    <li> It lasted close to 2 weeks before I saw any notable deterioration in finish.  I definitely will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Very, very pale hue. But creme finish ensures it lasts a long time. Good if you just want something subtle.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It gives your nails a natural look accentuating your white tips. It&#x27;s a great alternative to French and is much easier to do yourself. I did not give 5 starts as color is a bit streaky, but no one would ever notice. It stays on much longer than regular polish.</li>
    <li> This polish is wonderful - it lasts a full week as advertised. I bring it with me when I get a manicure because my salon charges extra for it! The color is sheer and neutral.</li>
    <li> Lasted 5 days on my nails with minimal chips. I used the Vinylux polish and the top coat. Lasted through dishwashing and constantly working with my hands all day at work. ( I work in a Lab)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have been getting &amp;#34;gel nails&amp;#34; for several years. The main reason is my nails are very soft, weak, and peel - NO MATTER WHAT I DO!!! Or so I thought.......When a friend told me I could do a gel manicure at home, I was very skeptical. She insisted, I purchased, and here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased &amp;#34;Lavishly Loved #126&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;CND Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish. Somewhere I had read that Witch Hazel, wiped on clean nails with a cotton ball, is a great nail prep - as well as cheap. So I sat down and filed, shaped, used cuticle remover, - the whole 9 yards and BEFORE I applied the polish, I wiped my nails with Walgreen&#x27;s generic witch hazel and let it dry. The Lavishly Loved polish was easily to apply and with one coat, the result was a natural French manicure. No globs and no streaks. Two coats produced a manicure that looks clean and professional. The Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish applied easily as well. On the advice of my previously mentioned friend, I walked outside, held my fingers up and let the sun &amp;#34;cure the manicure.&amp;#34; About 5 days into the week, I applied another coat of top coat and got 13 days of a non-chipped manicure! Mind you, this includes washing dishes, laundry, and cleaning without gloves as well as moving the lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I redid the manicure was the growth showed and I&#x27;m OCD. With the polish on, my nails were hard and after the polish was removed my nails were still hard. After 2 months of continued use, I actually have nails and they are strong and healthy and I actually have to file because they get too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know if the witch hazel prep made the difference, the polish and top coat made the difference, or the sun curing process made the difference, I only know that when I continued using these products and this routine, SOMETHING made a difference. It is my understanding that a base coat is not needed because the polish itself contains a basecoat and a nail strengthener. Whatever..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased with the products: 100% - in fact I just ordered 2 additional colors.nd a nail strengthener. Whatever..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased with the products: 100% - in fact I just ordered 2 additional colors.</li>
    <li> great neutral color - recommend!</li>
    <li> outstanding nail polish.  my nails stay perfect for more than a week for first time in my life!</li>
    <li> chipped the next day&lt;br /&gt;easy to take off- peels off.&lt;br /&gt;will try again hope for better results; color is nice</li>
    <li> This pink and very pale ,If you like your nails to look like there is no polish on them you will love this nail polish. It does have a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a pale pink that gives a sheer coverage.  The best thing is it last and does not chip. I usually wear it for a week before I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> A nail tech had used this polish for my manicure so I was already familiar with it and liked it as a standard, basic color. I was delighted to be able to purchased it online.  My order arrived in about a week.There was no damage.  I appreciate the prompt service and reasonable price. My manicure usually lasts at least 10 days.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade of neutral. I do at least two coats but it dries fast, especially with the top coat.</li>
    <li> The nail polish stays nice for a couple of days! Awesome product and will be buying more! I love it!</li>
    <li> This Polish lasted OVER two weeks for me.  Changed it tonight only because it grew out. Easy on and easy off. You must use the top coat.  I travelled through airports and I always chip a nail with luggage. No Chips. I wash my hands all the time because I have dogs ( and travel)  Did dishes, everything. It&#x27;s still on my toes from 2 weeks ago and looks brand new.  No peeling at cuticles&lt;br /&gt;This color itself is quite sheer. Looking for something more opaque.  But it does look great with grapefruit sparkle on top.  Love this polish!</li>
    <li> Will not buy again Opi much better for less money  very poor coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this color! Arrived way sooner than expected which was great!</li>
    <li> So beautiful in the bottle, but even after 3 coats I could barely see it.  Didn&#x27;t last well on me.  I&#x27;m going to try another color from this brand to try out before I decide whether or not I like the product (and not just this color).</li>
    <li> It does last over a week but I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because my weak grooved nails need something to cover the ridges better. A more opaque color option would be nice.</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> WOW, I love, love, love this.  I will never use any other nail polish. Amazingly, this polish lives up to all of its advertising hype, and then some.  Like many folks, I am allergic to formaldehyde resin, the ingredient that traditionally gives nail products their hardening and staying power.  I have tried so many hypo-allergenic nail polish products that are a waste of time because they are dented and peeling almost as soon as they dry.  This nail polish is something different.  It honestly goes on like a rock, and has the most amazing staying power.  I also love the well-designed brush which made it so easy to give myself the most professional-looking manicure ever.  My only caveat is that I prefer the Sparkly Grapefruit color which is slightly pinker, but has a subtle sparkly shine, but that is just me.</li>
    <li> Nearly clear - so a bit disappointing in that respect. But if you want neutral and unnoticeable, this will do you! The Vinylux formula is a little different than other polishes and doesn&#x27;t require special light, so you might want to try this!</li>
    <li> lovely color, but so sheer that I needed 4-5 coats, but still the perfect sheer pink color I was looking for.</li>
    <li> love the polish, last a good week.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and it&#x27;s nice to obtain it on amazon,,</li>
    <li> It is so much easier than Shelac since it comes right off with nail polish remover, no soaking or scraping.</li>
    <li> Stayed on only for a day or so</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best!  I love this stuff paired with the polish.  I am constantly cooking and have my hands in water, my manicurist recommend I tried this one time and I&#x27;m hooked.  Since I have to pay extra to use the ones at the salon, I decided to buy the colors I liked and bring them with me. Guaranteed to last a week, won&#x27;t damage your nails like the UV gel, comes off with regular acetone, dries super fast!  What more could you want? Your nails to actually grow better?  Well, guess what?  They do!&lt;br /&gt;Start by cleaning the nail thoroughly, pushing back any cuticle, give it a soft buff, I like to use a paper towel with acetone to clean any oils off the nail, apply 2-3 coats of color and one top coat.  No need for a base coat.  I really hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> My favorite shade, very feminine.</li>
    <li> Color is lighter than I expected, but that is probably my fault.  Color is almost sheer, but is nice.  Claim for Vinylux polishes is that they last a week on nails and I see many reviewers agree it does last a week.  For me, they last about 4 days (and I am not hard on my nails, I don&#x27;t clean, etc.).  But, it is much better than most nail polish, just hoping to see a week out of these sometime!  I would order again.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty, neutral, pink color. When applied correctly Vinylux stays put! Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Best polish ever. normally I can only get 2-3 days from OPI but with this polish----WOW easily a week of wear even when I am at the lake in the summer!</li>
    <li> I was clued into this by a beautition friend who does a lot of weddings and she uses it. I have never been a big &amp;#34;nail polish girl&amp;#34; As a nurse I wash my hands frequently and I never liked the short life of the polish. I  had the light cured professional nail polish for a  wedding and it was great but I never would have done it week after week. This polish is cured with regular light and gets harder with time I get about 5 days and for me that is worth it- my own nails have become very thin and breaking.A couple things my friend told me, the nails have to be very dry so don&#x27;t use after a shower or dishwashing, Scrub your nails well with alcohol to further dry them and get a dry base. Stick your hands under light(lamp ect) between coats for about 5 minutes. use a Vinylux top coat and remove with Acetone ( place soaked cotton ball on nails wrap with tin foil and let it set for awhile. I love this color for my everyday nursing job-but used Red Goddess color for the holidays and it was gorgeous. This method is a little time consuming but has great longitvity.</li>
    <li> The color is very natural looking and does stay on longer than regular polishes and comes off with regular nail polish remover with no extra effort.</li>
    <li> Just tried it yesterday. So far I am happy with it. I want something that does not chip so quickly so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> this polish seems to be the answer to my problems of having a manicure not last one week - nice shade</li>
    <li> Once you use this new type of nail polish, you will toss out all of your others.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing AND you still use regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this nail polish hoping desperately it would be what it claimed to be.  The nail polish definitely stayed nice much longer than any other polish I have used.  I removed it 6 days after applying it.  But it still left my nails dry and peely.  My nails are very healthy and I don&#x27;t have issues with peeling in general.  After a few months, my nails are back to their original health, but unfortunately, this product is a big (but sadly expected) disappointment.</li>
    <li> Wears fine and lasts but the color is a bit muted and not what I expected. True color choices are hard but this one was way off</li>
    <li> Came well packaged and undamaged.  Manicure with this product sealed by CND Vinylux top coat does dry in about 8 minutes and lasts for at least a week. Takes a little time and effort but is removed without soaking and without damage to nails.</li>
    <li> The color is great, and it lasts a long time. Goes on a little streaky, though.</li>
    <li> This color is not even close to pink so if you want a light pink get negligee. I found you can&#x27;t cut any corners, it is best to use all the CND protects intended to be used with this polish. The sticky base coat and the top coat. It didn&#x27;t stay on my nails a full 5 days without chipping but came pretty close.</li>
    <li> Natural looking color, dries fast and last longer than regular polish.  What more could I want!?</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> I had a french manicure at a Ritz Carlton in FL using all the Vinylux products. Being on the beach, swimming/sunscreen &amp; sand the manicure literally lasted all week, which prompted me to buy the very same products as soon as I got home. Disappointment! I don&#x27;t know what is different, but w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works the same as Revlon</li>
    <li> good stuff, good price - must use with its own top coat!</li>
