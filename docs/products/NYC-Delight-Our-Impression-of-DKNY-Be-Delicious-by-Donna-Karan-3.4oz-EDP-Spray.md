<li> original daughter was very disappointed but we&#x27;re not millionaires</li>
<li> hard to find the words that would describe this stuff!</li>
<li> , description is poor.</li>
<li> Wrong.</li>
<li> Needless to say even though she argued and begged for the 60$ dkny, i told her i bough her another bottle</li>
<li> box in a terrible condition.</li>

    <li> I went with two stars for this one. I almost went with three because it&#x27;s still a nice clean (although soapy) scent, but it&#x27;s not trying to be it&#x27;s own scent. It&#x27;s trying to be DKNY Be Delicious Apple, which I can say it fully fails at doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses DKNY Be Delicious Apple exclusively. It has become her signature scent she likes it so much. So when she ran out and I had limited funds I thought what the heck, it could be a good ripoff, right? Wrong. It&#x27;s more like a lavender soap smell with a small, very faint hint of green apple involved. As I said, it&#x27;s OK. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it as a knockoff again, but I would buy it for one of my other daughters as just a new perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original daughter was very disappointed but we&#x27;re not millionaires so she&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone, then we&#x27;ll go back to DKNY Be Delicious Apple again I guess.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> It smells good but it dose not smell like dkny be delicious. &amp;#60;3 chas 1/27/14</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIIKE THIS ALOT!  IT REALLY DOES SMELL LIKE BE DELICIOUS AND ARRIVED AS THEY PROMISED. WOUILD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES A REFRESHING SMELL !</li>
    <li> Love love love it. ...smells very close to dkny be delicious. ..it&#x27;s fresh n clean n a lil fruity. Doesn&#x27;t very long but smells great</li>
    <li> disgusting!!!&lt;br /&gt;came floor of a bottle. the smell of stinky. box in a terrible condition. hard to find the words that would describe this stuff!</li>
    <li> Got this and did a little test. I opened my wifes DKNY that was almost out and i poured this in...... Needless to say even though she argued and begged for the 60$ dkny, i told her i bough her another bottle...... she never even noticed the difference. haha people need more mental fortitude. smell is all in your mind guys and this is spot on with the real deal. I will continue buying this until something even cheaper comes along.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to save money buying this instead of DKNY be delicious save your money! I thought even if the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long that&#x27;s alright as ling as the smell is similar,  it&#x27;s not similar at all I received mine smelt it and gave it to my little sister. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> this was my first try at the off brand of the DKNY Delicious , and this is the closest i have gotten to the real thing ! i love this scent , and my husband noticed it also , and he says i smell good !</li>
    <li> well, the seller tried to create the most confusing title for the product.&lt;br /&gt;If you search for DKNY APPLE, yowl get this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;So, description is poor. No connection to DKNY whats or ever, while price is the same.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery took a bit loller than other sellers (+2-3 days form other sellers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this kind of attitude to selling, there for I am not recommending this seller or product!</li>
    <li> IT HAS THE SCENT ALRIGHT BUT IT DOES NOT STAY ALL DAY.ANYWAY YOU CAN GIVE IT A TRY.BUT I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN</li>

    <li> Mostly smells like the original with a little more of a musk scent . I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> It is not quite DKNY but quite nice apple delight. For the price that I paid it is more than five stars. To me this is a lot more better than some of spray in department store and the most importantly it is not offensive at all.</li>
