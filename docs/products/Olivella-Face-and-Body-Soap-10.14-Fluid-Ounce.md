      <li>The smell is great, so even if there are no medicinal benefits, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>seller packaged it very nicely, with each bottle covered with a plastic bag, to prevent any leakage problems.</li>
      <li>I bought here instead of elsewhere because I thought I was getting a good deal.  </li>
      <li>I have heard good things about this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Effective on both face &amp; body.</li>
      <li>This soap seemed like it would have been really nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t know since mine arrived leaking all over the place.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is a nice liquid soap.</li>
      <li>Nice sift skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>With this face wash and the Olivella moisturizer his skin is muck better.</li>
      <li>but I am sure I will love it.  </li>
      <li>i love this product, it smells amazing not to strong and it makes your skin feel nice and clean.</li>
      <li>Regarding the smell, I think you either love it</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s on me for not being more observant.</li>
      <li>Have no idea what the classification of the scent is, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found a lot of companies put a lot of emphasis on all the exotic plant ingredients they use in their products.</li>
      <li>However with Olivella, the olive oil is at the top of the list of ingredients.</li>
      <li>I would like to order more but not going to take the chance.</li>
      <li>It is ok but does not add any significant moisture.  </li>
      <li>Easy dispense pump.</li>
      <li>Love this product line, it&#x27;s like my skin feels so naturally clean every time I use this soap (and the bath bar soap as well)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>It is a pleasant alternative to harsher Dial or Old Spice body wash.  </li>
      <li>Glad it was available at Amazon.com as the product came quickly, and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>The price is more than the over the counter products, but well worth the money.</li>
      <li>perfumed and smells like cheap cologne.    </li>
      <li>so you will need a light moisterizer,</li>
      <li>I enjoy trying products that offer raw/natural ingredients, over synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;I am still thinking on this product line, is it a hit or miss?</li>
      <li>so having something that&#x27;s effective for cleaning but also gentle matters.</li>
      <li>Olivella leaves my hands much softer, with a nice clean but not girly smell.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, rinses clean and nourishes your skin in an ingredient derived from a Biblical fruit.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it; it smells fresh and while it&#x27;s strong, I wouldn&#x27;t call it overpowering...</li>
      <li>I was looking for a clean soap for my face and decided to give this Olive Oil soap a try.</li>
      <li>Natural,  silky &amp; effective.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t run out too frequently and fits nicely in the shower and on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Sure there are other ingredients - it has to be so that you can use it as soap - but even after its listing at the top of the ingredients list, there are more derivatives of olive oil throughout the ingredients.</li>
      <li>smell is fresh, clean.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try after reading several articles reaching about the benefits of using oils as cleansers, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I have been very pleased with this soap.  </li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t sweet at all, which is all right.</li>
      <li>It does as promised, I love not only that my skin loves this product, but I also enjoy the clean scent.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly rinse off clean and my skin felt like it had hand cream on it.</li>
      <li>(I have combination skin), and this makes my face feel super clean, soft, and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap and order it frequently when the store is out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used it twice and both times was left with a kind of film on my skin.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>This soap has some olive oil in it which helps to smooth out roughness and make your face feel clean and soft.</li>
      <li>and they were right.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing product for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
      <li>you are getting real healthy doses of olive oil - a natural basic ingredient packed with a ton of \\&quot;phenomenal for the skin\\&quot; properties and used all the way back since the Ancient Romans.  </li>
      <li>I love how my hands aren&#x27;t red and itchy anymore.</li>
      <li>Olivella soap helps to make your skin feel better when washing with it regularly.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>I am not sure If I am impressed with it or not.&lt;br /&gt;My focus on purchasing the products, was the key ingredient;) being Olive Oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I  love this facial wash.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This olive soap probably works for most people, but for me it was a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>clean, soft, radiant, Mediterranean-inspired skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone has their own body chemistry, action and reaction are too totally different concepts within skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would also be interested in more olive oil products for my very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It is strongly (!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neither floral or purely herbal.</li>
      <li>It also smells fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>It it very watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thing that I have found it is extremely \\&quot; runny\\&quot; lack for of a better word.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have always used dove body wash and this is an equal, but without leaving a film, it leaves you feeling sqeeky clean</li>
      <li>It cleans perfectly well, but my hands were left feeling stretched and dry, later itchy with a film on them.</li>
      <li>This actually makes me feel better about Olivella products, knowing I couldn&#x27;t just go to the grocery store and slather some olive oil on my face and expect the same results.</li>
      <li>It was inside a ziplock which helped contain most of the mess, but it was still all over everything.</li>
      <li>The price is a bit high with shipping costs</li>
      <li>In sum, I recommend the entire Olivella line because it packs high concentrations of a historically and scientifically \\&quot;proven to nourish\\&quot; oil into a modern, usable &amp; accessible product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Gentle clean and soft scent with leaving your skin dry.</li>
      <li>have found that soaps made with Kaolin Clay as the main ingredient are far preferred.</li>
      <li>ordered from a different site due to a better price over there, and I just reordered some yesterday.</li>
      <li>This is the only face soap that makes my face consistently stay clear.  </li>
      <li>I was at first wary of trying this due to being fragranced, however, this is great</li>
      <li>My skin is combination complexion (oily/normal, mature perimenopausal).</li>
      <li>I am 71 and haven&#x27;t really shown my age until recently.  </li>
      <li>Non-drying, leaving a natural soft feeling to skin.  </li>
      <li>As far as comments about scent ...</li>
      <li>But when you look at the ingredients list, those exotic plant extracts are usually at the end of the list and totally overwhelmed with fillers.</li>
      <li>I use a non-fragranced castile olive oil soap for my body, Cetaphil for my face, and this for general hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have mature skin and definitely need some \\&quot;help\\&quot; at this point.  </li>
      <li>Helps with the occasional mature woman acne that crops up sometimes.</li>
      <li>share, that it was not a instant wow,</li>
      <li>It says in the description that it is a \\&quot;fresh, herbal green scent\\&quot;, but not so.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best of all cleansers.  Natural,  silky &amp; effective.  Non-drying, leaving a natural soft feeling to skin.  Effective on both face &amp; body.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product for sensitive and dry skin. Ever since I started using it, my legs don&#x27;t itch anymore in the winter or after shaving in the Summer.  It also smells fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a clean soap for my face and decided to give this Olive Oil soap a try. I have used it twice and both times was left with a kind of film on my skin. It didn&#x27;t exactly rinse off clean and my skin felt like it had hand cream on it. I even used a wash cloth to try and get the residue off. No luck. The scent isn&#x27;t sweet at all, which is all right. I didn&#x27;t expect it to have a strong scent. It just isn&#x27;t the soap for me. Also I read the side label and its ingredients. I did not see \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; in its list. So who knows what those chemicals are that I am putting on my face. This olive soap probably works for most people, but for me it was a great disappointment.</li>
    <li> Olivella Virgin Olive Oil Face and Body Liquid Soap is THE BEST liquid soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.  In the past I have almost exclusively used Liquid Softsoap or Dove.  I wash my hands probably at least 20+ times per day due to my job, and household chores, remodeling etc.  I live in a very dry area in Colorado.  Olivella leaves my hands much softer, with a nice clean but not girly smell.  My husband and son also like it (including the smell).  I now have bottles in the kitchen and both bathrooms.  Glad it was available at Amazon.com as the product came quickly, and well packaged.  The price is more than the over the counter products, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was at first wary of trying this due to being fragranced, however, this is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this lately as a hand soap--not a body or facial wash-- and I keep it in the kitchen. I always look forward to the wonderful burst of scent that I can best describe and \\&quot;perky, bright, and clean\\&quot;. It&#x27;s neither floral or purely herbal. Have no idea what the classification of the scent is, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love how my hands aren&#x27;t red and itchy anymore. I wash my hands A LOT, dozens of times a day, so having something that&#x27;s effective for cleaning but also gentle matters. I use a non-fragranced castile olive oil soap for my body, Cetaphil for my face, and this for general hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, since it&#x27;s in the kitchen, I have occasionally squirted it on a sponge and washed cups with it or stinky lunch tupperware my hubby brings home. Works great for that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from a different site due to a better price over there, and I just reordered some yesterday. This will be a staple in my house.</li>
    <li> When it was packaged it somehow opened and the soap was all over everything.  Plus, the smell is too pungent - I can&#x27;t get the smell out of my nasal passages! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with intent to use in the shower. Not for a hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I have found it is extremely \\&quot; runny\\&quot; lack for of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have substance to hold itself \\&quot; collided\\&quot; when in the palm of you hand.. It it very watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which does not make it bad, makes it unusual. Different. Not that it is lacking or is to be judged.&lt;br /&gt;It simply is on it&#x27;s own. I haven&#x27;t had it for very long. I feel it should be used at the sink, rather than the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh, clean. It does offer a bubble, but It is so *watery it feels almost neglectful for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;(*For Body)&lt;br /&gt;I did buy the bar soap from the same company. I am not sure If I am impressed with it or not.&lt;br /&gt;My focus on purchasing the products, was the key ingredient;) being Olive Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that soaps made with Kaolin Clay as the main ingredient are far preferred. Personally.&lt;br /&gt;Myself being a skin care tech for yrs. I enjoy trying products that offer raw/natural ingredients, over synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;I am still thinking on this product line, is it a hit or miss? or simply indifferent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body chemistry, use of this product, is my personal observation. My comments are NOT to be taken as advise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own body chemistry, action and reaction are too totally different concepts within skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I share, that it was not a instant wow, but without using it long term.. I cannot say otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have found that with Olivella products that it is difficult to find a clear list of ingredients. One reviewer said that this soap did not contain olive oil - and this is the case. This product contains POTASSIUM OLIVATE, which means it essentially contains fatty acids derived from olive oil. This actually makes me feel better about Olivella products, knowing I couldn&#x27;t just go to the grocery store and slather some olive oil on my face and expect the same results. Regarding the smell, I think you either love it or you hate it, based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read. I really enjoy it; it smells fresh and while it&#x27;s strong, I wouldn&#x27;t call it overpowering...I&#x27;m going to stick with this line, although one last thing - do NOT get this in your eyes. Ouch.</li>
    <li> Gentle clean and soft scent with leaving your skin dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product line, it&#x27;s like my skin feels so naturally clean every time I use this soap (and the bath bar soap as well) It does sting the eyes though so be careful. I use this soap on my face 2-3x daily, esp in the summer (I work outdoors every day). My skin is combination complexion (oily/normal, mature perimenopausal). Helps with the occasional mature woman acne that crops up sometimes. I&#x27;m a fan of Olivella!</li>
    <li> I love this soap and order it frequently when the store is out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the 10 oz. size becasue it doesn&#x27;t run out too frequently and fits nicely in the shower and on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and rinses thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for the four star rating this time is that I received it half full having leaked out all over the inside of the box and onto other items.  I always keep extra so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have mature skin and definitely need some \\&quot;help\\&quot; at this point.  I am 71 and haven&#x27;t really shown my age until recently.  The olive oil in this cleanser makes my skin look and feel wonderful.  Please always continue to carry this product.  I would also be interested in more olive oil products for my very dry skin.  Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I  love this facial wash. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. Someone had tipped me off to using an olive oil facial cleanser and they were right.</li>
    <li> Olivella soap helps to make your skin feel better when washing with it regularly. This soap has some olive oil in it which helps to smooth out roughness and make your face feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I have always used dove body wash and this is an equal, but without leaving a film, it leaves you feeling sqeeky clean</li>
    <li> My husband has such dry skin that his face peels even in the summer.  With this face wash and the Olivella moisturizer his skin is muck better.</li>
    <li> I was initially pleased to find an olive oil based soap for sale, but this was a profound disappointment. I tried it on my hands when it arrived. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is strongly (!) perfumed and smells like cheap cologne.    It cleans perfectly well, but my hands were left feeling stretched and dry, later itchy with a film on them. The itch subsided after I washed again with my usual soap. It is possible that I am sensitive to cheap cologne, but who would imagine an olive oil based soap would smell so horrible? It says in the description that it is a \\&quot;fresh, herbal green scent\\&quot;, but not so.    Be warned. If you don&#x27;t want to smell like that, don&#x27;t buy this soap. It&#x27;s not cheap in price, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Love..Love.. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after reading several articles reaching about the benefits of using oils as cleansers, and I am very glad I did.  Every cleanser I&#x27;ve tried prior have either made my skin feel oily or dried out (I have combination skin), and this makes my face feel super clean, soft, and smooth.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found a lot of companies put a lot of emphasis on all the exotic plant ingredients they use in their products. But when you look at the ingredients list, those exotic plant extracts are usually at the end of the list and totally overwhelmed with fillers. However with Olivella, the olive oil is at the top of the list of ingredients. Sure there are other ingredients - it has to be so that you can use it as soap - but even after its listing at the top of the ingredients list, there are more derivatives of olive oil throughout the ingredients. Meaning ... you are getting real healthy doses of olive oil - a natural basic ingredient packed with a ton of \\&quot;phenomenal for the skin\\&quot; properties and used all the way back since the Ancient Romans.  The end result ... clean, soft, radiant, Mediterranean-inspired skin. It goes on smooth, rinses clean and nourishes your skin in an ingredient derived from a Biblical fruit. As far as comments about scent ... it is has a light, relatively neutral scent no more powerful than any common soap. In sum, I recommend the entire Olivella line because it packs high concentrations of a historically and scientifically \\&quot;proven to nourish\\&quot; oil into a modern, usable &amp; accessible product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Disappointing after reading the many glowing reviews, I had high hopes.  It is ok but does not add any significant moisture.  I still need to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This soap seemed like it would have been really nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t know since mine arrived leaking all over the place. It was inside a ziplock which helped contain most of the mess, but it was still all over everything. I would like to order more but not going to take the chance.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It does as promised, I love not only that my skin loves this product, but I also enjoy the clean scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only face soap that makes my face consistently stay clear.  A bit drying so you will need a light moisterizer, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> The best product ever. Easy dispense pump. Great outcome when using it. Nice sift skin. Can use to wash face, body as well as use it for shaving. Not greasy and smells great. Not thick and heavy. Best product out there. Never shower without it!</li>
    <li> I would have preferred it to be either fragrance-free or at least not such a strong scent.  Otherwise, it is a nice liquid soap.</li>
    <li> i love this product, it smells amazing not to strong and it makes your skin feel nice and clean. yeaaaaaaaaaa!!!!</li>
    <li> olivella olive oil face soap&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the soap but I am sure I will love it.  I have heard good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Overall, I have been very pleased with this soap.  It is a pleasant alternative to harsher Dial or Old Spice body wash.  The price is a bit high with shipping costs but I see few alternative at local stores. Olive oil has known anti-inflammatory properties but it probably unlikely that small amounts would be absorbed transdermally. The smell is great, so even if there are no medicinal benefits, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.  I was disappointed at the size of the bottle for the price.  I bought here instead of elsewhere because I thought I was getting a good deal.  I guess that&#x27;s on me for not being more observant.</li>
    <li> I use this in the winter months, because I tend to have a problem with my skin splitting when I use other soaps. This soap greatly minimizes that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller packaged it very nicely, with each bottle covered with a plastic bag, to prevent any leakage problems.</li>
