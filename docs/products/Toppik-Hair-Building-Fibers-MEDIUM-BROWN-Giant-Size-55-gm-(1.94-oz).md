      <li>Very pleased with the results covers great and would recommend for anyone experiencing mild to moderate hair loss.</li>
      <li>Works great to go between the spray nozzle and back to the shaker top.</li>
      <li>Maybe a fine mist spray?</li>
      <li>Will not bring back a complete bald spot, but if you need some volume and don&#x27;t want to see your scalp through your hair, you have the perfect product.</li>
      <li>quality is not as good and a smaller amount in the container than before.</li>
      <li>I use a volumizing shampoo, Living Proof full thickening cream and after blow drying and styling I sprinkle Toppik where needed then hairspray</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>, I was lucky my sister shared it with</li>
      <li>This is by the far my favorite bathroom product and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
      <li>This is the best secret you will keep.  </li>
      <li>The medium brown color gives me a much more natural look.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t smear or stain anything if you touch your hair, which I would have expected.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more and will not leave the house with out my toppik on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>style your hair first...</li>
      <li>i feel confident with this product and by now is part of my daily life.</li>
      <li>Covers up the scalp and makes my hair look full and normal.  </li>
      <li>, I am satisfied and will keep using it as long as I have some hair on my head.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist over certain meds prescribed for hair loss.</li>
      <li>It really covers naturally and comes in many different colors.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works but it leaves the brown fiber (power) all over the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I really would like to see it cheaper though.</li>
      <li>Was not expecting much when I bought this product &amp;#34;was</li>
      <li>so Toppik hair fabric is important part of my daily hairdressing, unless I find another product I will forever use Toppik</li>
      <li>it really work, I should take picture of before and after..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely undetectable when looking in the mirror</li>
      <li>This container you shake it on your head, but I prefer the air nozzle one which is more direct where you can target specific areas.  </li>
      <li>One other thing, I wish there was better way of applying Toppik instead of the salt shaker method.  </li>
      <li>It does the job as long as you have some hair on your head in which Toppik can make it look full.  </li>
      <li>If you have thinning hair, do yourself a huge favor and buy this, I can&#x27;t imagine what mental state I&#x27;d be in without it!</li>
      <li>I want this fixed.</li>
      <li>Yet, nearly 40% cheaper than the toppik website.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s main job is to hide thin spots, it also makes my hair look a shade darker which I love.</li>
      <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product if you have thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>the previous reviewer who said he doesn&#x27;t know how much is left in container, I recommend put it up against the light bulb</li>
      <li>Since my hair has been thinning, I have been self conscious about it and was looking for something to help with the bare spots.  </li>
      <li>It really covers up the normally visible bald spots that show due to my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Same old reliable product.</li>
      <li>Other than the high price</li>

<li> messy it gets all over the place, it ruined my carpet in dressing room.</li>
<li> I usually put a towel over the sink when I apply, but it still gets on floor, etc.&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought the small spray rubber thing</li>
<li> Unfortunately this container does not open where you can pour the contents into the air nozzle one.  </li>
<li> Please note that although I have very dark brown hair; I use medium brown because dark brown turns extremely dark on my scalp (due to perspiration) and it appears very artificial.  </li>
<li> The bad thing is you don&#x27;t know when you are running low because of the dark bottle, and I don&#x27;t want to ever go without this product and once you try it you will agree.</li>
<li> My hair is too thin and not abundant</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> you have thin hair</li>
<li> Became ill after using.... headaches and vomiting.  </li>

<li> Made me sick and cannot return.</li>

    <li> This is the best secret you will keep.  Toppik is amazing.  Since my hair has been thinning, I have been self conscious about it and was looking for something to help with the bare spots.  Voila Toppik.  I use a volumizing shampoo, Living Proof full thickening cream and after blow drying and styling I sprinkle Toppik where needed then hairspray and I look like I have more hair.  The bad thing is you don&#x27;t know when you are running low because of the dark bottle, and I don&#x27;t want to ever go without this product and once you try it you will agree.</li>
    <li> i always use Toppik hair building fibers every day. i feel confident with this product and by now is part of my daily life. great product</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years to improve thinning hair</li>
    <li> Just a little &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; with the applicator and it is like magic.  Covers up the scalp and makes my hair look full and normal.  Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff does a wonerful job on my hair. My only problem is that it basically gets everywhere in bathroom.  I usually put a towel over the sink when I apply, but it still gets on floor, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the previous reviewer who said he doesn&#x27;t know how much is left in container, I recommend put it up against the light bulb and you can actually see.</li>
    <li> Please note that although I have very dark brown hair; I use medium brown because dark brown turns extremely dark on my scalp (due to perspiration) and it appears very artificial.  The medium brown color gives me a much more natural look.</li>
    <li> works great...  style your hair first... then sprinkle on little by little and gently pat top of hair till it looks good to you!</li>
    <li> at covering thinning areas of hair. I&#x27;ve never tried any other brand of hair building fibers but this one covers and blends well. Looks like your hair if you match the color properly. I have yet to find a way to keep it from spreading all over the sink and countertop in the bathroom though</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  The shaker top does come off. You will need one of those rubber jar openers and just twist the shaker portion to remove.  After that it just snaps on and off. Works great to go between the spray nozzle and back to the shaker top.</li>
    <li> I only buy this on Amazon. Greta price!</li>
    <li> Became ill after using.... headaches and vomiting.  Attempted to return but Amazon will not accept hazardous materials for return.  So a hazardous material is being sold to place on your head.  Contains Ammonium Chloride which can cause headaches, vomiting, even coma.  Made me sick and cannot return.</li>
    <li> messy it gets all over the place, it ruined my carpet in dressing room.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning so Toppik hair fabric is important part of my daily hairdressing, unless I find another product I will forever use Toppik it really work, I should take picture of before and after..I even convinced my sister to use it. She said she is also using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I bought the small spray rubber thing have not use it no instruction on how, so that one is waste can I return it? Or I&#x27;ll just throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Virginia</li>
    <li> This stuff really works but it leaves the brown fiber (power) all over the bathroom.  My wife hates if for that reason, but hey...my hair looks GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found. I probably won&#x27;t order it from Amazon again because delivery time for my orders from them just keeps getting longer.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job filling in thinning hair so it looks thicker and fuller so you don&#x27;t see your scalp.  Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t smear or stain anything if you touch your hair, which I would have expected.  This container you shake it on your head, but I prefer the air nozzle one which is more direct where you can target specific areas.  Unfortunately this container does not open where you can pour the contents into the air nozzle one.  I&#x27;m thinking to drill a hole in the top though.  Suggestion would be that the lid screw off.  Overall I would highly recommend this product if you have thinning hair.  No problems with it, absolutey love it.</li>
    <li> I use this product since 2 years ago and now I can not live without it.  My hair is too thin and not abundant so when I use it, is like having instant blower</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and now I just shake it on and look awesome I just wish I had found this years ago</li>

It&#x27;s absolutely undetectable when looking in the mirror I can&#x27;t even tell I have applied anything to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Toppik now for several years and I don&#x27;t leave the house without it.  It does the job as long as you have some hair on your head in which Toppik can make it look full.

    <li> This is by the far my favorite bathroom product and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without it. Although it&#x27;s main job is to hide thin spots, it also makes my hair look a shade darker which I love. I don&#x27;t have to dye my hair, I got Toppik.

    <li> This product give me the confidence to go out without wearing a hat.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a five years, I was lucky my sister shared it with me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no longer concerned should someone take my picture from a a facial picture to one from behind.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair this is the product to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. It has changed my life.</li>
