      <li>All in all great product.</li>
      <li>They were great -</li>
      <li>and everybody was happy with it.      </li>
      <li>Not at all happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
      <li>This mascara is great because it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
      <li>It looks great and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a racoon after wearing it all day.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this mascara!  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>I think this mascara is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>It also does a great job of lengthening and thickening my lashes, I wish I could show a pic of one eye with it and one without because it&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>like what happens to me with most mascaras because my eyelids are so oily).  </li>
      <li>I also skirt out the outer most lashes for a flirty outer lash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I doubt most of you do.  </li>
      <li>So: it&#x27;s back on the quest for the perfect mascara!  </li>
      <li>Also, I believe the best way to apply this mascara is to apply as many coats as you want without letting the mascara dry between coats.  </li>
      <li>Love the easy removal and non-smudge formula.</li>
      <li>It come of easily with water.</li>
      <li>It also comes off easily on my makeup removing towelettes.  </li>
      <li>I stays on well too and easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Fiberwig stays on my lashes all day and yet comes off easily when I wash my face at night.</li>
      <li>it gives me a great long wispy lash look that I love</li>
      <li>Therefore, you get a huge gooey blob on the end.  </li>
      <li>When i applied a layer of mascara to my lashes the clumps stick to my lashes and it wasn&#x27;t smooth at all.</li>
      <li>Not always consistent in formulation, but when the fibers are abundant in the right consistency, it works.</li>
      <li>By reading all the reviews i was so excited.</li>
      <li>First, I love Fiberwig mascara.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure almost any mascara would do that.  </li>
      <li>Over time it might do more harm than good and loose firmness.</li>
      <li>Now that my lashes are full length</li>
      <li>so I use the tip of the wand and the full length of the wand.</li>
      <li>yet it is so easy to remove with simple warm water.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super long-lasting so you won&#x27;t have panda eyes at the end of the day (</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara by far!  </li>
      <li>It could only be removed by applying warm water.   </li>
      <li>Forgot who its made by and that makes my lashes nice and long</li>
      <li>Exactly what they used to sell in sephora.</li>
      <li>When I first tried Fiberwig, I was delighted with how thick it made my lashes, without clumping, and how it stayed on without smudging - including on the lower lashes, which are always more likely to smear.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fast and easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to let it dry between coats.</li>
      <li>it arrive really fast and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;m not going to return it because as I recall from much experimentation with mascara over the years, that the brush shape doesn&#x27;t really matter - it&#x27;s all how you use it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this one--</li>
      <li>It really does make your lashes longer.  </li>
      <li>cuz I don&#x27;t have much.  </li>
      <li>i really works, makes my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with FiberWig, and I will be a buyer for life if the prices stay reasonable.</li>
      <li>Its the real deal.</li>
      <li>one\\&quot; because when I searched a whole bunch of Fiberwigs came up at varying prices and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference because of the product descriptions lack sufficient detail.  </li>
      <li>Especially if you&#x27;re looking for dramatic lashes, this product is the greatest!</li>
      <li>Another thing I like about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run even when my eyes water (they do this quite often throughout the day for no reason in particular)</li>
      <li>I used the fiberwig and it had super results, so even if you have short, sparse to normal lashes</li>
      <li>So, here&#x27;s a little more detail on this particular</li>
      <li>The fibers in this mascara really attaches to your natural lashes to make them look longer and fuller.   </li>
      <li>You can go to sleep without taking it off, and still wake up looking normal.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, flake or smudge and it applies easily just like regular mascara, even when you use multiple coats.</li>
      <li>pretty short, almost invisible lashes and a friend gave me this Fiberwig 3D</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t even buy up the old ones, since there weren&#x27;t any to be had.         </li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals or rubbing off your eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I like a regular straight or cone shaped brush</li>
      <li>This really helped me to feel like I had more length to my stubby lashes after chemo without leaving little chunks of fiber in my eyes like other brands have.  </li>
      <li>I have also waited longer to dry my mascara first, but not noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>first thing I noticed is the package is mostly in Japanese (this is a Japanise product) which isn&#x27;t a big deal since I don&#x27;t read the packages</li>
      <li>The results from the first coat look like those from 1-2 coats of regular mascara, but as you keep putting it on it just keeps getting more dramatic.</li>
      <li>It arrived within the time frame promised and is exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>It does feel slightly different from regular mascara, probably because of the extra weight, but it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
      <li>You just have to be careful not to put too much on, because then it gets clumpy.  </li>
      <li>Makes my lashes look longer, fuller and more dramatic.  </li>
      <li>This product does give me more dramatic lashes without flaking or giving me raccoon eyes.</li>
      <li>Really disappointing for a mascara that cost $25 or more!</li>
      <li>what was advertised - it does not make eyelashes look much longer at all, and I agree with another reviewer that it&#x27;s a bit of a gooey mess.</li>
      <li>This mascara is the extra long version (not the original, which is what I thought I was buying because of the picture and confusing title).  </li>
      <li>Tried the new 3D, to me it is just like the other fiber wig, just more expensive.  </li>

<li> It really separates my eyelashes and makes them look like false eyelashes.   </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had very little issues with this clumping, so honestly it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>

<li> I didn&#x27;t need to pull and wipe my eyes too hard as with the regular mascara.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not waterproof.  </li>
<li> Not worth it at all.</li>
<li> This mascara is messy, gooey and does not appear to make my eyelashes any longer than any other brand.  </li>
<li> The one i have been always using was Telescope, a black skinny mascara.</li>
<li> I had to apply like 4-5 coats before i see a little color on my lashes.</li>
<li> It does give a little volume.  </li>
<li> The brush head is slightly curved and is thin in the middle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this mascara is pretty awesome. I have very short thin lashes and I am always looking for products to pump them up. This product does give me more dramatic lashes without flaking or giving me raccoon eyes. This is the first time that I ordered the 3d lash product - I am not i love with the curved brush, but would definitely purchase the brand again.</li>
    <li> The fibers in this mascara really attaches to your natural lashes to make them look longer and fuller.   You just have to be careful not to put too much on, because then it gets clumpy.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not waterproof.  As soon as water hits your lashes, you have all the fibers all over your face.  But all-in-all it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The mascara itself is great!  It really separates my eyelashes and makes them look like false eyelashes.   It doesn&#x27;t clump up or irritate your eyes even for contact lens wearers.  Plus, it&#x27;s super long-lasting so you won&#x27;t have panda eyes at the end of the day (like what happens to me with most mascaras because my eyelids are so oily).  Another thing I like about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run even when my eyes water (they do this quite often throughout the day for no reason in particular) yet it is so easy to remove with simple warm water.  No harsh chemicals or rubbing off your eyelashes.  The only time it flakes is if you rub your eye but I&#x27;m pretty sure almost any mascara would do that.  Also, the look it gives is very natural long eyelashes and not harsh or heavy so you can wear it any day any time.  I would definitely buy this mascara again.  There&#x27;s other things you should note about the mascara.  This mascara is the extra long version (not the original, which is what I thought I was buying because of the picture and confusing title).  The brush head is slightly curved and is thin in the middle.  Also, I believe the best way to apply this mascara is to apply as many coats as you want without letting the mascara dry between coats.  Once the mascara dries, it tends to clump up when you apply coats afterward.</li>
    <li> Especially if you&#x27;re looking for dramatic lashes, this product is the greatest! It doesn&#x27;t clump, flake or smudge and it applies easily just like regular mascara, even when you use multiple coats. The results from the first coat look like those from 1-2 coats of regular mascara, but as you keep putting it on it just keeps getting more dramatic. It&#x27;s very fast and easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to let it dry between coats. It does feel slightly different from regular mascara, probably because of the extra weight, but it&#x27;s not irritating. I am also a contact wearer, and I have had no problem with this product. I have used fake lashes before, but hated them because of the time it takes, the glue and the fact that some of them would come off, making them look uneven. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with FiberWig, and I will be a buyer for life if the prices stay reasonable.</li>
    <li> Not always consistent in formulation, but when the fibers are abundant in the right consistency, it works.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and bought it at a great price through Amazon.com.  This mascara will not end up under your eyes by the end of the day.  It stays on your eyelashes.  I have used many mascaras and this is one of the best!  It looks great and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a racoon after wearing it all day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know the packaging was Chinese or Japanese?  I read in a magazine a review of this mascara and wanted to try it, was a little disappointed the fluidity is very thin and not as thick with fibers as I had expected.</li>
    <li> When I first tried Fiberwig, I was delighted with how thick it made my lashes, without clumping, and how it stayed on without smudging - including on the lower lashes, which are always more likely to smear.  It could only be removed by applying warm water.   I told my friends about it and everybody was happy with it.      But when I re-ordered recently (September 2010), it was totally different: it didn&#x27;t do more than any other brand, and smeared just as badly.  I contacted the vendor and was told that the manufacturers had changed the formula.  Couldn&#x27;t even buy up the old ones, since there weren&#x27;t any to be had.         So: it&#x27;s back on the quest for the perfect mascara!  ;-(</li>
    <li> First, I love Fiberwig mascara.  I regularly buy it from Amazon.com - so convenient!  Recently I purchased this one.  I say \\&quot;this one\\&quot; because when I searched a whole bunch of Fiberwigs came up at varying prices and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference because of the product descriptions lack sufficient detail.  So, here&#x27;s a little more detail on this particular version.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the package is mostly in Japanese (this is a Japanise product) which isn&#x27;t a big deal since I don&#x27;t read the packages and I doubt most of you do.  Just gimme my mascara!  The next thing I noticed is the shape of the brush - it&#x27;s fat skinny fat.  I took pictures and am going to add them to this item.  I like a regular straight or cone shaped brush, so I was a little disappointed.  But, I&#x27;m not going to return it because as I recall from much experimentation with mascara over the years, that the brush shape doesn&#x27;t really matter - it&#x27;s all how you use it.  After comparing this mascara to the one I already have, I noticed that this one is Fiberwig Extra Long.  The ones I usually purchase are Fiberwig...regular, I guess.  So the product title should say this!  Finally, the vendor who shipped this product was Imoko.  They were great - it arrive really fast and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras--in fact, I&#x27;ve never bought the same one twice.  I have pretty short, almost invisible lashes and a friend gave me this Fiberwig 3D cuz she didn&#x27;t like it.  It has done wonders for me!  It does clump but who cares--all mascaras do.  Just lash comb that ish and move on.  I really like this one--I can do upper and lower lashes without them sticking to each other when I blink.  It definitely lengthens on me cuz I don&#x27;t have much.  It also comes off easily on my makeup removing towelettes.  I will definitely buy one of these once I&#x27;m done with this freebie.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when Sephora discontinued this line.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a mascara that does not turn me into a panda!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara by far!  Makes my lashes look longer, fuller and more dramatic.  I make sure I don&#x27;t run out!  I don&#x27;t find it to be clumpy or leave big gobs of mascara at all.</li>
    <li> Have been using this mascara for years. Love the easy removal and non-smudge formula. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Sephora no longer carries it, but was pleased to find it here. Please note that shipping takes a while.</li>
    <li> This really helped me to feel like I had more length to my stubby lashes after chemo without leaving little chunks of fiber in my eyes like other brands have.  Now that my lashes are full length it gives me a great long wispy lash look that I love</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! i really works, makes my lashes longer and fuller. I stays on well too and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Its the real deal. Exactly what they used to sell in sephora.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE THE SAME FORMULATION AS IT USED TO BE. Wont bother buying again....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  It really does make your lashes longer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and will be very disappointed if it is ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> I just received my fiberwig Mascara and it&#x27;s not what i expected. By reading all the reviews i was so excited. It doesn&#x27;t do any difference. The one i have been always using was Telescope, a black skinny mascara. Forgot who its made by and that makes my lashes nice and long and it&#x27;s only $9.99 this one i paid almost $25.00. Not worth it at all. Def not happy at all.</li>
    <li> This mascara is messy, gooey and does not appear to make my eyelashes any longer than any other brand.  When you pull the brush out of the container, it is not snug enough to remove the excess mascara from the brush.  Therefore, you get a huge gooey blob on the end.  Way to expensive for the results you get.  I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Tried the new 3D, to me it is just like the other fiber wig, just more expensive.  I would not spend the extra money again</li>
    <li> No idea if the mascara i bought has expired or what but when i draw the wand out of the applicator, it was all clumpy and sticky. When i applied a layer of mascara to my lashes the clumps stick to my lashes and it wasn&#x27;t smooth at all. I had to apply like 4-5 coats before i see a little color on my lashes. Do not recommend this at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very little issues with this clumping, so honestly it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal. This stuff is great and goes on nice</li>
    <li> The product performed as promised. The only thing I would say that is not in favor of it is that is does tend to clump. Otherwise, I like the way my lashes look, and my expectations were met.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years now. Sephora used to carries them, but they discontinued it. I was happy to find them on Amazon. Since it&#x27;s a fiberwig that means when I wash my mascara off I didn&#x27;t need to pull and wipe my eyes too hard as with the regular mascara. It come of easily with water. I think pulling and wiping one&#x27;s eye make up off everyday can be very hard on the eye area. Over time it might do more harm than good and loose firmness.</li>
    <li> I use Lilash eyelash growth enhancher about 2x per week and so have really long lashes. I use the fiberwig over my mascara for out of this world lashes. Even when I didn&#x27;t use the Lilash I used the fiberwig and it had super results, so even if you have short, sparse to normal lashes you will like this product. I curl my lashes then put on my normal mascara, usually within 1 min I put the Fiberwig just on the tips, turning the brush so I use the tip of the wand and the full length of the wand. I have also waited longer to dry my mascara first, but not noticed a difference. I also skirt out the outer most lashes for a flirty outer lash. All in all great product. I get compliments all the time on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely fashion, Does not lengthen like it says.  It does give a little volume.  I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It arrived within the time frame promised and is exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> I have tried A LOT of mascaras and am rather obsessed with it, but I did not find this mascara to be at all what was advertised - it does not make eyelashes look much longer at all, and I agree with another reviewer that it&#x27;s a bit of a gooey mess. Really disappointing for a mascara that cost $25 or more! I find that other common brands found in any drugstore are MUCH better for way less money! Not at all happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great because it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  You can go to sleep without taking it off, and still wake up looking normal.</li>
    <li> I will not be without this mascara! I HATE raccoon eyes and I just cannot wear regular mascara. Fiberwig stays on my lashes all day and yet comes off easily when I wash my face at night. It also does a great job of lengthening and thickening my lashes, I wish I could show a pic of one eye with it and one without because it&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
