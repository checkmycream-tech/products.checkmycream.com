    <li> Have used it a long time for complete uppers and lowers. Can eat anything. Lasts all day, sometimes more.</li>
    <li> It was February 28, 2013, when Dental Village removed all my top teeth and fit me with an upper denture and bottom partial. I was sent home with among other things a small tube of Fixodent. I followed the directions on the tube but my denture fell right out. I wish I could remember what I did between that failure and having success with Super Poligrip but at least the stuff works. I was not thrilled at the length of time it took me to remove the residue from the roof of my mouth when removing my upper, but at least the partial did not have the same problem. It would take a specialist to maybe explain it to me, but my upper never stayed firmly affixed to the roof of my mouth. I did try the comfort strips which are a lot easier to remove, but I still use the cream on my partial. I gave the product three stars because even the partial does not stay where I want it all day and food gets under it which can be painful at times. Still, I am not apt to try anything else.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a year and a half.  It holds extremely well, and keeps the gums from getting irritated.  Much better than the regular strength and somehow soothing.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product...fast shipping.!</li>
    <li> the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; in pink packaging performs better in terms of how long it &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> Great product - very good price.</li>
    <li> Keeps the particles out better than the regular, but doesn&#x27;t hold as long. It&#x27;s a balance. Holds long enough though. I&#x27;d rather keep those pesky particles out.</li>
    <li> Does the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t the big tube,as i wanted...won&#x27;t do that again.i thought i was getting the regular tubes, as in the stores.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> .........whole town I live in ran out of this type of poligrip.......like it so much I went to the internet &amp; found it on amazon.com.....what could be easier............thanks</li>
    <li> Delivers as promised and feels secure. I have used this product for two years and have never been disappointed. I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The very best for me. Have been having trouble finding it lately for some unknown reason. So glad that you had it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the polygrip with gold &amp; white cover.  Cannot find it anywhere in our area and I believe it was taken off the shelves and now want to know if it is being sold again in our local stores.  Ordered the 3 but felt this was very expensive-we only paid $5.98 or less for one 2.2 in our area and -I think I paid almost $40.00 for the pkg. of 3 - someone please help so it can be sold at a reasonable amt.</li>
    <li> Works very good, I do not know why it is being pulled from the shelf of most stores.</li>
