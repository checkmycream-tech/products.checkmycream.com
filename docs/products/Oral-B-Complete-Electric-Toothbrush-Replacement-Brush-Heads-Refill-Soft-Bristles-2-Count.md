<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the new brush head for my toothbrush. I snapped the new one on and it was as if I had a brand new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought the Power Toothbrush and realized it didn&#x27;t come with the soft bristles, so I also ordered these. Great coupon, I hope these with still have coupons when it comes time to get some more.</li>
    <li> bought the tooth brushes so figured get the replacement heads now. Very happy with overall experience will buy again on line for sure</li>
    <li> I got these for a great &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; price with my order.  I like the Oral-B Brush but had not found the replacement heads in a local store.  Great to have Amazon.</li>
    <li> quite a while and like it very much.  This is the second&lt;br /&gt;Time I have purchased new heads for my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These are fine and very soft.  I do wish that they looked like the original heads (blue and orangeish).  They&#x27;re very nice though.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product multiple times before and it never fails me.  It is just like the ones in stores. works well</li>
    <li> The quality of toothbursh is good, but it will be more applaused if the price is cheaper . The&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B CrossAction Power Soft Replacement Brush Head is perfect.</li>
    <li> excellent new came quickly!!!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding these replacement brush heads in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I found them on Amazon and for less money than in most stores. It comes with the 2 replacement heads and the tool needed to change them out.  The package that was sent was noted as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles although I usually get them as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; but works fine for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans your mouth and teeth very well. Good price too. I change out the head every quarter after I visit my dentist for a professional cleaning. I save the used heads and use them for cleaning my guns.</li>
    <li> The cross action rechargeable toothbrush was the cheapest they sell at Walmart, so I bought one. I wish I could justify $60 for a better one but this one is adequate, does the job. The replacement heads last a good long while, perhaps 3-4 months, and are not difficult to change (although it does require a special tool-supplied). No complaints for the money.</li>
    <li> I received the Oral B toothbrush from my mother, but she didn&#x27;t include any brush head refills.  I was thinking I had to throw the toothbrush away once the brush head frayed, and then I searched online for refills.  I&#x27;m very happy to have found them on Amazon, and at such a good price.  They are exactly what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of getting used to after having another type of electric toothbrush, but the overall effect is easily achieved.  Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this product.  Couldn&#x27;t find these at Walmart any more, so I went on line to get them.  About a week after ordering online, my daughter found them cheaper in our Shop Rite grocery store - who would have guessed - Oh well!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe he sells these so cheap! Trust me, you won&#x27;t believe the value. This is a really nice!</li>
    <li> As a replacement for a cheap but good toothbrush, we think it&#x27;s great. There&#x27;s a lot more expensive toothbrushes out there, but we were able to get a charging one for under $20 that works just as well as those expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to see they have replacements so we never have to upgrade!</li>
    <li> Love these replacement heads. Good quality and they make my teeth feel dental hygienist clean. Just wish they straightened my teeth, too.</li>
    <li> so im used to going to the store getting 2 heads for 10.00$ total rip off, but when i saw it on here it was much cheaper. thanks so much</li>
    <li> I believe (and my Dentist agrees) that this particular brush head does a fantastic job of taking care of my teeth and gums.  Buying on Amazon is a painless and economical way to make sure you have spares on hand.</li>
    <li> With this brushes it is more efficient to clean the teeth, that&#x27;s it. And you are able to reduce the dentist bill!</li>
    <li> I love my electric brush, and being able to replace the heads regularly is wonderful. This product is exactly what I needed, and it was shipped pronto. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find replacement heads for this toothbrush any more, but These were economical and work very well</li>
    <li> The product is as described. It comes with a tool that you can easily replace the old one. So you won&#x27;t need any thing sharp to do it.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not clear from the written description, this item is in fact a 2-pack of replacement heads for Braun Cross Action toothbrushes.  What you get in the package resembles the product photo.  It&#x27;s a great value, and the tool that&#x27;s included makes the job easy.</li>
    <li> i love our oral-b battery op toothbrushes - but often had a hard time finding replacement heads in the stores.  via amazon.com, i found a resource for them that ALSO sends them to me every 3 months like clockwork - at the exact time i should be replacing them anyway - it&#x27;s a win-win!!  AND, the price is lower than retail AND i get free shipping!  pinch me ... seriously, i&#x27;m just smiling brightly over the whole thing!</li>
    <li> me and my wife both have the cross action brush and this comes with two so it really worked out great for us. and it is much cheaper than buying two new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MC</li>
    <li> Received it in a day. The added piece that makes it so easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Just as expected.</li>
    <li> Gracias por el producto. En Colombia ya no se consigue.  Ya iba a botar las bases de los cepillos. Increible que en Bogot&amp;aacute; Oral B no tenga estos repuestos.</li>
    <li> The original brush was so inexpensive I thought it would be a throw away item but these replacement heads saved the day - great brush head and inexpensive too.  I like the softer bristles and this worked great.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy. I couldn&#x27;t find the brush heads in the stores any more. I am happy to get them from Amazon so we can continue using our cross action tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Fits the toothbrush easily. A bit pricey though, compared to the cost of a new toothbrush. I&#x27;ve never used expensive electronic toothbrushes though, so can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the toothbrush compared to those.</li>
    <li> I got these to go with my Oral-B Rechargeable Toothbrush. The brush that comes with the toothbrush is a garish orange and blue. Is that Bronco colors? I still don&#x27;t care for it, so I will use the original and then switch to these brush heads, which are a lot prettier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, what can I say? You have to replace the brush heads periodically, and these are them!!</li>
    <li> The price on these brush heads was cheaper than the Walmart.  They arrived on schedule and fit well in the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good price and delivery. Secret here is to use a new head every 3-6 months. I love the brush power unit and have used these for years. Much better price than drug stores. Wish they were available in &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;. Soft is very soft .</li>
    <li> If you think buying replacement brushes is cheap....go to your local stores or discount centers and you will find out how very expensive they are to purchase! The brush comes with some extra brushes and is cheap, but they really stick it to you when you need to buy replacements for the brush.  I learned years ago to buy them on E-Bay or this site and NEVER to purchase them in any local store - unless, of course, you don&#x27;t care about money! They are perfect and work just like they are supposed to!</li>
    <li> Have been using these for several years and my dentist  says it really helps, and that is great in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These blades are great, attached them to my Remington 850 and they were ready to cut., providing a much cleaner and faster shave than the Narellco that A purchased about 5 months ago to replace my Remington.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this item as it is an older model, getting this save me money and it was packaged very well and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I have gum disease and I have been using this type of toothbrush for a while, together with woven dental floss and a waterpik. It does seem to do a good job cleaning the teeth. The replacement heads are pricey, that&#x27;s why I try to find them on sale or use coupons. I am sure there are better options out there for a toothbrush, but this one worked OK for me, therefore I am planning to keep using it.</li>
    <li> It does the job, refills work great. Nice brush, the holder is a bit loud, but it does a great job cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> When buying appliances finding replacement parts, i.e. the heads for a powered tooth brush can often be problematic after a few months.  It was a pleasure to be able to find these and have them be reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Accurate as the description, Shipped in time.&lt;br /&gt;Every day use this toothbrush, I looked for parts did not I find a piece, and looked at Amazon and found the same specifications and price.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> These refills cost less than a good manual toothbrush. My wife and I have 4 of the toothbrushes and have no problem with fit or operation of the refills and the toothbrushes are great. I can&#x27;t imagine paying $50-100 for a toothbrush, and this is the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen on refills for any electric toothbrush. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> These a the most effective brush heads I have found in the market, sufficiently soft to not hurt gums.&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism for re-attaching the brush head is robust and the brush doesn&#x27;t get stuck by debris.</li>
    <li> I was told to get a power brush by a dentist for advanced gum problems, but i was put off by the price of most of them.&lt;br /&gt;These are replacement heads for a CROSS ACTION POWER rechargeable brush.  it does a really good job, much better than the old kind, not QUITE as good as the ones taking over...  but on the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t cost you 150 USD for a toothbrush, and these replacement heads are a lot cheaper each as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have a hard time finding the brush still, it&#x27;s been discontinued, but if you can find one, get it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the oral-B Cross Action power for several years now.  I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was and how well it holds a charge.  I am so happy that I can just purchase replacement heads for my wonderful toothbrush.  It cleans so much better than a manual toothbrush.  My teeth just feel better after using this toothbrush.  I love that one replacement pack lasts 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I will continue to buy in the future. Lots of products out there, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oral-B tooth brush that uses these brushes for years.  Replacements like this are hard to find but Amazon, as always, comes through.</li>
    <li> I gave them a 5 star because I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local Targets and ordered from Amazon. I like the toothbrush and since I started using the toothbrush, my dental cleanings have been super, hence I needed the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These are not what they claim to be. They do not fit on the toothbrush head they say that they will. These were a complete waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> If you have an Oral-B toothbrush, you have to get these replacements. Great quality, long lasting, and easy to use, except when the hardened toothpaste from the 10 second brush you do at night (yeah that&#x27;s getting rid of the plaque REALLY well…) builds up in the little hole you have to put the tool into to release the brush head. Good luck with that. My wife thought I was trying to push out an air biscuit with her in the room when she realized I was just trying to get the toothbrush head out. Not a flaw in the replacement heads, but really a flaw with the brush. I wish replacing the heads were easier…as well as concealing a honker.</li>
    <li> Had to order more for the great price.  Will definitely order more.  Works well with my slime line toothbrush base.</li>
    <li> Sorry, Sonicare, but you lost me at &amp;#34;replacement head&amp;#34;.  I am getting so sick of having to buy your expensive replacement heads year after year!  So sick of it, in fact, that I went out and bought this cheap Oral-B electric toothbrush, and it does a very adequate job.  No, its not quite as good as you (who could be?), but for the money, we&#x27;re extremely happy together.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to only having to purchase these VERY inexpensive brush heads from now on!  And the brush heads last several months, so its not like I have to replace them more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare, you are way too &amp;#34;high maintenance&amp;#34; for me!  We are through!  You hear me???  We&#x27;re THROUGH!!!</li>
    <li> Fits the brush handle and works as well as buying a new unit, for less cost.  However, the price has increased and now I see new brushes for sale cheaper!  Such a waste...</li>
    <li> The replacement head fit perfectly. The instructions on the back of the package were legible and simple to follow. The tool provided to remove the old spin head was easy to use too. It only took a minute or so and my toothbrush was just like new. It works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Good item to get for use with an Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was perfect. The tool that came with the kit removed my last head easily. Man, was it gross in there. I was able to clean my brush thy roughly and then install a new head. So much cheaper than buying a new brush.</li>
    <li> Have used these type of brush heads for a few years now and they are very effective in maintaining good dental health.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t freaking find these at my supermarket so if you&#x27;re looking for replacements for an Oral-B CrossAction electric toothbrush this is it.</li>
    <li> This product is strong and powerful, last long time, and easy to use. Recharge is easy and with indicator for very conveinince.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these stupid replacement heads in any local stores or pharmacy&#x27;s. Good old Amazon came through again.  I honestly believe electric toothbrush companies stop stocking stores with replacement heads a few months after they come out with a new model. They want you to buy the new more expensive  model because you can&#x27;t find replacement heads for the older model. I&#x27;m not too paranoid, am I?</li>
    <li> These work great and is just what I needed. Comes with tool to replace the heads. Price was cheap too.</li>
    <li> I just find it on Amazon. It is good and not expensive. I will buy it next time as well.</li>
    <li> Dependable and efficient.  It is ridiculous that I have to use 17 more words. Ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous. I am finished</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s original, it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Tried these without telling my husband and he noticed the quality was better than previous brushes purchased in local stores.</li>
    <li> The EXACT size of my toothbrush brand and the electric toothbrush does a much better cleaning of my teeth. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised. Will buy another set when these wear out. I buy everything form Amazon. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great replacement heads for my Oral B toothbrush and my wife&#x27;s Oral B Toothbrush.  We are pleased with its performance and the easy to replace the heads on the toothbrushes.  The price was a little more expensive than buying it in the store and I prefer the harder brush rather than this one (soft brushes).  But overall great product that came in original packing and quick shipment.  Would buy again from this retailer. Hopefully in the future they have a 2 for 1 deal or something.</li>
    <li> The good: The action and size of the brushes are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;The bad: SO loud that it sounds like someone is power sanding something. And I have a hard time getting them to charge, every time. I bought two brushes and i have to slam them on the counter on their ends to get them to start and it doesn&#x27;t always work the first time even with doing that..&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and they do a great job, maybe I just got two lemons. I can deal with the noise, if they would only charge like they are supposed to-</li>
    <li> Great replacement to the old brush.  Easy to put it on and tried.  No problem.  Everything works fine.  Will buy again next time.</li>
    <li> Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count is a great product at a reasonable price. Love the toothbrush it is for also.</li>
    <li> Exact same product found at the chain drugstores except for a little more than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I could not find the actual tooth brush as well on Amazon (so I could replace it as well).&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, it also has the little gadget used to replace the brush head.</li>
    <li> Got these replacement brush heads for my Oral B electric toothbrush.  Great value and excellent quality.  Wish I have bought two more.</li>
    <li> thanks to the add on option, the price of the replacement heads are just right. Overall these make a perfect system with the cross action brush, making no need for more expensive brushes</li>
    <li> Great this was a wonderful experience. Love my brush</li>
    <li> Be true to your teeth or they&#x27;ll be false to you.  Perfectly satisfied with the transaction!&lt;br /&gt;Ya still gotta floss!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these Cross Action replacement brushes for many years - these were much more economical than the brushes I had been buying at various chain drug stores.</li>
    <li> Really great price, easy to put on (as long as you follow the directions, which I didn&#x27;t do at first) and long lasting.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested a battery-operated toothbrush.  This one was inexpensive and does a great job of scrubbing teeth.  When it&#x27;s time to replace the Brush Head, the old one pops off easily and the new one goes on.  A new toothbrush ready to go!</li>
    <li> It does the job of cleaning your teeth very well. I recommend this product. This refill was the right fit and the price was good.</li>
    <li> These work with the CrossAction toothbrush, not most of the other Oral-B brushes. Make sure your toothbrush says &amp;#34;CrossAction&amp;#34; on it somewhere and look at the picture: this is just the little head part, not the head and neck like some of the other Oral-B brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, to make it easier they should name them Oral-B, Oral-C, Oral-D, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these fit and operated properly in my CrossAction. The package says they&#x27;re &#x27;soft&#x27; but they seem pretty normal to me. The head spins very fast and anything harder would probably just wear away your tooth enamel and set your face on fire ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a great add-on item, especially to get you over the &#x27;free ship&#x27; line with Amazon. Sometimes in our area (Metro Detroit) we can go months without seeing replacement heads at any of the stores--so long that I got a few cheapie battery powered toothbrushes to tide me over until I found replacements. It was very nice to discover these--now I can go back to using my CrossAction.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of the replacement heads. Change the head and change the battery and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t find these at stores in my area.  Have the battery powered toothbrush and need the replacement heads, and I don&#x27;t want to run around looking for them and usually end up finding out the stores don&#x27;t have them.  Instead, just get them from Amazon and they get delivered on time.  Save money, time and the environment because the delivery is better than jumping in your car and searching from store to store.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed.  Have a battery powered Oral-B toothbrush with replaceable brushes but couldn&#x27;t find the brushes anywhere.  Amazon to the rescue. 2 replacement heads are in the package and easy instructions to replace.  Presto, a brand new toothbrush. Don&#x27;t have to waste throwing away an otherwise perfectly good toothbrush for the lack of a new head.  I will continue to buy these replacement heads until I can no longer find them.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush before so it&#x27;s not anything new. I m really satisfied that the product came so quickly. I didn&#x27;t even expect it since it came in just a day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding these in stores lately. Happy to find them here, and reasonably priced. These toothbrushes are great. We&#x27;ve been using them for over 5 years. They&#x27;re still going strong, and the replacement heads last a few months each. Cheaper than throw-away toothbrushes in the end.</li>
    <li> Price is just reasonable for this product. Whenever I need the replacement head for this brush, I will buy it from this amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Installation is sometimes a slight pain, because of the dried toothpaste inside of the toothbrush that impedes pulling out the old worn out brush. I usually have to get a stiff wire inside, to loosen the toothpaste out and once had to use a plier to pull the head out. It is what it is, I&#x27;d rather put up with the hassle than buy a more expensive unit or use an old fashion toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need. Fast ship!</li>
    <li> They did not foot my brush.  It makes you wonder why they have so many varieties of basically the same brush</li>
    <li> Love these! I had bought the whitening version, but bristles were too hard, The softer version works better (for me) and my dentist recommends soft bristles anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought a few and would buy more if I could find them.  works with a single battery operated unit that is cheap and good</li>
    <li> Oral-b has probably changed the design of the top bristles in round, and I feel they&#x27;re more effective now. I guess earlier that round bristles were bit harder and little tapered.</li>
    <li> This is hard to  find in the stores these days.  Was very happy to find here and hope it stays available awhile yet.</li>
    <li> I only use compact soft or medium toothbrushes. Oral-B is one of the top brands and they make a really good toothbrush that lasts. And, they offer the compact size that I love.</li>
    <li> easy to use, perfect replace ment head for great little easy to use tooth brush.  Too expensive, but overall worth it.</li>
    <li> This is what could save you from those pricey dentist visits. Soft bristles work fine on the enamel but still remove stain. I bought a whole batch and paid import duties, and it&#x27;s still cheaper than retail in Canada.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE HARD TO REPLACE, BUT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW, IT&#x27;S EASY AND EACH BRUSH LAST AT LEASE A MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;I CHANGE THEM MORE OFTEN AND ALTERNATE FOR THREE MONTHS.  IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE.</li>
    <li> cheap enough good and they were exactly what i need will buy more of them if the price remains the same.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and works perfect. Didint have any problem using it or trying to make it work. Well done!</li>
    <li> Very good product.All other brush comes very costly but it has all quality which you could find in other high costly tooth brush. overall worth for money and outstanding.</li>
    <li> My almost 6-year old son uses Oral-B Action Power toothbrush.  Recently he had his first dental check up and he was commended on his dental hygene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he needed a replacement brush head, I found this product.  The fit is perfect, and the removal of the old brush head was easy with the included tool.  After removing the old brush head, I cleaned the toothbrush and the stand with Lime-Away, and then installed the new brush head.  The toothbrush looks brand new.</li>
    <li> Nice cheap replacements when you can find a coupon for it.</li>
    <li> There was no warning that the new brush head would not work on our current Oral-B holders.  Had to scout around to find holders that worked.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these. Got 5 packs (each pack contains 2 brush heads). All of them were soft, but doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me or my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Amazon says there might be a problem with this listing, but they work fine in my crossaction toothbrush. They say &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; instead of cross action or dual action, so they might not be the latest models, but they fit, they are Oral B and not generic, they came with the little tool to pop off the old head, and they were only 5 bucks.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly the thing I needed for my brush. This is hard to find in stores. The price was cheap (as long as you combined with another shipment).</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and great value</li>
    <li> Works as described.  With the dual scrubbing heads, I can brush my teeth in 1/2 the time.  &amp; yes, both heads do scrub, unlike other dual heads you see where only 1 head scrubs &amp; the other is stationary.</li>
    <li> if i remmbered correctly, Oral B&#x27;s heads are manufactured in germany and motor in mexico, I use generic/ OEM stuff elsewhere but when it comes to something americans want the german engineers to make, and I have to use it in my mouth daily, I know I ll pay more for original stuff.</li>
    <li> Brushes work great.  Just seem like they cost too much. But I guess all power head brushes are expensive.  But they do work good.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on my Crossaction Oral-B toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little weary about purchasing them because they are labeled as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but I do actually like them a lot and they are more of a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;. No where on the packaging does it actually say they are &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Oral-B is the premier maker of dental care products. These brush heads are well designed, easy to change and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I find that this doesn&#x27;t flare out as much as the other one. It definitely does its job but its not some sort of holy grail to go out and purchase the toothbrush and replacements...</li>
    <li> This is often hard for me to find at local stores, so I was excited to find it here for a decent price. Love how this type of head cleans with the circular and separate back and forth motion so no need to scrub like heck!</li>
    <li> The packaging comes in good condition. Worth the money and much cheaper buying it online.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric toothbrushe&#x27;s. The Complete Action Deep Clean with it&#x27;s charging cradle is by far the best. Powerful, fairly quite, just works. The replacement heads are cheaper than most and last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> fit my brush perfectly.  make sure you research fit for your model.  much prefer this brand of oral hygiene products.</li>
    <li> Could not find these replacement heads in local stores.  Not even wholesale clubs that sell the brush they go with.  Amazon has them thankfully.  They are well made and i like them better than the more simple round brush only heads.  Dual action seems to work very well and these are less expensive than alternative brushes.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> They fit, they work.  Seem to be genuine.  They definitely make your mouth feel cleaner than normal brushing alone.  Unfortunately, that just means I brush for a shorter amount of time.  You can think of it as a time saver or a tooth saver.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of toothbrush for years and I really like it. The replacement heads make using this toothbrush so much easier.</li>
    <li> Fortunately I could stil fid some more heads for my beloved Action Power Believe me: it&#x27;s not easy. Buy soon before they&#x27;re over!</li>
    <li> Works as expected - nothing more and nothing less.  I&#x27;d buy it again since the price was right and since I have no choice ;-)</li>
    <li> Changing the brush takes a little effort. Here is how I change the brush using the provided plastic tool.&lt;br /&gt;1. Put tool on brush side of the toothbrush so that the tool wraps over the brush handle.&lt;br /&gt;2. Position the inclined part of the tool so its raised dot can be inserted into the small hole located below the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;3. Press the tool&#x27;s inclined part so the dot goes into the small hole on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;4. While pressing the dot into the small hole - use your other hand to slide out the brush (slide toward the top DON&#x27;T lift up).&lt;br /&gt;5. Slide the new brush into position, when it snaps you&#x27;re good for 3 more months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints: Because the brush head is typically coated with debris it may require some extra effort to slide it out..&lt;br /&gt;When pressing the tool into the small hole, use your fingernail to pry from the bottom of  brush head toward the top,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the old brush off - you&#x27;ll see the debris, just clean it with an old toothbrush and paste. The new brush head will slide</li>
    <li> I am very grateful that I looked on line for the brush head replacements.  This is the best price that I have ever seen.  Love it</li>
    <li> fit&#x27;s excellent. as advertised</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement brush head. Snaps on easily and seems like its an original part. Price was lower than the local drugstores too.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I have used in five years. Battery lasts extra long, (thank God it only needs one) and I love that I can change out the heads whenever I need to. Make sure you save that little stick, I accidentally threw mine out and had to buy a whole new two pack because nothing in my house would get my used head off.</li>
    <li> The brushes are as advertised and fit the Oral-B toothbrush easily. They are good quality and I like using back my toothbrush again</li>
    <li> my bf has the toothbrush and needed replacement heads got them for him since he kept forgetting.  they fit as intended.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are exactly the same type you see in stores and this is the best price I have found for them.</li>
    <li> What more is there really to say. If you&#x27;re looking for replacements brush heads, you already know how the toothbrush works. These work as good as the one that came with your cross action / dual action.</li>
    <li> I always forget when I am at the store to get new heads and I found them! They come right to the door and fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy being able to order this item through Amazon.  I was having a hard time&lt;br /&gt;finding the replacement brush head for my tooth brushes but I found them available through&lt;br /&gt;my Amazon which many hard to find products can be found.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;One Happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nora</li>
    <li> I could not find these anywhere! They arrived the day after I ordered them. Very happy. So are my teeth. And gums.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are a great value compared to even WalMart.  Could not use the toothbrush without them.  Love the way my mouth and teeth feel after brushing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to purchase another toothbrush and I like the cost of theses heads  Quality and affordability and plus</li>
    <li> It was good price for these refills.  Came on time and was easy to install into the toothbrush. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The real thing, and a better deal than in local stores. I&#x27;d get it again. (Five more words required? There!)</li>
    <li> These are very inexpensive compared to some of the other electric brushes. And they work exactly the same as all but maybe the most sophisticated Sonicare. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I can find these replacements since it appears Oral B has discontinued marketing this type of brush, priced great ordered a bunch to stock up!</li>
    <li> The price for this on Amazon is much better than in the store. So, this is a really good replacement if your old brush head needs replacement. I recently bought the Philips Sonicare so I get to use this less often nowadays and this will probably be mainly used for travel, but sometimes even at home I feel like using this rather than the Sonicare &#x27;cause it feels easier and less cumbersome to use.</li>
    <li> These worked great in the power brushes that we own.  We feel it was a great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> good value and are the exact replacements for the brush i use</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I have a hard time finding these, even from the store I purchased the toothbrush from originally. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I really like the Oral-B battery operated toothbrush.  The pop-off head allows you to clean out the yucky toothpaste residue that accumulates under the head.  These replacement heads install easily but keep in mind if you have not cleaned the toothpaste residue periodically you may have difficulty getting the old head off of the brush.  BTW I am quite impressed with how long an ordinary alkaline battery hold up in this brush.  Replacement heads are significantly cheaper than a new tootbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite tooth brush. These replacement brush heads are hard to find in stores, probably because they are easy to steal. I&#x27;ve used the same brush handle and replaced the battery and heads up to about 5 or 6 times before the motor stops working. Honestly, that&#x27;s a pretty darn good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a little tricky to replace the first time, especially if you haven&#x27;t done a good job of cleaning the brush over time. Use the included tool to release the old brush head, by holding it over the body of the brush (you will have to push pretty hard on it). Then you can lift the old brush head off. Use a q-tip or something similar to clean inside the brush before you put the new head on. Hold the new head over the brush body and snap it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these over the other brands.</li>
