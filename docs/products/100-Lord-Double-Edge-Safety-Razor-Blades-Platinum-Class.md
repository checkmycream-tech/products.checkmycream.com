      <li>the razor is awesome, the blade that came with it was great</li>
      <li>Good quality and the price is very good.</li>

      <li>I ended up liking them much better than the feather blades that were supposed to be the best.  </li>
      <li>They are a great bargain, but for me One, or two at the most, is all that I get per blade, but they are Good, the first/second time around, and at this price, what the heck!</li>
      <li>and I loved it, it came with a free blade that was awesome</li>
      <li>This is really a good deal.</li>
      <li>, JUST USE CLASIC SHAVING SOAP OR GOOD MOISTURIZER.  </li>
      <li>the seller makes good on my order somehow</li>
      <li>I did not expect these to be nearly as good as they are.  </li>
      <li>I like them and it was a good price</li>
      <li>I think it was a good investment</li>
      <li>I use them for every shave and have good results.  </li>

      <li>Very easy to do</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m on a quest to find excellent blades for my Edwin DE razor and out of my multiple sample packs</li>
      <li>However, I think&lt;br /&gt;these are the best of the bunch with about the same price.</li>
      <li>Note: no shaving item is more subjective than razor blades: your results may, and probably will, vary.</li>
      <li>They give an excellent close shave without tugging or pulling (even when my facial hair gets longer).</li>
      <li>I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a lot of hype around DE razors in the US and mostly I&#x27;ve found the basic stuff works the best.</li>
      <li>They worked fantastically, and I purchased about 30 more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>2nd time i have purchased the product and am very happy with the quality of blades.</li>
      <li>All of the different LORD razors were the best, so we bought this pack.</li>
      <li>These are the best blades we have tried; they are sharp and work for many days, and they do not cut you</li>
      <li>These are good blades and very affordable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll preface this review with the caveat that I&#x27;ve tried other blades, and found that these work best for my face.</li>
      <li>I can get a nice close shave with these blades if I put the effort into it and make sure not to go against the grain too much in spots</li>
      <li>My husband gets a really close shave with this kind after trying a variety pack and choosing his favorite.</li>
      <li>There is no blade for ever man, but this particular blade (Lord in general) was the sharpest and best for me.  </li>
      <li>I got some of these blades free when I bought a Lord razor.</li>
      <li>These razors are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>NO PROBLEMS WITH FIT WITH</li>
      <li>I had received these for free along with my DE razor.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at how good they were compared to the cost.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp and do a very good job</li>
      <li>Try these with a cheap safety razor and you&#x27;ll start to love shaving like you did in high school</li>
      <li>If you want to get two or three full shaves out of these and then trash them.....</li>
      <li>The Blades are top quality at a very affordable price.  </li>
      <li>They are a good step up from Astra blades without making too big of a price jump.  </li>
      <li>JUST KEEP A LIGHT PRESSURE AND LET THE INEXPENCIVE FRESH BLADE DO THE WORK.  </li>
      <li>THE 40.00 RANGE SAFTEY RAVOR HOLDERS IN STAINLESS ARE JUST A GOOD WITH THE TWIST TOP THAN THE EXPENSIVE ONES AND LOOKS GREAT IN THE HOLDERS</li>
      <li>THEY ARE PERFECT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH A NEW BLADE EVERY OTHER DAY FOR A MONTH.</li>
      <li>These came with my super inexpensive Lord razor</li>
      <li>bottom line is: better product, longer lasting, cheaper, better results.</li>
      <li>Great blades and good price cannot go wrong with these</li>
      <li>These blades are great, so cheap for how many you get and how long they last!</li>
      <li>Ok, so I had bought their Razor as I am new to this type of shaving</li>
      <li>Each safety blade is in it&#x27;s own wrapper and then in a stack of 5 in it&#x27;s own small box.</li>
      <li>I get a smooth, close shave, yet they are very forgiving.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I think they are worth a try for some one else</li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying in a 5 pack.</li>
      <li>work great, smooth, sharp, and left me baby butt smooth.........</li>
      <li>They are sharper than Merkur, though not as sharp as Feather, and surprisingly durable.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product, and I gave two stars instead of one based upon the fact that the price is right.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the right bevel for me</li>
      <li>So cheap, I use a new blade for every shave!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are a few razors that these blades might work better with than others</li>
      <li>Very smooth and last about five shaves.</li>
      <li>These are good, very average.</li>
      <li>We tried a sample pack of blades, which contained many different brands.</li>
      <li>They are also cheaper by far than the Feathers, although not as cheap as Astras.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what is advertised.</li>
      <li>but these never broke in or changed enough to be anything better than \\&quot;just okay\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>These seem to be a higher quality version of Shark blades.</li>
      <li>I already have a few Platinums to compare and the Chromes work just as good to me</li>
      <li>If I go sideways to smooth out the trouble spots they work fine.</li>
      <li>when I started the DE thing, I wanted to go with a cheaper razor so that I wouldn&#x27;t be out so much money if I didn&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
      <li>VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND DO NOT PRESS</li>
      <li>The Lords are&lt;br /&gt;sharp and smooth at the same time.</li>
      <li>but as i said, i ordered platinum and really wanted what i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After a year of DE shaving, I switched blades because the other blades were allegedly better.</li>
      <li>(make you bleed) like many other brands do.</li>
      <li>They are super sharp but they also have what I can only describe as a more &#x27;positive feedback&#x27; quality to them.</li>
      <li>I can get about 15 full shaves out of feather, blue bird, shark, merkur, etc, etc.....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is not sharp enough to shave easily. 75% satisfying.</li>
    <li> I have terribly sensitive skin, but using these with a safety razor causes no bumps or irritation.  Tis was my last resort before I went with the laser route and I hit the jackpot with them. Plus, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Would you rather pay $25 a month for Mach 3 blades? Try these with a cheap safety razor and you&#x27;ll start to love shaving like you did in high school</li>
    <li> These came with my super inexpensive Lord razor so I tried them out.  I ended up liking them much better than the feather blades that were supposed to be the best.  These feel as sharp and last longer and give me less razor burn so I bought a bunch of them.  There is a lot of hype around DE razors in the US and mostly I&#x27;ve found the basic stuff works the best.</li>
    <li> I had received these for free along with my DE razor. A pack of derbies came as well. The derbies were great but I ran out so I tried the Lord, and that&#x27;s the first time since using a DE razor that my face actually burned after shaving. I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tossed the blade and tried another, same result. Definitely a difference between quality blades and mediocre blades. To me it&#x27;s worth the money to get the quality blade, and to anyone thinking it&#x27;s due to sensitive skin, not the issue. I have very tough skin, I can go over two or three times with no irritation with a quality blade.</li>
    <li> Works great and way cheaper than those disposable razors.</li>
    <li> These are good blades and very affordable.  I was really surprised at how good they were compared to the cost.  I think it was a good investment and I would have no trouble buying this brand of blade again.</li>
    <li> my goto blade.  Love these in a Merkur or a Lords razor!</li>
    <li> My son has discovered double sided blades for shaving.  He loves these blades, great prices &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> These are good, very average. Not aggressive or too sharp, room for error, would use again.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I use them for every shave and have good results.  They are consistently sharp and hold their edge well.  If you use a double edge razor I recommend you give these a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this razor. I gives me the closest shave. I can use the blade 4 time before I through it away. This is really a good deal. I get 400 shave which means I can shave any day for a year and will have only cost me 17 dollars. It a total no brainer. I used to use gillet fussion which was about 13 bucks for 4 razors you can do the math. 4 razors would last me about 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> 2nd time i have purchased the product and am very happy with the quality of blades.</li>
    <li> There is no blade for ever man, but this particular blade (Lord in general) was the sharpest and best for me.  Even with a 5-day scruff it would shave without tugging and hurting.  So cheap, I use a new blade for every shave!</li>
    <li> i used this brand before in 1998 to 2008 it was the blue cover it was the best but when i start to use it now i notest the deferents in quility that why i rated  4  stars</li>
    <li> These are only second to the feather de blades as being my favorite. I shave with the platinums daily. Very smooth and last about five shaves. My beard hair is pretty heavy. You cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> If you like dull blades and razor burn, these are the blades for you. Just as bad as the regular Lords.</li>
    <li> I got some of these blades free when I bought a Lord razor. I&#x27;ve used Lord blades in heavier razors and lighter razors with pretty much the same result. It&#x27;s not a super sharp blade. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 6 or 7 sharpness if measured on a scale of 1-10. I can get a nice close shave with these blades if I put the effort into it and make sure not to go against the grain too much in spots I know I will get weepers. If I go straight down on the bottom half of my neck with these I&#x27;ll get weepers. If I go sideways to smooth out the trouble spots they work fine. These blades just are not sharp enough to go against the grain where you know you&#x27;ll have trouble spots. I got some slight tugging with these blades in the top portion of my face even when they were new or on the second shave. I know blades can have a break in period but these never broke in or changed enough to be anything better than \\&quot;just okay\\&quot;. These blades are middle of the road. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them myself but you can get a decent shave with these blades if you pay attention and don&#x27;t rush things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving these Lord blades 3/5 stars. I&#x27;m sure that there are a few razors that these blades might work better with than others but I haven&#x27;t found that combo yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 20 different brands of safety razor blades before finding these. These Platinum Lord razor blades seem to be a notch above other blades I&#x27;ve tried in terms of sharpness. The sharper the shave the smoother the shave. I have thick stubble and most safety blades I&#x27;ve tried tend to snag, especially after a day or two. In contrast the Lord Blades seem to cut through with no snagging and remain very sharp for about a whole week. I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 100 razor blades in the package, but since they are safety razors (double sided) it&#x27;s really like getting 200 blades if you use a straight razor like I do. Each safety blade is in it&#x27;s own wrapper and then in a stack of 5 in it&#x27;s own small box. I just take one of the double-sided razors, that is still in its wrapper (so I don&#x27;t accidentally get cut) and bend it to break it in half. Very easy to do and then I actually wind up with 200 new blades from this pack.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying the older version of blades but I received the platinum coated blades which I liked a lot  more. All I can say is I liked&lt;br /&gt;the blades and I think they are worth a try for some one else, everybody has different preferences.</li>
    <li> I use these blades exclusively and have never had an issue with them.  They stay sharp longer than some other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past and the quality of them is superb.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> NO PROBLEMS WITH FIT WITH OLD FASHION 1940&#x27;S TYPE TWIST SAFTEY RAZOR AND THE SHARPEST SHAVE YOU COULD WANT.  PACKAGED WELL AND STORES WELL AS THEY COME IN SMALL PACKS OF 10?  FOR A TRAVEL PACK THEY ARE PERFECT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH A NEW BLADE EVERY OTHER DAY FOR A MONTH. VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND DO NOT PRESS TO HARD UNLESS YOU HAVE A IRON FACE IN WHICH I DO NOT HAVE AND ONLY NEED TO USE EVERY 3 DAYS AFTER USING SIDE BURN ELECTRIC TRIMMERS ON A FEW WEEKS GROTH IT TAKE IT DOWN TO SKING LEVEL AND NOT BELOW GIVING INGROWN HAIR THAT SOME OF US MIX RACED PEOPLE ARE PRONE TO AND MUST USE SHAVING POWDER.  JUST KEEP A LIGHT PRESSURE AND LET THE INEXPENCIVE FRESH BLADE DO THE WORK.  THE 40.00 RANGE SAFTEY RAVOR HOLDERS IN STAINLESS ARE JUST A GOOD WITH THE TWIST TOP THAN THE EXPENSIVE ONES AND LOOKS GREAT IN THE HOLDERS RECOMMENDED SO EVERYTHING DRYS AND NO BACTERIA LIKE THOSE DRUG STORE TRASH RAZORS WITH THE COMFORT STRIPS, JUST USE CLASIC SHAVING SOAP OR GOOD MOISTURIZER.  WILL LAST A LONG TIME AND IF MY DISCRIPTION FITS YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY. ONE OF MY BEST BUYS TO DATE ON SHOW ON MY COUNTER WITH ALL THE HIGH END HIGENE PRODUCT HOLDERS.  BEATS DOLLAR RAZOR PROGRAM IN COST IN A FEW MONTHS.  LONG TERM INVESTMENT AS LONG AS YOU TAKE CARE WITH BLADES TO SPARE THE COST NEXT TO NOTHING.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sample pack of razors and found these to be my favorite. They are super sharp but they also have what I can only describe as a more &#x27;positive feedback&#x27; quality to them. I can feel the blade when I am shaving, which not everyone likes but I am a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack size is a spectacular deal. This is clearly a wholesale package meant for the individual boxes of razors to be sold at a storefront. I shave about three times a week, Monday&#x27;s shave being the first and thickest with a full weekend buildup behind it. I switch razors every other shave or so but a single blade could easily last the week. It is going on eight months since I purchased these and I&#x27;ve still got a ton to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the value lives in the safety razor vs. cartridges argument. The only potential drawback is that I might want to try out some different razors now that I have my technique down and it will probably be another eight months before I am out of these.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I had bought their Razor as I am new to this type of shaving and I loved it, it came with a free blade that was awesome so I figured let me buy a truckload of these.  These feel terrible! they hurt to use, I end up throwing them out after one use and have only used three of these.  the razor is awesome, the blade that came with it was great but this pack sucks.  I cut my face, I get irritation and soreness it just is not good razor blade</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t overlook these blades because they are inexpensive. I have used a multitude from Derby to Feather. These work great and are a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a quest to find excellent blades for my Edwin DE razor and out of my multiple sample packs Lord has been the biggest failure.  I have thin hair and shave every other day and these blades (regular and chrome) start tugging on the sixth or seventh shave every time.  Worse yet, they did not provide a close shave at all.  I found myself struggling with having to do multiple passes to get a close shave each day.  I can get about 15 full shaves out of feather, blue bird, shark, merkur, etc, etc.....but not these turds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I thought the quality of every blade manufacturer were so close that it was an almost pointless endeavor.....until I tried these.  If you want to get two or three full shaves out of these and then trash them.....that might be the only way to find value in them.  As for me, I can see the low quality in these blades and will not repurchase these ever again.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and do a very good job</li>
    <li> Bought a multi-pack of razors and these were the best for me so I had to buy a 100 pack.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have ever used. One blade shaves me for a week without a single nick. Maybe it&#x27;s the right bevel for me but I am hooked on these blades!</li>
    <li> These seem to be a higher quality version of Shark blades. Good quality and the price is very good.</li>
    <li> Great blades and good price cannot go wrong with these</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what is advertised. No suprises, arrives in a timely manner,part of making a shave a relaxing time again without hipe. A break from the hurry-up throw-away to the personnel.</li>
    <li> We tried a sample pack of blades, which contained many different brands. All of the different LORD razors were the best, so we bought this pack. These are the best blades we have tried; they are sharp and work for many days, and they do not cut you (make you bleed) like many other brands do.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as some, but a fine blade.</li>
    <li> having used three other blades in the past, these Lord give me a smoother and closer shave. I get about 4-5 uses out of each blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review with the caveat that I&#x27;ve tried other blades, and found that these work best for my face. Your results may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I started the DE thing, I wanted to go with a cheaper razor so that I wouldn&#x27;t be out so much money if I didn&#x27;t stick with it. I got the LORD brand razor and two blades that came with it. They worked fantastically, and I purchased about 30 more. After a year of DE shaving, I switched blades because the other blades were allegedly better. I found that they didn&#x27;t work for me personally, and I switched back to LORD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 pack is an excellent value. I think I purchased it for around $16. At four shaves per blade, every other day, these will last me a little over two years. The cost of a blade on a per shave basis comes out to only four cents. Compare that with the standard four blade razors which come in a 17 pack for $35. At four shaves per blade, the cost is a little over a half dollar per shave, and the shave with a DE razor is much closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: better product, longer lasting, cheaper, better results.</li>
    <li> I received these blades in an assortment when I ordered my Weishi safety razor. Of all the blades that came with the razor, these are by far the nicest. They give an excellent close shave without tugging or pulling (even when my facial hair gets longer). They stay sharp and last about 4-5 shaves each. I would recommend these blades to anyone with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> These blades are great, so cheap for how many you get and how long they last! My husband gets a really close shave with this kind after trying a variety pack and choosing his favorite. A must have!</li>
    <li> The Blades are top quality at a very affordable price.  I tried at least 20 brands and these ranked in the top tier.</li>
    <li> I like them and it was a good price, I really think that there are BAD blade brands and the rest are all good, they all act differently if you do not use them properly.  This was priced well too</li>
    <li> I would have given this blade 5 stars, but i took away stars because the distributor  FGP Sent me Chromes instead of Platinums.  I already have a few Platinums to compare and the Chromes work just as good to me so ill keep them anyway being i am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;I tried asking the seller why i got sent Chrome instead of the advertised Platinum, and my question keeps getting deleted and i get no answer, so i dont know whats going on.&lt;br /&gt;The box looks the same as the Platinums, but it says Chrome instead.&lt;br /&gt;They work great, smooth, sharp, and left me baby butt smooth.........but as i said, i ordered platinum and really wanted what i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I guess ill have to order Platinums from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;If the seller makes good on my order somehow, ill change this review.&lt;br /&gt;So far my blades favorites are LORD Chrome and Platinum, Personna blue, Shark Chrome and Astra Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;All these blades work about even with my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I can also use Dorco and Feather with no problem, but like the other four better.&lt;br /&gt;Derby and Merkur rip me up, although for some reason i can use Derby with my shavette shaver. Go figure?</li>
    <li> These razors are fantastic.  I got a multi-pack to see what worked best for me, and these were it.  Incredible value to get over a year&#x27;s worth of razors for so cheap.  I will never go back to regular razors!!!</li>
    <li> been using derby, crystal, dorco 300. these are very good. I got 5 good shaves from the first blade and no nicks or weepers! none on  5 shaves .</li>
    <li> These blades seem much more dull than the last blades I got. They are the same brand and same model.</li>
    <li> This is one of my three favorites. It&#x27;s my regular daily razor. For me it seems yo last longer and when a discount hits I snatch up another pack. I suggest trying out one of those multi packs of different manufactures if you are somewhat knew to safety razors.</li>
    <li> When my local drug store stopped carrying DE safety razors, I was forced to look online.  I bought these based on the price of the blade, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with the overall quality.  I would only describe my beard as normal thickness, but these blades tug harder than any others I&#x27;ve used in the last 7 years.  After two passes with these blades (one with the grain/one across) and I still don&#x27;t feel like I have a close shave, and the stubble is fully grown back by about 2:30pm -- absolutely terrible for my work environment.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a bunch of dull blades that I don&#x27;t want.  I&#x27;ll probalby change the blade out every day and then never buy these again.  I do not recommend this product, and I gave two stars instead of one based upon the fact that the price is right.</li>
    <li> If you like your razors to be on a sharp side, these ones are for you. Clumsy shavers--stay away. These guys bite, especially the first time you put them against the skin.</li>
    <li> Between Feather Razors, the sharpest, and Dorcos, the dullest, there is a happy medium and these are it.  The Lords are&lt;br /&gt;sharp and smooth at the same time. They are also cheaper by far than the Feathers, although not as cheap as Astras. The&lt;br /&gt;same factory that makes these also makes about seven other razor blades, including Sharks and Big Ben. However, I think&lt;br /&gt;these are the best of the bunch with about the same price.</li>
    <li> I stopped paying the high prices of cartridge razors and went back to the way my grandfather shaved using these blades.  I first purchased a variety pack and found these blades offer the best performance for my beard.  The savings of these blades as opposed to cartridges is amazing.  I shave a year, with a closer shave, for the price of a month of cartridges.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I use these with the basic Lord DE razor.  They give a close enough shave, but only last 2-3 shaves for me before they start to tug.</li>
    <li> My son likes these.  They are thin and don&#x27;t last forever, but they are still a good purchase for the cost.</li>
    <li> I did not expect these to be nearly as good as they are.  They are sharper than Merkur, though not as sharp as Feather, and surprisingly durable.  I can get 5 or 6 daily shaves from one razor, though the first 3 are noticeably easier.  They are a good step up from Astra blades without making too big of a price jump.  Definitely worth trying in a 5 pack.</li>
    <li> Bearing in mind that no blade will be perfect for everyone, these blades do the trick for me.</li>
    <li> They are a great bargain, but for me One, or two at the most, is all that I get per blade, but they are Good, the first/second time around, and at this price, what the heck!</li>
    <li> For the price, I&#x27;ve found I cannot beat them. I get a smooth, close shave, yet they are very forgiving. I have an average beard and get 4 shaves per blade. Note: no shaving item is more subjective than razor blades: your results may, and probably will, vary. They work for me.</li>
