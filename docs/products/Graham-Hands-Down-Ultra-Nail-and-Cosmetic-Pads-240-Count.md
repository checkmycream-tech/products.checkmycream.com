      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>Huge mistake...</li>
      <li>I bought these primarily for removing nail polish.</li>
      <li>These are great for taking nail polish off and this size will last for a while.  </li>
      <li>I bought two bags and sent a bag to my daughter after reading all the great reviews stating it only takes one for all your polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are great because while using these they protect your manicure, and you can use the plastic back to mix colors, apply glue, etc..  </li>
      <li>When using them with the gel nails, I use a lint free wipe (which is paper thin) on top of these for a perfect manicure.  </li>
      <li>Frequent maintenance with proper removal is a must for best results.</li>
      <li>These pads are essential for a good manicure.  </li>
      <li>They are so much easier to use than cotton balls, which are too fuzzy and leave too many fibers stuck on your nails when you remove nail polish.  </li>
      <li>The other thing I noticed is how many there are!!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and very dependable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!</li>
      <li>They are on the pricey side but worth it.  </li>
      <li>definitely worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the wait for shipping.</li>
      <li>The bag of 240 pads could very well last you for a year while you save time and frustration by having an easy to use product to get your nails really clean and fuzz free.  </li>
      <li>Just wanted to do a first impression comment.  </li>
      <li>You can use them on other people and it won&#x27;t strip your own nail polish.</li>
      <li>started using these when the dark colors were all the rage because they really got in the corners to clean off my nail, working better than cotton balls.</li>
      <li>these are nice but not worth the money would rather use cotton balls</li>
      <li>They also hold liquid products well without drying out too fast, thus saving time and money.</li>
      <li>they get through sparkles really well, with acetone remove.</li>
      <li>It holds the polish remover very well.  </li>
      <li>Love these pads, just wish they came in a bit bigger size for those clients with red polish.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>these are a must have if you are doing CND shellac nails, no lint or cotton fibers left behind, good for the sanitizer before and the alcohol after the last top coat.</li>
      <li>I love the little &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on them.</li>
      <li>I will try these probably tomorrow, and then I will give details of these things in action!!</li>
      <li>The pads are plastic backed and are nice and thick.</li>
      <li>They come in a nice thick plastic bag with a ziplock type closure.  </li>
      <li>Now I love them because if I mess up a nail and the rest of them are wet, I can clean it up and start again w/o damaging the polish on my hands already.</li>
      <li>pad easily removes polish from 5-10 nails depending on how dark the polish is.</li>
      <li>So even when the soft side is done you can use the plastic side.  </li>
      <li>These pads are soft and absorbent.</li>
      <li>These are also better than any I&#x27;ve found in stores because the material that the pad itself is made of is sturdy and the cloth doesn&#x27;t strip (like if you use a cotton ball, once it gets wet it kind of starts falling apart and might leave behind little fibers.</li>
      <li>They say you can use one for all ten fingers, I use about two and then a third for a final wipe, but that&#x27;s me, your mileage may very.</li>
      <li>Only down side is they are not completely lint free.  </li>
      <li>Worth the little extra money.</li>
      <li>The texture makes polish removal much easier and takes less pads than when using regular makeup removal pads.  </li>

<li> Without sparkles, I got the polish off on all 10 nails (base coat, 2 color coats, water marble &#x27;layer&#x27; and top coat) with 1 cotton pad!!</li>
<li> The bags last a very long time because it only takes 1-2 pads to remove polish from ten nails so</li>
<li> No more cotton threads stuck to my nails &amp; fingers :) I use less time and less polish remover with these little dandies.</li>
<li> But don’t if you have dark or red nail polishes…it’ll smear all over your fingers.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s 10 pads that is pretty poor in my opinion.</li>
<li> Not only do these make less mess than cotton balls, Q-tips, or cotton rounds, they actually remove the polish faster.</li>
<li> But I found them to be too rough for the face.</li>
<li> even if it seems expensive, it is well worth it.</li>
<li> The pads are surprisingly small, but pretty thick.  </li>
<li> Unlike others here I thought these were too small and use of only one side - didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br</li>
<li> No more sticky pieces of shredded cotton ball left on your nail.</li>
<li> The surface is slightly ruff</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t mess up nails.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a little pricey but the bag lasts me a while.</li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these, you are missing out.</li>
<li> And theres no cotton left behind.</li>
<li> No more little fuzzies in the nail polish.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing.  I love these.  They are on the pricey side but worth it.  They hold a lot of nail polish remover without dripping and the material doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the nail polish you&#x27;re trying to remove.  They say you can use one for all ten fingers, I use about two and then a third for a final wipe, but that&#x27;s me, your mileage may very.</li>
    <li> My drug store stopped selling these so I had to try to find them online. These are great for removing nail polish, definitely my favorite method. You can use them on other people and it won&#x27;t strip your own nail polish. These are also better than any I&#x27;ve found in stores because the material that the pad itself is made of is sturdy and the cloth doesn&#x27;t strip (like if you use a cotton ball, once it gets wet it kind of starts falling apart and might leave behind little fibers. This won&#x27;t do that at all). One pad takes off polish on both hands so this will last you years.</li>
    <li> I love that these have a paper backing so you can remove your nail polish from your toes without messing up your fingernails.  It holds the polish remover very well.  The texture makes polish removal much easier and takes less pads than when using regular makeup removal pads.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t left an occasional strand of cotton.  Nothing like regular cotton balls but I was under the impression these would not leave any cotton strands.  I&#x27;ll  buy these again when I use my current supply up.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Will never use cotton balls again!</li>
    <li> these are great for applying anything you need to your face.  Works great else where also.  Leaves no cotton behind.</li>
    <li> these are a must have if you are doing CND shellac nails, no lint or cotton fibers left behind, good for the sanitizer before and the alcohol after the last top coat.</li>
    <li> Unlike others here I thought these were too small and use of only one side - didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try something else next time. (nail polish remover pads &amp;#60; used for)</li>
    <li> These are great for removing nail polish, they have a plastic backing so that you can remove polish safely without messing up the polish on your fingers--for example if you have a smudged or chipped nail you want to re-polish or if you want to only remove polish on your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are low fuzz, I don&#x27;t get tons of cotton fibers all over my nails and I can usually get 5 fingers done with one pad.  They&#x27;re a little pricey but the bag lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> these are nice but not worth the money would rather use cotton balls</li>
    <li> These pads are soft and absorbent. I love the little &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on them. I use these all the time and would recommend them to every one...</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nails and they don&#x27;t work well for me. While they hold quite a bit of polish remover they leave a lot of fibers behind with thicker polish or polish with any type of glitter.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. 1 pad easily removes polish from 5-10 nails depending on how dark the polish is. I love using then to remove pedicure polish because the plastic coating and grip protects polished nails on your hand.</li>
    <li> very nice pads to use to remove nail polish with, easy to use and i can take off 3-4 nails or so with one pad. i would purchase agin</li>
    <li> Heard about these from missjenfabulous.  No more cotton fibers stuck to my nails, even gets glitter off.  Worth the little extra money.</li>
    <li> Love these! Awesome for nails. But I found them to be too rough for the face. For nails their amazing, no lint! :)</li>
    <li> Product is great! Exactly as described! Great quality! Great price! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> The pads are plastic backed and are nice and thick. They work great for gently removing nail polish. You only need one pad to do all nails.</li>
    <li> using these has changed my manicures.  It only takes one pad per hand to remove my polish and it gets every last bit including glittery polishes</li>
    <li> Love these pads, just wish they came in a bit bigger size for those clients with red polish.</li>
    <li> Could not do my job without these. They are the best to remove polish or to take tacky off gel nails.</li>
    <li> If you do the work on your nails you will love these pads.  Easy to use and very dependable.&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> These are honestly the best cotton pads...they get through sparkles really well, with acetone remove. Without sparkles, I got the polish off on all 10 nails (base coat, 2 color coats, water marble &#x27;layer&#x27; and top coat) with 1 cotton pad!! That&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> These are great for taking nail polish off and this size will last for a while.  No more sticky pieces of shredded cotton ball left on your nail. One or two good swipes and the polish comes off.  Even has tabs you can hold to prevent polish from getting on the finger nails that are holding the pads.  Great price for these too.</li>
    <li> Hi!! Just got these THIS MINUTE!  Just wanted to do a first impression comment.  They come in a nice thick plastic bag with a ziplock type closure.  The pads are surprisingly small, but pretty thick.  The backing is really nice.  The other thing I noticed is how many there are!!  I guess I thought 280 pads was not that many, but this is a LOT of product for the price.  I will try these probably tomorrow, and then I will give details of these things in action!!</li>
    <li> These pads are essential for a good manicure.  I use 100% acetone, which dries out the skin on my fingers.  Having a barrier on the pad ensures my fingers won&#x27;t be exposed to acetone any longer than needed.</li>
    <li> Once I found these I could never go back to standard cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;They are amazing and SO MANY come in a pack. Definitely worth the wait for shipping.</li>
    <li> Huge mistake... I base my buying choices on other reviewers. I have 1700 reviews last time I checked.&lt;br /&gt;First off no fibers this is true.&lt;br /&gt;Great idea how they work and have the thing on the back so you don&#x27;t mess up nails. So if you are changing toe nails polish you fingers nails polish stays pretty&lt;br /&gt;Here is why I gave them one star. I was shocked  I have to use one of these for each finger nail. That&#x27;s 10 pads that is pretty poor in my opinion. I am not sure what polish others use. I use OPI and Butter London. I bought two bags and sent a bag to my daughter after reading all the great reviews stating it only takes one for all your polish.&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy that I have to use 10 not one. I would never buy them again. i will stick with the pads that already have the polish remover on them.</li>
    <li> What person wouldn&#x27;t love to get these. You use these to take makeup off your face. I use mine for taking nail polish off. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I would highly recommend.  They do not leave any fibers on my nails like others do</li>
    <li> LOVE these cosmetic pads. definitely worth the buy. They&#x27;re really great quality and help take off polish easily with my acetone remover.  I only need ONE pad to remove both hands even if i have glitter. And theres no cotton left behind. Was recommended these by a friend and i will reperchase when i run out. great buy!</li>
    <li> Let me start with this: I have over 110 bottles of nail polish. I figured rather than pay $10 for a manicure, I could start doing it myself and buy the polish instead. So I&#x27;m a bit of a power user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using these when the dark colors were all the rage because they really got in the corners to clean off my nail, working better than cotton balls. Now I love them because if I mess up a nail and the rest of them are wet, I can clean it up and start again w/o damaging the polish on my hands already. Also: generally I only need 2 - 3 to remove polish from both hands. It always takes me way more cotton balls to take it off my nails.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Allows you to take off nail polish without messing up the polish on the hand you are using with the pads.</li>
    <li> I did like these as I could hold onto them with that backing.</li>
    <li> The name is fitting because they are &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; my favorite product for removing nail polish. The plastic backing and tab protect your nails if you have to remove polish from just one nail, or your toes, and the lint-free surface scrubs even the toughest glitters. If you haven&#x27;t tried these, you are missing out.</li>
    <li> best nail polish remover pads I&#x27;ve found.  Beware imitations!</li>
    <li> Removing Shellac nail polish is not the same as removing nail polish. These pads allow for &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34; off the shellac without wasting your remover while saving time since multiple fingers can be &amp;#34;soaked&amp;#34; at once. Shellac can allow damaged nails the time to grow out and strengthen after years false nails. Frequent maintenance with proper removal is a must for best results.</li>
    <li> I bought these primarily for removing nail polish. Not only do these make less mess than cotton balls, Q-tips, or cotton rounds, they actually remove the polish faster. I love the plastic backing so you don&#x27;t get polish all over your fingers, and you can see it soaking the polish up all the way through to the backing. It doesn&#x27;t just smear it around like cotton balls. They&#x27;re also advertised as lint-free, which they definitely are! No more cotton threads stuck to my nails &amp; fingers :) I use less time and less polish remover with these little dandies.</li>
    <li> I use these pads to remove and work with gel polish.  They are great because while using these they protect your manicure, and you can use the plastic back to mix colors, apply glue, etc..  So even when the soft side is done you can use the plastic side.  Only down side is they are not completely lint free.  When using them with the gel nails, I use a lint free wipe (which is paper thin) on top of these for a perfect manicure.  They also hold liquid products well without drying out too fast, thus saving time and money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - a must for all who do at home manicures and pedicures.  They are so much easier to use than cotton balls, which are too fuzzy and leave too many fibers stuck on your nails when you remove nail polish.  The plastic backing protects your nails and skin from drying nail polish removers and makes the pads easy to grip.  The bags last a very long time because it only takes 1-2 pads to remove polish from ten nails so even if it seems expensive, it is well worth it. The bag of 240 pads could very well last you for a year while you save time and frustration by having an easy to use product to get your nails really clean and fuzz free.  Try this - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product is the best that i have found at this price range. I bought it for nail Polish removal. The surface is slightly ruff so it makes nail polish removal a breeze. The back side has a plastic cover, this makes it possible to contain the liquid on one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this on your face, it&#x27;s a bit ruff and may scratch your skin a bit.</li>
    <li> And the best nail polish remover ever!  You only need one pad for all 10 nails.  But don’t if you have dark or red nail polishes…it’ll smear all over your fingers.  For those colors, you’ll have to go back to cotton balls.</li>
    <li> No more little fuzzies in the nail polish.  Great clean way to remove polish.</li>
