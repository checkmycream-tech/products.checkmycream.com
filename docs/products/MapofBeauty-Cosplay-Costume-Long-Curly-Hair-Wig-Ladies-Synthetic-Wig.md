      <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE WIG!</li>
      <li>Wig itself is great for the price and the shipping was very quick.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have to make my own.</li>
      <li>I got it before it was to be delivered which was nice</li>
      <li>so the mesh underneath is very visible, especially on top.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s kind of a gamble.</li>
      <li>so was unsure how the ends should be the are kind of flimsy to give the bouncy feel.</li>
      <li>It comes with a wig cap too, which was nice.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the nice thing about these wigs, they are versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good quality, easy to take care of.</li>
      <li>Tangles very easy.  </li>
      <li>This wig is very good quality and really seems to hold up to kids playing with it.  </li>
      <li>WOW I was quite impressed when this wig came in.</li>
      <li>but it would have been near perfect</li>
      <li>the quality of this wig is amazing and the price is unbelievibly cheap for this amazing wig.</li>
      <li>Wig cap is very flexible, lots of wigs won&#x27;t fit me, but this one adjusted perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is superior to her special order $450 wig.</li>
      <li>Most wigs don&#x27;t fit very well because of this, but this wig fits a bit snugly, but perfectly.</li>
      <li>The wig does tangle a bit, but I sprayed some detangler just to see how well it would work, and I was able to work the curls to a point where they&#x27;re easy to brush but still look nice and curly.</li>
      <li>Great for my costume, good quality, recommend is super real hair.</li>
      <li>By all means, if you want this wig as a gag or wacky Halloween costume, go for it.</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews before buying this wig, wanting to be sure that it was what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wig.</li>
      <li>then that i love the wig as is.</li>
      <li>and I hope this review helps others. :)</li>
      <li>It is not costume quality, it is much better.</li>
      <li>and i noticed that it had some spaces showing though the wig on the top</li>
      <li>if I hav&#x3D;d paid more than $8 bucks for this</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more wigs from this seller.</li>
      <li>I could not be happier with my purchase, and love the gift the seller tossed in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just had to fix the bangs to look more like her</li>
      <li>I would buy two though, just to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>this is my second wig from this Taobaopit Avant Garde Cosplay and there are very good, so BUY IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this wig for more than just cosplay</li>
      <li>4/5, I like it :)</li>
      <li>And I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for Halloween because I was in love with it from the picture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll tangle tho  </li>
      <li>I was still able to get the knots out without noticeable hair loss</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>If your getting this I recommend making sure</li>
      <li>(White) Wig is awesome.</li>
      <li>I am in love with my wig.</li>
      <li>If you comb all of the hair on top, then you cannot see the cap underneath.  </li>
      <li>I bought this wig for my Elsa costume, and it braided okay.</li>
      <li>I paid about $8, and am mostly satifed with it for the amount of money I paid.</li>
      <li>There was also an unraveled thread (about 1/2 the wig length) just dangling amongst the strands, which lead toward one of the top weave parts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure eventually I can use this wig.</li>
      <li>that I have more time</li>
      <li>and I already started styling it to make it look somewhat better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It nice and wavy and long. Good for cosplay.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the fit of the wig.  Purchased it for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume and it didn&#x27;t fit. She&#x27;s 4 years old and it&#x27;s an adult wig.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig. So did everyone else.  I have a short, black pixie cut and just about everyone said I should wear it anytime I feel like having long hair.  It went great for the event.  It was so soft and the curls were gorgeous.  It was definitely a winner.  I will be buying more in the future from them.  Their shipping was fast and ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thin, but what do can you expect for the price? The color is true to the image and so it the length. I&#x27;ve had it over a year now with a few uses and it&#x27;s still in tact. It&#x27;s knotted a bit but nothing impossible to fix. I haven&#x27;t even had to use a wig comb on it! Good buy.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly as an Elsa wig for my daughter on halloween! She was stunning!</li>
    <li> Not sure why the wig cap is light yellow. Seems a little thin, but might work well in a dark club atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s really pretty otherwise and would consider buying a second to wear over the first to make it thicker.</li>
    <li> My teenager and her friends love wearing wigs for fun and they really like this one. Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> The fibers in the wig are nice and don&#x27;t tangle easily, but it&#x27;s a little on the thin side which I think is especially easy to see in the white.  But it&#x27;s not pricey, so it works.</li>
    <li> Got 2 for mannikins, and they&#x27;ve held up very well travelling through several shows</li>
    <li> I like it but you can see the tracks so I had to tease it a little. The pre curl was awesome and easy to manage it didn&#x27;t get all tangled either.</li>
    <li> Though it arrived sooner then it was meant to this was to small for my head and really really thin in the back like there was almost no hair.  Disappointed sadly</li>
    <li> Very, very white.  Stark white.  Will be great for dress up or Halloween.  Or may try to add a little light blonde or blonde streaks to it.  Wig itself is great for the price and the shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> I bought this as one of my first wigs, as I wished to give them a try for the convention I am going to next week. When I received the item, I was stoked. It looked gorgeous, with soft flowing hair and so forth. But then, I started to see flaws in my particular wig. The hair is very sparse in some parts, where others it is so thick it can be hard to work with. The netting underneath is nowhere near the whiteness the hair is at, so it can look really weird if left uncovered, something on my particular wig it is hard to not do. There was also an unraveled thread (about 1/2 the wig length) just dangling amongst the strands, which lead toward one of the top weave parts. There was another part of the weave that was just poking through the hair itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most of this is able to be worked around, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to put the effort into it since quality control should have taken care of it. :(</li>
    <li> I read reviews on just how beautiful this wig is .. Infact it is a Beautiful white .. BUT it seems to be VERY thin by the front of the head .. Which is VERY unfortunate .. As I will have to purchase some sort of headband or something to cover the thinned areas where you can see the cap. It DOES come with a wig cap ( which is a Plus ) BUT its black .. SO if you want a white one you better order one as I did. Did come neatly packaged.</li>
    <li> A gorgeous wig, very elegant and dramatic. Have used for several costumes. Have not had any trouble with shedding. Worked well for my Game of Thrones costume, although this does not have a middle part.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and figured it would be destroyed after a few days.  This wig is very good quality and really seems to hold up to kids playing with it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before buying this wig, wanting to be sure that it was what I wanted. I was a little disappointed that the hair isn&#x27;t as soft as the other reviews claim it is, feels pretty similar to the wigs you&#x27;d get at the Halloween store. I do really like it though and it will be great for my Daenerys costume this Halloween. It is worth the money, and I do not regret buying it at all. Like other reviews have said, it&#x27;s a little sparse on hair towards the top so I can&#x27;t really braid it like I&#x27;d wanted to, but oh well. It comes with a wig cap too, which was nice. 4/5, I like it :)</li>
    <li> I had to buy this wig for a cosplay I was interested in. The wig came in a net and had long perfect curls. The wig falls to about the middle of my back and it feels like natural hair. I had to mess around with the bangs so they would form my face correctly, yet other than that, no alterations had to be made. I got compliments from everyone I showed and they said that it was identical to my character! (Felicia Hardy) I would definitely recommend this wig to anyone looking for a lovely wig. Taobaopit can look forward to many more purchases from this happy customer!</li>
    <li> Came before shipping date which was awesome. I was wanting this wig for a cosplay im doing, and i opening up the package and it was in pretty good condition. I tried it on right out of the box and it looks very good, just as expected from the picture. Some work needs to be done on the bangs because they are pretty long, but other then that i love the wig as is.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous wig that appears to be very high quality. You can not see the wig cap through the wig itself. There is little to no shedding at all. AMAZING find and buy! Thanks!</li>
    <li> i am a cosplayer and i have several wings. this is the nicest wig in my collection. purchased this wig for a storm cosplay. the hair is soft and has a natural shine and bounce to it. it looks, feels, and acts like real hair. the color is perfect... white, but not stark, plain, paper white. the quality of this wig is amazing and the price is unbelievibly cheap for this amazing wig.</li>
    <li> Kinda is off from the picture but is really pretty and soft and easy to maintain overly all I love it for my BlackCat and storm cosplay</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price.  Doesnt look like the picture.  Needs a little styling to get it to look like the picture. only wearing it for a foam glow race.  Hair is falling out already from playing with it</li>
    <li> I bought this 30 days ago and was hoping to wear this for a shoot. I still haven&#x27;t gotten it. Really Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Decent quality for the price, works for mother of dragons style. You have to wear it a little off center since this wig has bangs and she doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I used this wig for my Jasper (steven universe) cosplay! It worked flawlessly once I cut the bangs and styled them with LOTS of hair spray. It&#x27;s very soft and de-tangles fairly easily, after running around a con all day /and/ wearing a backpack rubbing against it I was still able to get the knots out without noticeable hair loss</li>
    <li> Love it I&#x27;m very pleases it&#x27;s long and curly I just can&#x27;t stop wearing it best product ever I&#x27;m going to order another one from them again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it the rating I am, because it is not what pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig comes up with the searches &amp;#34;platinum blonde&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;white blonde&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image also shows a whitish blonde wig.  So wouldn&#x27;t you think maybe a blonde wig? At least I was lead to believe so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon receiving the item, it isn&#x27;t blonde at all, it&#x27;s a white wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes to show the image can&#x27;t be trusted, however it is a nice white wig and I am a fan of the wigs taobaopit offers having owned now 4 of them. They work beautifully for cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure eventually I can use this wig. But for now, it will just sit around.</li>
    <li> The wig came with a few strands of blue and red hair (I plucked them out with no damage), and just in a zipbag in a padded envolope.&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself tangles easily and has shorter bangs than pictured, but it is a plastic wig. I paid about $8, and am mostly satifed with it for the amount of money I paid. I bought this wig for my Elsa costume, and it braided okay.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know I think is the company but this wig is perfect (I want it for my Elsa&#x27;s character from frozen) and its perfect is not too long and have enough hair for the Elsa&#x27;s tress also is very white so people who think is going to be a littler blonde is not, is a perfect white for whatever character or occasion you need it white. I love it and it is soft like real hair this is my second wig from this Taobaopit Avant Garde Cosplay and there are very good, so BUY IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Daenarys Stormborn kaleesi costume. I just had to fix the bangs to look more like her but it rocked! For the price I thought it might be knotted or something like so many of the cheaper wigs of mine were like but its smooth and neat just like the picture. And it still is after quite a few uses! Seriously its a great buy. If you&#x27;re looking for something for costumes or cosplay this it for you.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for with this.. creature of a wig. First off, it looks nothing like the picture. When I took it out of the packaging, I thought I pulled out a wig made of poodle. The curls were wild and tight, and the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; were terribly jagged and covered the top of the head like a bowl-cut. If you want a more accurate depiction, think Dog the Bounty Hunter. Brushing or de-tangling the curls would be a terrible idea, as there were a lot of hairs falling off the cap just from handling the wig. You can most definitely see netting as well, as the hairs are sparsely sewn. By all means, if you want this wig as a gag or wacky Halloween costume, go for it. But for what I need (Blackcat cosplay), this was nothing I had imagined it would be.</li>
    <li> Worst wig I have ever had .. it is thin and shows tracka ll through the the top in addition they sent a BLACK  WIG CAP which shows through a stark white with. if I hav&#x3D;d paid more than $8 bucks for this I would be so pissed. cheap cheap deal ..awful.</li>
    <li> Great for my costume, good quality, recommend is super real hair. They were delighted at the party with my hair</li>
    <li> The wig I got was for a child or something. Even fully loosened it didn&#x27;t fit my head at all and I don&#x27;t have a big head. Normally wigs fit me just fine. If your getting this I recommend making sure it&#x27;s a women&#x27;s size! And keep your package and receipt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really pretty wig though. TT-TT</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for Halloween because I was in love with it from the picture. The first time I ordered it, it was being sent from the actual company in Korea (I believe) but never arrived. Amazon gave me a refund and since it was now available from prime, I ordered it again. It is definitely not like the picture. It is cheap and only for Halloween so I am going to try and make it work. Unlike some of the other reviews of the bangs being too short, mine didn&#x27;t have any at all so I&#x27;ll have to make my own. It is very thin and you can absolutely see the stitching. Might not be too bad if they used white to sew it instead of a cream color. If it&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re looking to wear on a regular basis, you might want to look for something of better quality. For a one time thing like Halloween or cosplay, it will do the job. Just remember, you get what you pay for with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length. I will never wear this wig :(</li>
    <li> As a longtime cosplayer, this is not the quality of wig I would normally use. It is true to it&#x27;s cost, and somewhat untrue to the picture. If you are expecting to receive what&#x27;s in this picture, keep looking. It&#x27;s curly, and coloured a shiny, silvery white. It does not have the platinum tint seen in the picture, nor is it anywhere NEAR as long as it seems. It&#x27;s actually very short, slighty past my shoulders, and I&#x27;m about average height. It&#x27;s also thin, and you would see a wig cap underneath it. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed with it, as it&#x27;s cost is about right for the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than maybe a cosplay photo shoot.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to pull the tracks off and add white highlights to another wig. The spacing of the wefts themselves seem like they would cause some problems with the cap showing if I wore it on it&#x27;s own. The color and style are lovely, it&#x27;s very soft and the cap itself seems quite sturdy- I&#x27;ll be saving it for another project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping only took about a week, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product I got for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it! I got it before it was to be delivered which was nice and I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my head.</li>
    <li> Looked terrible on me.  This is extremely white.</li>
    <li> Too thin on top, you can see wig netting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty, though I can see the webbing in three different spots while its on, it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
    <li> The wig I received is absolutely nothing like what is shown in the pictures (by the seller and customers)  The curls are nothing like what it is the picture, they look like a bad perm, by simply finger brushing the curls out to separate them, it frizzed. It is incredibly shiny and feels extremely plastic, like a wig you buy at a Halloween store.  There are no adjustable hooks/straps, so if you have a smaller head, I am sorry. Also, the netting of the wig can be seen. It also does not resist high temperature heat as said, it started to crinkle and frizz the moment I touched it with my flat iron on the LOWEST heat. Finally, I didn&#x27;t get a wig cap. I was really disappointed because I actually ordered a wig VERY similar to this one in a wine color from the same seller and it&#x27;s beautiful, absolutely perfect. But this white wig is just sad. If I haven&#x27;t returned it, it&#x27;s because I desperately need it for a con and I already started styling it to make it look somewhat better.</li>
    <li> ...And I absolutely love it. I am an avid wig fan, and I was very pleased to open this up on my birthday! Taobaopit never fails to please me with their wigs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This wig went to about my shoulder blades, in very pretty, loose curls. The bangs can be parted in the middle without looking odd, but I am sure that they would look nice if you wanted to part them all to one side, or even cut them into a fringe. That&#x27;s the nice thing about these wigs, they are versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It tangles semi-easily, but that is to be expected with any synthetic wig of this length and style. Thanks to it&#x27;s short length, it is pretty easy to manage, and with a few youtube tutorials I managed to get it looking like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another thing, is that I have a fairly big head. Most wigs don&#x27;t fit very well because of this, but this wig fits a bit snugly, but perfectly. It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t slip around. And for you people with smaller heads, don&#x27;t fear! There are little elastic laces you can use to tighten it to fit your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very pleased with this wig!</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful color and very soft, but it is shorter than it seems to be in the picture and its not thick at at the top of the wig. You get what you pay for :/ I bought it for glados cosplay and it&#x27;ll be fine.I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll tangle tho  https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t1.0-9/p600x600/10500372_540379346085154_1592090706848868095_n.jpg</li>
    <li> super soft! like seriously SO SOFT. it styles with low heat. the only problem is that it is kindof thin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my wig. White hair has always thrilled me. Wish i was born with natural white hair &#x3D;/ oh well the wig will do. The only problem is after a while their maybe some shedding from the wig. like alot. &#x3D;/ lasted for a good month. Hope to find a better quality one that may last longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few wigs from this vendor and have liked them but this wig, the white one, seems to be the worst quality.  It&#x27;s made too thin so the mesh underneath is very visible, especially on top.  It should have about twice as much hair on it. Also, many of these wigs do not have the temple or sideburn sections like normal wigs do.  I&#x27;m not just wearing these wigs for play, I&#x27;m wearing them every day to work and really want them to look good, thick and striking.</li>
    <li> Looks great with a beanie, normally  it&#x27;s not so hard to tease the wig or make small changes in the way it lays, this one is kinda stubborn,  but I am still very happy with the overall  quality!</li>
    <li> Out of control, impossible to style, poor quality, and why is the cap yellow? Looks nothing but fake, not &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; Halloween fake, like horrible &amp;#34;Amanda Bynes&amp;#34; fake</li>
    <li> This wig is really WHITE!!! I opened the bag, and was like ...Whoa!! I tried it ,on right away.. and ,it looked so pretty! Not very realistic, bc of the color.. but, otherwise, is soft and very fluffy .. It does shed a bit , but, there is A LOT of hair, so no problem there! Hasn&#x27;t tangled all that much, yet.. I am going to try to get it to be less fluffy, bc it really is just a little much!! lol It feels so real and, I might even add some pink streaks to it, or baby blue.(with sharpies). Not sure,yet.. Overall, a gorgeous wig, and, I am very satisfied with this purchase...</li>
    <li> good quality, easy to take care of.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a costume and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a really cool color.</li>
    <li> We bought this wig as part of a Halloween costume for The White Queen (Alice in Wonderland). It was for my 12 year old daughter. It came after quite a while, shipped from Asia somewhere, but it was well packed and didn&#x27;t smell funny. It is a high quality wig, it even came with a hairnet/scull cap for your own hair to fit the wig better. I recommend this wig, you will not be disappointed by the quality for the price. It is not costume quality, it is much better.</li>
    <li> Really small and thin on top.  Great for an Elsa costume for a child but a bit small for an adult.  I used a lot of bobby pins but it was still tricky hiding my hairline all around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thin but otherwise perfect. I have a larger head (I guess) and long hair, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a wig that fits over my head and hair. This one did pretty well! You can see the netting a little bit on the top of the wig but not enough that it should cause a problem (unless you&#x27;re a real stickler for that sort of things or you have mean, super critical friends). Wear a white wig cap underneath it and you won&#x27;t be able to see a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Thin, a little see through, but overall good wig at great price. Soft &amp; Not super tangle-y. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Not only does it barely fit my head but its also a lot shorter than i expected. Pretty much disapointed</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never really bought a wig before, but it was necessary for my daenerys halloween costume. i chose this wig based off positive reviews and the affordable price. it took roughly up until the beginning window of the estimated time of delivery to arrive, so about 3 and half weeks i believe.&lt;br /&gt;again, i don&#x27;t really have any previous wigs to compare this one against but its overall fairly soft and nicely curled to work for my costume. the bangs, like another user mentioned, are a bit of a hassle to style how i need for my costume, but it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that the hair is sparse/flat at the top of the head. especially in the front near the forehead, as i am pinning the hair into a middle part, you can see the net of the wig....not a huge deal but it would have been near perfect had it not been for this downfall.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig! It completes my Storm costume. I would suggest ordering it alittle early because it does take some time to get there but it definitely worth the wait. Super soft too, not stiff like some others wigs. Im definitely going to order from them again!!</li>
    <li> As I got it I was very surprise how pure the color white was it is perfect for my cosplay costume Noire (Black Heart) from the Neptunia hyperdimension now I just need the clothes and their my cosplay is complete.</li>
    <li> I just bought this wig for my best friend, and we were both very excited when we received it, in perfect condition! It came in the mail pretty quickly, and when we opened the package, we were amazed at how soft and human-like the wig was. It wasn&#x27;t tangled, nor did it feel fake, and the wig was not overly shiny! The only problem we had was that after adjusting it for awhile, we still can&#x27;t seem to completely hide the bump of her hair, even with a wig cap. She has A LOT of hair, but I still feel that eventually we will figure out how to place the wig and her hair correctly, for a perfect appearance. Overall, we&#x27;re very satisfied with this order!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product for the price.  The color is spot on and it fits well.  You can see through the wig, but I&#x27;m just going to wear a tan wig cap.  Also the front of the wig is a tad weird, but I&#x27;m just going to trim the front and work it.</li>
    <li> Besides being very affordible, the wig came in very early and it&#x27;s beautuful.  It looks exactly like the photo, it&#x27;s bouncy, and soft.  The bangs are pretty long but, usually with cosplsy wigs, they are going to be long.  So if you are wanting bangs you may need to cut it a little.  I&#x27;m very happy with this and I hope this review helps others. :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE WIG! It&#x27;s so beautiful! O: I wish it came in a pink but that&#x27;s okay. I can&#x27;t wait to dye the tips red for my Halloween costume x3</li>
    <li> The wig for the price was great. I regularly buy $40+ wigs, but needed this for a costume ASAP. It&#x27;s thick enough that I could straighten it with hot water, but it would&#x27;ve been nice if it was a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 5 start though is because again, for the price, it&#x27;s all you could ever want. Your hair doesn&#x27;t show through, it&#x27;s a decent size around the head (if you have ever worn a South Korean wig, you understand the problems I mean), and it comes fast. If it&#x27;s for a Halloween party then it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have more time, I&#x27;m more than likely going to purchase a better quality wig, as I need to style it and then the wefts show through. But for falling flat, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Wow! (White) Wig is awesome. I have several of these wigs for cosplaying, the white is my favorite so far. It is well styled already and very soft. Plus I love how well it covers my very dark brown hair so you cannot tell at all</li>
    <li> It is the most beautiful wig I have ever seen for an amazing price. Got lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it looks not real; but it had a wonderful feel - way better than the $20 ones from the party stores. This is more like a real thing, it feels soft to the touch and it does not tangle up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head-cap that comes with it is black, so I purchased a skin color one. If your hair is very short and blonde: This perfect for you! My hair is very, very black, silky and very long... So, I had a hard time trying to hide all the &#x27;dark hair&#x27;... But, probably it was my lack of experience too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the wig has a great full-body, and it hid the dark hair I could not completely tuck in! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried to comb or wash it yet, but it looks like you can do both and still have it looking perfect! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore a sterling silver headband on it, and it looked so pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might buy it in different colors too! Beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this wig for more than just cosplay so I decided to break it in a little bit. The hair is a bit thin at the top but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal. Hair is nice and soft. The wig does tangle a bit, but I sprayed some detangler just to see how well it would work, and I was able to work the curls to a point where they&#x27;re easy to brush but still look nice and curly. I dropped the wig on accident after brushing it out thoroughly and it landed it a big pile of curls.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely manner and was neatly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I had previously thought the wig cap it came with was ripped, having never had the ones with the hole in the top, but soon found out this wasn&#x27;t the case; it was supposed to be that way. My review has been moved to five stars.</li>
    <li> Very good, I was worried it might be poor quality due to the price but it was well made and pretty full, no bald or thin spots. The hair is way softer then I expected. Very adjustable too. I would use this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Tangles very easy.  Very thin and not very durable.  Is only good for a few hours before becoming a tangled mess!  I don&#x27;t recommend it and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> As expected this WI is fabulous, curls nicely,not as nice as I wanted but I can easy wig that. The net shows if parted in the.middle, keep in mind that, my product was lost in the mail,but I contacted the company and they quickly and very politely helped me re sent it with a tracker and a cute gift. I wont hesitate to do business with them again.</li>
    <li> WOW I was quite impressed when this wig came in. It&#x27;s a REALLY good quality wig for the price we paid. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. Its not shiny like the &amp;#34;halloween&amp;#34; wigs you buy from party city or halloween express. Too bad i have a lot of hair so even with a nude wig cap, you can still see my black hair through the wig cap through the wig lol. Gave it a 5 star because it was nicely put together and shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a toy for a child and still did not last long enough for even &#x27;play&#x27; usage.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, and it&#x27;s pretty legit. It&#x27;s not the best but is not the worst.</li>
    <li> This product made me look like an old women.  Not flattering at all.  Very White.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Has a part in the hair and is adjustable in the back with straps and hooks I get lots of compliments on this wig</li>
    <li> I cant believe the quality for the price, I used this wig for Halloween, everyone complemented my wig it looks expensive and longer in person</li>
    <li> Recived quite a few compliments with this wig. I used it for my Storm costume. Given the price I was surprised at the quality. Very minimal shedding and the cap was nice and tight and had adjustable straps inside. Will be ordering more wigs from this seller.</li>
    <li> It gets tangled really easily, the hair is very shiny.</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft to the touch and for the price, is pretty close to real hair. The wig is styled just like the picture, in soft curls, and was in good condition when it arrived. Wig cap is very flexible, lots of wigs won&#x27;t fit me, but this one adjusted perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very awesome,  great product!</li>
    <li> The wig was not what I had hoped for.  I could see bare patches and my hair bled through unless you were wearing a hat to cover.</li>
    <li> While the wig was both beautiful and silky soft, it did not cover my head well and stay on even 15 bobby pins. Being that I wear the same size hat as my 5 yr old son this is not good. It should have fit better than that. Fit was so poor that it made the wig completely unusable. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a class play.  Only problem was it easily slips off a child&#x27;s head.  We secured it with bobby pins and it stayed on.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a 5 star wig, this is not it. I rated it 5 stars because of the value -- for the price this is excellent. As other reviews stated the wig is a little thin on top, and I think the color is a little too &#x27;grey&#x27; (as apposed to a sexy platinum). But over all it fits OK, it looks and feels very nice and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Beautiful white color! Can&#x27;t wait to use it for one of my running costumes!</li>
    <li> it did not fit, it was layered terribly, its NOT syntheitc and its a cheapy halloween store wig. totally not worth your money.</li>
    <li> The wig is exactly what I was expecting.  Taobaopit was pleasure to work with, I had a problem and emailed them, they got back to me quickly and more than fixed the problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again.</li>
    <li> great for cosplay but unless your a kid its far to small. i have a smaller size head when it comes to wigs and this hardly even stay on because the cap is far too small. would not buy unless its for a kid or it will slip right off</li>
    <li> Hair not as long as expected. I bought this for a cosplay, and unfortunately the hair only went to my shoulders. I&#x27;m fairly tall- 5&#x27;9, but I thought it was going to be longer than shoulder length. It&#x27;s a great shade of white though, and comes with the wig cap!</li>
    <li> Got two of these for my granddaughters for their make shift Frozen costumes. They loved it!  The price is right.  Hours of fun!  Well worth it for what it Is. Will buy again from the company. Thank you for keeping the price down.</li>
    <li> it was nice on top but on the ends it a bit thin.. it is the first time I purchase a wig so was unsure how the ends should be the are kind of flimsy to give the bouncy feel. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t look good on me I have a heart -round -shape face... the bangs didn&#x27;t fall on me like the picture.. but I was impressed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig on Dec 20th and it arrived on Jan 4th, in perfect condition, exactly as advertised!  The wig is high quality synthetic fiber, easily adjustable, comfortable to wear and moves like natural hair.  The price on such a quality item is amazing. I could not be happier with my purchase, and love the gift the seller tossed in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing the bulk of my wigs from Tao Bao PIT in the future.</li>
    <li> Cheap and bare. This is the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Bought for a costume but it was too embarrassing to pull it off and look right.</li>
    <li> While somewhat comfortable to wear, you could see the netting under the wig, especially in the back. I put it on and had my mom look it over for me and she pointed out that the netting was visible. I compared it to my other two wigs(With help from my friend) and she and I bother agreed that is feels like a wig you would get from Walmart on Halloween while my other wigs(A brown wig and a purple wig) actually felt real and you couldn&#x27;t even see the netting. It was frizzy when I got it out of its bag as well and remained that way even though I tried to style it a bit to cover the netting and lessen the frizz. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> The wig was so thin and and just a giant poof.... I had to cut it to my shoulders and use wig curlers and curlers and still is terrible I tried to color it and it just made it worse do NOT buy</li>
    <li> I like to wear wigs sometimes to change my haircolor because i dont really like the idea of dying my natural hair so i started by&lt;br /&gt;buying a costume wig from halloween adventure awhile back and i noticed that it had some spaces showing though the wig on the top and it got very messed up easily and i was disappointed but then i decided to shop online for wigs instead and&lt;br /&gt;then i found this wig its very soft to the touch and looks amazing and it has no spaces that you can see on the top i highly recommend this! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> This item was slotted to arrive at the earliest at July 9th, but arrived June 27th. The material is super soft and doesn&#x27;t have the shine that a lot of wigs tend to have that makes them look fake. I was able to test it right out of the package with minimal brushing and it looked amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price. It fit nicely on my head, the hair was somewhat soft for wigs and it curled beautifully. I think the one complaint I would have with it is the fact that the top of the wig seems to be sparse on hair. You can see the mesh of where the hair was woven on the wig.    [...]  Here&#x27;s a picture with me and the wig on (lol yes I&#x27;m a cosplayer. I&#x27;m cosplaying Daenerys Targary)en</li>
    <li> I got this wig to be Black Cat and I love it!!! It has an almost natural feel to it and has the ability to be managed/combed styled. The head band is adjustable and sits well (I have a large head)</li>
    <li> This is a pretty 100% pure white wig.  Just note that the hair on top is flat (not fluffy).  If you comb all of the hair on top, then you cannot see the cap underneath.  However, if you shake the wig so that hair clumps up in places, then you can obviously see the light colored cap underneath.  So, you will probably want to also wear a white nylon wig cap underneath, which are almost impossible to find in brick-and-mortar stores, but I was able to easily purchase from MayaBeauty here at the Amazon Marketplace.  Just search for &amp;#34;BT Stocking Wig Cap White&amp;#34; at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Real hair!!! Wear all the time most people don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s a wig!!</li>
    <li> My Mom has white hair. Yes it&#x27;s natural. We have searched everywhere for a wig that would come close to her natural color. SCORE! This is well made. Seriously great quality. It is superior to her special order $450 wig. The only adjustment was to the bangs.. she is wearing not cosplaying(haha) Hair is full and soft and holds up. The curlys spring right back after being brushed.</li>
    <li> Took long to receive but good for price</li>
    <li> Holds up well, I got two and 1 was much longer( supposed to be 28 inches, one was maybe 18 the other was 28)  and thicker (the other you could see the wig cap) than the other... So keep that in mind when you order, it&#x27;s kind of a gamble. I just pulled wefts out of one and sewed them into the other. I&#x27;ve used heat and they didn&#x27;t melt, so that&#x27;s a plus. Had them for 8 months and still holding up well... I would buy two though, just to be on the safe side.</li>
