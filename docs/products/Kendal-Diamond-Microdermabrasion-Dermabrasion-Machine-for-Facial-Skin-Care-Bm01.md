      <li>bought this model because I liked the case which looks really nice</li>

      <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>At 70, I now have the best complexion since my early teens and it&#x27;s getting better.  </li>

      <li>and I have a healthy grow.  </li>
      <li>This will give a better end result.</li>
      <li>The suction is mostly there for keeping the skin suctioned and in contact with the tip as it glides across the skin.</li>
      <li>I really love this machine.  </li>
      <li>I think it would be great for people who need touch ups between appointments, but not for real results.  </li>
      <li>all in all, this is a review of the product and i am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I have been doing microderm for more than 10 plus years and used the hand held face exfoliator for a while</li>
      <li>I was glad I did.</li>

      <li>So after they sent me a return shipping label, I sent the machine back and they sent me a replacement machine that works perfectly!  </li>

      <li>The entire set is very nice!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best purchase I have made for myself in a very long time.  </li>

      <li>Price was fair and delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a dummy, I&#x27;ve owned microdermabrasian machines before and they are quite easy to use.</li>

      <li>I would not recommend for a beginner or someone who has never had a microdermabrasion as the suction is so strong.  </li>
      <li>Over all, I pleased with the product and specially the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure how roughing up the skin with a &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; will help. No positive results.  And not sure I want to continue with it.  Might sell it on line.  The machine is built very well.  I like that.</li>
    <li> This product does not have any real suction... like for real. I used to have pmd and it worked good/ok but this device its big with no suction, its a joke! I usually don&#x27;t complaint about my product... but come on!</li>
    <li> I got and returned this - It works... I guess. It seemed a little big and bulky for my taste. I got the [[ASIN:B00C2BRR5Q Riiviva Microderm]] because I still wanted to be able to do microdermabrasion at home - it&#x27;s cordless and uses Diamonds, though, a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a dream come true for me.  Mine has great suction and I can&#x27;t believe how much the filter collects.  I love being able to use it on my legs, arms, neck and chest.  I would never be able to afford to have all those areas treated in my aesthitician&#x27;s office.  My skin is so soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> I have used this machine about 4 to 5 times and it really leaves my face clean and smooth. I suffer from acne scars and I know results will take a while to show, but all my family seems to notice changes in my skin already so im happy with it. Just make sure not to be too harsh since redness can occur.</li>
    <li> I did extensive research prior to purchasing this machine because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to choose from all the machines out there and wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work compared to the ones they use in salons, but I&#x27;m happy to say that this machine does the job.  I was a bit upset at first since I was excitedly awaiting the arrival of my machine but found it wasn&#x27;t working when I received it.  However, the seller responded quickly and sent me a replacement AC adapter-still didn&#x27;t work. So after they sent me a return shipping label, I sent the machine back and they sent me a replacement machine that works perfectly!  Keep in mind that the seller is shipping from New York- I live in California so it took 5 days to receive via UPS Ground (not too bad if it help keeps the price down)&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is pretty light (about 7 lbs) outer dimensions of machine are about 9.5\\&quot; x 7.5\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;, it&#x27;s very basic and easy to use which you&#x27;ll appreciate since the instruction manual lacks detail.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to use too strong of a suction or you could really damage your skin and this machine- HBM01 has a suction power up to 22inHCG (56 cmHG) which is more than enough for face, neck &amp; hands- which is what I use it for. There&#x27;s no way to know exactly how much suction pressure is being applied since this machine does not come with the dial plate which indicates real-time pressure but I practiced on my hand at first until I got the gist of it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to used the dial more than half way up.  I usually keep it at about 50-65 degree angle which is a little less than halfway on the dial which just looks like a basic volume dial.  I did go a little overboard the other day, I couldn&#x27;t stop (this could get addicting &#x3D;P) and my husband said my face looked a little burned.  Even though I used it on the same setting as usual, I went over my face more than I should have.  I would suggest going over one spot of your face no more than three times, then STOP!! or you could take off too much skin and could look sun burned.  It took about 2 days to heal and redness to go away- lesson learned!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results and so is my husband.  He&#x27;s had 2 treatments in the past 2 weeks and his sun spots have been reduced by about 30%, my husband does it himself- it&#x27;s that easy.  I&#x27;ve gotten better results on this machine than when I went to the salon.  I used to go to the salon every other month and paid $95 + tip or $800 for 10 treatments.  Granted, they do other treatments for you but my what I really went for was the microdermabrasion.  Now I can do 2 light treatments a week and get better/faster results since I do it more often my wrinkles are diminished and my face is so smooth.  I was getting little bumps on my face and they are 95% gone! Between my husband and I, we&#x27;ve used this machine 6 times, so I&#x27;ve already made my money back. Not to mention how your face will absorb makeup and lotions better so you&#x27;ll find you don&#x27;t have to use so much! Definitely a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this model because I liked the case which looks really nice and it&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Dermabrasion done by professionals. However  this is pretty good and so much cheaper. Great results. Everyone ask &amp;#34;what are you doing different?</li>
    <li> This machine does exactly what it claims to do. Its easy and convienant to use and very well made. I researched differant makes and models and I am very pleased I settled on this one! Not to mention it makes your skin look and feel like new! I can not tell the differance between the results from this machine and the ones Ive paid a lot of money having done in a salon! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this machine because of great  feedback from others, however mine didn&#x27;t last a month. It lost suction after second use. Additionally the tips are not diamonds but some cheap metal, with a rough finish. Really not something i appreciate scratching my face with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I returned the machine and I am waiting on some great cistomer service. I hope they don&#x27;t dissapoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CAn&#x27;t wait for resolution ...</li>
    <li> REALLY A GREAT MACHINE-I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL AND WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING PORTABLE. THIS MACHINE WORKS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I purchased this machine a few weeks ago and have used it 4 times on myself and a few times on family members. IT IS AMAZING! My skin is completely transformed. I had some fine lines under my eyes, fine crows feet, some hyper pigmentation in places, some mild acne, enlarged pores and blackheads on and around my nose, acne scars, and the beginnings of some feathering around my lips. The feathering, pores and blackheads, crows feet, and any trace of blemishes are completely gone already. My skin looks and feels amazing - it&#x27;s bright radiant and looks almost airbrushed. I have given my sister 2 treatments and she looks 5 years younger already. This machine has already paid for itself twice over. Honestly, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I&#x27;m 31 and I have always taken great care of my skin and this machine has become and will remain a fabulous addition to my skincare regimen.Totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Love this machine. It&#x27;s great for home use.</li>
    <li> I had read all the mixed reviews on this product and had also researched microdermabrasion machines and how to use them for several weeks prior to my purchase. I no longer wanted to pay to go to a salon to have this treatment done, and decided to try this machine. First of all the items are neat, clean,, packaged properly, everything was included in the package as described by the booklet/instruction manual (except for the two small extra fuses). There was much debate on here about the power of the suction. The suction is absolutely more than adequate. I only turn the knob to about the half way point, any more than that is too much. The entire set is very nice! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The actual machine is great in regard to suction, looks, and performance.  Initially, I bought it in hopes that it would help with small little whiteheads around my mouth and chin.  The first two times that I&#x27;ve used it, I broke out really bad.  Now I&#x27;m not sure whether I broke out because I&#x27;m pregnant, &#x27;purging&#x27;, or the whole process just breaks me out.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it once a week then update with final results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving this initial Review after having received my second machine after the first one had a structural defect. What I did want to get out there is that they issued me a refund (They didn&#x27;t know I was going to buy another one), before the product had even made it to them. I was so impressed by this that, despite the disappointment of a non-working Christmas gift and hassle of shipping this time of year, I got right back on and gave them my business. The second one arrived in proper time and intact. I&#x27;ll update after using this.</li>
    <li> I saved ~$50 in purchasing this Kendal machine instead of Diamond Microdermabrasion Portable Machine NEW SPA HOME.  At first, I was hesitated in buying this one since there is no review anywhere about it (not even from YouTube, this may be a new model). I compared this Kendal machine with the NEW SPA HOME machine and learned they are pretty much the same, except their prices. And I am glad that I took a risk in purchasing this Kendal as I saved money and it works great. It also came with 360 cotton FILTERS which can last a long time, depend on how many treatments that you have.  They even have instruction for each Diamond tips which I like since I am not a skincare professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kendal machine has great suction if you allow 3-5 mins for it to warm-up. I started with a low-minimum power(haven&#x27;t tried maximum power yet). So far, I tried on my face, arms, armpits, legs, knees and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin it got out of me...ewww!  My skin is softer and brighter.  My husband noticed my skin is glowing and asked for a facial treatment.  I was surprised when he asked as he never asked for a skincare treatment from me before. He loves it and can&#x27;t wait to have another treatment in 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t imagine how much we&#x27;d have to pay if we get those treatments done at the spa.  The last time I paid for a microdermabrasion at a spa was $60 plus tips, that&#x27;s only for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope this machine will last a very long time and I will try to take good care of it.  It&#x27;s my baby now.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot. suction is good. i have &#x27;tough skin&#x27;, nothing reddens or damages it much, including chemical peels. while i wish it was a bit more aggressive, it should be more than enough for most people. i can&#x27;t attest to how long the diamond tips last just yet, and i do wish there was a rougher one, but my skin&#x27;s tolerance is exceptional. this will indeed replace professional salon visits</li>
    <li> extremely poor suction power.  I cannot recommend product. However, I still haven&#x27;t found the quality that I am looking for at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> It really helps your skin look fresh and renewed. I use it once a week and could tell immediately that it works. All the acne scaring has almost disappeared along with some discoloration. Very happy with my results and its a lot less expensive then a professional and you get the same results. Try it. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Easy to set up and use. Lots of filters included. Have already seen improvement in the tone, texture, and dryness of my skin. All for less than the cost of two salon treatments, good value!</li>
    <li> GOOD, JUST OKAY, BOUGHT THIS, NOT REAL STRONG ON FACE, GAVE AWAY TO A FRIEND, AND BOUGHT A STRONGER VERSION..THAT I LOVE</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and I can already feel the difference. I suffer from acne so i always have lumps all over my face, not to mention scars. But his product has done alot for the first time. My skin is so smooth. It may leave redness but all depends the speed you set it up to which is easily can be switched from high to low or vice versa. The only thing is that I didnt see that there&#x27;s a filter between the hose and the connection to the box so some extra money will be spent for replacement. Over all, I pleased with the product and specially the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great little machine.  I would not recommend for a beginner or someone who has never had a microdermabrasion as the suction is so strong.  You need to play with the suction to see what works for you.  I have been doing microderm for more than 10 plus years and used the hand held face exfoliator for a while but those little tools just break after a year.  This is more professional style equipment and I love the little suitcase in comes in and the attachments.  I love that I can use the smaller attachment for areas around my nose and the larger attachment to use on my forearms and hands.</li>
    <li> Price was fair and delivery was fast. I just have not tried it yet. It came highly recommended and I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it is supposed to. Fades my scars. Notice changes every week I use it. I strongly reccomend this if your complexion needs help.</li>
    <li> If you take care of it, it will take care of you. Remember to always sterilize all your metal components, never leave it uncleaned, always clean out after every use with hot boiling water. The pressure system and the diamonds tips do their job, you can manage how strong it can go and by far i have not gone to any other spa or dermatologist in months because of this baby, even my kids say that my skin looks cleaner.</li>
    <li> Returned.  Too complicated.  Don&#x27;t both unless you have oodles of time.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product, I read lots of reviews positive and negative, decided to give it a try.  I was unfortunately  disappointed.  The suction power really isn&#x27;t there, after getting  professional treatments for the past couple years due to my hyper-pigmentation from acne breakouts I know what a Microdermabrasion treatment should do and feel like.  It is user friendly and quiet.  But if you are looks for results this is not for you.  I think it would be great for people who need touch ups between appointments, but not for real results.  Overall I was disappointed and needed to return it.  I wish I would have spent an extra 50-70 dollars on a more expensive machine with more power. But I will be sticking to the professionals from now on.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, after one use my skin felt soo soft! I will combine this with chemical peels and cant wait to see the results...I am 45 and have a lot of sundamage, acne, and some pretty deep forehead lines, of course the deep wrinkles are still evident but the difference in texture and appearance are evident. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My skin has nvr looked this good. Even my mom said my skin has nvr looked this clear. Does wonders.</li>
    <li> garbage. had no suction after 2 uses,  returned mine and thankfully got a refund. Did not even come close to performing as its described.</li>
    <li> Looks great but the vacuum it not strong.. Very disappointing .... I should have chose another brand..</li>
    <li> This might be fine for younger people but at my age it didn&#x27;t work and was too abrasive for my skin.  I wish it had.</li>
    <li> Hi every one my name is Ronnell and for years I suffered from age spots and hyperpigmentation etc. I searched every where for any kind of creams and treatments and finally I found this machine the first day I started using it my skin became brighter smoother and look more healthy. And for the price it&#x27;s well worthy it if u try it I know you&#x27;ll like it looking forward to using this machine to it fullest potential.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne or blackheads.  doesn&#x27;t do much at all</li>
    <li> It took me a long time to review the various microdermabrasion machines, but I finally chose this one based on the good price and great reviews. I am very pleased so far with the performance and results of this machine.This is a good value as you have the chance to use it on any area of the body. It is easy, convenient, and fun!</li>
    <li> BROKE WITHIN A MONTHS TIME TOO LATE TO RETURN PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 2 years now, and I try to use it at least every week. I am 43 years old, I look 35 and it only gets better. The more you use it, the better results you get. I learned how to handle it on my skin: sometimes I go light when my skin feel dry, sometimes I use it more in depth when I need to tackle some wrinkle getting deeper: in this case it will make my skin dull and dry for few days, then the new skin will come out and will be glowing, wrinkle free. And the device is still working great after all these years. I love it, I recommend it. Its a great quality device!</li>
    <li> i have received the product as ordered.  i have used it.  this is not a product that you have instantaneous results.  however, it has operated properly.  the product is not flimsy.  the&lt;br /&gt;attachments are not cheaply made.  when using the machine, it works properly and i believe that it will render the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for anyone that has had microderm abrasion, they will understand this.  this is a process of clearing away dead skin, hopefully eliminating areas where \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; can gather causing skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Complete let down.COMPLETE.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M 49...in the travel business...2,000mile trip...minimum...weekly.My appearance matters.&lt;br /&gt;I get run down...I wanted a facial kit I could  travel with...operate easily..I was initially excited to see how compact it was. Problem 1) instructions lack detail...pretty useless and not a single online video anyway (a clue) on how to use it THIS MODEL.  PROBLEM 2) IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK...tried EVERYTHING!! so..I check &amp;#34;troubleshooting&amp;#34; in the &amp;#34;instruction booklet&amp;#34;~ I&#x27;m reminded to check ALL connections, main power settings...and then I see, &amp;#34;EXCHANGE FUSE&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;WELL, flip back a few pages to the &amp;#34;accessories&amp;#34; page and what do you know?&lt;br /&gt;Two fuses that SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED....NOT IN THE BOX.&lt;br /&gt;Problem 3) Even if they HAD BEEN.AND.even after I contact the company and insist I receive them (WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND ANOTHER PENNY)..there are NO instructions on how to break into this rivet sealed metal box and replace a darn fuse.. $$175 n change after taxes...this is what you get!!! Oh yeah...IT COST ME $$ 350.00.  AMAZON charged me twice and couldn&#x27;t remove the charge b/c it was done over LABOR DAY weekend...I await that deposit as of this writing (Friday 9/5)..four days AFTER the holiday...As I complete this review..I think I&#x27;ll avoid the B.S. IM SURE to receive on requesting my missing fuses...and the frustration of trying figure out how to get inside the guts of this thing to replace it..&lt;br /&gt;A lot  of time...and money spent for a big letdown....Oh...if your still thinking of investing...they&#x27;ll want you to invest another 90.00 to sterilize your equipment after every use.. This is highly encouraged but never offered during initial purchase....mo&#x27; money~ mo&#x60; MONEY.. So pissed off right now</li>
    <li> It was an ok product if you are trying to rejuvenate your skin by removing dirt and oil from the surface only. I used it just a couple times and my face had a certain glow. However it does not have the suction capacity I was hoping to treat some deep facial blemishes I have had for several years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 4 times so far and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had any problems with it.  It is definitely effective at removing dead skin cells and leaving a light &amp;#34;pinkish glow&amp;#34; when done.  In combination with a good moisturizer, this item does well by me.  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can find at the moment is the directions booklet that comes with it.  It covers a number of models and isn&#x27;t written in good English, so it can be a bit confusing.  Two sizes of cotton filters are included with the kit.  But, I have yet to understand where the larger filter is supposed to be inserted.  Based on the directions, putting the filter where instructed to do so will not allow the item to work properly... nor will it fit in said location!  But, if common sense prevails, you can get this machine to work properly with little effort.  The instructions also direct you to any Youtube video that shows microdermabrasion procedures in order to show you how to use the machine.  A little &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; in my opinion.  In conclusion, thus far, the machine is good... the instructions... not so much.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. After 2 uses my fine lines are almost nonexistent. My skin is vibrant. My hyperpigmentation is diminishing.  I am sure that after a few more uses the pigmentation will decrease even more.  I contemplated for a few months thinking I didn&#x27;t need this machine.  Well, I was so wrong.  It&#x27;s the best purchase I have made for myself in a very long time.  I never ever write reviews, so that is saying alot for this machine.&lt;br /&gt;If you are contemplating this for yourself, the pros are that the cost is equivalent to one or two visits to the dermatologist.  It is very easy to use.  That&#x27;s it.  The results are amazing.  Easy directions, easy use.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;As for cons, well for me there aren&#x27;t any yet!</li>
    <li> Does a good job and has several extra pads. Before I was paying 100.00 dollars a pop at the dermatolagist. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician. I use professional crystal microdermabrasion machines at my spa. At first, I tried the heads from the middle row... these don&#x27;t work well... the suction just isn&#x27;t there. I was disappointed and almost returned the device., BUT I decided to try each head because I know depending on the shape or size, this can greatly change the suction. I was glad I did. I found that the ones shaped kind of like a funnel, the D100 &amp; D120 work GREAT! I have used this twice now and it seems to be just as effective as the one that I use on clients in my spa. I do keep the suction knob turned almost all the way, and halfway on my face. Its not a professional machine by any means, but very effective and gives the same result as the ones Ive used without all the mess from the crystals. I read a few reviews and as far as the one asking about .. scratching your face.. well, really.. isn&#x27;t it common since? Yes, these diamond tips are essentially just like sanding your face. The suction is mostly there for keeping the skin suctioned and in contact with the tip as it glides across the skin. Yes, it does suck away a little dry skin, but its real purpose is keeping a good contact between your skin and the tip, so its still important. If you keep the tip directly flat on the surface of your skin, you will feel a better suction as you move it across your face. This will give a better end result. I suggest after your treatment, apply a high quality organic face mask filled with antioxidants. This will give your skin a chance to cool down, calm any redness. Freshly microdermabrasioned skin will absorb ingredients much better, so use only quality skincare. I use Eminence, which we sell at our spa. The firming acai masque or the stonecrop masque are my favorite to use on clients right after a treatment. ALWAYS use an spf 30 or higher ,made for your face, anytime you go outside. Exposing microdermabrasioned skin to UV rays can cause hyperpigmentation and accelerate wrinkle formation.  I hope my review helps.ormation.  I hope my review helps.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected, wish the case was bigger to hold all the attachments instead of two boxes. Received the product in just a few days. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with product losing suction. After paying 60$ per facial at the spa I will save a ton of money being able to provide my own facials.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best purchase I have made this year. Ive never had microdermabrasion done before. Wanted to try it at a spa but the pricetag ($80-$120 per session) always dissuaded me. I saw this on here and thought, what would it hurt to try it in my own home? Im so glad I did. The package was delivered quickly after ordering. I found the instructions a little difficult to read but I got everything put together fairly easily. I have dry, acne prone skin. I also have a lot of hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and jawline. After I used it for the first time, the results the next day were incredible. My acne wasnt as red fading and my skin was oilier than Ive ever had. The next few days the acne was almost gone (all from being suctioned out!) I didnt use any product on my face for those days. After asking a few friends what to expect from a pro and their techniques, A week later I performed another session and the results were amazing. My acne was almost entirely gone and my fine lines werent as noticeable. After those two sessions this machine has paid for itself. I performed a session once a week for 4 weeks and now once a month. My complexion has never been clearer and smoother. I am in love with my machine! Im 41 and am very happy with my results!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!!!!!!! Just from first time I used it I see great results!!! My skin was so dry this thing saved me.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product after reading the reviews. However, it has NO suction. I&#x27;m not a dummy, I&#x27;ve owned microdermabrasian machines before and they are quite easy to use. It feels like I&#x27;m scratching my face with the tip of the wand..not good! The setting has to be on max for any suction to be felt...and the suction is very poor. I&#x27;ll be contacting customer service to see if anything can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set looks pretty, but works poorly. I&#x27;m highly disappointed I spent so much money for junk that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This does the trick for dermabrasion.  Hopefully it will save some $$ in spa fees.  Well made w/ lots of attachments and filters.</li>
    <li> Loved it! If you are into getting microdermabrasions at the salon, then this is a great way to save money. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The head pieces are great...they have a guide right on the box to let you know which headpiece is for what specific need (face, scars, nose etc...)&lt;br /&gt;* It comes with enough circular filters and extra accessories.&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is small which is perfect to store anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;* The suction is great for at home use and the dial is easy to turn.&lt;br /&gt;* Not noisy&lt;br /&gt;* Cost effective&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth skin ( Helpful hint:  Remember to use extra sunscreen after you microderm because you want to protect the new layer of skin from harmful rays.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* My only issue is that it came with two (one blue and one red) pieces which aren&#x27;t explained in the guide. I tried looking for it online as the guide suggested but the video didn&#x27;t show the same model. I assumed it was some type of filter so I attached one end to the microdermabrasion machine and the other end to the tube.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin looks refreshed and clearer within 3 days!</li>
    <li> I really love this machine.  It does exactly what it says it does and more.  There is nothing like giving yourself a facial at home.  In three weeks of use, I have erased the age shots from my face and I have a healthy grow.  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice for one&#x27;s individual beauty needs, Men or Women</li>
    <li> The instructions say that the rubber in the motor might get hard and require a one time 3-5 minutes of running for it to soften up and give proper suction. I&#x27;ve let it run for 10 minutes on two separate occasions, and have the same result, I have to turn the dial all the way up to even feel any suction from it. On lower settings it actually feels like it is pushing air out instead of pulling it in. The result is the same whether it is through the hose or you place your finger at the intake source on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the seller would respond within a few days for a solution, however after a week I initiated a return with Amazon and it is on its way back.</li>
    <li> it would be really nice if I knew how to use it! they don&#x27;t send you any instructions with it, so it has been sitting in my closet for 2 or 3 months! you would think for the price I paid for it,it would at least have instuctions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this machine four times only, but everyone noticed that my skin looks much&lt;br /&gt;better than before. The machine makes my skin glow and smoothed wrinkles. I&#x27;m 57 years old and I love this machine.&lt;br /&gt;Margarita Shapovalova - Leonid Soroka&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> I spent up to a year researching various diamond md machines.  Finally settled on the Kendal BM01.  The suction is great and the customer service from Shining Image was prompt when I contacted them with several questions regarding the machine use as I did not understand the instructions.  I recd a reply w/i 24 hours.  Also what amazed me was I counted each filter and found the large filters were 9 short, but the small filters were above the advertised amount.  I just mentioned that to them but did not expect them to send me 9 large filters in the mail.  But they did and it probably cost more postage to send then the cost of the filters.  I have used the machine on my face and body and also on friends and have had no problems; my skin felt so smooth afterwards and diminished teeny blackheads and also forced to the surface latent sebum trapped under the superficial skin.  After I use it I wash with hot soapy water, soak in a sterilizing bath and then place under a degerminator lamp for a few minutes to sterilize.  So I give the product and the company 5 stars.  I&#x27;m willing to answer any questions one may have at scotie@lanlink.net as I am definitely not a &#x27;fake&#x27; reviewer.  danielle</li>
    <li> The microdermabrasion machine is portable; i can carry it anywhere &amp; helps me become an ambulatory facial specialist. It really helps as a new business owner. I plan on purchasing a heavy duty machine later on with Kendal</li>
    <li> love it. gets rid of dead skin you can see it on the filters.  Makes your skin very soft and clear. Use it all the time</li>
    <li> I am updating from a previous post. I would not recommend this particular model because it has no suction on the lower settings. It has moderate suction on the highest setting and some may find this fits for what they need. That being said customer service worked with me and refunded my money. Maybe the next model up would have a better suction capability. I would be willing to try a different model.and again feel I should not be responsible for return shipping charges when the product I purchased does not perform as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to note that the wand heads are very rough, this is my first unit so this may be normal but I wanted to add the information.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I contacted Amazon yesterday regarding my concerns and the representative said they will reimburse my shipping cost…. I will update you on this process. I commend Amazon for their courtesty, however I feel the company should be responsible.&lt;br /&gt;PS: Here is an example of how the communicate to you. I did not edit this at all and this was the entire email:&lt;br /&gt;if we refund some money do you want keep this one?&lt;br /&gt;you know SF01 have best suction.&lt;br /&gt;we think we refund some money to you is our WIN-WIN choose.</li>
    <li> It leaves my acne skin smooth and soft worth to buy it to save $$$ and time for going to salon.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond tips work great and it came with a small tiny box plus seller ship it fast.</li>
    <li> I love my kendal works so good, i recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about getting it.</li>
    <li> the first one i got was defective and it did not suction at all, so i returned it.  the company was prompt with the returns. aside from this hassle, the new product i got was very nice and effective. instructions were a bit broken english, same as customer suport, but understandable. all in all, this is a review of the product and i am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I checked out many machines and decided on this one, mainly because one reviewer spoke of it getting rid of her forehead bumps. That was about two months ago. I over did it a little the first time - used too much suction and created a little sunburn effect.  At 70, I now have the best complexion since my early teens and it&#x27;s getting better.  I wish I had done a before and after picture.  Indeed, the bumps are almost totally gone.  My skin is smooth.  I&#x27;m using it on my neck and decollete as well, and I don&#x27;t have that old lady look on my neck anymore.  My pores have shrunk  significantly.  I also use it to smooth out my feet. I don&#x27;t know what I would do with the more expensive machines. They have accessories I would never use. The metal box this unit comes in is light, small, and holds all the heads and wands. When I travel, this goes with me. Through the years I&#x27;ve constantly done dermabrasion, Glycolic acid, laser, and all the pore cleansing and extraction treatments. The trick is, I never did those treatments twice a week. The treatments cost me a fortune, but no more. This is a wonderful gift I have given myself.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It works really well and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that I cannot find the instruction for cleaning (cleaning the machine if necessary).&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether it needs a cleaning or not. The cleaning instruction of the machine is nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;I only clean the diamond tips and handle so far. I&#x27;m planning to search for more information and instruction of the product on other websites or on youtube.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and I can say that this machine works better than the one we had at school, with far less mess! Make sure not to turn it up too high. This baby has got some suction! Gave myself a hickey on my forehead on my test pass lol</li>
    <li> I love this machine. I&#x27;ve done 2 treatments 3 weeks apart and can feel a huge difference in my skin. never had a problem with the suction. I&#x27;ve had professional microderm before and the mid strength setting is perfect for me. my dermatologist friend came&lt;br /&gt;over to play with this machine and even she was impressed!</li>
    <li> Wonderful machine.....Terrific value .....and has very good power to it....</li>
    <li> I did not get a chance to use it. The mirror was broken and the contents looked used. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have not had any problems and it leaves my skin really smooth.I still have issues with acne but I will be put on accutane for that. The parts of my face that don&#x27;t have acne look really soft and pretty. The diamond tips are also a plus and work great.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted for Mothers Day the Microdermabrasion thingy that they are selling on TV.&lt;br /&gt;Went on line to the TV web site and seen the little plastic micro....... with 2 attachments and YOU can order filters on line, the cost was $250 . Looked up reviews on and it rated about a 1 of 5. (JUNK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this Kendal with cute 10 inch silver box, nine attachments, 2 wands, and lots of filters for $175 bucks.(total)&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it from Amazon, and it is fantastic, my wife loves the little box, the suction is adjustable from zero to extreme (half setting perfect).&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t leave the big machines on your sink, or the little units (crash) , but this is perfect to set it on sink, when you get done,  just store it under the sink or in bedroom.( the long hose and 2 wands fit in the silver box)&lt;br /&gt;This Mothers Day present is the best yet.</li>
