      <li>This is the cheapest price I have found for this cologne which I absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>and I receive many compliments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came on time and I love this scent.</li>
      <li>Not to overpowering, unless they cover themselves :-)  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The Warm Vanilla Sugar fragrance is a great smell for young girls.  </li>
      <li>Warm vanilla sugar is true to it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite stars love perfume, the taste is very strong, very fragrant!I quite like the sea, and</li>
      <li>I love this smell, it&#x27;s light and sweet.</li>
      <li>Super exotic fragrance, an excellent product, vanilla aromas combined with other mixtures makes it special, I recommend this product  .</li>
      <li>I saw that this product was recommended by heaps of people and was excited to buy it...</li>
      <li>Although it took longer than expected to arrive, this perfume is great.</li>
      <li>A hint of vanilla, but not to sweet.</li>
      <li>lasts quite a while on me but definitely isn&#x27;t as strong as it is when you first spray it, but it lingers and is niceeee</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong and too much can give off a chemical-smell</li>
      <li>the new bottle is cute as hell and the scent is pretty!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth my money.</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny</li>
      <li>Light fragrance with pleasant smell, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
      <li>Scent seems to last longer than most body sprays.  </li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely loves this!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Packaged well and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t get it 5 stars was because you get a strong alcohol smell in the air when you first use it.</li>
      <li>I really could not tell you.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it lingers and smells very yummy.  </li>
      <li>I would give a better rating but after 3 tries to get the order</li>
      <li>thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
      <li>But seriously..for those who enjoy low note fragrances and the Vanilla scent .. I would highly recommend this body spray.  </li>
      <li>it is subtle, yet it smells soo good.</li>
      <li>I bought it originally because I have a shampoo of the same scent, and wanted a basic perfume that didn&#x27;t contrast with it.</li>
      <li>Most have smelled like play-doh, very dull or faded too fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and lasts a while.</li>
      <li>It mostly goes away in a few minutes and the smell does last awhile.</li>
      <li>In cold and drizzly times, it feels cozy like a sugar cookie, but it&#x27;s floral enough that it feels right on a fresh, bright day too.</li>
      <li>Amazing compared to other vanilla sprays I have purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>even the brand new ones in the store shelves had the same stench.</li>
      <li>Finally ran out of my last bottle, and really miss it.</li>
      <li>WORTH THE TROUBLE.</li>

    <li> I really love the scent of vanilla, and this is a very warm, mellow variation.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it lingers and smells very yummy.  It&#x27;s also one of those scents that works well in all kinds of weather.  In cold and drizzly times, it feels cozy like a sugar cookie, but it&#x27;s floral enough that it feels right on a fresh, bright day too.</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to smell very nice.</li>
    <li> Very delicious fragrance but I wish it could&#x27;ve lasted longer, but still very nice!</li>
    <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
    <li> Great product at a very good price point.  I&#x27;d buy this again and would recommend it for the powder room.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest price I have found for this cologne which I absolutely love.  I am constantly told \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.  Well worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Finally ran out of my last bottle, and really miss it. If I don&#x27;t smell like vanilla, life isn&#x27;t the same. Have to reorder! Great product!</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING I WAS BUYING.DIFERENT FRAGRANCE.WAS GOING TO RETURN IT THEN DECIDED TO KEEP THEM.NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE.</li>
    <li> SO GOOD ...  Just like Warm Vanilla Sugar!  I walk around smelling and feeling like a cupcake!  lol  But seriously..for those who enjoy low note fragrances and the Vanilla scent .. I would highly recommend this body spray.  Scent seems to last longer than most body sprays.  Packaged well and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a very difficult time finding a vanilla body spray that either lasts more than an hour or smells like vanilla. Most have smelled like play-doh, very dull or faded too fast. Warm vanilla sugar is true to it&#x27;s scent. It&#x27;s soft and lasts a while. I sprayed a couple squirts on my wrist and 4 hours later, I still smell it. Amazing compared to other vanilla sprays I have purchased in the past. I love it. It smells wonderful on me.</li>
    <li> I would give a better rating but after 3 tries to get the order right I really could not tell you.  I am sure it is good but at this point I really do not know.</li>
    <li> the new bottle is cute as hell and the scent is pretty! lasts quite a while on me but definitely isn&#x27;t as strong as it is when you first spray it, but it lingers and is niceeee</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stars love perfume, the taste is very strong, very fragrant!I quite like the sea, and the price is very cheap.Really good ah.Will come again</li>
    <li> Came on time and I love this scent. It is one of my favorites.  It is always nice to get the product you want in good time and condition.</li>
    <li> The Warm Vanilla Sugar fragrance is a great smell for young girls.  Not to overpowering, unless they cover themselves :-)  My daughter absolutely loves this!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had this fragrance when I was teenager twenty years ago.  It still smells good.  Inexpensive, so I wear it on days I don&#x27;t want to use my expensive designer perfumes.</li>
    <li> I saw that this product was recommended by heaps of people and was excited to buy it... but when it arrived it smelled bland and boring, not what I expected at all. I would not be recommending this fragrance to anyone.</li>
    <li> Although it took longer than expected to arrive, this perfume is great. I bought it originally because I have a shampoo of the same scent, and wanted a basic perfume that didn&#x27;t contrast with it. It&#x27;s a bit strong and too much can give off a chemical-smell but people tell me all the time when I wear it that I smell like a cupcake. Definitely worth my money.</li>
    <li> Light fragrance with pleasant smell, not overwhelming. A hint of vanilla, but not to sweet. Great for all over spray.</li>
    <li> After using the lotion, I thought this would smell just as good. Nope.  This spray smells like a vanilla Tootsie Roll dissolved in Scrubbing Bubbles.  It&#x27;s not just the bottle I ordered, even the brand new ones in the store shelves had the same stench.</li>
    <li> I have always used this and will always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells wonderful and I receive many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received on time and no issues!</li>
    <li> Super exotic fragrance, an excellent product, vanilla aromas combined with other mixtures makes it special, I recommend this product  .</li>
