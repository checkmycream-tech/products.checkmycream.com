      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>It lathers okay...</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>I think this is a pretty good product, the smell is relaxing and fresh.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, so fresh and helps your skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh aroma.</li>
      <li>Will not leave a smooth feeling as you would find with olive oil based gels.</li>
      <li>Olive smells good, masculine enough and is a great way to start the day.  </li>
      <li>The scent is so clean, but I will not buy the jumbo size again because I do like to change scents from time to time.</li>
      <li>He likes the fragrance and the way it gets him clean.</li>
      <li>Does not lather as much as I wanted it to which required more to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the fresh feeling and the aroma.</li>
      <li>The gel lathers well and the clean and fresh scent leaves</li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised at the light, lovely smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty smooth.</li>
      <li>Feels good and you don&#x27;t have an over-whelming fragrance that makes you feel like a garden center.</li>
      <li>Fresh, unisex sent.</li>
      <li>my skin stayed soft and clean smell fresh</li>
      <li>First it was a gift to me at Christmas, then it was a gift from me, to me.  </li>
      <li>The olive scent is light - not too feminine, not too masculine.</li>
      <li>This is the first shower product that doesn&#x27;t cause him issues.</li>
      <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t have so much of it though!</li>
      <li>Very gentle and smells good, but the only thing is the pump that you may need 9 -10 pumps if you are a big guy.</li>
      <li>Other than that, a nice body wash.</li>
      <li>great for my dry dry skin</li>
      <li>Works very well on my Midwest skin.</li>
      <li>There is not as much olive oil in this as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>and I can wash my whole body.  </li>
      <li>I switched it out with a lotion bottle pump that fit it and puts out larger amount per pump.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean, not oily, and not dry.</li>
      <li>I really like this, makes you feel clean, not dry but not oily either.</li>
      <li>, after using it for a week, it&#x27;s substantially better than your typical drugstore brand body wash.</li>
      <li>It takes four to five pumps to get a decent amount out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Not really a true olive shower gel, mostly chemicals.</li>
      <li>Though it is big enough, it&#x27;s not as good as I thought because my skin is still dry after shower.</li>
      <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and it has a clean smell.</li>
      <li>Nice, delicate fragrance that is hardly apparent.</li>
      <li>I use it liberally and don&#x27;t be surprised when you do and there are no bubbles or foam -</li>
      <li>This product leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft anyway, but this enhances it and makes it easier to apply moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I gave this only three starts because the picture is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>oh so soft.  </li>
      <li>Given the price, I should not be too surprised.</li>
      <li>Olive Oil is near the end of the list of ingredients.</li>
      <li>last positive thing is that I do not have any major turn offs.</li>
      <li>I really prefer the shower gels at The Body Shop because they moisturize vs. leaving that dry prickly feeling of regular soap.  </li>

<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump,too small.</li>
<li> I was expecting an earthy smell or something like that, but this comes across as a slightly off floral scent.</li>

<li> Not sure how the scent got its name!</li>
<li> The smell is just not pleasant at all.</li>
<li> not great,</li>
<li> (I always seem to get some in my mouth, is anything but olive oil - difficult to describe but not pleasant.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when I got this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I smelled this at my daughter&#x27;s home and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy my own. The scent is so clean, but I will not buy the jumbo size again because I do like to change scents from time to time.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this was organic - it&#x27;s not! That being said, this is a nice shower gel. My skin has a tendency to get dry, and the olive oil in this definitely seems to help!</li>
    <li> I really prefer the shower gels at The Body Shop because they moisturize vs. leaving that dry prickly feeling of regular soap.  Olive smells good, masculine enough and is a great way to start the day.  I use it liberally and don&#x27;t be surprised when you do and there are no bubbles or foam - that&#x27;s The Body Shop keeping the nasties out of their products.  But everything works like it is supposed to and I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh aroma. It is invigorating and makes great lather.The lite scent stays with you.  A wonderful combination with the the olive body butter.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, neutral scent that my wife and I share.  It&#x27;s a great wash to keep around for guests as well, and the price is good for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Not really a true olive shower gel, mostly chemicals. Will not leave a smooth feeling as you would find with olive oil based gels. Would not recommend this. Does not lather as much as I wanted it to which required more to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.</li>
    <li> I gave this only three starts because the picture is very deceiving. You  DO NOT get both of these for the price, just the larger bottle. Amazon needs to learn how to ensure that these sellers stop deceiving their customers. Other then that complaint I think this is a pretty good product, the smell is relaxing and fresh. Doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> Given the price, I should not be too surprised. Olive Oil is near the end of the list of ingredients. It&#x27;s doubtful there&#x27;s much olive oil in here at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after using it for a week, it&#x27;s substantially better than your typical drugstore brand body wash. It leaves your skin feeling clean, not oily, and not dry.</li>
    <li> This product is the best ever for that all over feeling of softness. No drying or flaking of skin after your shower. The gel lathers well and the clean and fresh scent leaves you feeling refreshed and exhilarated all over! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First it was a gift to me at Christmas, then it was a gift from me, to me.  I enjoy the fresh feeling and the aroma.</li>
    <li> Best shower soap around.  Feels good and you don&#x27;t have an over-whelming fragrance that makes you feel like a garden center.</li>
    <li> My son has tons of allergies. This is the first shower product that doesn&#x27;t cause him issues. He likes the fragrance and the way it gets him clean. We&#x27;ll be purchasing this for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an earthy smell or something like that, but this comes across as a slightly off floral scent. Not a huge fan. Other than that, a nice body wash. I wish I didn&#x27;t have so much of it though!</li>
    <li> I love this product. i love that it is not tested on animals. that was the most important thing. the smell is refreshing and clean, not too strong. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I got this. The smell is just not pleasant at all. I tried to get past it because its such a big bottle to waste, but I couldn&#x27;t. Not sure how the scent got its name!</li>
    <li> Fresh, unisex sent. Moisturizing. Lathers well. Great value. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Okay...positives... You do get a lot of the shower gel for the price.  It lathers okay...not great, but okay.  Four to five pumps on my wash puff is enough for me to wash everything without reloading, so it should last a while.  It does smell nice.  It arrived as promised and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so positives...There is not as much olive oil in this as I had hoped.  That is part my fault for not reading the label before buying, but still... .  It takes four to five pumps to get a decent amount out of the bottle.  While it is much better than some gels I have tried, this still leaves my skin a bit dryer than I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last positive thing is that I do not have any major turn offs.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and smells good, but the only thing is the pump that you may need 9 -10 pumps if you are a big guy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Great company supporting good causes creating a great product.  Love the smell.  Works very well on my Midwest skin.</li>
    <li> Hydrating, great smelling, fair trade and very inexpensive. What else could you want?</li>
    <li> great for my dry dry skin</li>
    <li> I just got this today and let me just say it smells great! It makes me feel refreshed and there is no soapy residue left behind on my skin. The bottle will last me a while as well. You can&#x27;t beat the price! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great smell and moisturizing. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shower gel.  It smells divine and leaves my skin oh so soft.  I am a big fan of olive oil in bath and beauty products and this does not dissapoint.</li>
    <li> Though it is big enough, it&#x27;s not as good as I thought because my skin is still dry after shower.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin silky soft. My skin is soft anyway, but this enhances it and makes it easier to apply moisturizer. It is sufficiently concentrated, so it goes a long way. Nice, delicate fragrance that is hardly apparent. Will not interfere with your colognes if you wear them and it is perfect for people like me whose sinuses don&#x27;t like fragrances.</li>
    <li> I really like this, makes you feel clean, not dry but not oily either. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump,too small. I switched it out with a lotion bottle pump that fit it and puts out larger amount per pump.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Body Shop products and I especially love their shower gel. The olive scent is light - not too feminine, not too masculine.</li>
    <li> Lathers fine, four or five pumps into my scrubby and I can wash my whole body.  The smell and taste (I always seem to get some in my mouth, is anything but olive oil - difficult to describe but not pleasant.</li>
    <li> this gel leaves your skin feeling great and smelling good. Also took this with us to Jamacia and being out in the sun and salt water my skin stayed soft and clean smell fresh</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. However, the pump doesn&#x27;t give enough soap. The soap doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and it has a clean smell.</li>
    <li> I worried about the scent as I&#x27;m not sure I wanted to smell like my perception of olives.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the light, lovely smell.</li>
    <li> There is only ONE bottle for sale here. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture. But yes, it&#x27;s got a nice scent and it&#x27;s pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and also have problems keeping my mature skin moisturized especially in the brutal summer months, this shower gel used along with the body butter helps and is less costly then some of the better brand names...</li>
    <li> Love the smell, so fresh and helps your skin feel smooth.</li>
