      <li>The mild citris sent is great.</li>

      <li>I love the Vitamin</li>
      <li>I love this product - my husband and I both use it.</li>
      <li>Although, these oils tend to be almost in the end of the ingredients list, which I guess, makes the oils almost non-existent and more of a scent purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice and light, not greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just an ok moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than my $4 Olay moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After all the alcohols goes cocoa butter which is an awesome moisturizer, but a big no-no for those fighting with acne (don&#x27;t let</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
      <li>Enjoyable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s hurts a lot, made my face all red! i&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
    <li> As a first time user i was hoping to find a replacement to my old moisterizer which contains parabens and other toxins... i found the scent great, consistency very thick, however i cam only use it every three days or so because i will break out otherwise. I am not typically prone to break outs so i attributed this to the heaviness of the cream.</li>
    <li> Good organge scent but not strong. I think that this cream has never been absorbed, so white cast remains all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, i just put it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Have this delivered every two months love it</li>
    <li> hard to rub in and it leaves a residue. I don&#x27;t like the texture. it reminds me of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;this moisturizer is oil free, but not fat free. it contains cocoa butter, which is highly comedogenic. so not suitable for oily and/or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;greetings from germany!</li>
    <li> In general, I like the product. Again though, this is titled as an organic product but it says it is only 70% organic on the label, which I find misleading.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, organic or not. I have combination skin and it really gives me a balance. I started using it when I became pregnant, and believe it or not my skin has cleared up. I will continue to use it after. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> As many other recent reviewers have noted, they have changed the formula for this product to a much more runny consistency. Not sure if this is to save money or if it is a temporary thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still provides some moisturizing qualities but does not seem to be the level of the previous batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it 3 stars here as I don&#x27;t know if this is just a temporary thing or something dealing only with this product through amazon. I have used this product for years and I&#x27;m looking for alternatives (I may order one more time to see if this was a one off change or bad batch).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years on my face and neck.  I love the feel, smell, everything!  Highly recommend it AND it&#x27;s an environmentally conscious product.</li>
    <li> my skin looks so much firmer, brighter and youthful!!! you wont be sorry u bought this. i use it every night along with the eye serum. not greasy and smells great</li>
    <li> good product, delivery on time</li>
    <li> I kept hearing good reviews about this so I finally tried it. First of all, I didn&#x27;t like that it leaves residue. Secondly this might not even be the real deal. I started to think something was off when this irriatated my skin. It burned and turned red. I started to doubt the legitimacy of the product I ordered. The previous 1 star ratings confirmed my doubts. This has to be some type of horrible imitation.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Works great and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> As with the Renewal Cream that is too thick, this new formula is entirely too thin.  I like the old formula much better!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, only use a few times a week, but seems like it works pretty well. It&#x27;s kind of thin, definitely not greasy or thick. i actually wish it was a bit thicker. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this product - my husband and I both use it. It&#x27;s eco-friendly, not oily, and my skin always feels refreshed when I use it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but I think it&#x27;s causing blackheads on my nose, I never had them before</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I looked and compared many Vitamin C products and found this one to be the best. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly. I use it for my face especially around the eyes, neck, chest, as well as hands. There is a light fragrance which I love! It smells like a orange creamsicle popsicle® -super yummy; the scent does fade so it&#x27;s not overbearing. I will definetly buy this again and love the fact you don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it should last awhile.</li>
    <li> Both my boyfriend and I use this moisturizer-- it is non-oily and light under makeup and I find my dark spots are lightening up. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my face really soft. Is not too oily or thick like other facial creams. Easy to spread around and the soft smell is a plus. I bought this moisturizer because i had been using the vitamin C renewal cleansing milk for a while and really liked the product. I am not disappointed at all. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have allergies and sensitive skin and this cream does so well and leaves no sticky residue --absorbs very well too</li>
    <li> It has a great smell. I wish it had more moisture in it when you put it on your face.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, the formula has obviously been changed, for the worse. I&#x27;ve used this cream as a day cream for years and it used to be a regular face cream consistency. The most recent jar I received was so liquid-y that some actually spilled out over the edge when I accidentally tilted the opened jar. At first I thought I just received a frost-bitten batch or something, but now I understand that a &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; is to blame. And it&#x27;s not just the consistency, but I don&#x27;t think the performance is as good either. Not as moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Refreshing smell, good moisturizer. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I initially found it at Target, smells fantastic, light and refreshing, feeling moisturized all day....This was a fantastic discovery</li>
    <li> Very great moisture for my face</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Use it religiously.  Live in dry climate.  Does a great job moisturizing, but not oily, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Wish I could put it all over my body.</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin C cream for my face.  I mix the vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid to apply to my face daily.  Works miracles in clearing up scars and also makes your skin incredibly smooth.  Will continue to use it for as long as I am able.</li>
    <li> I was scared because I got super red skin, I used vitamin C before and had never had an irritation like this, after I read the comments  I realized they have added sodium lauryl sulfate and combined with vitamin C causes this effect on my face,  of course not all have the same reaccion, but that combination is very harmful</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin nice and smooth and not oily as it normally is.  I would definately recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  It sinks right in and does not have any perfume order to it.  She is 67 and does not look like it at all.  The cream draws moisture under the skin and makes her skin look smooth.  We usually buy 3 or 4 at a time.  She wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Though oil-free, it really moisterizes your skin. Has a slight citrus-vit C scent which I don&#x27;t mind. I can use it everywhere on my face, even the T-zone. Reasonable price and gives great results. My skin always looks good in spite of my middle aged skin!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It has made a great improvement in my complexion and the texture of my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different natural and organic moisturizers trying to find something that moisturizes without making me break out or irritating my skin. I have been using this for at least 3 years now, which is a record for me. It is very effective, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and has a wonderful but light orange scent which dissipates quickly. I hate it when beauty products are heavily scented, but I love the smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains no parabens, which is an endocrine disruptor many so-called natural products contain. Read labels!</li>
    <li> After having my second child and turning 30, my face suddenly was overrun by acne.  after struggling with my skin for 9 months and going to a dermatologist, I started using acne medications prescribed by my dr to clear it up.  Still I had a ton of dark spots left behind once the acne itself finally started to clear up.  Within a week of using this, I noticed my skin looking brighter and the dark spots fading.  Although its not the best moisturizer for dry skin, it still makes my skin look great.  A little pricey but worth it, and only takes a dabble at a time to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer line for a few years now and it is awesome!  The smell is wonderful!  I use this along with the cream products on face, neck and upper chest area.  My skin loves it ~ you can feel the difference and my skin just drinks it up! I am a huge Avalon Organics fan :)</li>
    <li> It feels great and smells even better!  I love the Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I add it to my glycolic cream for a great pairing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
    <li> What i ordered isn&#x27;t what they sent.I did not want the NEW oil free moisturizer. Do not like it and now i have to send it back.It isn&#x27;t expensive but isn&#x27;t what i ordered!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just an ok moisturizer. It smells lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than my $4 Olay moisturizer. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product- I was in desperate need of a new moisturizer and this was to be my solution. The vitamin C was what caught my attention along with &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34;. I find it extremely hard to believe that this product is oil free, because its thick consistency feels like it clogs my pores instantaneously. It is not a light moisturizer- more like a heavy cream. I recommend this to people with dry to normal skin, but NOT anyone with oily or combination skin. It also has a rather irritating, strong scent of oranges. I may end up using this as a body lotion, hoping I can abide the smell.</li>
    <li> smells great really good moisturizer. My skin is a little on the oily side and tends to break out. I would say this is a great moisturizer for the dry autumn, and winter months. I mist a little water on my face and apply a very small amount so it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. very nice smell!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream! My skin never looked so good.  I&#x27;m 64.</li>
    <li> Best face cream ever ever ever! Ill never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Oil-Free should be a give-away, and I should have known better, but if you have dry skin, this is not the moisturizer for you, as I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s not the moisturizer for me.  But some moisturizers just aren&#x27;t moist enough for me, so I try a lot of them.  This one left me itchy and tight-feeling.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order because light and air break down vitamin C and causes it to become unstable and break down. It had so many positive reviews, and a cheap price tag so I gave it a try. If your looking for a really good moisturizer...this is it... I use my own very stable... Paulas Choice Vitamin C serum... then use this as my moisturizer on top of it, before bed and in the morning, my skin looks fantastic. So as a moisturizer I think it&#x27;s a good buy, but if your specifically looking for a Vitamin C product (only)..... go elsewhere. Cindy</li>
    <li> I use this with the vitamin K cream but I also have used this on dark spots on my forehead from sun damage and it&#x27;s slowly healing the dark spots. Nice feel to the cream too and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after reading all of the reviews raving about it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be perfect if I had completely clear skin and just wanted a nice moisturizer for my face, but that&#x27;s not the case with me. My skin is acne prone and slightly oily and this lotion just made it worse. It feels heavy to me and leaves my face feeling super greasy because the lotion takes FOREVER to get absorbed.</li>
    <li> Really makes your skin radiate. One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I have super sensitive skin and this moisturizer is wonderful. No stinging. The mild citris sent is great. This is a good deal too. In our local grocery store they sell the same container for $25.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week or so, and not religiously.  I have very stubborn skin that requires a Salicylic acid cream, so I&#x27;ve been using this primarily on the weekends, or days when I wash my face multiple times and have an opportunity to apply different creams.  I love the scent, and the level of moisture.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion!!! Put it on after your shower before bed and your face will thank you. My Mom hates lotion on her face and I got her hooked! I love the smell!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a wonderful addition to healthy skin care! I get compliments all the time, but best of all, my skin feels great. I have combination skin and after years of hit or miss with various lines, I&#x27;ve found a combination that works great for me.  My pores are tiny with no build up! This moisturizer is rich and creamy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go for facials and invariably I&#x27;d come out red with that overly scrubbed look. Clean, but not cute! Now when I treat myself to a facial, aestheticians ask what I use! I come out relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORNING either getting ready at home or gym I use a Clarasonic with a delicate scrub head with&lt;br /&gt;Humphrey&#x27;s Organic Botanicals Moisturizing Cleansing Milk. It has Witch Hazel &amp; Jasmine built in. Avalon makes a milk based cleanser too, but I&#x27;m happy with my Humphries.&lt;br /&gt;Followed by&lt;br /&gt;Avalon Organic Botanicals Vitamin C Rejuvenating Oil-Free Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;And topped with a dab of&lt;br /&gt;La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleasing Towelettes, Night Calming&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Original Formula SPF 15</li>
    <li> Nice product, a little too orangy flavor and smell that lasts for a long time is the only drawback, mix it up with another moisturizer to diffuse the smell</li>
    <li> Still love this product.  I use this for my face and the Avalon Organics Eye Cream for my eyes -- seems to make a difference.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of these facial creams -- tried many -- I prefer plain Oil of Olay (original) plus this and the eye cream.  They seem to really help most with the vertical age lines that form around the mouth and on eye lids.</li>
    <li> Cream works well. It is absorbs into the skin readily. Package is sealed and is delivered on time. It&#x27;s oily, but not oily that you can&#x27;t clean it up once you are done. We have made several purchases and the only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is one time (of the 8 or so I have bought), the quality seemed to be difference.</li>
    <li> Helped reduce the appearance of wrinkles</li>
    <li> Does not absorb into skin. I notice it every time I washed with the cleanser that it was still on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for yeaaaaaaaaaaaarrrs.  Love it.  It&#x27;s light, yet moisturizing and smells very good.  I just want to mention that this lotion is best purchased at the store. I ordered online and one of the two that I ordered was very hard (dehydrated/old).  This also happens to the ones sold at store.  At least you can check the one at store before you buy.  I always open the lid and look inside.  You can tell what the texture is like without touching it.  If it looks hardened I give it to the store personnel to take off the shelf and buy the one that looks to have the right texture.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C cream is light and moisturizing.  Love it.</li>
    <li> First off, the ingredients list in amazon description does NOT coincide with the real one on the product package. Ingredients number 5 to 9 in this product are derivatives of alcohol, which explains why my sensitive skin feels kind of dry and taut right after application.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, those first ingredients have high comedogenic rating, that&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with acne-prone skin. After all the alcohols goes cocoa butter which is an awesome moisturizer, but a big no-no for those fighting with acne (don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; words on the product mislead you)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pity because the cream goes on smoothly and absorbs fast and the idea of the product is great... it has a lot of citrus oils which could make it a real holy grail for replenishing skin with vitamin C and boosting collagen... Although, these oils tend to be almost in the end of the ingredients list, which I guess, makes the oils almost non-existent and more of a scent purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are supreme moisturizing and anti-oxidant ingredients like green tea, aloe vera juice, vit E, cucumber peel extract in the same product, which is soooo hard to find nowadays. However my skin doesn&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s enough for proper moisturizing, perhaps because all the action of these good ingredients is canceled out by the alcohols in the beginning of the list.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this product to me.  I have sensitive combination skin that gets really dry and flakey in the Chicago winter.  A good moisturizer is hard to find. This goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel too thick or oily, and really works!  My skin is baby soft and in this colder weather, no more flakey skin!  A great all around moisturizer for all seasons.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite face creams.  I buy it because I need an oil-free face cream when I&#x27;m doing the hcg diet.  I love it so much I use it even when I&#x27;m not dieting.</li>
    <li> ...But I am glad I read the reviews to discover that it is the new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; version being passed off as the original. I was a very happy repeat purchaser of the original product. I loved it! The new version feels slimy, sticky and gross... seriously. I can&#x27;t imagine they tested the new version on ANYONE who was familiar with the original. This stuff is terrible. As if that was not bad enough, it made me break out... twice. (I gave it a second chance.) I miss my old moisturizer! I wish they would go back to the original... so bad!&lt;br /&gt;(I should note that I am reviewing the non-SPF formula. I cannot comment on the changes made to the SPF version.)</li>
    <li> This moisturizing is very soothing, moisturizing, and not greasy. Good for daily use. Will not cause break-outs.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is not greasy and very light.  I bought it because it does not have the harsh and damaging chemicals that most moisturizers have in them.  I also use their moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This product was bought out by another company and does not have the same ingredients that the first product had which were great.  This product did nothing for me and I was very disappointed in the fact that they did not change the ingredients.  I think this is false advertisement and they should be made to correct the ingredients to what is actually in the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything and I mean almost EVERYTHING. Lotions and other skin products usually set my skin ablaze with rashes and angry red blotches. My mom bought this for me as a present and I was skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started using it daily. First of all, at 20, I didn&#x27;t expect to see any improvement in my skin because I am young, but I was wrong. after about a week I noticed my skin was slightly lifted and tighter than I remembered. Then my freckles became lighter and more seemly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and it&#x27;s an absolute necessity in my every day. I use it before my makeup and at night after I was my face. It has a lovely smell that my boyfriend absolutely adores. Every night I come to bed he always tells me that I &amp;#34;smell like fresh oranges.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, buying another batch as we speak.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer, and the price it is being offered at on Amazon is unbeatable! I had combination skin with an oilier t-zone and some dryness is other areas. Here are the pros and cons as I see it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight, creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;- Lovely light citrus smells wakes you up in the morning but doesn&#x27;t smell fake, overpowering or nauseating&lt;br /&gt;- Oil free formula is quick to absorb into your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Light SPF 15 in this product which is better than nothing&lt;br /&gt;- I love that it has Vitamin C which is an antioxidant and can help stave off signs of aging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;- While SPF 15 is better than nothing, it&#x27;s not enough to really protect your skin especially in the summer. I wish they would create a formula with a higher SPF while maintaining the lightweight texture.&lt;br /&gt;- I once got a jar of this where the cream was thicker than usual and it left my face with red patches. The company quickly sent me a new jar and everything was fine...very odd but thankfully, an anomaly</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; badge is not a reliable indicator of whether or not you have the terrible new version of this product.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the formula currently being shipped is awful.  The smell is different (gone is the formerly wonderful orange scent).  And yes, I too could feel my skin burning after I put it on.  Before I bought this moisturizer this time around, I looked at my old container and saw that it had the \\&quot;More Sustainable\\&quot; marking on the package.  I incorrectly assumed that I hadn&#x27;t noticed the change previously and that my nose and skin just didn&#x27;t have a problem with the new formula.  Not so.  Even though both my old and new package say \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; the contents of the containers are VASTLY different.  Save your time and money...don&#x27;t repurchase this product if you liked it before...just start researching alternatives now.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this facial moisturizer.  The great clean fresh scent is a plus.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product! Has a pleasant citrus scent, not overpowering! Would buy again, but I wish it was in a different container, it&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
    <li> Product has nice light orange scent.  Is not oily, makes skin feel soft.  I use it to moisturize my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been so great for the ever changing new england weather. My skin loves the cream in the winter time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so creamy and makes my face so soft but not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this in the past and purchased it in the store. Great stuff I love it. However I feel the jar I received was tampered with the moisturizer was like liquid not like the original  solution I&#x27;ve used. It appears to be something else. Also there was no white lid on the inside like with past purchases.</li>
    <li> a little watery than the same product w/oil &amp; also a slight difference in smell but same great results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily since 2009/2010 and have always loved it.  However, the product I received with this order is not consistent with what I am use to getting and using.  It is like someone took the packaging and filled it up with cheap body lotion.  It is runny and doesn&#x27;t have the orange  smell that it is suppose to have.  This is the first time I have run into this problem ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;does a great job without causing any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ehh... I was trying something different from my regular moisturizer but I prefer the Alba Oil-free face moisurizer.  I don&#x27;t like the way this makes my face feel when it dries- a little tight.  Also, while I appreciate the natural fragrances, the orange smell is pretty strong.  Maybe there are better anti-oxidant properties with this moisturizer so it might be better for my skin.  I did see it recommended by a dermatologist in a magazine which is partly why I had purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and love it. I have purchased at both the grocery store and through Amazon and have never had a problem until my most recent purchase about a week ago. I ordered two jars of this and while the shipping was awesome as always, both jars of this moisturizer were quite runny like hand soap. Also the box was not what is pictured here. Perhaps it was a bad batch or maybe they have changed their formula. Regardless I tossed both jars and in the future will purchase this product from the grocery store. The cost is a bit higher but I can be sure of getting what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> This product provides a thick moisturizing coat without feeling greasy. Good for combination or dry skin, as it is a heavier moisturizer. When I mentioned I was using a Vitamin C moisturizer to my aesthetician, she reminded me that Vitamin C degrades in sunlight and I should use this more as a night-time cream to get any benefits from the Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that nourish your  skin.  It will not make you younger, what product does?  The importants of this product is that  makes your skin l look healthier,and brighter.</li>
    <li> from what i could tell, its the same product i get off the shelfs for a few dollars cheaper ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 or 3 weeks. I&#x27;m 39 with combination skin. Most of my life I struggled with oily skin and acne. I&#x27;m an active outdoors person with fair skin, and have gotten a fair bit of sun damage unfortunately. Now that I&#x27;m 39 my skin is less oily, I break out less, and wrinkles and sun damage are bigger concerns. I still have blackheads in my T zone and occasional breakouts, so I&#x27;m still concerned about products making me break out. So a paraben-free, oil free, vitamin C cream sounded like just the ticket for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pleasant, citrusy scent. I have not had any breakouts or other adverse reactions. I have to only use it as a night cream, though. First of all it doesn&#x27;t offer an SPF. Second, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well enough for day use. It&#x27;s too greasy to use under makeup. I really like it as a night cream, though. I alternate nights using the vitamin C cream and a glycolic cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-aging effects, yet. However, I haven&#x27;t used it often enough for a long enough period of time to really tell. So this is my report so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed from the reviews that people loved a previous formula. This is my first time trying the cream, so I cannnot compare.</li>
    <li> Upon opening this product, it was a runny consistency and smelled old.  I know something was wrong with it because I had bought a jar of this previously from a store and was not like this. I also don&#x27; t like the fact that it is in a plastic jar. I will not be buying this item again on amazon.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best product ever! It has helped with dark spots on my face, evened out skin tone and made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product contains both sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Research has shown (particularly in soft drinks) when these two ingredients are combined and exposed to heat and/or light, they produce benzene, a known carcinogen.  May be a non-issue with such small amounts in this cream, but still not comfortable putting it on my face. The orange fragrance was also too strong for me.  Too bad, because the price is good compared to competitors. Acure has a nice day cream with Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> you need vitamin C for your skin!</li>
    <li> The tub was unsealed and the lotion didn&#x27;t smell the same as what I usually buy locally nor was the lotion the same texture. This was not the same product as what I buy sealed from my local organic product store.</li>
    <li> The old formula was so much better! Great quality and great price. I&#x27;m just using this new one until I find something I like better,</li>
    <li> I look 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> Light scent, light texture, great anytime moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> My skin looks younger and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it is perfect for my skin</li>
    <li> I find this an excellent face cream, not too light, not too thick and gooey. The &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; version is particularly good. Highly recommended.The first seller mistakenly sent only one box for the 2-box set, but I reordered from another seller and got the 2-box set. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever used any of these Avalon products, and I love them!  Great scent- not too overpowering, but really refreshing.  I use this after every morning face wash and shower.  Nice and light, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now, and it&#x27;s been perfect for my needs. I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and this moisturizes without affecting any of these. Also, it&#x27;s subdued some of the laugh lines that I&#x27;ve started to see. Plus, Amazon has it for a much lower price than Target. However, I do not recommend the formula with SPF 15 as I tried it and it did make my skin break out and it felt a bit suffocating.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.  A bit heavy, and can leave &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; after drying.  OK for night.</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive products.  This one is wonderful and not that expensive. You will love it, try it.</li>
    <li> This was the ultimate catastrophe. The bottle caps were open and the product leaked all over my porch. It sainted the porch. The products obviously cannot be used. The packaging of these products was below sub par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never order from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product didn&#x27;t leak but the smell from the others sitting in 110 degree heat forced me to throw it all away.</li>
