<li> THere are actual dry fibers you put on after a gel butthey fall into your eyes and make yor eyes feel like they are bleeding no matter how careful you are.</li>
<li> The fiber wand literally has loose fibers hanging on it just waiting to get into your eye upon application.  </li>
<li> Product itself is a little tricky</li>
<li> The fibers were totally dried out.</li>
<li> Definately not safe for any one alive!!!&lt;br /&gt;Kristin</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll stick to false lashes.</li>
<li> This fiber mascara kit is ridiculously dangerous!  </li>
<li> Very painful.</li>
<li> Smelled horrible of chemistry</li>

    <li> When this says fiber it means fiber. The tube actually has white fibers that your suppose to add to your lashes. NO!  Everything in Chinese.</li>
    <li> Omg!  I have very short lashes, I used my new lengthening mascara and fibers..... To my pleasant surprise I had long beautiful thick lashes! The price is right and I recommend 100%!  On the bonus side it washes off with warm water and wash cloth!  5 star&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have used this product only once, and my results were quite noticeable. You could actually see my eyelashes!! This product appears to be working, and the customer service has been excellent!</li>
    <li> all I can say is AWSOME. and for those that complain about the fiber getting into your eyes I say practice makes Awsome.</li>
    <li> very good afternoon seller responds timely product looks good and makes you look very full lashes with much more volume and more long. the color is intense and does not spill</li>
    <li> It took nearly a month to receive this horrendous product.  This fiber mascara kit is ridiculously dangerous!  The fiber wand literally has loose fibers hanging on it just waiting to get into your eye upon application.  Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> first package was lost in the mail.  Seller kept contact and sent me a second one.  Product itself is a little tricky but once you get the hang of it, it works well.  I use my own mascara and layer with the fibers.  For the price, I would order again.</li>
    <li> I followed the steps and all I got was a bunch of flaky white stuff everywhere. I&#x27;ll stick to false lashes.</li>
    <li> I try one that my friend gave me and works great ; even that the fibres are white they still work good</li>
    <li> The fibers get into my eyes. Very painful. Threw it in the trash</li>
    <li> The transplanting gel and fibers were white. Didn&#x27;t even try to use it. Who wears white mascara. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible of chemistry so I never even used it!!</li>
    <li> the product was completely unusable. The fibers were totally dried out. I would never order this product again. It&#x27;s in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Awesome and volumizing lashes here I come. Every girl love long eye lashes so here a sujestion, great price too.</li>
    <li> not fond of it quality isn&#x27;t that great but you get what you pay for I guess its super cheap doesn&#x27;t work like other 3d lash products ive tried</li>
    <li> i love it, its really works on my thin lash.&lt;br /&gt;will use it for future. its also make more longer my lash.</li>

    <li> Took sometime to get this product and it was ok! I would recommnd it to my friends and to my family</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d and noticed right away it was from China.  After opening one time, it turned to dust.  Throwing it away ASAP.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great.</li>
    <li> I love these products they give me amazing lashes. I recommend you try them yourself and you&#x27;ll love your new lashes.</li>
    <li> I dont like the mascara but the fibers are great!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good imitation of fiber lashes. It would&#x27;ve been much better had the fibers been black and not white. I actually dip the mascara brush into the fibers instead of applying separately</li>
