      <li>This stuff is awesome, the best, I can tell my color is coming back and my scalp and hair feels natural and healthy.</li>
      <li>it says &amp;#34;hair oil&amp;#34; on the package so i&#x27;m not 100% sure about using it on the face.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried many oils (argan, almond, caster, etc.)</li>
      <li>make the mixture based on seasonal needs (add more moistened oils together in Winter, but make balancing oil in Summer for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>My hair just felt better...</li>
      <li>I love this oil for my hair and skin</li>
      <li>I love to this oil for my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>I used it as leave on hair conditioning, it gives your hair a smooth, shiny and easier to manage condition!</li>
      <li>Make sure to rub it around on your hands and move your hands around to apply, warming the oil and having it spread out ensures that you will not get oily patches.</li>
      <li>love it and will stick with this product</li>
      <li>Light and just lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it with wet hair and then the dryer, both with excellent results.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I opted for this oil thinking it would be light and have a lovely smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fabulous for healing scars,</li>
      <li>It moisturized my hair without leaving it feeling greasy, and it has a very mild, almost undetectable scent.</li>
      <li>As for my hair , it softens adds sheen and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
      <li>My hair is elbow length and fine</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the price is justified as I would pay more for poorly-infused keratin and argan oil products that are full of additives and don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Plus, I&#x27;ve seen a huge reduction in hair-breakage.  </li>
      <li>This oil feels so smooth on my skin.  </li>
      <li>oil\\&quot; to keep my hair especially moisturized and happy.</li>
      <li>The oil is a light moisturizing oil that leaves virtualously no residue.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>I was on the search for a great hair oil a couple years ago but found that every commercial product I tried contained silicones.  </li>
      <li>Light oil, I use it instead of eye cream.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free, I would suggest you experiment with ways which it could work for you, your hair and skin type.</li>
      <li>I am also unsure if this brand is organic (there are organic brands available)?</li>
      <li>Made it feel silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink, it&#x27;s light, and it moisturizes so well.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with the bottle applicator at first but realized you only need a few drops and this rations out the oil perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for that \\&quot;special</li>
      <li>My lips were full to the max.</li>
      <li>while my hair was shiny it felt waxy and did not look good the next day.</li>
      <li>I like camellia because it&#x27;s light and absorbs well, but leaves my hair very silky and easy to detangle.  </li>
      <li>I have super curly, frizzy hair and this oil is a godsend.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Camellia is my favorite hair oil, and I&#x27;ve used many (and still do) at various times--coconut, olive, jojoba, argan, and castor.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I didn&#x27;t want to just leave it sitting there occupying space, so I&#x27;ve been using it to moisturize my face and skin, especially after a shower and it does a very lovely job of that.</li>
      <li>face, mix with any other oils of your favorite to have your own &amp;#34;Face</li>
      <li>Japan made high quality always have higher standard, really good for both hair and skin!</li>
      <li>it absorbed immediately</li>
      <li>It makes my skin incredibly soft and hydrated and I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for years, I think Camelia oil works better for my skin type.</li>
      <li>It is not scented which I like, and even better my head is not greasy afterwords and my hair has returned to soft.</li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>Very Light a light smell not overwhelming and provides nice sheen and moisturize my hair , I do not utilize very often</li>
      <li>I tied Moroccan Oil, Neil George Indian Gooseberry oil, and Organix Coconut hair serum (all have silicone), and lately I have been using HerStyler hair serum which is awesome, but  again, pretty much pure silicone.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance, and a silky smooth application which makes my curls easy to manage, soft to touch and no reaction to my sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>i applied some on the tip of my hair right when i got out of the shower</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I moved to an area that has very dry weather, and my hair constantly was having static problems. This oil really improved the condition of my hair. I used to have medium-length hair (above shoulder) and have grown my hair out since I started using this oil. It help reducing the amount of split as I grow my hair out. I use this oil almost every time after I wash and condition my hair; after drying my hair with towel, I apply around 3~5 drops of oil (3 for medium length and 5 for medium long hair that length before waist) at the end and the middle of my hair. Then, I blow dry my hair from above. It helps protecting the hair from drying out.  I&#x27;m a bit lazy, so I didn&#x27;t do the hot oil treatment that they suggested.  You can also use it as moisturizer for body and face.</li>
    <li> This oil is replacing all my other hair styling products. After trying numerous different products, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a hair conditioner or styling product that does not make me break out and is effective until this simple oil. I am Asian, but I have very thick, coarse, dry, wavy long hair. This oil helps my hair feel soft, less frizzy, and much less dry. My hair and scalp hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in a long time. I can now clear out all the almost new products in my bathroom, yay!</li>
    <li> OK, I just received it and have only used it a few times, but I am in love with it. My hair is super fine - most products weigh it down and limp after a few hours - thus far my hair is shiney, not fizzy and has some pizzazzzzzz! I bought it after reading an article in Vogue magazine regarding maturing hair therapies. The author was delighted with it, so I tried it.....&lt;br /&gt;Happily.</li>
    <li> I have tried many oils (argan, almond, caster, etc.) for my hair. I like this esp. pre-shampoo treatment. However, I found it pricy for a little bottle, it wont last you long esp. if you have long hair like me.  if you have really dry hair, i would recommend trying argon oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have a wavy hair. Was falling like crazy. The hair loss significantly decreased. Added nice sheen and softness. Nice frizz control. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s heavy though, you have to be careful how you apply it! also there is no smell! which i like.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and gross like coconut oil or other oils out there. If you put a small amount in with wet hair with a comb and let it air dry, it&#x27;s makes your hair soft. I recommend for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade concoctions of various oils for face-moisturizer and hair after shampoo. Light and just lovely.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a long search for something to replace my Aubrey Organics White Camellia oil conditioner. I loved how that product reduced frizz and gave sheen to my hair, but they changed the ingredients so I started searching for just the oil. After some research I realized that there were three different types of Camellia oil and some were best for skin, while others were best for hair. The three types are camellia sinensis (green tea seed oil), camellia oleifera and camellia japonica. Camellia sinensis is best for skin because of its antioxidant/anti-aging properties and I have also used it to soften my hair. The camellia oleifera is best for cooking and reducing cholesterol. The camellia japonica (Oshima Tsubaki oil) is the star when it comes to beauty care and is best for hair treatments. I use the Oshima Tsubaki oil when my hair is flat-ironed as a daily moisturizer and it is very detangling, softening and leaves my hair shiny. I sometimes mix it with argan oil if I want to go a few days without re-moisturizing. For my natural hair (type 4a) I use it as a pre-shampoo treatment on slightly damp-dry hair then shampoo it out twice followed by a cream deep conditioner. I sometimes mix it with argan or extra-virgin coconut oil for a triple treatment, but the Tsubaki oil is always the main ingredient. My hair has had more shine, less frizz and less tangles since incorporating the Oshima Tsubaki oil.</li>
    <li> This is great material! My friend who had sever allergies use it without any problem!!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this to replace my Boscia Tsubaki buying - at less than half I had to give it a try and the results are as equal if not better. I rub it on my hair as a treatment, my face during the night, my chest and even any dry spots I have. It&#x27;s literally an all over moisturizer and is great to help shave rash.</li>
    <li> One of my sister in law used this oil and she got awesome result. Then i bought it for my wife. She is using this oil twice in a week. So far, it seems it start working. Though the price is little bit high but worth to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;moin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small amount and being West African I thought, maybe for my face but it won&#x27;t last on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for both and my last bottle lasted me the summer.  The oil is so rich that you don&#x27;t need to douse your hair in it, just a few drops with a leave in conditioner is enough.  I liked it so much I got it again.  It&#x27;s on Amazon as if under two names, no idea why.  It&#x27;s crazy expensive but I hear there are a couple &#x27;fakes&#x27; out there.  Until I get to a real Asian market I&#x27;ll keep paying for this.  It helps me avoid single strand knots and lasts about 5-7 days in my hair without me having to add more oil.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of leave in hair oils, including Morroccanoil and Kerastase&#x27;s Elixir Ultime.  Recently I decided to try to use more natural products and to avoid petroleum-based and other heavily chemical additives.  This product is the same oil that is in Shu Eumura&#x27;s Essence Absolue without cyclopentasiloxane as the first ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful.  I use a small amount on wet hair (it also works on dry hair) and it makes my hair outstandingly soft without weighing it down and killing my 2a/b waves.  My hair is elbow length and fine but it has a lot of volume, and I only have to use a few drops for all my hair.  Make sure to rub it around on your hands and move your hands around to apply, warming the oil and having it spread out ensures that you will not get oily patches.</li>
    <li> This  product is ideal for cleaning / maintenance of fretboards of guitars made of rosewood.  You can reduce risk of cracking due to lack of humidity.  This product does not leave any sticky residue. It is better than commonly used lemon or orange oil.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. I was worried that it would be heavy or weigh down my hair, which is very fine, but it&#x27;s light and not a bit greasy. I recommend it</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my hair as it made it too oily.  I have fine long hair.  However I use it on my skin and do like it.  I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again or not.  I may though, the energy of the oil is good.</li>
    <li> lightest hair oil I&#x27;ve tried.  non-greasy. makes hair shiny without weighting em down or making them look oily. i thought it was not gonna work since my hair is blonde &amp; fine and japanese women&#x27;s hair are dark and coarse but it did!  I didn&#x27;t get the tsuge comb u supposed to use it with so I just put a couple of drops on my hands and rub it on the hair, ends first then everything else. it says &amp;#34;hair oil&amp;#34; on the package so i&#x27;m not 100% sure about using it on the face. package is legit from japan, with a seal. says made in tokyo, japan. ingredient: camellia seed oil. 2oz. glass bottle&lt;br /&gt;somebody who can read the instructions in Japanese, pls tell me if I can use it on the face. pics show woman using it on face but there are ads for other products from the line so I don&#x27;t know if this pic is for this oil</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this with intent to use it for my hair. Argan oil is much too heavy and biosilk contains alcohol which is drying. Therefore, I opted for this oil thinking it would be light and have a lovely smell. First off, it has absolutely no noticeable scent and most importantly, even with the tiniest amount used, it leaves my hair looking so greasy and dirty which I absolutely hate. It serves of no use for hair whatsoever in my opinion. Unless you want to look like you have greasy, very stringy hair. For the price, I didn&#x27;t want to just leave it sitting there occupying space, so I&#x27;ve been using it to moisturize my face and skin, especially after a shower and it does a very lovely job of that. But for $18...it&#x27;s a severely overpriced moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Oshima Tsubaki hair oil works wonders on African American hair. It&#x27;s 100% pure camellia  oil with no silicones or chemicals added. I&#x27;ve been using it for over  a year. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts about 6 months. I prefer it to all the other popular hair oils.</li>
    <li> Very Light a light smell not overwhelming and provides nice sheen and moisturize my hair , I do not utilize very often I really like this bottle I have a Large amount.</li>
    <li> I use this as a body oil, post shower/bath.  Then follow up w/body lotion to seal in the moisture.  Really last and staves off dry skin.  I also use this as a facial oil and it really plumps up the skin.  I am still on trial &amp; error on using this as a hair oil.  I tend to over-use it and I end up w/greasy looking hair (but strangely enough, doesn&#x27;t FEEL greasy, just looks it).  Highly recommend this over the brand-name version (this is pure 100% camillia seed oil versus the brand name one which has other ingredients in it) which is over-priced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice skin oil, no noticeable changes in skin appearance. I&#x27;ve tried a  lot of oils and they all seem to be about the same.</li>
    <li> Best oil for thick curly very dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have not used this enough to give it 5 stars as yet, but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight oil with no discernable fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wild crafted Tsubaki from Ohshima which is southern part of JP islands, you can&#x27;t go any higher quality than this when it comes to &amp;#34;Japanese Camellia&amp;#34; oil.  People complain there isn&#x27;t much smell is because this is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; (thinner) although it is 100%.  I go for the practicality than just the smell on this (I would add some other EO if I want the smell anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin &amp; Hair use #1:&lt;br /&gt;Use as massage oil : Since this texture is thinner than some other oils, you can us this AS IT IS or AS a Carrier.&lt;br /&gt;Adequate amount to spread over your face/scalp. Massage for some minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If scalp is massaged, then shampoo/rinse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;If face is massaged after you washed your face, wipe off the excess that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;or use as &amp;#34;Cleansing oil&amp;#34; then wipe off with Steamed towel / wash /rinse, then do the rest of skincare as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin &amp; Hair use #2:&lt;br /&gt;Use it on scalp and hair overnight, covered/wrapped with towel so that it won&#x27;t soak into your pillow!&lt;br /&gt;Then shampoo/rinse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Use it on face then covered with a steamed towel for minutes, then leave it as it is if moistened enough or add more face oil (other oils etc) as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin &amp; Hair use # 3:&lt;br /&gt;For hair, just use oil on tip of your hair before blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;For face, mix with any other oils of your favorite to have your own &amp;#34;Face oil&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I make the mixture based on seasonal needs (add more moistened oils together in Winter, but make balancing oil in Summer for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to oils, I go crazy on buying /trying out different face oils from different companies at the same time I keep experimenting to mix on my own.&lt;br /&gt;This Japanese Camellia oil is a must have in my skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the performance of this oil.  As an African American, I have naturally curly hair and have been trying new oils for the last 3 years.  I&#x27;m always looking for that \\&quot;special oil\\&quot; to keep my hair especially moisturized and happy. Not surprised that it worked so well because I read the history and rave reviews of others.  I was just pleasantly surprised that it worked so well on MY particular hairtype (3c/4a).  It has a light fragrance, and a silky smooth application which makes my curls easy to manage, soft to touch and no reaction to my sensitive scalp. It&#x27;s winter in Virginia now and I plan to use this on my ends to keep them protected from the wind and cold.  I highly recommend this oil to anyone, especially those with fragile hair like mine.  Wasn&#x27;t happy with the bottle applicator at first but realized you only need a few drops and this rations out the oil perfectly. Since it&#x27;s so light, I normally add some Castor oil to it and apply to both my scalp and the length of my hair.  Will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like camellias. It smells like vegetable oil. It didn&#x27;t make my hair look shiny, it made it look greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin completely when you massage with it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Light oil, I use it instead of eye cream.</li>
    <li> I use it every day for a month and it does soften my hair. I used about 10 drops each time to massage my scalp and hair, leave it for 20 minutes then wash it as normal. After my hair is dry, I used about 2 drops to my scalp and hair again, and this time I leave it until next day. I like the result and shall continue to use it as I am getting old and my hair needs some extra help.</li>
    <li> Completely filled my expectations, the effect is immediate, since the first use my hair left manageable, straight and hydrated. I&#x27;ve used it with wet hair and then the dryer, both with excellent results. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Japanese,and I know how great this product is! I&#x27;m glad I could find this here! This camellia oil is not the same as the other ones. A bit pricey,but it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,not greasy.Great on your hair.Really good shipping and delivery.Will buy again .Use it every day and very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love to this oil for my skin and hair. This oil is like a olive oil but much better actually, and made in JAPAN!</li>
    <li> I use on hair and body. My boyfriend has cystic acne.. the kind where you are prescribed ridiculous creams- tazorac, steroid cream, etc. He tried this, he broke out for the first two days. He was very discouraged. But I reminded him most products say to use at least two weeks because after all your skin needs to adjust. He said he would try it. He is so happy he did. One week later, no acne, less blackheads, and the marks are slowly fading.&lt;br /&gt;I use on my hair. Everyone compliments me. It absorbs immediately. A little goes a long way. A lot is too much.&lt;br /&gt;This is a natural sun block and bug repellent. I know this from experience. I wore it when I went to Six Flags for the day. No tan. At all.&lt;br /&gt;I wore this when all my co-workers were getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, I maybe had two bug bites the whole night, on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I will always have this stocked in my home. Always.</li>
    <li> this product because it makes my hair soft and shiny. I use this product because my hair feels like straw because it is sooo dry. I am glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> This oil felt really nice on my hair. Made it feel silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was on the search for a great hair oil a couple years ago but found that every commercial product I tried contained silicones.  I tied Moroccan Oil, Neil George Indian Gooseberry oil, and Organix Coconut hair serum (all have silicone), and lately I have been using HerStyler hair serum which is awesome, but  again, pretty much pure silicone.  Silicone is effective at smoothing, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to actually nourish your hair which was what I really wanted.  Then, I stumbled across this product while searching amazon for another product and decided to give it a try...I am so glad I did.  It made my hair just as soft and smooth, but without weighing it down like silicone serums do.  My hair just felt better...light and soft and silky, not just temporary smoothness.  It&#x27;s an added benefit that you can also use it on your skin (I love multitasking products, especially when I travel).  Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently got this and my hair use to be very dry and frail. This stuff is awesome, the best, I can tell my color is coming back and my scalp and hair feels natural and healthy. This I would recommend to every one. Wonderful product,  every one should have.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft, and I have over processed hair.  I tried a lot of products and this is nothing compared to the rest.  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have straight, dry hair, and have tried multiple solutions in the past including conditioners, deep conditioners, hair masks, olive oil, and coconut oil, and this is by far the best.  It moisturized my hair without leaving it feeling greasy, and it has a very mild, almost undetectable scent.</li>
    <li> This is a nice dry oil that can be used during the day since it won&#x27;t make your skin look oily. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair and skin</li>
    <li> I had tried other brand of body oils, but only camellia oil works for me.  Even my daughter said my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> I used it as leave on hair conditioning, it gives your hair a smooth, shiny and easier to manage condition!</li>
    <li> i like this product. it makes a really good hand and body moisturizer. i didnt like it when i used it on my hair though. i applied some on the tip of my hair right when i got out of the shower and it made my hair really oily.</li>
    <li> A light, nourishing, nearly odorless oil.  Detangles my fine and breakage-prone hair like a charm, yet doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I&#x27;ve been using it, post wash (On wet hair), for a couple of weeks and haven&#x27;t seen even a hint of build-up.  Plus, I&#x27;ve seen a huge reduction in hair-breakage.  Next, I have to try experimenting with adding this oil to my conditioner, hair masques, shampoo, henna treatments, hot oil treatments etc...&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was easier to pour the oil (Hence only 4 stars), as you can only dispense the oil drop by drop, but at least I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;Something I did try...whipped up some shea butter with a bit of this oil and used it as a body butter.  Trust me kids, just try it.  It&#x27;ll knock your socks off.</li>
    <li> Kept my hair hydrated! But you need to apply a hefty amount to get the effect that you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had recently relocated to city where the air pollution is terrible and environmental factors were destroying my hair. I am African-American with a wavy straight texture of hair. I also have a mohawk. My exposed head would be so flaky, itchy and full of dandruff :(. I began to see severe split ends forming from breakage and my whole scalp was dry (even after washing, deep conditioning, and hot oil treatments and monthly hair visits to a salon) The keratin oil I was previously using would be absorbed and gone after a day of being in my head and even the product recommended at the salon was no match for this environment. This oil is GOOD, as it is not extremely heavy compared to some but would probably range as moderate. I have used many products and a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be deceived by the bottle  (60ml is the largest of this of this particular brand). I am unsure if it is cold pressed and unrefined (I assume they claim it to be as their is only the camellia seed oil as an ingredient and maybe that is what the &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; on the box indicates? I am also unsure if this brand is organic (there are organic brands available)? The directions for hair are in English on the box, but not very descriptive as far as to how often to apply (I assume as needed), but do indicate that thicker or longer hair may require more oil. It is not scented which I like, and even better my head is not greasy afterwords and my hair has returned to soft. I have not used it on the face as I have oily skin and can not put oil on my skin, but I imagine it might work wonders. Also, the directions for the face are in Japanese as well, but by typing in a general search I was able to find instructions and even more uses of Camellia oil, what it is and what it can do. I will continue to use this product and will recommend. In my opinion, the price is justified as I would pay more for poorly-infused keratin and argan oil products that are full of additives and don&#x27;t work. This will remain in my beauty regime as long as I have access to it.</li>
    <li> I know that this is one of the most popular camellia oil brands, but it was alright. Compared to other camellia oil brands, it seems a bit greasy. Maybe I had a bad batch?</li>
    <li> I have super curly, frizzy hair and this oil is a godsend. You only need a little bit, so I&#x27;ve been using it over a month already and haven&#x27;t even begun to make a dent in this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a high quality product and is a wonderful addition my hair care routine!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use it for my skin and it works great.</li>
    <li> Nice way of adding oil to your hair. Not too heavy like Castor oil. my hair feels healthier and thicker since using it.</li>
    <li> The oil is a light moisturizing oil that leaves virtualously no residue. This product is in my daily moisturizing routine.</li>
    <li> This product has made the ends of my hair much stronger.  I use it on my face and it helps with dark marks, etc.  I have very sensitive skin and there is no irritation.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil feels so smooth on my skin.  Not oily at all.  I apply it to my hair, face and body.  It sinks into my skin leaving a silky finish.  I also like using this on my hands and cuticles at night before bed. I sometimes alternate this with argan oil, but I prefer this oil to argan because it is less oily. The glass bottle is nice, although I would have preferred a flip top.  I will repurchase this once I am finished with the bottle, but this 2 ounce bottle will last a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular brand of camellia oil for about two years now, and since I need to order another bottle, I thought I&#x27;d do a review beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camellia is my favorite hair oil, and I&#x27;ve used many (and still do) at various times--coconut, olive, jojoba, argan, and castor.  My hair is past waist length and really loves oil, so it&#x27;s something I use frequently.  I like camellia because it&#x27;s light and absorbs well, but leaves my hair very silky and easy to detangle.  When I use it in a mister bottle, I usually mix it 3/4 camellia oil with 1/4 casto oil (I teaspoon of oil per 2 oz. of water).  Don&#x27;t be put off by the cost, because this is a high quality oil and it does last a long time.  If I&#x27;m doing a deep treatment pre-wash, I generally use coconut oil because it&#x27;s cheaper and works well for that.  Also keep in mind that the cheaper camellia oil (chinensis vs. japonica) is not as high quality as this one, and you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a lil under a week, so I don&#x27;t have an extensive review BUT I ordered it because it was healthy and had good reviews. I was expecting camellia oil to smell beautifully, but disappointed when I smelled nothing which does not really work for me because one of the three reasons I chose camellia oil was based on how I expected it to smell. It absorbs well and it a light oil, which I prefer over heavier oils that are hard to remove.</li>
    <li> will be always buying this. worth every penny</li>
    <li> It works great to smooth out my dry and damaged hair, especially the ends. It can also be used as a hair styler. And a tiny tiny drop works well for every use.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Tacha camellia oil and this is a good substitute for it . The price is reasonable and size will last longer</li>
    <li> This oil is very powerful and I had a slight allergic reaction.  As a result I only use 1 drop every 2 weeks to get fabulous shine and soften Afro hair.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing .... It makes me skin very soft and refreshed</li>
    <li> I applied this on my dry lips before bed time and woke up looking like Kylie Jenner. Seriously.  My lips were full to the max. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that result because the oil is not a lip plumper. Anyway I like the results so I&#x27;ll keep applying. As for my hair , it softens adds sheen and absorbs very quickly.  I have to use a small amount because it does weigh my hair down. I have tail bone length hair. Just a few drops is enough for me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink, it&#x27;s light, and it moisturizes so well. I put it on my face and my hair. It helps control my overly greasy skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve used it the following ways with results as listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: I first tried it while my hair was still wet before blow drying (like using a serum or Moroccan Oil) - unfortunately it was too heavy for me - while my hair was shiny it felt waxy and did not look good the next day. I barely used a dime sized amount for waist length Asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;I next used it as a scalp treatment and on the ends of my hair before washing.  My scalp loved it and so did my hair! It washed off without any heavy residue and made my hair look healthy, shiny and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin: I massaged a few drops onto my cuticles and heels at night and my skin absorbs it immediately without too much oiliness.  It makes my skin incredibly soft and hydrated and I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for years, I think Camelia oil works better for my skin type. It has a very soothing effect on skin; for example, I had a cold and my nose was getting very chaffed and sore from all the rubbing, I kept putting the tsubaki oil on it - it absorbed immediately and I have no dry skin to show! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fabulous for healing scars, etc. too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, a truly remarkable oil.  Fragrance free, I would suggest you experiment with ways which it could work for you, your hair and skin type.</li>
    <li> It is definitely one of the more expensive oils out there, but if you have the money, by all means get this one. The smell is nutty and sweet, similar to sesame. The design of the bottle is odd but fancy. I am minimalist so if I am going to keep something for a while, it better look good. I agree that the oil is hard to get out of the bottle at first, but as it gets more empty, it gets easier to distribute the oil. A small bit spreads easily so it is economical. Expensive but there are no better oils than this in my opinion. I use this for eczema, conditioning, and polishing blades. It absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Japan made high quality always have higher standard, really good for both hair and skin! Will come back and buy again for sure</li>
    <li> love it and will stick with this product</li>
