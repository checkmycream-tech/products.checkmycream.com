      <li>I also used it on my arms and bikini area and it worked wonderfully!  </li>
      <li>Very happy and satified with the reults.</li>

      <li>I was very impressed by their customer service.</li>
      <li>This hair removal system is AWESOME!  </li>
      <li>Okay!!!  </li>
      <li>Worka well (and does eliminate ingrown hairs as advertised), but incredibly time consuming.  </li>
      <li>Buy good wax and a warmer instead!</li>
      <li>It works great for me.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was great.  </li>
      <li>for me i found that on the lower speed it didn&#x27;t work too great on my thighs.  </li>

      <li>Works great on hands and arms too    </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>

      <li>So glad to find this replacement.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Ok for the Price, but it doesn&#x27;t work well...</li>
      <li>This product exfoliates your skin much more efficiently than using a body scrub and is also great for soft smooth feet!</li>
      <li>The first time is used according to it book, was good.  </li>
      <li>it works really good for getting rid of the callouses on feet, nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It left my skin extremely smooth and removed all the hair on my legs with great ease!  </li>
      <li>I tried varying pressures, mostly attempting to keep it light like the instructions said but also mixing it up.</li>
      <li>My legs are smooth and hairless :)   </li>
      <li>If you follow the directions closely, like I did, you will get the results other have gotten which are AMAZING!!!!!</li>
      <li>It needs stick on pads to make it easier and more environmentally friendly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use although</li>
      <li>I have fine skin</li>
      <li>I have the free time to devote to it, so it worked just fine for me.</li>
      <li>it just leaves a fine powder, wipe the powder off, smooth on some moisturiser and your on your way to the legs of your dreams.  </li>
      <li>Worked well, gave me smooth legs</li>
      <li>After about 15 minutes of using this product my legs were smooth to the touch</li>
      <li>I cannot believe I just found this because it appears to have been available for years.</li>
      <li>This machine leaves my skin hair free and as smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>NO bumps, NO pain, just smooth hair free legs.  </li>
      <li>I bought these a few years ago and it was a great price!</li>
      <li>When lightly placed on the hairy area, the rotating discs remove the hair and exfoliate the skin.  </li>
      <li>and my husband smooth arms</li>
      <li>Even Smooth Away pads can be used as replacements.  </li>
      <li>Even though Conair no longer carries replacement pads for this item any the replacement pads for manual skin sanding products can be cut to fit the plastic discs (the discs do not wear out the abrasive paper on them</li>
      <li>I used Smooth Away pads before, and it worked for me.</li>
      <li>Have not found another product that can do what this does for smooth feet.  </li>
      <li>However, it is important to use it for a while and get the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>A light touch to the skin</li>
      <li>So far not looking good on it though.  </li>
      <li>Removes hair quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>Like I said, this product is definitely worth keeping!  </li>
      <li>This is great on fine hair and rough spots but for thicker hair it leaves you feeling like you still need to shave.</li>
      <li>Great for dry heels as well.</li>
      <li>Your skin does feel nice and soft afterward.</li>
      <li>I had my last one for 8 years and loved it.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to read the instructions and do not apply too much pressure or else it won&#x27;t work at all</li>
      <li>That may be true.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product for the price.</li>
      <li>Not a bad price.</li>
      <li>and it dries out pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super, super quick, which is a plus.  </li>
      <li>I imagine they discontinued this great product because people don&#x27;t read instructions and tried to use it  on their underarms or some other tender place and then filed complaints!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product, had it for years not only does it remove hair it also removed calluses. I use it on my feet. I have the pediatric machine that went into the trash. So buy this product it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Removes hair quickly and easily.  Also, like the way it removes the dry skin layer and leaves it smooth.</li>
    <li> I understand those of you who tried it and ended up with sore, scraped legs.  However, it is important to use it for a while and get the hang of it.  It is as efficient as the smooth away but much faster.  If you follow the directions closely, like I did, you will get the results other have gotten which are AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this in hope  would find something that would be an alternative to expensive and painful waxing or irritating shaving. I used it, I was very patient, i probably spent about an hour on my legs. I tried varying pressures, mostly attempting to keep it light like the instructions said but also mixing it up. It sis not work at all. I was left with lots of hair that I had to shave off right after which hurt. the pads wore down before I was done with my legs. I am not skinny but I&#x27;m not fat either athletic track runner build. I am black with sensitive skin, not sure how this might affect it but just though I would put that out there. It works okay for exfoliating, a bit painful, good for the feet I suppose. Its not really worth the hassle but I will use since I spent my money already. I really hoped this product would work but it did not. Guess I will have to save up for laser.</li>
    <li> I received this item yesterday, and i had a little stubble on my legs and decided to try it almost as soon as i got it. For my lower leg on low speed it worked great!  I know everyone&#x27;s experience is different, for me i found that on the lower speed it didn&#x27;t work too great on my thighs.  The \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed is a little scary at first (sounds like you could sand a car) but that did work on my thigh. And i don&#x27;t know how you could keep this product in one spot for too long it moves so rapidly. Here is my run down:&lt;br /&gt;Lower Leg: Low Speed (does the job)&lt;br /&gt;Thigh: High Speed&lt;br /&gt;Underarms: Low speed, small head - not good at getting into the grooves, but works great at getting that gross dead skin off. And if you&#x27;re like me, it also works for getting any ingrown hairs loose and out of your life!&lt;br /&gt;For upper body, wouldn&#x27;t recommend, kinda scary.</li>
    <li> I was so optimistic about trying this product on my legs. I have coarse hair and I saw no difference between shaving and using this conair hair removal system. My legs were actually smoother when I shaved. I gave this product 2 stars because of the way it removes dead skin but as far as a hair removal system it was a complete failure for me. I still felt a lot of hair stubble... Maybe it has to do with the type of hair I have because I know a lot of people who had this system work for them. I just wish it worked for me :(</li>
    <li> Throw the shave cream and razor away.  This is the best for hair removal.  A light touch to the skin and it removes hair leaving your skin nice and smooth.  It works as an exfoliator as well.  My legs are always dry and cracked but this machine removed old skin and I have no more cracks on my shins.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and shaving/waxing just kills my legs no matter what shaving cream, razors, or waxes the spa use.  This hair removal system is AWESOME!  That&#x27;s all I can say.  It left my skin extremely smooth and removed all the hair on my legs with great ease!  NO bumps, NO pain, just smooth hair free legs.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to use this product.  I have even told me friends about it who are now going to buy one.  I was skeptical at first but this product amazed me!  Even my boyfriend was amazed!  I did both of my legs, upper and lower in about half an hour.  I barely used any pressure when applying it to my legs.  The key is DON&#x27;T press it hard - just glide it along your skin and it will work.  I also used it on my arms and bikini area and it worked wonderfully!  Like I said, this product is definitely worth keeping!  Just make sure to read the instructions and do not apply too much pressure or else it won&#x27;t work at all and you&#x27;ll be left with rough bumpy irritated skin.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive and thin skin, don&#x27;t buy it. It left my arms bleeding. I prefer waxing and shaving a lot more.  I can&#x27;t return the item and am going to throw it away.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have money for laser hair removal this is the next best thing. Once you learn to use this product it works really well and the hair growth slows down quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I actually use this as a foot sander, I removed the blue pads and replaced with find grit sandpaper with adhesive backs and it works MARVELOUSLY to remove callouses and rough skin on your feet.  Just don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works, but man it earned me mega brownie points with the Mrs. She loves this thing!</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and i was pretty excited to try it out.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things to keep my legs smooth, but nothing really worked and it has cost me a lot of money.  After about 15 minutes of using this product my legs were smooth to the touch and my skin felt great.  I did use moisturizer afterwards which made it even better.  Usually I have stubble overnight from shaving, but this morning i woke up and my legs were still smooth!    I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and eventually get my desired results.</li>
    <li> So I just got this product as a gift.  I followed the directions and it is fantastic!  I have pale sensitive skin and it did not hurt or irritate at all.  I did my lower and upper legs in less than 30 minutes.  The key is not to press too hard or go over an area for too long.  If you do, it will cause irritation.  You can feel when your skin is about to get irritated.  When you start to feel a little tingle/burning sensation, stop using it on that area.  It really does make your skin feel great!  The key to this product is to keep using it.  The first time will be wonderful, but there may be a little tiny bit of stubble, same as shaving.  It&#x27;s not much at all.  The more you use it, the better your legs feel.  The first time I used it, I put moisturizer on afterwards and my legs felt great.  It&#x27;s only meant for arms and legs.  It&#x27;s too aggressive for anything else.  It&#x27;s pretty much a motorized smooth away! You put very little effort into this without the fear of cuts and irritation.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and in good condition.  Works great.  I would highly recommend this seller</li>
    <li> je trouve&#x27;que ce produit n&#x27;est pa efficace du tout...je lai essayer plusieurs fois et ca enleve juste un tout petit peu les poils.  Bref je suis très decu de ce produit..</li>
    <li> This product works great, tried many different hair removal techniques and this one being one of the best I found.  Only complaints I have for this item is that i only received the four larger discs and not any of the smaller discs.</li>
    <li> Good thing this was cheap.  It kinda sorta works, but it&#x27;s very time-consuming.  My wife wanted it, and she has used it for over a month.  She&#x27;s not happy with it because it takes too long and the results are not what she expected.</li>
    <li> I have very tough and coarse hair like nylon fibers. This product did the trick and left me smooth in the areas where I wanted. The product manual states that one hair removal pad is good for 30 uses. That may be true. However, with my experience with the product, it worked very well and quickly the first go around and if you used the same pad a second time [it took me] it can take 30 minutes to one hour of trying to remove a small area of hair with poor results. If you bought a bundle of replacement cartridges and changed it every time the pad wore out it would be a good product.</li>
    <li> I received this system about a month ago and I&#x27;ve used it just once for its purpose (shaving).   It&#x27;s completely useless. It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave at all. The same thing az razer, I would even say - WORSE.  I don&#x27;t have that many facial hairs but I decided to try it anyways...OMG! It was the worst idea ever.  All the small hairs stayed exactly there they were! But my skin....it was...shaved. I was burnt. The spot I tried to shave was red for the next two days and it looked like somebody kicked me or I fell down from the stairs...it was AWKWARD.  Moreover, it did hurt. I couldn&#x27;t even sleep for the forst night.  I have fine skin and I don&#x27;t have many facial or body hair. So it&#x27;s completely useless for me.   I use it on my feet now to exfoliate rough skin.</li>
    <li> The product was received as requested and on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This hair removal system DOES work as advertised. It can be tricky to use at first but with practice everything improves. When applying for the first time don&#x27;t be afraid but be careful with aggressiveness. Removal takes long so be patient! If you want instant hair removal search for another system. After removing hair the skin is left exfoliated. The biggest concern is how fast the pads wear out. Conair should sell 8 pack replacement pads instead of 2 pack.</li>
    <li> This does remove the hair, but takes quite a while.  Plus, I found it pretty painful to use as my only source of hair removal.  So, I use it to go over stubble from the previous day shaving.  If you use it as your only source of hair removal, you will find new growth the next day.</li>
    <li> Junk Junk It does not work and when you use even the lowest speed you get burned I dont have sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MACHINE. As far as hair removal products are concerned I have been nothing but disappointed, UNTIL NOW. If you watch the DVD and follow the instructions it works as stated. Even though Conair no longer carries replacement pads for this item any the replacement pads for manual skin sanding products can be cut to fit the plastic discs (the discs do not wear out the abrasive paper on them does) 600 grit (or higher)adhesive backed or can convert to Velcro works.  Even Smooth Away pads can be used as replacements.  So I am se t for life and I ordered this from Discounts Jungle and got the most awesome deal.      This machine leaves my skin hair free and as smooth as silk. It is fast (15 - 20 minutes)no cuts, no burns,no rashes, just perfectly smooth skin. I use it on my face, jawline, neck (low speed with small disc but large works too), legs (high speed and large discs), underarms, anywhere I fell I require hair to be removed and well the softest skin ever.  I cannot believe I just found this because it appears to have been available for years. Well, better late than never. I am definitely sold and I will not have to hunt for something better for hair removal anymore.    BTW-there are 2 versions of this:  The HB2 and HB2R.  The HB2 has 4 LARGE PADS total.  One on the applicator and 3 spares in a ridgid plstic container. The ISBN/USP code for that item is 07410802675.    The other option is the HB2R which has 5 PADS TOTAL 3 LARGE AND 2 small. The ISBN/USP code for this is 074108039002.    So I own 2 of each have all the mounts and can replace the pads out myself.  Very happy and satified with the reults. I have seen very few bad revies for this product and those I have seen well indicate that they are using it incorrectly.  This is a sanding device and it pwders the hair.  You are not supposed to spply pressure.  If you do you will injure yourskin/self.  The DVD has been included for a reason.    HAPPY DAYS :)))))))))))</li>
    <li> I bought this hair removal system in the forlorn hope that it would actually work well to remove body hair. After reading through the instructions a few times and trying it out, I found this product to be a complete waste of time and money. I tried to remove hair using the booklet&#x27;s method of light fast passes across the area in a clockwise motion. This did nothing. it removed no hair whatsoever. When I tried a more agressive approach, I found my skin to be red, irritated and downright painfull for the next three to four days. This product does not work. I dont know if the people who gave this thing five stars were bribed or what, but this product simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Terrific product reduces hair and dry skin to soft powder with no pressure at all.  I glided it gentle over legs and even upper lip and bikini stubble from shaving (which is expressly against manufacturers instructions) and wow!!! it just leaves a fine powder, wipe the powder off, smooth on some moisturiser and your on your way to the legs of your dreams.  I can only think reading the other reviews that people are trying to hard you just have to gently glide it above the hair.  Its amazing value, the only con for me is that the machine itself is a little cumbersome.  [[ASIN:B000H65W1E CONAIR 2-Speed Hair Removal System Model HB5R]]</li>
    <li> Well I bought this thinking it might actually work, But it doesn&#x27;t. The only reason I gave it two stars is like other reviewers its great for exfoliating my feet! They feel so smooth and look so much better after a few minutes of use. If you are thinking about purchasing this for hair removal don&#x27;t bother. And it said it came with an instructional DVD and it wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> The picture of the product was incorrect and I received the wrong product but the seller immediately contacted me to apologize for the mistake and refunded the money including the shipping price. I was very impressed by their customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I previously used the Smooth Away hair removal system which worked well but was very time consuming. I thought this would be faster and more effective but in fact it seems to be a waste of my time and money. It&#x27;s not very easy to use as u have to keep holding down the button while u move it in circular motions along your skin. It gets hot while you&#x27;re using it and for the length of time keeping it in one area, it doesn&#x27;t remove much hair at all. It is especially difficult to use on the shinbone area probably because of it&#x27;s size and inflexibility as opposed to the smooth away pads. I really regret buying this product as it was a total disappointment!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was less expensive than ordering replacement discs for my hair buffer I already own. But the listing said this was packaged with 4 large discs and 2 small but that is completely not true.  It came with 3 discs and a travel case (utterly useless in my opinion).  Still, less than the replacement discs I saw here on Amazon but be aware that the picture and description shown does not match what is shipped.  Shipping was super, super quick, which is a plus.  Just wish it was what I actually ordered...</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of work to remove the hair and it is rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair removal gadget a few times now.  It works pretty well on my legs as long as I have about a half an hour of free time to use - not excellent -- but pretty well.  As far as removing hair \\&quot;in other places\\&quot;, it&#x27;s terrible!  Can&#x27;t seem to be done without causing a severe rash.  I&#x27;ve used Smooth Away Hair Removal in the past and am going back to that product.  It works much better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this but figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.  As I first started using it I thought it was great.  But, after I did part of my leg and had stopped to take a phone call, my leg had a slight burning feeling and itched!  I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t apply hardly any pressure.  The burning and itching, even after applying a ton of lotion, lasted for a few days. I do have pretty dry skin so that may have been part of the problem. Personally, I&#x27;d recommend looking for another option.</li>
    <li> I tried it as soon as it arrived today after watching the DVD that came with it. It works but it is very time consuming. The only complaint I have is that I did not receive the same product that is advertised. It did include the 4 discs but not the 2 smaller discs or the bottle of moisturizer. I was really wanting the smaller discs. On the plus side the shipping was super fast...</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE MACHINE WORKS TOO WELL. ENDED UP WITH LOTS    OF RED SKIN. HAIRLESS BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO PAY    ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING.</li>
    <li> I cannot evaluate something that has not arrived!  I have not checked to see if I have not been billed but you would think a month is more than enough time to get a product out to someone...... It seems I at least would have gotten some sort of contact indicating why there has been a delay but that has not happened either.</li>
    <li> They must be shipping this product from Mars!  I wish Amazon would do something about vendors that lower the price of products to get people interested and then charge unrealistic shipping fees to increase revenue.  It is poor business and it damages the reputation of Amazon partners.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my Chinese Crested puppy.  Although he is a hairless variety, he tends to sprout some errant hairs on his back. The groomer is expensive and the hair grows backs as stubble--ugly and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device works well.  It comes with four replacement discs, a traveling case and an instructional dvd.  When lightly placed on the hairy area, the rotating discs remove the hair and exfoliate the skin.  The hair must be dry, although hair length does not matter.  There are two speeds, a high and low.  It is easy to use although a tad on the noisy side.  It removes the hair painlessly, seems to soften the skin and saves me an exorbitant groomer&#x27;s fee.  The hair that returns appears to be finer and softer not the bristles left by regular shaving/clipping. I am satisfied and the dog is soft and silky.</li>
    <li> i used it the first day and it surprisinglly worked but i definitely would not agree with the \\&quot;rapid hairmoval\\&quot; description it has. it took me near a half hour just to do one leg. it got rid of a majority of the hair, but not all of it. its hard to  get around the ankles, even with the small pads.doesnt really work for finer hairs. so in short it works when you first use it but then starts to not show the great results you want. but it still works... i guess i&#x27;m on the fence. it works really good for getting rid of the callouses on feet, nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t work at all. At least I can cover the sanding head with a detaling shammy and use it to buff my car outside with an extension cord.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice that this removes my hair all that well but then again I have dark coarse hair and maybe this isn&#x27;t quite up to the task. However, it leaves my skin exfoliated and very smooth. I also notice that using this in between my normal shaving routine helps drastically cut down on my ingrown hairs/shave bumps...maybe due to the exfoliation? So although it doesn&#x27;t work to remove hair (at least on me) it still has its benefits and for the price its well worth giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe I was doing something wrong but this is one purchase I was definately disappointed in.</li>
    <li> This is great on fine hair and rough spots but for thicker hair it leaves you feeling like you still need to shave.</li>
    <li> It takes some time (longer than shaving) to remove my hair as I have reasonably coarse hair on my lower leg.  I don&#x27;t use it every time but it has improved the appearance of my legs - as if they have been polished or exfoliated.  Great for dry heels as well.</li>
    <li> I waited a month after purchasing this to test it out and give it a fair review. That being said, there are several things I like about it and a couple things that I dont.  It takes a little bit to get that technique down, but once you do it works very well (I suggest using the low speed for first time users). I like that it exfoliates while I&#x27;m using it; my skin is very soft afterwards. It works pretty well at getting the hair off, however I found it takes a little longer than shaving. I also noticed that hair grows back faster than with shaving :(  I feel like I am having to use this twice a week (and that&#x27;s because I wear jeans most of the time, if I was wearing shorts a lot I&#x27;d probably be using it every other day). I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like shaving does!! I read a review that said the hair grew back softer; I have not noticed that with mine. Maybe if I try using it for longer than a month; we shall see. I also found that on the fine hair on my thighs and behind my knees, it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of getting it off.   Not a bad product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about 6 months now.  I can say it does work well on legs and exfoliates as it removes the hair. However the hair grows back almost as quickly as regular shaving.  I wouldn&#x27;t try your underarms as it will remove too much skin and leave you with a burned feeling.  I&#x27;m also not sure I would try it on the face.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE THIS ITEM 1 MONTH AGO AND USE IT ONCE IN EVERY WEEK.AND I THINK IT DOES IT JOB QUIET WELL ONLY ON LEGS NOT WORK ON ARMS MAYBE I HAVE VERY THIN HAIRS ON MY ARMS. THIS IS A REALLY TIME CONSUMING MACHINE IT TAKES ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO REMOVE HAIRS ON LEGS.ANYWAY I AM ENJOYING WITH THIS HAIR REMOVING SYSTEM,GOOD PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> You have to hold the power button down the whole time you are using this product. This is tiresome and difficult when you have to move the device all around to make contact with your legs or arms. The head of the device does not fit comfortably against your legs. It&#x27;s flat and you have to keep adjusting your hold on it to keep the head of it in contact with your legs. (It works by \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; off the hair from your body.) Your skin does feel nice and soft afterward. But it takes a long time to sand-off the hair and as I said you have to hold the power button on through-out.</li>
    <li> Total fail. I bought the Conair to remove back and shoulder hair. My results were less than satisfactory. The hairs were cut near skin level, but just high enough to leave little stubby hairs. Results lasted maybe 2 days, and I used up all of the discs included with the system. I guess it is back to waxing.</li>
    <li> It does do the job but you have to keep going over the same area and I got some serious \\&quot;rug burns\\&quot; after all was said and done.  I also got to vacuum my entire bathroom and then dust too in order to get rid of all the white, powdery dust that covers everything in sight.  I still own it, somewhere in the back of a deep closet, but I&#x27;ll stick with a razor.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed - at least it was cheap!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it!  If you have sensitive skin, beware!  It burns your skin.  I didn&#x27;t press hard, just followed directions.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I love this item because I bought it for exfoliation purposes only, not for hair removal. I would say that this product does little to none for hair removal, but it is a great skin exfoliation system. This product exfoliates your skin much more efficiently than using a body scrub and is also great for soft smooth feet!</li>
    <li> This product actually works as advertised. I used it on my legs and thighs. It removed the hair and left them super smooth, with no irritation. It does leave behind a great deal of ash, but nothing that lotion doesn&#x27;t cure. Also, the wand gets very hot, so you won&#x27;t be able to do both legs without letting it sit and cool off multiple times. Don&#x27;t start unless you have about an hour to spare. Overall though, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> all of my friends say that this works really well! it 100% replaces razors and every other painful hair removal product! i am going to try this and we&#x27;ll see what happens!</li>
    <li> If this would have been marketed as a rough skin remover for my feet then I would have given it a five. But because it gave me such blisters on my legs when I tried to use it as it&#x27;s intended, I give it the lowest rating</li>
    <li> Disappointing. The fuse blew as soon as I plugged it in which is a shame as I really liked the product. Never used.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use, your legs will feel very smooth after.  But you&#x27;re basically \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; your hair off, so it will regrow.  Didn&#x27;t find it painful to use.  My biggest gripe is that the pads wear out quickly and are hard to find.  Due to this I quit using mine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t press, just let the wand do the work. I have sensitive skin and use this everywhere. No rash, burn, or discomfort. Stop pressing and you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
    <li> It works but takes time and care not to press too hard.  The Four large discs were in the box but the two smaller discs   and the bottle of after-use moisturizer were not in the shipment.  I really do need the smaller discs more than the large ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok for the Price, but it doesn&#x27;t work well... I think the pads are not hard enough for removing strong hair...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this would work.  But I used it as soon as it arrived.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved in awhile, so my hair was fairly long.  The product worked really well.  I felt no irritation.  My legs are smooth and hairless :)   And if you find a hair or two you&#x27;ve missed, it is very easy to go over that spot.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving with razors, electric razors, nair-like products and waxing.  This is the easiest with no pain, no odor (from nair etc.), no nicks and it took off the dry skin too! What a deal.  Diane</li>
    <li> This was a great product, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because if you are using it for a really course hair and very much of it, the pads didnt last super long. But definitely a better product than I expected. Completely painless as long as you dont push too hard to leave it in one spot too long. Worked well, gave me smooth legs and my husband smooth arms 2 very different types of hair.</li>
    <li> best for skin scaling better than scrub ideal for smoothing after shower. use without water. can remove hair if not dense.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money. This thing didn&#x27;t do anything but get uncomfortably hot against my leg. If anyone has actually gotten this device to remove hair, I&#x27;d like to know your secret.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a different product for leg hair removal, with nerve problems in my legs, the razors irritated me more.  I got this product, and immediately put it to use.  I am pleased with the overall results, plus, it does not irritate the nerves in my legs!  Very nice product, I am happy with it, and the price was cheap, and I had seen reviews saying something about the shipping.....well, let me tell you why that is high, it is sent via 3 day priority shipping, well worth it, and I actually had it 2 days after I ordered it.  Much better than another company I dealt with for something else recently.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift, brand new in the box. (Conair Hair Removal System, Model HB5R)&lt;br /&gt;  The first time is used according to it book, was good.  Next week (I only used it for the second time now) plugged it in and started to use it and I smelled burning and machine stopped working.  I called Conair Customer Service for assistance.  She said since I don&#x27;t have a receipt they cant fix it or exchange the product, plus this hair remover is discontinued.  So I am stucked.  But I can see this product is still at the market. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years on my facial hair.  I inherited too much facial and body hair.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to tame it down in my 40&#x27;s.  I was growing a beard and would shave and had to stop using deploritory creams because of skin burn.    A sympathetic friend bought me this tool on an after Christmas sale, and this device has worked to slowly deplete my facial hair.  Although, I have to make certain not to rub to hard on my skin, this product does not hurt or burn or feel uncomfortable on dry skin.  In a few minutes of using the product every day - my beard is totally gone and is slowly disapearing. I would never quit using it. I own six of them now, since I found it at a remarkably low price.     I only have to change the wheel once every year and 1/2.    Worth the money if you have too much facial or body hair.  Works great on hands and arms too    dlo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product. It&#x27;s too difficult to use and can cause painful \\&quot;skin burns\\&quot;. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Thank God I only paid less than $5 for this item! It does not work! I repeat it does not work!  Stick to the creams, waxing, and traditional shaving to remove unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Worka well (and does eliminate ingrown hairs as advertised), but incredibly time consuming.  I have switched to Veet (Nair) because my skin tolerates it.</li>
    <li> Not only was I sent the wrong item, but the hair removal system that I received had been used despite the fact that they advertised it as new!  They expected me to use the same hair removal pads as a previous owner which is disgusting.  I attempted to contact them multiple times by e-mail and phone.  They always promised to send me a pre-paid return shipping label, but even after confirming my address multiple times, I never received anything.  After three months of unfulfilled promises, I was left with no choice but to file a claim with amazon.  Be aware of this company.</li>
    <li> I really iked this product, but it took a long time to use it so you really have to have a free schedule. It&#x27;s not good if you have thirty million things to do. I have the free time to devote to it, so it worked just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I was really upset when they stopped making the disc replacements.  I decided to buy two new sets just to get the discs.  However, what I received was not what is shown in the picture.  It had only three discs.  It did not include the two small discs.  The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as when I use to shave, but that was so-o-o-o many years ago.  I read one of the previous reviews and learned something new.  You can brush off the discs (I wet brush mine) and it really makes the disc last a lot longer.  I wish I had saved mine over all the years!  I imagine they discontinued this great product because people don&#x27;t read instructions and tried to use it  on their underarms or some other tender place and then filed complaints!</li>
    <li> I burned myself with this. It went into the trash!</li>
    <li> The Conair hair remover works, but you need to be a bit gentle until you get used to it. Take your  time, don&#x27;t expect to get every hair the first few times.</li>
    <li> This sander barely did more than sand my legs. If I persisted long enough to actually remove hair, I paid for it for the next few days with sanded skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty alternative to the &amp;#34;Nair&#x27;s&amp;#34; of the world that smell and are hard on sensitive skin. Once yoi get the hang of it, it leave a nice smooth surface behind. Hair grows back faster then with the Epilady and Nair but those products don&#x27;t exfoliate. I think a mix of various hair removal systems is probably the best way to go...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair, just sort of twists it around and occasionally pulls one out. Incredibly painful if you skin is damp at all, including if you&#x27;re sweating, which is kind of unfortunate since the summer is generally when I like to get rid of hair. It is a nice exfoliant, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I used Smooth Away pads before, and it worked for me. Using them just took a lot of time.   Even after many negative reviews, I ordered Conair hair removal system to save time on hair removal. It works great for me. I use it 2-3 times per week. Using it first time took the longest time than the following one. Skin and hair needs to adjust to the device. Now I need only several minutes. I use it on my legs; my hair are dark and pretty thick. Constant usage of this method of hair removal allows hair to become thinner and eventually disappear.   I gave this product 4 stars, because I found difficult to find replacements discs for a good price.</li>
    <li> It works well as advertised. the design could use a little more off set of the handle to maneuver around curved surfaces. It needs stick on pads to make it easier and more environmentally friendly. Not so much waste in packaging for replacement sandpaper</li>
    <li> I found this to be an entirely useless product. You are more or less SANDING YOUR SKIN! And when I say sanding, I don&#x27;t mean like microdermabrasion. Pointless, painful, sanding of the skin. It does sand the hair down, but not any different than shaving does and it grows back just as fast. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Buy good wax and a warmer instead!</li>
    <li> did not like at all when you press down to lightly nothing happens and to hard causes bad scratching of the skin ouch, maybe I am just not skilled with it yet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this item.  Wow, just take a piece of sandpaper and use it instead.  That is what this is like, just sands off your hair and kills your legs! DONT BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Have not found another product that can do what this does for smooth feet.  Just takes a few minutes to use and then wipe off your feet with a towel.  I bought these a few years ago and it was a great price!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how had it is to still find this hair removal system. I had my last one for 8 years and loved it. Also defoliates sand works well on feet. So glad to find this replacement.</li>
    <li> Wife hates it waste of time and money :-(     I thought it would be good based on the other reviews</li>
    <li> Works well.  Takes time to get the technique down.  Hairs that grow in are softer and more downy, not like rough stubble.  Leaves legs very smooth.  Also this saves water for people who used to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Does what it says! Not a bad price. Make sure you have enough hair on you&#x27;re legs for it, and read the instructions.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and it dries out pretty easily. Unfortunately, my dry sensitive skin is paired with thick, coarse hair that grows back as soon as I get a chill.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this takes forever. Your basically sanding down your body to get rid of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, you&#x27;ll get determined to work on a stubborn hair or patch which in turn will &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; your leg.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, it dries out your skin, which is to be expected, but when you go to put lotion on, it&#x27;s not fun since the thing basically gave you extreme rug burn.</li>
    <li> I just didnt like it! it wasnt for me! I didnt like the way it felt on my skin and it felt like it was just scraping my skin and it didnt really remove the hair! I would not recommend</li>
    <li> Okay!!!  It works wonders sanding off dead skin but ouch it hurts for a few days.  It removes the hair and keeps it away for much longer than shaving but my legs are red with sanding burns for three days.  Okay in the winter but this summer not going to work.  I am hoping that my skin will toughen up to it and I will not get the \\&quot;rug burns\\&quot;.  So far not looking good on it though.  What a shame cause I really love how my legs feel when using this.  When the hair comes back in it doesn&#x27;t have the sharp end to it and makes the stubble much better to live with.  I am so hoping that this will work for me.</li>
    <li> Much better than shaving, waxing or tweezing. Its leaves the skin smooth!</li>
