<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very cheap and not flexible at all. I have never had so much of a hard time putting on lashes before.  I thought maybe it was a bad one it the pack but it turned out to be all of them.  Never again.  They seemed plastic more than anything.</li>
    <li> Love how fast they came, they are set individual boxes which is perfect for travel and are very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Should have combo - Maybe add a eyelash adhesive with package!</li>
    <li> First of all i just wanted to say I uploaded a photo so anyone interested in buying these could get a better idea of what they look like on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to sign for these when they arrived, which was odd lol I&#x27;ve been buying lashes from across the sea for over a year now and I do love them but im going to tell u right now no they don&#x27;t look natural. The band is thick and noticeable, the lashes themselves are also thick and are shiny if you are looking down and getting that point of view. This is something I&#x27;ve encountered with all the lashes I&#x27;ve bought over seas, so anyone telling you oh these look natural, no its a lie. Plastic lashes are very fake looking bc of the length and shine. But just bc they don&#x27;t look natural doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t beautiful. I love these lashes, its my first time buying crisscross lashes and they are definitely worth the buy. If your looking for natural looking lashes these aren&#x27;t the way to go, I suggest human hair lashes if your going for a full natural look since its very hard to find &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes that are plastic.</li>
    <li> Received these before estimated shipping date, they look really nice can&#x27;t wait to put them on !</li>
    <li> Ok for a dramatic look but not necessarily natural looking. Cannot be reused, I wished the overlaps were closer. just ok.</li>
    <li> Genuinely questioning all the reviewers that called these natural looking, these are horrible and way over the top! Also, there are very inflexible and plastic feeling. These remind me of costume eyelashes, I certainly could never see myself wearing these on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I love love love these lashes. They are so full and beautiful and if handle properly they can be reused! Check out www.cericonchetta.com</li>
    <li> I always get complimented on these! Many people ask if they&#x27;re my real lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do cut them down to size as they&#x27;re probably too long for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some other eyelash glue I already had with these, so I&#x27;m not sure how well the glue these come with works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for false eyelashes, I&#x27;d definitely suggest these as you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Super cute and different. Easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m completely in love with these lashes. Took exactly a month for them to get here but so worth it. They do feel a little stiff but that&#x27;s what makes team easier to put on (I&#x27;m not the greatest at putting on lashes) they&#x27;re not too dramatic and they&#x27;re not that natural either.will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> They are very long and pretty but have a plastic look.  I let my friend have them and they are very long and look kinda fake.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just got these and all i can say is I LOVE these lashes, wow its the perfect size and length. Not to dramatic, not to long and full looking so you still get noticed. It brings my eyes out. I love it will be ordering more for sure. The band on the lash is just right and the glue i use holds so well on this lash, it holds very nicely in place (Revlon lash Precision)</li>
    <li> In the package they look cheap... however I decide to try them on, I had to  cut the because my eyes are smaller, but once I put them on they really look great! I went to several places, nobody notice them, people said I look different, I look good, but they don&#x27;t know why. I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> The best lashes I&#x27;ve tried .. there long ..dramatic.. n noticeablee .. will b buyiin moree.. if dramatic is wat ur lookin for these r the lashes for uu ..</li>
    <li> These lashes are very nice, long, and full! The only downfall was that they were too long on the sides (if you don&#x27;t trim them to your eye length they will hurt) but if you cut them down you will be fine and you do get 10pairs. I have gotten things on Amazon thinking that it was more than one set and it wasn’t, so t you really do get 10 pairs of lashes.</li>
    <li> Same as image thank you</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE LASHES ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE MASCARA AND YOUR  GOOD I DO EYE LASHES FOR A LIVING THEY LAST FOR AT LEAST 1 WEEK BEEN USING THESE LASHES FOR 4 YEARS NOW.......</li>
    <li> Great product. 100% satisfied and quick shipping!!</li>
    <li> These are very cute. They are exactly as described.  The only downer is that the tube of glue they send is super tiny. Its a good thing I had some at home already. Great Buy for the price, though</li>
    <li> these were great just a bit too much for me</li>
    <li> Very thick and look plastic</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes so far!!!! Never tried criss cross lashes before but I love how natural they look with length plus fullness but very light weight. Not super fake looking or stiff plus they curl perfectly with the eyelash curler. I like these better then the $15 pair of lashes from MAC! Will not be wasting that much on a pair of lashes again!!!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes are definitely not worth it.  They are not flexible so placing them on made it a difficult task and they just looked too fake.  I sure know I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have small eyes, but these were slightly too big for my eye shape,&lt;br /&gt;so i trimmed them and then they were perfect!</li>
    <li> Not too short, not too long, not too thick, and not too thin.  Just right!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone.  I usually can wear them a full week before taking them off.  Also each pair has lasted no less than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love these!! The perfect false lash. Not too over dramatic but certainly noticeable! I bought 2 boxes and am thinking I might need more! :)</li>
    <li> Just a little thicker then I like. Nothing was wrong with the product</li>
    <li> they are full and long. they look great on but the glue ?  for the price unbeatable, have given away some and they like them</li>
    <li> Bought these lashes because they looked beautiful on my sister in law and ended up falling in love with them..</li>
    <li> These are very cute, better than expected they look like you&#x27;re wearing a few coats of mascara, dramatic but not overly dramatic. Easy to apply with a good eyelash adhesive. Don&#x27;t judge them in the package try them on!  The same pair can be worn several time if handled with care.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great for practicing putting on lashes!  The are not natural at all and are extremely heavy.  They are more like what you would see on a drag queen and or good for dramatic looks for going out sometimes.  But I like a more real and natural look.  So, that is why I gave it an okay rating.</li>
    <li> These lashes were pretty great, they give your eyes a very nice look and makes them look bigger, I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Ok. So I was skeptical about this purchase because I have purchased other large quantity of lashes and they were not so great. Oh ladies these lashes! They look very natural. Easy to flex and looks like the real thing. The picture you see make them look thicker than they really are. I take them off every night so they are reusable. If you love lashes, these are a must have in your kits. These I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Omg I love these  lashes I&#x27;m a free lance MUA and btw me and my clients there first choice, even though the look big and bold there not as dramatic which I like when I go for the bold look I double them and it&#x27;s beautiful these lashes are a must have ❤️❤️💄💄💋💋</li>
    <li> They were a gift for my daughter. She loves them and they seem to stay on pretty good for her.</li>
    <li> Really bad eye invention after one use. I threw the rest away. Cost me  a lot of money with the eye doctor and medicine. Never again</li>
    <li> CHEAP,AND Its a lot work to get in.I do lots of makeup&#x27;s and this lashes is so hard to stay on.Never buy again.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re way too stiff, long and heavy for use.  I like the fullness of lashes but these are way over the top.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the crisscross would be too thick and bold, but after wearing them, I decided I really like them!</li>
    <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;I always order it! &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;The best eyelashes ever! I wear these everyday. Every time I put make up on.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends!!</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THESE I AM STILL LEARNING .SO I THINK I AM GETTING IT, AND I LOVE THE LOOK</li>
    <li> Good quality lashes!I got thrm on time and its reusable. I was definitely impressed and will be ordering more in the future. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! I recommend buying dufferent eyelash adhesive! The one they sent along with the eyelashes wont last so long.</li>
    <li> i didnt like these. i was so excited to see them in the mail but when i opened the package i saw the eyelashes looked really cheap like there was glue on the band AND lashes. ugh, i also baught them because it said it comes with glue, i checked to see how it was but the damn things were empty! meaning i paid for glue and there was no freakin glue in any of them! and im really picky about how thick the bands are because they hurt the inner corner of my eye lids and i cant stand how uncomfortable they are.  man cheap s*** im not buying these lashes again, RED CHERRY all the way!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are great for the price. They took awhile to arrive but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I wanted them to look more real, but once I put them on, they looked like plastic . . .</li>
    <li> Like the lashes. They are a lil shorter then I was hoping for and the band is a bit thick but overall they are nice. Have used them twice and I was pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE LONG GORGEOUS,FULL AND THE PERFECT BLACK..PRETTY PACKAGE AND EACH SET IS INDIVIDUALLY BOXED..FAST SHIPPING AND GOOD BARGAIN I WILL RE-PURCHASE OFTEN</li>
    <li> Great packaging and best quality lashes you can find for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. They are full and dramatic. If you are looking for a full and bold lash then this product is for you. It&#x27;s a firm lash that holds up. It&#x27;s not wispy thin and the band is sold. I would buy again. Would recommend highly. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great!! They look natural (not over-done at all) and I&#x27;ve been able to use them sometimes for 5 to 6 uses each.... I don&#x27;t use the glue that they come with so I can&#x27;t comment on that... They are definitely one of my favourite!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 1 Dec 2013 - It&#x27;s safe to say that these have become a staple item for me ... for those people \\&quot;hating\\&quot; on these lashes ... please remember lashes appear differently on some people based on some factors; the shape of the eye, the size of the eye, application, etc - I&#x27;m still loving these!! Just one thing though .... I decided to open one of the glues that come with this product - EMPTY HAS HELL .... What&#x27;s up with that? It won&#x27;t change my mind about repurchasing though - I always do!! Try it - you just might like it!</li>
