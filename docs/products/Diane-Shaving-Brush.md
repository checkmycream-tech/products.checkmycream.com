      <li>a must for a perfect shave!</li>

      <li>Great deal.  </li>
      <li>Great brush for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great shaving brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a good reference of comparison to the horsehair this brush uses.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t in all good will recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>just as depicted so is a great value and service was excellent along with very fast</li>
      <li>Kind of a compromise material, and</li>
      <li>I usally face lather and this brush had no problem developing a nice lather for me.</li>
      <li>kind of like the handle.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s kind of sparse to begin with in that department.  </li>
      <li>This brush works up a nice lather, and it rather inexpensive.</li>
      <li>In all honesty I like it, its a great temporary shaving brush in my opinion if you need one quick or want one to try, this is the way to go</li>
      <li>others have said, it&#x27;s a very good brush for the price, and shipping was fast, so I got what I need for now.</li>
      <li>I was able to produce a good lather fairly easily.</li>
      <li>Either way, wasn&#x27;t even able to use it because it broke within 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the $50 boars hair brushes are somehow better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure because the label doesn&#x27;t say.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with it</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used many shaving brushes but with that being said, this one is just ok.  </li>
      <li>For an econmy brush this works much better than I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>When soaked nice soft bristles that develop a nice lather fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>and they nicely and professionally granted me a full refund of both price and S&amp;H. Super nice people!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap brush</li>
      <li>/&gt;The faux badger effect is a bit cheap, but</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s functional and not crap.</li>
      <li>but i bout another for a little more that has been great for 8 months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
      <li>Not enough bristles to do a good job lathering.</li>
      <li>use Creamo Shave Cream with it-- not the same as a good shaving soap bar, but acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>maybe 2 if lucky before I need to buy another one.</li>
      <li>The black handle is great.</li>
      <li>It is a great little brush and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
      <li>A nice brush, delivered in short order.</li>
      <li>people - here you go), but for a beginner, this is a good brush to try out and find out whether you are a wet shaving fan or not.</li>
      <li>and I received it pretty quick too.</li>
      <li>I stopped and turned the brush over and all the bristles came right off the handle.</li>
      <li>i bought this so I can dust off my firearms and works just right.</li>
      <li>delivery.thank you very much</li>
      <li>bristles of the brush are coming out from first day itself.</li>
      <li>Thanks million for my Dad!</li>
      <li>I used to use a double edge shaver many years ago, and wanted to begin to use one again.</li>
      <li>Decent brush, will fall apart quickly</li>
      <li>But after many uses still the same.</li>
      <li>Just in the first time my husband used the brush it started coming apart in chunks.</li>
      <li>Its cheap and so far it seems to be made well.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that there would be more bristles on the brush, but it does a reasonable job-- it just takes a few more strokes to cover my face.  </li>
      <li>Kind of to be expected</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok brush though, and it will do the job, so I will give it a solid three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an animal friendly material that is harvested from horse&#x27;s tails, which they regrow naturally.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re new or traveling and need a quick fix it can get the job done</li>
      <li>The brush felt nice against my face: soft and pleasant, not scratchy or rough, yet somewhat firm.</li>
      <li>Major flaw, though - the bristles came un-glued from the handle after about a month of use, but I was able to re-attach them using Gorilla glue, and so far it has held up for another couple months.</li>
      <li>, it do not make foam much.</li>
      <li>It was for me, better than expected</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t pay much attention to the name haha</li>
      <li>Nice everyday brush.  </li>
      <li>sure it isn&#x27;t as large as the other brushes</li>
      <li>This is a nice stiff brush with lots of backbone for face lathering.</li>
      <li>so I had to clean the extra out before I started.</li>
      <li>It has more backbone than badger hair, but is softer and less scratchy than boar bristle.</li>
      <li>but I personally will be buying one with more quality bristles because I feel like this shaving brush will last me maybe a month or</li>
      <li>Not as soft as expected but does the job either way for the price, will be shopping for a better brush soon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The knot didn&#x27;t fall out, the handle didn&#x27;t break, it didn&#x27;t shed hairs constantly, it made some decent lather, it felt nice on my skin, and it was extremely inexpensive.</li>
      <li>It is a little more prickly than I like</li>
      <li>It appears to be hollow but still has some weight to it and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or prone to breaking.</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last for too long because it will started shedding real quick.</li>
      <li>I thought that the knot was a bit small and would have appreciated a bit more hair to work with, but it is how it is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the bristles are a little courser than i would have wanted, but overall it is a nice brush for the price.</li>
      <li>Been using it for over a month and it is providing a decent shaving experience thus far.</li>
      <li>One could excuse that, and use it as a travel brush, but the handle is too bulky to be useful.</li>
      <li>see, I was in the middle of lathering when a large chuck of the bristles fell out of the plastic handle and into the sink.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 4 year old grandson so he can shave (no blade is used in the razor) along with his father.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft absorbent.</li>
      <li>I will be replacing it with a higher quality brush before too long</li>
      <li>Extremely &amp; completely unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>On close inspection, however, it looks like natural hair to me.</li>
      <li>This is a decent brush, especially given the price.  </li>
      <li>I found it not good , i am now using my hand , I found it better than this shaving brush , just wasting of money.</li>
      <li>I am new to traditional shaving and wanted an inexpensive brush.</li>
      <li>The brush was as advertised but loses its bristles easily</li>
      <li>generally well regarded.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a 27yr old male and just used my mom&#x27;s account</li>
      <li>During my first use trying to wet the brush for application, the entire brush fell out of the handle.  </li>
      <li>This is the most worse item I bought online &amp; the most worse shaving brush in my 45 yrs shaving life.</li>
      <li>If you peer into the bloom there is no black area on the internal</li>
      <li>On my third time today using this brush, the whole bristle assembly separated from the hollow handle.  </li>
      <li>I will advice the Famous Amazon to discontinue such worse item.&lt;br /&gt;Q.</li>
      <li>This is a decent travel brush or a brush for those starting traditional wet shaving.</li>
      <li>It would appear that the top half of the brush was bleached slightly, and then a black stripe was hastily painted or dyed around the outside.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought it for my dad as a present.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush based on the low price. (As the saying goes, You get what you pay for..)  On my third time today using this brush, the whole bristle assembly separated from the hollow handle.  It is so disappointing but at least Amazon has good return policies (I haven&#x27;t had the thing a week) Maybe it is a one off problem, but I will not try another.</li>
    <li> For the price, you get what you pay for. Some bristles were falling off so I had to clean the extra out before I started. The black handle is great. I shaved once with it and it lathers up great. I&#x27;m using &amp;#34;Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap&amp;#34; if you want to know which soap I used.  In all honesty I like it, its a great temporary shaving brush in my opinion if you need one quick or want one to try, this is the way to go but I personally will be buying one with more quality bristles because I feel like this shaving brush will last me maybe a month or maybe 2 if lucky before I need to buy another one. The quality of the bristles just isn&#x27;t there to meet my expectations personally.</li>
    <li> just as depicted so is a great value and service was excellent along with very fast delivery.thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush. I&#x27;m sure the $50 boars hair brushes are somehow better but this works. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up but there is no indication of poor design. It was for me, better than expected</li>
    <li> I used this brush three times before it fell apart and ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> A nice brush, delivered in short order.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used many shaving brushes but with that being said, this one is just ok.  I have had a few bristles come out and I think it&#x27;s kind of sparse to begin with in that department.  It is a little more prickly than I like but It does the job.  In this instance I think you do get what you pay for.  I probably wont be using it long and will be purchasing another in its place.</li>
    <li> After using it for about 2 weeks the brush started loosing its brush</li>
    <li> I opened the package and took the brush to the bathroom. I loaded the brush with my Arco shave soap and began lathering the soap on my hand. The moment I started the bristles began coming off. I stopped and turned the brush over and all the bristles came right off the handle. Contacted the supplier and they want to charge me a restocking fee upon return. How can you restock a defective item?!</li>
    <li> I found it not good , i am now using my hand , I found it better than this shaving brush , just wasting of money.</li>
    <li> Although I cannot recommend this brush, I recommend this seller completely.&lt;br /&gt;You see, I was in the middle of lathering when a large chuck of the bristles fell out of the plastic handle and into the sink. Really poorly made in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;However, I contacted the seller letting them know what happened and they nicely and professionally granted me a full refund of both price and S&amp;H. Super nice people! But I can&#x27;t in all good will recommend this brush. I&#x27;d say spend the extra $5 and get an Omega brush.</li>
    <li> It seems like it&#x27;s been used..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright brush for the price I got it to foam up for me sure it isn&#x27;t as large as the other brushes but you shouldn&#x27;t be displeased ....... I am pleased with it and I received it pretty quick too. I am a 27yr old male and just used my mom&#x27;s account so don&#x27;t pay much attention to the name haha</li>
    <li> This is a decent brush, especially given the price.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles or had any other problems.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.  You can be mentally challenged and still notice the value.  The plastic handle is for durability and not elegance, keep in mind</li>
    <li> I am new to traditional shaving and wanted an inexpensive brush. After researching this model I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is made of horsehair. This is an animal friendly material that is harvested from horse&#x27;s tails, which they regrow naturally. Horsehair is regarded as being somewhere between badger hair and boar bristle by shaving cognoscenti. It has more backbone than badger hair, but is softer and less scratchy than boar bristle. Kind of a compromise material, and generally well regarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon unboxing the brush I wetted it down and was surprised that there was no foul odor, in fact there was no odor at all. I wondered if it wasn&#x27;t horsehair after all but synthetic. On close inspection, however, it looks like natural hair to me. I see a few split ends and there appears to be some variation in fiber thickness. While I was rinsing it a few loose hairs fell out and then it ceased to shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faux badger effect is a bit cheap, but whatever. It would appear that the top half of the brush was bleached slightly, and then a black stripe was hastily painted or dyed around the outside. If you peer into the bloom there is no black area on the internal hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of like the handle. It reminds me of a stubby screwdriver or something. It appears to be hollow but still has some weight to it and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or prone to breaking. It is functional and I like the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a novice, but I used it to lather with a hard soap puck and gave it an initial test. I was able to produce a good lather fairly easily. The brush felt nice against my face: soft and pleasant, not scratchy or rough, yet somewhat firm. I thought that the knot was a bit small and would have appreciated a bit more hair to work with, but it is how it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knot didn&#x27;t fall out, the handle didn&#x27;t break, it didn&#x27;t shed hairs constantly, it made some decent lather, it felt nice on my skin, and it was extremely inexpensive.The knot is very sloppily constructed though, the top is uneven and looks like it was thrown together in a hurry. It&#x27;s an ok brush though, and it will do the job, so I will give it a solid three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be fine for a disposable brush, or for traveling where you don&#x27;t want to take an expensive one with you.</li>
    <li> the bristles are a little courser than i would have wanted, but overall it is a nice brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. It leaves brush hair on your face while using .</li>
    <li> I like this brush, use it myself and give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> i bought this so I can dust off my firearms and works just right. has a plastic handle, no hairs have come out.</li>
    <li> works perfect! a must for a perfect shave!</li>
    <li> Worst brush ever. Just in the first time my husband used the brush it started coming apart in chunks. Maybe we got a bad one but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> great product, beenusing for years</li>
    <li> I used to use a double edge shaver many years ago, and wanted to begin to use one again. For an econmy brush this works much better than I was expecting.  When soaked nice soft bristles that develop a nice lather fairly easily.  I usally face lather and this brush had no problem developing a nice lather for me.</li>
    <li> This got broken after just one use</li>
    <li> Nice everyday brush.  The bristles are soft absorbent.</li>
    <li> worked well.  Great deal.  Timely shipping.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not enough bristles to do a good job lathering. One could excuse that, and use it as a travel brush, but the handle is too bulky to be useful.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a replacement for an Art of Shaving travel brush that I left in a hotel (what a loss!).  Lots of the bristles have fallen out during normal use over the past few months.  Last week, big clumps of bristles started falling out.  I air dry the brush, bristles down.  I&#x27;m going to have to replace the brush soon - there won&#x27;t be any bristles left.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality. Not very big but it can create a lather. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last for too long because it will started shedding real quick.</li>
    <li> The brush was as advertised but loses its bristles easily</li>
    <li> bristles of the brush are coming out from first day itself. It is getting thin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it do not make foam much.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, after one use the brush came away from the base and I am no longer able to use it.</li>
    <li> fell apart almost immediately. Kind of to be expected but i bout another for a little more that has been great for 8 months.</li>
    <li> Extremely &amp; completely unsatisfied. Bristles coming out from the base &amp; stuck on the skin, cause itching and damaging expensive razor blades. I thought it may stop after couple of shaves. But after many uses still the same. This is the most worse item I bought online &amp; the most worse shaving brush in my 45 yrs shaving life. I did a mistake: I should return it back on time, not for the money back, but for compensation for the damage of costly razor blades &amp; my costly time. I will advice the Famous Amazon to discontinue such worse item.&lt;br /&gt;Q. Haq&lt;br /&gt;FDNY</li>
    <li> Mine loses hairs pretty often, and I have had to re-glue the head to the handle once. But it works.</li>
    <li> It is a great little brush and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Been using it for over a month and it is providing a decent shaving experience thus far. By no means would a die hard wet shaver find it acceptable however.</li>
    <li> This is a decent travel brush or a brush for those starting traditional wet shaving. It&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;s functional and not crap. It is either boar hair or synthetic. I&#x27;m not 100% sure because the label doesn&#x27;t say. Either way I know it&#x27;s not badger hair as it is too coarse and low quality. Either way it is an inexpensive way to fill your shaving needs.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as expected but does the job either way for the price, will be shopping for a better brush soon.</li>
    <li> Decent brush, will fall apart quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 year old grandson so he can shave (no blade is used in the razor) along with his father. It&#x27;s all about father and son together, father teaching son some of the little things about life.</li>
    <li> sheds and will replace soon ...but with another brand</li>
    <li> My Dad lost his brush during the holidays.  He&#x27;s had it for the last 40 some odd years.  Could not find it in any store.  Thanks million for my Dad!</li>
    <li> Did the job up not very soft</li>
    <li> During my first use trying to wet the brush for application, the entire brush fell out of the handle.  Poorly made.  However could have just been my brush.  Either way, wasn&#x27;t even able to use it because it broke within 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> this brush doesnt retain water and irritated my face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap brush but you get what you paid for.  If you&#x27;re new or traveling and need a quick fix it can get the job done</li>
    <li> This brush works up a nice lather, and it rather inexpensive. Major flaw, though - the bristles came un-glued from the handle after about a month of use, but I was able to re-attach them using Gorilla glue, and so far it has held up for another couple months. I will be replacing it with a higher quality brush before too long (Christmas ideas people - here you go), but for a beginner, this is a good brush to try out and find out whether you are a wet shaving fan or not. I would give 2-1/2 stars if half-stars were an option.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that there would be more bristles on the brush, but it does a reasonable job-- it just takes a few more strokes to cover my face.  I&#x27;ve never used boar or badger bristle brushes before, so I don&#x27;t have a good reference of comparison to the horsehair this brush uses.  But it&#x27;s definitely a step up from the crummy brush I used before with synthetic bristles that shed a lot and a handle that was prone to breaking.  The handle on this brush holds up well, and rarely loses bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Creamo Shave Cream with it-- not the same as a good shaving soap bar, but acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it&#x27;s a very good brush for the price, and shipping was fast, so I got what I need for now.</li>
    <li> This is a nice stiff brush with lots of backbone for face lathering.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush does its job. Its cheap and so far it seems to be made well. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> DID NOT RECIEVE THE CORRECT ITEM! ORDERED A SHAVING BRUSH AND WE ENDED UP RECIEVING A 25 pc. PLASTIC MAKEUP SPATULA PACK!  AND WE PAID FOR THE SHAVING BRUSH!</li>
