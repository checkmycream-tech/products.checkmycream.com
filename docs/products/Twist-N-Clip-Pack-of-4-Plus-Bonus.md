### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best price ever.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just saying cheaper price is not alwasys the best way to go&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;So be warned, if your buying these clips from a vendor not in the USA, there is a very good chance you&#x27;re getting a knock</li>
      <li>Great assortment - priced perfect- great innovation .</li>
      <li>These work great</li>
      <li>Why would I ever want to go to BBB with this great service?</li>
      <li>This thing works great.</li>
      <li>love these clips because they keep my hair up and in wonderful condition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from that, these clips are great and I reach for these more often than I reach for my claw clips now.</li>
      <li>No pulling , no breaking, easy for arthritic fingers, stylish ( make your own beaded tail!!!!)</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s kind of wasteful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice not having my hair get all tangled in a ponytail band.  </li>
      <li>Good thing I didn&#x27;t purchase more than 2 boxes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving the 5 star rating for the genuine product because these work great and are very easy to use.</li>
      <li>, they are flexible and easy to use even without a mirror!  </li>
      <li>I ordered these off Amazon because it was very cheap.</li>
      <li>Someone is making very cheap plastic and trying to pass it off as authentic.</li>
      <li>But I still love them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dangling charm is cute and helps dress up your up-do if you&#x27;re feeling a bit more dressy.</li>
      <li>she loves it says it works better than any clip she has had</li>
      <li>I am a dragon boat racer so having my hair up and off my head is critical and these work great!  </li>
      <li>and we order more because the women she works with all wanted some.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these clips.</li>
      <li>I wanted more since they work so well.</li>
      <li>I would have done better at a Dollar store.</li>
      <li>I love them over hair ties.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>&quot; I was able to creat a goo-looking half-updo on the first try with the Twist &#x27;n Clip and that, for me is the mark of a good product.</li>
      <li>Amazon makes it easy and if your a prime member the shipping is free!  </li>
      <li>It goes in the hook quite easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to lose them</li>
      <li>I have medium size hair and the clip is quite strong.</li>
      <li>Charm was cheap plastic, looking nothing like crystal.</li>
      <li>The product was billed as being great for fine hair but, even though my hair is long, it will not hold.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased these at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.  </li>
      <li>They could keep the gem string and make the clips in the original material.</li>
      <li>I had to order more, my grand daughter with super long hair took my first package,!!!</li>
      <li>These clips  aren&#x27;t really clips but they are more comfy than the hair claws.</li>
      <li>I was lucky to find them now on Amazon as they are no longer sold at BBB.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve found that nothing else works for you then these are well worth the price.</li>
      <li>These are thinner and not as nice as the ones I bought at Wal-Mart last year.</li>
      <li>It tends to bend and loosen pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought a package of Twist n&#x27; Clips off the official website last year and was very very happy with them, they were great for my long thick hair.</li>
      <li>I do wish there was an option for a large size too!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t do all the fancy styles that are advertised as being easy with these, and my hair does come loose when I&#x27;m running, but they&#x27;re much more comfortable than claw clips when you&#x27;re doing any sort of workout that requires you to be on your back.  </li>
      <li>the envelope was pretty smashed up from shipping.</li>
      <li>Well, I love trying out different products for putting up my hair.</li>
      <li>service received from Amazon was very prompt and scheduled to the exact date of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I need the large ones.</li>
      <li>box and the pamphlets all look like the real thing, but when it came to the clips themselves, they paled in comparison to the real thing.</li>
      <li>They are as great at securing my thin hair.</li>
      <li>, these are comfortable enough to sleep with.</li>
      <li>While the real clips bend while in use, but eventually it will &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; back to it&#x27;s original shape or close to it.</li>
      <li>Love the twist n clips but these were made of a softer plastic and do not hold their shape, thus do not hold the hair as well as other twist n clips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>These are not the same material as the ones originally sold.</li>
      <li>Same old problem everyone has with clips and fine hair, the only difference was, this one specifically mentioned the ability to use it in fine hair...</li>
      <li>My favorite feature of this twist n clip is that it&#x27;s not bulky, and I can rest my head against a head rest or lie down unlike the bulky monster claws that just jab into your head.&lt;br</li>
      <li>wish the brown was really a brown rather than the bronze that is neither the color of brown hair nor the color of blonde hair--and thus doesn&#x27;t really work for anyone unless you are hiding the whole clip.</li>
      <li>I have super fine and thick hair that is shoulder length.  </li>
      <li>First off, instead of getting 2 different sizes.</li>
      <li>Also the fake clips plastic is smooth and shiny, while the real clips is matteand kind of has a rough texture on the plastic</li>
      <li>My hair has shorter layers and is not particularly thick, so there&#x27;s only so much these things can do.  </li>
      <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t flexible and therfore is less comfortable.</li>
      <li>The first set of Twist-n-Clips I bought a couple of years ago were very strong and could hold my thick long hair all day.  </li>
      <li>I thought my daughters would love this ,but it is too hard to use and sticks out like a sore thumb.</li>
      <li>I was surprised as I ordered it one day</li>
      <li>The plastic material is not the same as the REAL product.</li>
      <li>This current batch seems to be made of a much softer plastic.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried putting up all my hair yet--and the clips, honestly, look a little small for that but am encouraged to try given that</li>
      <li>At least i got my free shipping but did NOT receive my extra 4 clips as advertised....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great design, but I&#x27;m disappointed in its sturdiness.</li>
      <li>I have thick, wavy, fly away, long hair (down past my pants pockets).</li>

<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> My daughter, who also has long thick hair but with a much silkier/smoother texture, loves these clips as well.</li>
<li> the dangle charm was not clear color, but an amber brown color.&lt;br</li>
<li> Because I have thick hair, I normally use the larger sized clip, but in a pinch I can use the medium sized clip.</li>
<li> This would not come close to closing in my hair doing a french twist or even half up french twist.  </li>
<li> Comes in black, blonde and a copper red color .</li>
<li> None have broken as I thought they would have when I first felt them.</li>
<li> Put hair up wet or dry-</li>
<li> Very few work as advertised--and a number of them just create messy updos that are really</li>
<li> big one little that worked well.</li>
<li> I have very thick straight hair</li>
<li> they were missing the two big ones</li>
<li> Not real.</li>
<li> These are MUCH more flimsy than the \\&quot;real\\&quot; ones, they do not hold my thick hair AT ALL, and are basically useless to me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a bit of a struggle to clip it because I have such thick</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t like to leave it down when I sleep</li>
<li> I ended up with 4 medium sized clips (2 brown, 2 black) also</li>
<li> the half updo worked.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have thick long hair and wanted it to put my hair up.</li>
<li> Hair ties, when I can find ones that are strong enough to work, tangle and tear my hair terribly.</li>
<li> I use them everyday.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you purchase it from an authorized seller.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, after daily use for a year, they had all either been lost or broken, so I ordered these to replace them, assuming they were the same product.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair that is down to my waist</li>
<li> but this crap isn&#x27;t even worth my time and trouble.</li>
<li> /&gt;The fake clips are made of different material and cheaper plastic.</li>
<li> I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but unfortunately they are a cheaper plastic than the ones I had before.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought a package of Twist n&#x27; Clips off the official website last year and was very very happy with them, they were great for my long thick hair. Unfortunately, after daily use for a year, they had all either been lost or broken, so I ordered these to replace them, assuming they were the same product. They are not! These are MUCH more flimsy than the \\&quot;real\\&quot; ones, they do not hold my thick hair AT ALL, and are basically useless to me. I am trying to get a refund from the seller because I am very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> these suck!!! I am returning mine asap!!!!!!!!! Let&#x27;s just saying cheaper price is not alwasys the best way to go&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I had to order more, my grand daughter with super long hair took my first package,!!! Keep hair in check!</li>
    <li> I am almost 60 and have below-shoulder length hair . I always have my hair up. These clips  aren&#x27;t really clips but they are more comfy than the hair claws. No pulling , no breaking, easy for arthritic fingers, stylish ( make your own beaded tail!!!!) and makes wearing a garden hat or any hat comfy. Put hair up wet or dry- these babies hold forever !!!! Hair doesn&#x27;t fall or pull out. Comes in black, blonde and a copper red color . Great assortment - priced perfect- great innovation .</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, fly away, long hair (down past my pants pockets). Hair ties, when I can find ones that are strong enough to work, tangle and tear my hair terribly. In the 80&#x27;s I used to use those banana clips but would spring those after a couple months use. Regular store barrettes don&#x27;t even come close to working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these clips because they keep my hair up and in wonderful condition. There&#x27;s no tangling or tearing. With my hair I need to use two of the larger clips so it&#x27;s kind of wasteful. I wish you could buy them individually as the smaller ones don&#x27;t work for me. My daughter, who also has long thick hair but with a much silkier/smoother texture, loves these clips as well. If you&#x27;ve found that nothing else works for you then these are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008OJXO02 Twist n Clip]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service received from Amazon was very prompt and scheduled to the exact date of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;When I received this package AS SEEN ON TV TWIST N CLIP I was totally disgusted to find nothing but 4 pieces of plastic clips similar to plastic used in clothing merchandise as a part of their display to hold the garment in place.  At least i got my free shipping but did NOT receive my extra 4 clips as advertised....would like to be reimbursed for the $14.99 purchase but this crap isn&#x27;t even worth my time and trouble.</li>
    <li> These are thinner and not as nice as the ones I bought at Wal-Mart last year. They bend out of shape so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are the only hair clips I can get to hold up and out of my way my middle of the back hair.  The best price ever.</li>
    <li> The last order I purchased had 2 big and 2 smaller clips. This one only had the smaller ones. I need the large ones.</li>
    <li> I had purchased these at a chain store and lost them in a move.  I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but unfortunately they are a cheaper plastic than the ones I had before.  They won&#x27;t stay in my hair and become warped after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had and used these for over a year now. None have broken as I thought they would have when I first felt them. They are as great at securing my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have ordered several times and given these to my daughters. I use them everyday. I love them over hair ties. Barrettes almost anything. They don&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Substandard product , inferior material . Would not stay in my hair . Charm was cheap plastic, looking nothing like crystal.I would have done better at a Dollar store. Will not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Well, I love trying out different products for putting up my hair. Very few work as advertised--and a number of them just create messy updos that are really \\&quot;updon&#x27;ts.\\&quot; I was able to creat a goo-looking half-updo on the first try with the Twist &#x27;n Clip and that, for me is the mark of a good product. I haven&#x27;t tried putting up all my hair yet--and the clips, honestly, look a little small for that but am encouraged to try given that the half updo worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the brown was really a brown rather than the bronze that is neither the color of brown hair nor the color of blonde hair--and thus doesn&#x27;t really work for anyone unless you are hiding the whole clip.</li>
    <li> CVS stopped carrying the twist n clip. I wanted more since they work so well. I ordered two boxes last week. The plastic material is not the same as the REAL product. Someone is making very cheap plastic and trying to pass it off as authentic. Not real. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you purchase it from an authorized seller. I don&#x27;t have time to return or exchange things online. Good thing I didn&#x27;t purchase more than 2 boxes. Junk.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. I have a ton of hair and the twist n clip keeps it up all day.</li>
    <li> These were an inferior product for twist n clip.  Love the twist n clips but these were made of a softer plastic and do not hold their shape, thus do not hold the hair as well as other twist n clips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These fell apart and did not hold any legnth of hair up. We bought these as the grab bag gifts for Christmas, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Flimsy &amp; over priced for what they are.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t poke my head or pull the hair out of my scalp. Not great for a ponytail. But I still love them. I have long hair and I don&#x27;t like to leave it down when I sleep, these are comfortable enough to sleep with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these clips. I gave one yo a girl at work and now everybody asks me where I git them from.</li>
    <li> she loves it says it works better than any clip she has had and we order more because the women she works with all wanted some.</li>
    <li> I have medium size hair and the clip is quite strong. It goes in the hook quite easily. I do wish there was an option for a large size too!</li>
    <li> These are not the same material as the ones originally sold. They could keep the gem string and make the clips in the original material. This stuff isn&#x27;t flexible and therfore is less comfortable. Also these are one medium size not the one big one little that worked well. They don&#x27;t hold my hair well now,  when before I could do my hair all up or partly up.</li>
    <li> The first set of Twist-n-Clips I bought a couple of years ago were very strong and could hold my thick long hair all day.  This current batch seems to be made of a much softer plastic.  It tends to bend and loosen pretty quickly.  It&#x27;s such a great design, but I&#x27;m disappointed in its sturdiness.</li>
    <li> It says two jumbo and two small I ended up getting 4 small. I have thick long hair and wanted it to put my hair up. I was upset when I found that I had gotten 4 small ones.</li>
    <li> I have super fine and thick hair that is shoulder length.  This would not come close to closing in my hair doing a french twist or even half up french twist.  It is made for people with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; amount of hair.</li>
    <li> That was not the regular I use to buy they were missing the two big ones, I was very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do all the fancy styles that are advertised as being easy with these, and my hair does come loose when I&#x27;m running, but they&#x27;re much more comfortable than claw clips when you&#x27;re doing any sort of workout that requires you to be on your back.  My hair has shorter layers and is not particularly thick, so there&#x27;s only so much these things can do.  It&#x27;s nice not having my hair get all tangled in a ponytail band.  It&#x27;s really easy to lose them and I think they&#x27;re a little expensive.  They&#x27;re horribly uncomfortable under a bike helmet.  Wear your ponytail holders for that if you&#x27;re a cyclist.</li>
    <li> The product was billed as being great for fine hair but, even though my hair is long, it will not hold.  Same old problem everyone has with clips and fine hair, the only difference was, this one specifically mentioned the ability to use it in fine hair...but, alas, not true.  Lots of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I thought my daughters would love this ,but it is too hard to use and sticks out like a sore thumb. Looks like you have a twig sticking out of your hair.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased these at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.  I have really thick hair that is down to my waist and I was looking for something simple to tie it up in a bun on my head.  These work great, they are flexible and easy to use even without a mirror!  I am a dragon boat racer so having my hair up and off my head is critical and these work great!  I was lucky to find them now on Amazon as they are no longer sold at BBB.  Amazon makes it easy and if your a prime member the shipping is free!  I was surprised as I ordered it one day and they arrived the very next!  Why would I ever want to go to BBB with this great service?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the 5 star rating for the genuine product because these work great and are very easy to use. I have very thick straight hair and it keeps my hair up all day. I&#x27;ve even used this while working out at the gym and it manages to keep my hair up while I&#x27;m running, cycling, or doing an aerobic step class. My favorite feature of this twist n clip is that it&#x27;s not bulky, and I can rest my head against a head rest or lie down unlike the bulky monster claws that just jab into your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dangling charm is cute and helps dress up your up-do if you&#x27;re feeling a bit more dressy. The box comes with 4 clips (2 larges and 2 mediums) Because I have thick hair, I normally use the larger sized clip, but in a pinch I can use the medium sized clip. It&#x27;s just a bit of a struggle to clip it because I have such thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the product I received. I ordered these off Amazon because it was very cheap. It was about $6, so I thought, &amp;#34;What a steal!&amp;#34; So I ordered the product from a third party vendor not realizing they were NOT in the USA. When I finally received the package it was shipped from China and the envelope was pretty smashed up from shipping. Since this was shipping from China and the box of the Twist N Clip says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34; all over the boxes, I was suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box and the pamphlets all look like the real thing, but when it came to the clips themselves, they paled in comparison to the real thing. First off, instead of getting 2 different sizes. I ended up with 4 medium sized clips (2 brown, 2 black) also the dangle charm was not clear color, but an amber brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fake clips are made of different material and cheaper plastic. Once I use the clip, the plastic bends and stays bent. While the real clips bend while in use, but eventually it will &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; back to it&#x27;s original shape or close to it. Also the fake clips plastic is smooth and shiny, while the real clips is matteand kind of has a rough texture on the plastic and it feels more durable than the fake clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be warned, if your buying these clips from a vendor not in the USA, there is a very good chance you&#x27;re getting a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, these clips are great and I reach for these more often than I reach for my claw clips now.</li>
