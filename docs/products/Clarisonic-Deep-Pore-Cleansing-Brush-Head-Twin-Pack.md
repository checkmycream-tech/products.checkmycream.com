      <li>i want it better packing.</li>
      <li>and I love these brush heads.</li>
      <li>I love these brush heads.  </li>
      <li>I love the Clarisonic cleansing products.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that the outer band of the brush is longer and will clean more efficiently the crease between the nose and cheeks.  </li>
      <li>I feel nice and clean when Im done.</li>
      <li>Washing the face feeling very clean</li>
      <li>Great better cleaning than the sensitive one.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with how reasonably  priced they were and how fast they were delivered.  </li>
      <li>and these ones are very soft and feel great on your face.</li>
      <li>I have not doubt my skin is clean when I use the Clarisonic!  </li>
      <li>The brush works, but I would prefer a better fit.</li>
      <li>For those reviewers who said this is not real Clarisonic, these brush heads fit my Clarisonic Mia2 perfectly...</li>
      <li>Go get one now, or order one from Amazon, it will change your life, the refills are easily accessable and affordable.  </li>
      <li>I also received these very quickly, even though they are not under Prime.</li>
      <li>You didn&#x27;t spend $140-$200+ just to skimp on a cheap knock off.</li>
      <li>Also, when I ordered it, I had a message that this order qualified for free shipping</li>
      <li>I understand they are cheap</li>
      <li>I have had my clarisonic for over two years now and so replacing the brushes is important.  </li>
      <li>I would say that these brush heads are even softer than the genuine \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads, which makes me question the cleaning</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s available to me.</li>
      <li>Just as good as what I ordered directly from Clarisonic</li>
      <li>The price is good for two heads, brush holds up well with frequent use, I&#x27;ve used it longer than the 3 months recommended.</li>
      <li>A bunch of hair on this replacement brush head started to fall out after the first use!!</li>
      <li>My face feels so clean and smooth after using them.  </li>
      <li>I found that if I used the Clarisonic every other day with very gentle pressure, I get the best results.</li>
      <li>As promised, they were in the original Clarisonic retail boxes with plastic brush covers.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brushes are counterfeit as well because after a week, they carried this stench that never happened before when I bought the brushes off Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>These work fine, but I&#x27;m wondering if the real ones should work better.  </li>
      <li>Clean my skin well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very metro guy &amp; it&#x27;s very important to take care of your skin.</li>
      <li>Just the right size!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic and worth trying if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
      <li>Thanks love them.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel nice and soft like never before.</li>
      <li>They clean much better than the normal brushes do.</li>
      <li>I have a great complexion due to this brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Loved how quickly my order arrived.</li>
      <li>I much prefer these brushes to the ones that came with the Clarisonic, sensitive skin or whatever, I feel like they clean deeper and more comfortably.</li>
      <li>bristles are MUCH softer than those on the genuine brush heads.  </li>
      <li>Much like many of the reviews here, (which I should have payed more attention to prior to ordering)</li>
      <li>These brush heads do a pretty good deep cleaning job, but must be used consistently to get results.  </li>
      <li>I thought the bristles would be stronger than the ones on the original (sensitive skin) brush head I had, but it fits on my Mia just fine.</li>
      <li>Has made a great impact in my daily skin care, and works well with my original clarasonic cleaning brush and has worked well for my sister&#x27;s mia clarasonic cleaning brush (which is the smaller version of the clarasonic cleaning brush).</li>
      <li>If you use the Clairsonic and have large pores, you must purchase these!</li>
      <li>This brush is amazing, and I use it twice daily (the Clarisonic) for facial cleansing that cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;Noticeably different texture, smoother, smaller pores, wonderful!!!</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>Hard to find these brush head at a great price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Clarisonic cleaning system is terrific.  It has even helped with my milia which are a bain of my existence!  LOL</li>
    <li> I thought the bristles would be stronger than the ones on the original (sensitive skin) brush head I had, but it fits on my Mia just fine.</li>
    <li> It does say deep pore brush but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so rough on my skin.  I should have gotten the sensitive brush I guess.</li>
    <li> Great but expensive, try Sonimart.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price! Same quality as the ones from Macy&#x27;s for a fraction of the price can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Great better cleaning than the sensitive one. Would recommend to anyone who has deep pores and blackheads. Buy here its cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic for over 10 years.  The price of a single replacement head was $25.00 which at this time was a little steep for my budget. Getting two replacement heads for under $20.00 was a deal I couldn&#x27;t pass up. I just hope my Clarisonic outlasts the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> these are real clarisonic replacements. i&#x27;m very happy with this price. arrived in clarisonic box and compared to my other brushes they are identical.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  The price for this item was amazing...much lower than I have seen anywhere else.  I would highly recommend shopping here for this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Clarisonic  for almost 4 years, while friends of mine have used &#x27;lesser&#x27; products.  Mine just keeps going &amp; going&lt;br /&gt;&amp; going etc.</li>
    <li> Clean my skin well.  Not too soft.  Works well with my Aria clarisonic face cleaner.  I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> For those reviewers who said this is not real Clarisonic, these brush heads fit my Clarisonic Mia2 perfectly...they ARE real Clarisonic heads.  What a deal!  I ordered three twin packs and will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! Excellent cleansing brushes for the Clairsonic. I have tried all the brushes and I keep coming back to theses brushes.</li>
    <li> Got these for my clarisonic and they work very well. I was impressed with how reasonably  priced they were and how fast they were delivered.  Will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> everything clarisonic is A-1.  Although I haven&#x27;t used all their creams the devices (I have 3) and brushes are superb.</li>
    <li> When I first got my Clarisonic it came with the sensitive brush head.  When I first used the deep pore one it felt more abrasive (almost painfully so) for a few days.  Since then my skin as adjusted and I see a difference in my pores, blackheads, and texture of my skin.  I would recommend easing into this brush head if you have sensitive skin or have used the sensitive brush previously.</li>
    <li> These are definitely knock off brushes!! I ordered them, thought they looked a little different. Used them for a bit and my face started breaking out. So I finally went to the mall after ordering 2 different brushes from amazon and realized they are totally different. These SUCKS!!!</li>
    <li> If you use the Clairsonic and have large pores, you must purchase these! I don&#x27;t understand how the different brushes work but these definitely do!</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased a 3 pack from another seller on Amazon, and although the product worked decently, I had suspicions the product was a dupe. These came in the actual Clarisonic packaging. The other ones I had purchased from the other seller came in separate plastic zip baggies. Love the deep pore cleansing brush heads. Always cleans my face amazingly well so that when I tone, there&#x27;s not much dirt or oil left. Will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in results between the regular brush head and the more expensive deep pore one.&lt;br /&gt;Others might.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, and I use it twice daily (the Clarisonic) for facial cleansing that cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;Noticeably different texture, smoother, smaller pores, wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> if you don&#x27;t have a clarisonic you need to get one.  Go get one now, or order one from Amazon, it will change your life, the refills are easily accessable and affordable.  I love them!!</li>
    <li> I have the Clarisonic Aria and can&#x27;t live without it.  This is a great price on the brushes so stock up now!</li>
    <li> i use this product twice a day and it makes my skin feel nice and soft like never before. i wouldn&#x27;t return this product ever.</li>
    <li> I have had my clarisonic for over two years now and so replacing the brushes is important.  This is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> clarasonic is an awesome product for cleaning your skin. This twin replacement pack is a good deal. I recommend this to anyone who uses clarasonic and needs replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic.  When I purchased it, it came with the normal brushes.  These I feel like they really clean deeper than the others but are gentle on my skin at the same time.</li>
    <li> they are not the same as the one from Clarisonic.  I can still use them even they are not as soft.  but should this seller make it clear the ones they are selling is compatible, but not originals?</li>
    <li> Purchased the replacement brush heads for my wife at more than half the price charged by the bigger retailers.  Same product as what is available in stores.  Highly recommend you try them for yourselves.</li>
    <li> Has made a great impact in my daily skin care, and works well with my original clarasonic cleaning brush and has worked well for my sister&#x27;s mia clarasonic cleaning brush (which is the smaller version of the clarasonic cleaning brush).</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and works great, plus you can&#x27;t beat the value.  It looks very authentic, it came in the original Clarisonic packaging.</li>
    <li> I would have purchased these sooner had I known they were on Amazon.  I paid a lot of money for my Clairsonic years ago.  I am now glad to have interchangeable cleaning heads.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for these brushes. Product arrived as promised and the packaging was intact. I plan on buying these again and again.</li>
    <li> Love these with my clarisonic face cleaner tool. Last for 3-4months. Have bought multiple times. I feel nice and clean when Im done.</li>
    <li> I ordered these mainly so when I need the refill it&#x27;s available to me. It&#x27;s suggested you use a new one every 90 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved how quickly my order arrived.</li>
    <li> They work great......but turned yellow after just a few weeks.......:/ Ew. To clean my face with a yellow brush head or not to clean my face with a yellow brush head......it hurt - but I tossed em.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very metro guy &amp; it&#x27;s very important to take care of your skin. Everyone needs a Mia &amp; this brush makes my skin feel baby soft &amp; keeps me blemish free.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the brushes. I prefer the green ones. I think those are for sensitive skin. But my husband uses these.</li>
    <li> These brush heads do a pretty good deep cleaning job, but must be used consistently to get results.  Skin looks better, but with continuous use I hope to see further improvement.</li>
    <li> I like using the Clarisonic face cleaner, so finding these through Amazon at a big savings I ordered.  I use with any facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have tried different ones but these beat them all. This brush cleans your pores so well and also exfoliates skin. It is great for people who have a lot of blackheads as it pulls all the dirt out. You might break out first few days but it is worth it. Great deal to buy two at once too. Love it!</li>
    <li> These are not authentic Clarisonic Brush Heads.&lt;br /&gt;No where near the quality of true Clarisonic products. I was suspicious when I received the product, but tested it anyway. It made my new Aria make an awful clicking noise and didn&#x27;t cleanse any better than the head I had just replaced (after 3 months use).&lt;br /&gt;Like you I was trying to save a few bucks, but let&#x27;s be real ladies. You didn&#x27;t spend $140-$200+ just to skimp on a cheap knock off. Utilize your investment.</li>
    <li> I did a video review, but the file was too big for Amazon, so I posted it on YouTube at &lt;http://youtu.be/UDSb8PjVJMc&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband ordered these for me just after I signed up for the automatic delivery from Clarisonic.com.  Both packages arrived within days of each other, so I was able to compare them side by side.  These, compared to the brush heads that arrived from the factory store, are softer, less dense and the moving part is a little less smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are less dense on these than on the genuine brush heads.  Upon first use, one of the bristles fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are MUCH softer than those on the genuine brush heads.  Even my young daughter said that the \\&quot;amazon brush\\&quot; was \\&quot;so much softer.\\&quot;  I would say that these brush heads are even softer than the genuine \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads, which makes me question the cleaning capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center part that turns and vibrates when attached to the cleaning tool is not as smooth when it turns as the genuine one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sure that these are not genuine.  The inscriptions on the back of the brush head are not the same, so they are definitely being manufactured in a different factory.  Another reviewer claimed to have received a used one.  I used one once and noticed it was inferior quality to what I had been using.  It would not surprise me from a company that sells knock-offs that they would just put it back on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it does actually work on the Mia and it probably cleans fine. It&#x27;s just not genuine, so don&#x27;t expect it to be the same quality. For me, if I&#x27;m going to go through the expense and trouble of washing my face with a $200 tool, I&#x27;m going to want the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE: The Clarisonic store has lousy customer service, but if you sign up for the automatic delivery, the price is not much more.  Apparently in September the Clarisonic website is rolling out a way to access your account online soyou can cancel your subscription.  Until then, don&#x27;t bother calling them unless you have an hour to sit on hold.</li>
    <li> I have had the Clarisonic machine for 3 years and just moved to the sensitive brush head. It has changed the look and feel of my complexion. I love it!</li>
    <li> Have used this brush head before and like it better than the other ones.  Try it if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
    <li> Have oily skin in the south and I love these brush heads. They get everything so clean and keep your skin very clear. LOVE!</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews stating the product was fake, I was skeptical in purchasing. However, the product did arrive in actual Clarisonic packaging, fit my Mia, and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews after I ordered and thought I&#x27;d be unhappy.  But that wasn&#x27;t the case.  These work great! Just as good as what I ordered directly from Clarisonic but with more money left in my pocket.</li>
    <li> These work fine, but I&#x27;m wondering if the real ones should work better.  These are NOT clarisonic.  These are a counterfeit.  The lids do not snap on like the real ones but fall off.</li>
    <li> This brush cleans really well without drying out your face or irritating it. I have a great complexion due to this brush.</li>
    <li> its not worth the price</li>
    <li> They seem a bit different than the ones that came with my clarasonic but they still work so I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I much prefer these brushes to the ones that came with the Clarisonic, sensitive skin or whatever, I feel like they clean deeper and more comfortably.</li>
    <li> the production is very good. my friend is very love it . i want it better packing. very like it</li>
    <li> Love these. They seem like the real clarisonic brush heads and I would purchase these ones again. Thanks love them.</li>
    <li> Has made my skin so much better!</li>
    <li> What a deal.  If you have seen these things on the Clarisonic website or in a retail store you know they are ridiculously expensive well this was the exact same thing, same box even that I saw last night in Belks and their twin back was $48.00.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I believe these are authentic pieces from Clarisonic. Cheaper than buying in a store. I found that if I used the Clarisonic every other day with very gentle pressure, I get the best results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but decided to give it a try..it&#x27;s fantastic and worth trying if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic is the best cleansing system that i have ever used.  There are visible improvements in my skin. I would highly recommend for any skin types.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase replacement brush heads from Macy&#x27;s (twin pack for $40) but I decided to shop around and thought I could save some money. I had tried the deep pore brush heads previously and liked it. However, although these came in the exact same packaging and looked authentic, they felt completely different. They get the job done but feel much harsher on my skin. They even fit differently on the Clarisonic body. It clicks into place but not as perfectly as the ones I have purchased from Macy&#x27;s or the Clarisonic website. I think these may be defective ones. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why they are sold for a lower price or what, but I wasn&#x27;t happy and will spend a little extra at Macy&#x27;s or from the actual website from now on.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase these from Ulta, but, the price was much cheaper on amazon so I decided to order them. However, the bristles were very stiff - almost to the point of scratching my face. It makes me wonder if these are actually name brand or knockoffs. Next time I will pay more and buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Perfect cleaning heads for your Panasonic facial brush. I use these things pretty much every day and you get a really deep clean. They last a couple of months each. Nice price.</li>
    <li> Transportation is very fast, very fine goods packaging, appearance is very good. It is also very convenient. Washing the face feeling very clean</li>
    <li> it is not the real Clarisonic brush head. it is the fake brand.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FAKE!!!!!!!FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE~!! HATE IT~!</li>
    <li> they are the real deal make no mistake of that and these ones are very soft and feel great on your face. arrived much sooner than I had anticipated and they were in the correct packaging.</li>
    <li> Read a bunch of reviews and was worried about these not being &amp;#34;clarisonic&amp;#34; manufacturered so almost didn&#x27;t buy.  HOWEVER, I did and I am really pleased. They didn&#x27;t come in the box as pictured but they were individually wrapped.  My Mia came with the standard ones and I feel like these blue heads, deep pore brushes are much better and softer.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that the outer band of the brush is longer and will clean more efficiently the crease between the nose and cheeks.  However, it makes a clicking sound and seems &#x27;loose&#x27; once it was attached to the clarisonic cleanser.  The brush works, but I would prefer a better fit.</li>
    <li> its original,, its so soft... and gentle to the skin...  i love to use this  brush daily... u can use it with any facial cleansers available in the market</li>
    <li> I waited too long to replace my Clarisonic brush and then was desperate to find one FAST! I was nervous about buying them on Amazon after reading reviews about other purchasers&#x27; experiences with less-than-Clarisonic-quality brushes, but I took a chance and it paid off!  For roughly the cost of buying ONE brush head from my aesthetician, I purchased TWO of these deep pore brushes.  As promised, they were in the original Clarisonic retail boxes with plastic brush covers. I&#x27;d used the sensitive brush before, but the deep pore brush immediately made a difference in the smoothness of my skin. My face is glowing!</li>
    <li> I love these brush heads.  My face feels so clean and smooth after using them.  I would highly recommend these to Clarisonic users!</li>
    <li> Hard to find these brush head at a great price. Found these on Amazon for my Mia. Just the right size!</li>
    <li> Much like many of the reviews here, (which I should have payed more attention to prior to ordering) I received not only two completely different brush heads than I originally ordered, but one of the brushes has CLEARLY been used. There is a strong odor of some sort of cleansing agent, and dried residue all over the outside part. The bristles are also frayed, and I could not be more disgusted. In fact, I threw up a little when I took them out of the box. SHOULD HAVE GONE TO NORDSTROM!!!!!</li>
    <li> ALITTLE TO HAD FOR MY FACE</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the ones they sell in the mall and they are just the same! Love these product! It really cleanses your face really well!</li>
    <li> I bought brush heads from Amazon and they are fake.I have proof but my photo keeps getting deleted and I do not know how to keep it there. The photo I took shows the packaging of the box and how they counterfeited the product wrong. The photo showed a blue brush for acne cleansing. If you look at a photo from Clarisonic, you will see that acne brushes are green and not blue. These brushes have counterfeit boxes and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brushes are counterfeit as well because after a week, they carried this stench that never happened before when I bought the brushes off Clarisonic. I understand they are cheap but these sellers should not be able to claim they are Clarisonic brand when they are not! They sellers contacted me and gave me a New York area code. I did some research and checked eBay and I found a ton of sellers with prices very low just like Amazon. Some of the sellers already state that they are generic and fit the Mia, never claiming them to be real. Coincidentally, majority of the sellers with low prices are shipping from New York. (Some of the photos on eBay have the photo of the blue brush head on the box of a acne cleansing)</li>
    <li> A bunch of hair on this replacement brush head started to fall out after the first use!! Also it feels very coarse on face. I would not recommend buying it at all. :-(</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic skin cleanser is wonder!  I have large pores and it can be difficult to get my skin really clean.  I have not doubt my skin is clean when I use the Clarisonic!  Wonderful product and I am glad Amazon has the replacement heads!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order these online because I read many negative reviews from customers buying these from other sellers.  These are definitely the real deal.  Save your money and buy these here on Amazon.  The cleansing brushes come nicely packed in the authentic retail box.  I&#x27;m happy I went this route and saved myself some dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself doesn&#x27;t feel drastically different from the sensitive brush that my Clarisonic Mia came with.  It is not rough or hard.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with these because I need more of a deeper cleansing.</li>
    <li> I bought my claisonic based on a friends recommendation and have been very happy with it. I decided to by some additional brushed and these are great. The company shipped them out same day and they arrive in a box in within a week of ordering.</li>
    <li> The rea fim compared with the sensitive brushes that come originally, this new ones clean so deep and leave my skin so soft... no break outs until now, and I have been using them for about a week.... let&#x27;s see</li>
    <li> The deep pore cleansing brushes are awesome. I really needed these. They clean much better than the normal brushes do. My pores are smaller and I feel like they clean much better than the normal ones did. Ordering them here was also much cheaper than ordering them from their website or anywhere else. I also received these very quickly, even though they are not under Prime.</li>
    <li> great price on a great product! I love my clarisonic and was searching for the best deal on replacement heads; this is it.</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic cleansing products.  My skin feels so rejuvenated after using the Mia 2 cleansing brush.  I have had horrible oily skin with large pores my whole life but after using the Clarisonic cleaning brush regularly over the past few months my skin is better than it has ever been.</li>
    <li> They are the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; from Clarisonic...not a knock off that I bought before.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;clack&amp;#34; while cleansing.  I was hesitant to buy the deep pore brushes at first, thinking they might be too rough, but they are not.  I feel like my face is so much cleaner now.  Arrived within just a few days; way before the date stated.</li>
    <li> The box came very damaged and the first brush I used had to be put together, something I was no expecting.Also, when I ordered it, I had a message that this order qualified for free shipping but I was charged way too much. I might as well have bought it from a bricks and mortar store.</li>
    <li> Brushes were frayed and the bristles were coming out after a few uses.I would not buy these again.Will buy from clarisonic.</li>
    <li> While the clarisonic is an investment, it does a remarkable job of smoothing and cleansing theskin. I use the deep pore brush heads because I have some skin problems, and those problems have nearly disappeared.</li>
    <li> work well and the price was excellent they last a long time have no faults I tell all my friends about this and are for my wife</li>
    <li> The price is good for two heads, brush holds up well with frequent use, I&#x27;ve used it longer than the 3 months recommended.</li>
    <li> Does not fit properly. Once turned it locks and when it&#x27;s on it will not rotate. I do not fully lock it when I use this brush</li>
    <li> These are much less than purchasing them from ULTA. They work just as well and will buy more of them.</li>
    <li> Tthe bristles do not exfoliate at all.  This style of brush head is a waste of money.  They don&#x27;t even hold their shape and fray leaving you with the sensation you are using the base itself to wash your face with.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these brush heads before and really liked them.  It seem that Clarisonic has changed the design.  The brushes are must too soft.  I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are getting cleaned very well.  I am not using the normal brush and the brushes are much stiffer.  Either these are knock offs or Clarisonic has changed them.</li>
