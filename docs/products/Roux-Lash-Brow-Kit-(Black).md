      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
      <li>After having it done many times, I attempted to tint my lashes at home.  </li>
      <li>I think wrapping bits of cotton over the wooden sticks works best.</li>
      <li>I used to get my eyelashes dyed before vacation and love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about mascara,</li>
      <li>It could be better</li>
      <li>but I have found nothing that is better</li>
      <li>Paper shields worked ok.</li>
      <li>Just wish this product was better bottled.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It did get the lighter color tips and my lower lashes are more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I make sure the brush is wiped on the bottle edge a couple of times before applying either liquid</li>
      <li>At many salons it cost $10 - $20.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Now I do it myself and love the results.  </li>
      <li>Also used an eyelash curler to keep my top lashes separate from my eye area when applying both liquids.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful and last so well.  </li>
      <li>WHAT MORE COULD ONE ASK FOR?</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap (compared to going to a salon) and it works!</li>
      <li>Would probably work ok if I kept trying and got better at applying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe,</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s okay, it does the job.</li>
      <li>I read many of the wonderful, very informative reviews here before attempting to tint my eyelashes for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tiny fine bristles hold the liquid perfectly.</li>
      <li>It arrived out of its original box, with TAPE (no safety seal!)around the caps of the bottles!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dyeing my own eyelashes for years, and this is the first at-home dye kit that I&#x27;ve been really pleased with.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and saves me money.</li>
      <li>All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  </li>
      <li>It was really easy to use and didn&#x27;t burn my skin or eyes at all.</li>
      <li>I read a review where someone&#x27;s fingers were dyed, but that is easily resolved by wearing vinyl or plastic gloves (used for cleaning, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clean-up was easy.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
      <li>luck!u don&#x27;t have Latisse brushes, you could use fine paint brushes.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have Latisse brushes, you could use fine paint brushes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a huge money saver.</li>
      <li>I have light brown lashes turning lighter at the tips.</li>
      <li>I used to see the Latisse brushes (no product) on eBay for cheap prices, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any posted currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they came with since it keeps them secure.</li>
      <li>It is important to wear gloves since the product will stain your skin.</li>
      <li>This ensures a nice dark color and that you get a good chemical reaction when applying step</li>
      <li>I first made the mistake of buying this at Sally&#x27;s and paid about $10 more than Amazon&#x27;s price.      </li>
      <li>Considering the cost of the kit and the 50-pack of disposable wands was less than one trip to the salon (and I&#x27;ll get many, many, many uses out of it), this was a definite win for me.</li>
      <li>but my lashes are much thinner and more sparse.</li>
      <li>I am completely pleased, and I would absolutely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true-</li>
      <li>so provided you&#x27;re willing to take on learning professional techniques, this is a good</li>
      <li>Easy to use and does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>I saw some complaints about the application process and wanted to add a tip for anyone interested that made it easy for me.</li>
      <li>It took a while because I did 1 row of lashes at a time, so I had to do it 4 times, but it was pretty easy.  </li>
      <li>The first time I had my lashes dyed, I went to a salon, but the procedure is so easy, you can do it yourself with this product--</li>
      <li>buy a bunch of disposable mascara wands, dip a clean one into the first solution, let it drip off into the jar or onto a napkin or something (not your skin!), and apply.  </li>
      <li>I like to leave each step on for a little more than the time on the instructions to get good permeability.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s good to be young and have a good set of lashes, otherwise, skip this and buy a waterproof black thickening mascara.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick,</li>
      <li>Wore off quickly, except for my skin.</li>
      <li>This product helps so much and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get ALL OVER your hands but a spot or two is still too much as it doesnt wash off easily like hair dye.  </li>
      <li>Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  </li>
      <li>So far I have not been able to have any impact on it at all.</li>

    <li> YES, IT WORKS, ITS EASY TO DO AND IT ISN&#x27;T MESSY.  WHAT MORE COULD ONE ASK FOR?</li>
    <li> It did get the lighter color tips and my lower lashes are more noticeable.  Kinda messy.  The little pads it comes with for under your eyes a cumbersome and hard to get under your lower lashes.  If I do it again, I plan to using two pieces of masking tape with their sticky sides together so that one side has a small thin strip of stickiness to it to use.  And I will use gloves.  It doesn&#x27;t get ALL OVER your hands but a spot or two is still too much as it doesnt wash off easily like hair dye.  The instructions do warn about this.  If I had blonde lashes I would love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my own eyelashes for years, and this is the first at-home dye kit that I&#x27;ve been really pleased with.  I&#x27;m pretty careful and steady, but I had no stinging or burning, even when the stuff made contact with my eyelid.  That&#x27;s a pretty big deal if you&#x27;ve ever had to wash off a couple partial applications because your eyes are watering and dye is running down your face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use petroleum jelly, and I would encourage you not to use it either.  If even a little of it gets onto your lashes (which can easily happen), the dye will not take.  I also skipped the little papers, but again, I&#x27;ve done this before.  I pulled tiny pieces of cotton off of a q-tip and rolled it around the narrow end of the stick as tightly as possible.  This actually worked pretty well, but I followed up with a clean mascara wand (in both solutions) to make sure I got the underside of my lashes and to maximize coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the results...were the best I&#x27;ve ever had with a non-stinging product, and certainly as good as what I&#x27;ve had in a salon.  The lashes I treated were absolutely black, and I could tell a big difference between eyes after doing just one - and this was after two or so weeks since my last dye, so my lashes weren&#x27;t all whitey-blonde to begin with.  I am completely pleased, and I would absolutely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:  think of this as a lash-by-lash painting, not an application of mascara - less is better. Even when using a mascara wand, you don&#x27;t want it to be dripping with stuff, just dip it and shake off the excess.  Don&#x27;t bother closing your eyes - your \\&quot;aim\\&quot; will be less accurate with quivering eyelids, and besides, you want to get the underside of your top lashes and can&#x27;t when your eyes are closed. I used the lids of #1 and #2 to contain a small amount of each, and used new sticks for each container, for each eye.  I rinsed and dried the caps thoroughly before putting them back on, to ensure no contamination.  If you have a steady hand, you can create a really fine-ended stick, with a very small amount of cotton wrapped around it, to get closer to your roots.  I actually used a real toothpick, with the sharpest part of the point dulled, but I wouldn&#x27;t try that until you&#x27;ve done this a few times.ou can create a really fine-ended stick, with a very small amount of cotton wrapped around it, to get closer to your roots.

    <li> I used disposable mascara brushes to apply the solutions instead of following the instructions, and I think it was much easier.  However, I will NOT be using Vaseline again or the paper skin protectors, what a waste.  The paper protectors were just annoying and actually gave me a paper cut under my eye!  I guess these are made for people who are NOT self-dying.  It took me two tries to properly dye my bottom lashes, I believe I got some Vaseline on the bottom lashes of my right eye for the first try, so they didn&#x27;t fully dye (the left eye bottom lashes, and both top lashes, came out perfectly the first time!).  After the minute or two per the instructions, I rinshed off the lashes so that I could start again with the bottoms that were not dyed.  I noticed that some had washed off when I did this step.  I retried without the Vaseline with success, so this time I left it on for a long time (like 30 minutes or an hour) before washing my eyelashes to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t rinse off, and it didn&#x27;t.  They look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:  buy a bunch of disposable mascara wands, dip a clean one into the first solution, let it drip off into the jar or onto a napkin or something (not your skin!), and apply.  Be careful not to touch your skin with the wand or the solution.  Wait the appropriate amount of time per the instructions, then using a CLEAN wand, do the same with the second solution.  I had a q-tip at the read with the remover solution, I did have a drip or two I needed to wipe up, and it came off with a few sturdy swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my first attempt was a success.  Considering the cost of the kit and the 50-pack of disposable wands was less than one trip to the salon (and I&#x27;ll get many, many, many uses out of it), this was a definite win for me.</li>
    <li> Have used this product a very long time.  It could be better but I have found nothing that is better so I keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I used this product starting nearly 50 years ago and stopped using it for several years until chemo treatment destroyed my eyelashes and my lashes grew back nearly invisible.  I ordered this and it is just as good as I remember it.  Those who complain about stinging the eyes and staining all over the place must be using too much and too close to the under eye and lid.  You must be very careful.  I don&#x27;t bother with the shields or vaseline as it is too difficult to get the barriers in the right place.  Simply put very little cotton on the toothpicks, wear gloves, never re-dip into bottles and very carefully touch only the lashes and not the skin.  Prepare for some fumes causing eye watering and burning.  If you don&#x27;t oversaturate the cotton swabs, discomfort is minimal and this stuff works. Your lashes stay dyed until they fall out naturally.</li>
    <li> I first made the mistake of buying this at Sally&#x27;s and paid about $10 more than Amazon&#x27;s price.      It&#x27;s an excellent product, I use for my eyelashes and they turn out black.  It&#x27;s great for those mornings when you don&#x27;t have time or feel like putting on mascara.</li>
    <li> Great! I now only use mascara when I am going out. (a date, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Love the little sticks to wrap a tiny bit of cotton around.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use petroleum jelly around my eyes, but I find if I am careful I dont need it...&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t do it in a hurry*&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I read many of the wonderful, very informative reviews here before attempting to tint my eyelashes for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it was very easy.  I did use cotton swabs, and a disposable eye/mascara brush- but found that I didn&#x27;t need the gloves I had purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slow, be careful, and it&#x27;s pretty easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blonde lashes are now a luscious black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product only 4 stars for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- the undereye papers are pretty cheap, and no one&#x27;s eye is actually that shape&lt;br /&gt;- I feel like the solutions would have been easier to work with if they were thicker.&lt;br /&gt;- the kit doesn&#x27;t come with effective tools- c&#x27;mon a pack of 50 toothpicks- sheesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it is for salon professionals- so provided you&#x27;re willing to take on learning professional techniques, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true- the tint remover stings.  A lot.</li>
    <li> Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn&#x27;t much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit), I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!) even the little blonde tips.  I recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research), so I&#x27;m doing an experiment, side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have found - I think Roux is the kind of lash tint the salon used.  It cost me about $5 (including shipping) on eBay for a single application (I recommend trying it that way).  Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The draw-backs of the Roux lash tint experiment:&lt;br /&gt;1)  All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  I had to pierce some of the chemicals with a safety pin to open it, and even then had trouble dipping the wands into the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;2) The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black) turned my fingertips black. The instructions said to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anywhere you don&#x27;t want turning black, and I faithfully ringed my eyes below and to the eyebrow, but never thought of putting it on my fingertips!  :)  Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  Oh well, it&#x27;ll fade.&lt;br /&gt;3) Because I was doing a self-tint, I had to do one eye at a time.  I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  That tells me there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;4) My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  I went back over them at the end, but they just didn&#x27;t dye.  I think maybe there was petroleum jelly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... that is my review of Roux.  I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don&#x27;t need to keep your eyes shut the whole time, it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  But I will have to see for myself.eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.

    <li> The instructions and included applicators are garbage. Based on the advise of my hairstylist I purchased a mascara want for the application and threw out the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of bathing my lashes with a toothpick wrapped in cotton like the directions say, very gently and slowly I used the applicator for the No. 1 liquid and the same for No.2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not over saturate them, and because I was so very careful I had no mess to worry about. This product did tint my lashes very well. It certainly exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product are the included applicators and eye protectors. If you go very slowly, carefully, and use a mascara wand... you should have no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  It&#x27;s not available in the state in which I live, so I&#x27;ve always had to purchase it when traveling to the West Coast.  It&#x27;s safe, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s cheap (compared to going to a salon) and it works!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Easier to use than you might think.  With a good magnifying mirror, I don&#x27;t need the paper shield or Vaseline.  Started using Latisse (from India, ladies--cheap!), and have lovely, long, but pale lashes.  With the Roux tint, I have astonishing lashes without mascara.  I&#x27;ve always hated mascara: harsh-looking and inevitable smudgy. With Latisse and Roux Tint, I wake up every day with great lashes.  Just a little crimp to them, and I&#x27;m out the door.  Also, the tint lasts about a month.  I would do this weekly to achieve these great results, but I (and YOU) don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> This is a product you have to use a couple times to really see a dramatic difference-- but once you do, WOW! The first time I had my lashes dyed, I went to a salon, but the procedure is so easy, you can do it yourself with this product-- and it&#x27;s a huge money saver. Plus, now I wake up looking like I&#x27;m wearing mascara. I recommend using it once a week until you achieve the level of darkness and drama that you desire, and then monthly or so for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year and used it on my brows and lashes.  My lashes broke off and the product did not stay on my brows.  I would be careful about using this product as it takes quite a while to grow lashes back.</li>
    <li> I will absolutely use this product again! Easy to use and does exactly what it says it will. :) A+</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times. It works very well if you get used to using it. The first time I used it, I had my sister put it on me. It was a total disaster with burning and dye every where. Then I started doing it on my own and have gotten quite good at it. I can get a very dark black color on all my lashes down to the roots. But it took practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wear gloves. It&#x27;s impossible to do this without getting it on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy mascara wands (the kind used for touching up hair dye) and don&#x27;t use the toothpick applicators that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply it like you would mascara with BOTH EYES OPEN. I know it sounds crazy because this stuff burns if it gets in your eye. But I found that I have more control with both eyes open and actually get less in my eyes. It does burn my eyes a little and I tear up a bit, but I just suck it up. Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain. But If you do get it in your eyes, try to resist blinking hard or else you will wind up with some crazy black marks under your eyes. I also use a makeup brush (a small one like you would use for eyeshadow) to dab it on my lashes with my eye closed. I pull the corner of my eye outward with my index finger to close one eye at a time instead of trying to keep it closed with my eye muscles. Kind of like when you apply eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you get some on your skin around your eyes, wait until after your done and have rinsed everything off before you use the dye remover. The directions say to use it right away but I found that the remover burns more than anything and when it mixes with the other chemicals it hurts really bad. I have gotten chemical burns from the dye remover. Use a Q-tip and rub it where ever you have stains. It may take a few seconds for it to start working. But be careful, like I said before, the dye remover burns the WORST!&lt;br /&gt;5. Absolutely drench your eyelashes with step number one paying close attention to the corners. This ensures a nice dark color and that you get a good chemical reaction when applying step 2.&lt;br /&gt;6. Keep some tissue handy. If you try this with both eyes open, sometimes the fumes can make your eyes water. Just dab away the tears with a tissue so they don&#x27;t wash away the solution. Again, don&#x27;t blink hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!you get a good chemical reaction when applying step 2.  6. Keep some tissue handy.

Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was different from one i had tried before, hoping for better results.  No luck.  Do not waste your money on this if you have blond lashes.  After FOUR tries, there was only a slight coloring on my upper lashes, none on the lower and I followed the directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely, some major cosmetics company can invent a product that&#x27;s safe and easier to use.  &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; has a great beard and mustash color product that my husband uses.  It&#x27;s very easy and thick, making it much better to apply but it can&#x27;t be used on lashes.</li>
    <li> No difference after one application. Maybe a little color on the ends of bottom lashes, but top lashes look the same.  Did not sting, but very, very slight fumes let you know you don&#x27;t want to get this in your eyes. I washed face well before starting and was very careful with applying Vaseline so I didn&#x27;t get it on my lashes. Paper shields worked ok. I tried applying solution with a Q- tip and with soft toothpick that has tiny green bristles as one reviewer suggested. I&#x27;m not sure the toothpick applied enough product even though I dipped it, applied, dipped it again, applied, etc.  Using a Q-tip seemed to apply more solution, you just have to be more careful and not try to get close to the roots or you&#x27;ll smudge. I kept a Q-tip soaked with remover at the ready and if I felt like I might have touched my skin with color, I immediately used the remover on that spot, whether I saw a stain or not. If you are careful, you won&#x27;t have any smudges. Clean-up was easy.  Disappointing results. Will apply again tomorrow in hopes of seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great results years ago after going to one salon that used vegetable dye. It was awesome!  Went to a very expensive salon in Vegas and I wanted to yell at the guy who dyed my lashes. He was SO sloppy and rubbed my eyes so hard, stretching the skin around my eyes like you are told NOT to do because it causes wrinkles.  He rubbed so much and so hard that he got remover and cotton in my eyes and left them bright red with no color on my lashes. I was furious and biting my tongue instead of embarrassing the incompetent sadist.  I complained to the manager and they did nothing, no refund, no apology, just snooty attitude like I was beneath their stupid salon.</li>
    <li> I have gotten my lashes tinted at a salon and loved the results.  My hair is dark, but the ends of my lashes bleach out.  After having it done many times, I attempted to tint my lashes at home.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND TINTING YOUR OWN LASHES WITHOUT EXPERIENCE OR A LICENSE. The results are great.  There are three bottles.  The first step, you put on #1 which breaks down the hair enough to accept tint.  After a few minutes you apply #2 (the black tint smells like it has chloride and the fumes can irritate the eyes), the tint.  I recommend putting both #1 and #2 on all sides of the lash hair for best results, and if it gets on your skin it will stain.  For eye-brow I work against the grain to avoid skin contact. #3 is a stain remover that works fine on light stains, but will not take off a dark stain.  I reapply to up-keep every 3 weeks, as the end of the lash hair is already broken down (that is why it looks pointed) and doesn&#x27;t have enough cuticle to hold the tint.  For up keep I only need to apply to the outer half of the lash, but I have almost black hair.  I did my mother&#x27;s, gray lashes, and had to reapply to the length of the lash.    Again, if this is your first experience with lash tinting have a professional tint.  You do not want to get the tint in your eyes.  At many salons it cost $10 - $20.  For professionals, I have had the veg based tints and though they come in an assortment of colors I think this product lasts longer and takes less time.  I like to leave each step on for a little more than the time on the instructions to get good permeability.  Also, you do not need much on the applicator.  Too much may run in the eye or stain the skin.  The stains look dark brown and unattractive.  The pads are uncomfortable and I would recommend cotton instead.</li>
    <li> I was born with and still have very white eyelashes and eyebrows even though my hair is dark blonde.  I started using Roux years ago and it has totally changed my life.  Before I was using makeup to enhance the eyebrow area, but now I use Roux and look and feel like a totally different person.  For anyone that suffers with the same condition, I highly recommend that you try this product.  It will change your life too.</li>
    <li> Liquid is easier to apply than globby gel. Its very black and you do have to be careful not to slop it anywhere, . Good result,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blonde and get the black color because it looks brown on and fades fairly quickly. I try to dye them every 1-2 weeks. The only issue I have with this product is that they don&#x27;t give you enough stain remover. I always have to buy a new package when that runs out, even when I still have dye left.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly and my eyelashes looked a little bit darker but as soon as I took a shower it all came off.</li>
    <li> Went on ok, it not easy to apply. Have to be very careful. One eye came out darker than the other. Wore off quickly, except for my skin. Would probably work ok if I kept trying and got better at applying it. Instead, ordered 1000 hours from Australia and will go back to that since I know that works well and have used it before.</li>
    <li> This product is very messy during application, so make sure to get vaseline on all surrounding skin or it gets all over it. I&#x27;ve used another eyelash tint that was easier to apply but didn&#x27;t last as long. I will buy the Roux Lash Brow Kit again though because it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> So hard to use without undoing or over doing and for lashes I get it all under I use every other time in between paying someone to dave money</li>
    <li> I got this product specifically for my lashes, not brows. I needed to leave it on a bit longer than what was instructed, in order to get a better black result, but other than that I really love this product. It was really easy to use and didn&#x27;t burn my skin or eyes at all.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me the first time but the second time it worked really well!</li>
    <li> The first time i used this eyelash tinting kit i made a terrible mess, dyed my fingers &amp; eyelids, oops.  After a few practice runs i have the technique down.     First: take those little wooden sticks that come with the kit &amp; throw them away!  Second: use the paper eyelid protectors to apply vaseline to your upper &amp; lower eyelids. Take a q-tip &amp; apply a layer of vaseline to one side of the paper, then  carefully slide the paper along your lash line &amp; on your eyelids (vaseline side down of course). then once both eyes are done throw the paper away. This is the easiest way to apply vaseline without getting it on your lashes. Because if you get any vaseline on your lashes you might as well not tint them because it won&#x27;t work.   Third: now this is the secret that will help you the most, to apply the solutions to your eyelashes use 2 (one for each solution) between the teeth soft pick by GUM. The tiny fine bristles hold the liquid perfectly. Then you can apply the solution as if you are applying mascara, just with a much smaller brush.   I have tried q-tips (which waste product), disposable mascara wands ( hold too much liquid then it runs down your hand), lip brushes &amp; none of those items worked well at all for applying the tint.</li>
    <li> I bought the Roux tint to color my eyebrows. They are black and have a few grays coming in. I was using brow tint from Sephora previously, but the darkest color they had was dark brown and it was noticeable up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Roux based on the reviews her on Amazon.com. I saw some complaints about the application process and wanted to add a tip for anyone interested that made it easy for me. Please read the other reviews for the complete process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two bottles that have solution you apply to tint your brows/lashes. The first prepares your hair follicles to receive the color and the second is the actual color. The box comes with 40 thin wood sticks that look like flattened toothpicks and they recommend to twirl some cotton around the end to use as an applicator. I used Latisse applicator brushes instead, one for each bottle. (I use Latisse, but not their applicator brushes. I use a brush from an old Revitalash product for Latisse instead, extending a 30 day bottle to 3 months.) The Latisse brushes small, plastic, disposable paint brushes. They are fine enough to use for painting the solution #1 and solution #2 on the brows as instructed. I tried the lashes too, but I think to dye the lashes completely, it may be a 2 person job. I used 1 brush per solution (to avoid cross-contamination) and tossed them after I was done and had great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no issues with dye on my skin. There is a \\&quot;stain remover\\&quot; bottle included too, but it wasn&#x27;t needed. I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with the solution dripping or running. When I put the solution on each brush, I removed any excess liquid by brushing the bristles along the inside top of the bottle to let it run back in, as if I was painting. I did use petroleum jelly around my eyebrows and lashes and also used gloves. I read a review where someone&#x27;s fingers were dyed, but that is easily resolved by wearing vinyl or plastic gloves (used for cleaning, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit should provide 40 applications. If you don&#x27;t have Latisse brushes, you could use fine paint brushes. I would recommend either plastic or acrylic bristles and in a fine enough point so the bristles can be use to paint each hair or lash as desired. You would need two - one for each bottle. I used to see the Latisse brushes (no product) on eBay for cheap prices, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any posted currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!u don&#x27;t have Latisse brushes, you could use fine paint brushes.

    <li> I used to get my eyelashes dyed before vacation and love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about mascara, especially when I know I&#x27;ll be in water.  I&#x27;m starting to like it so much I want it done all the time, but it&#x27;s not really in the budget to do it every three weeks or so.  I&#x27;d seen this product before and finally decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;d read some other reviews and was worried about messing it up, but it wasn&#x27;t that hard.  It took a while because I did 1 row of lashes at a time, so I had to do it 4 times, but it was pretty easy.  Use a q-tip instead of the applicators that come in the box, it&#x27;s easier.  My lashes didn&#x27;t end up quite as dark as when I have them done, but I can always redo it if I want them darker.</li>
    <li> I got my lashes linted at a salon about 25 years ago and the French woman who did this for me [ for  years] did a fab job. Fast forward to today... same product but my lashes are much thinner and more sparse. Not working the same. So it&#x27;s good to be young and have a good set of lashes, otherwise, skip this and buy a waterproof black thickening mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used three time in about a month.  Does a GREAT job of staining my fingers, but barely - barely makes a difference on my lashes.  I was hoping for a good result.  Not as good as mascara, but at least noticeable.  No such luck</li>
    <li> I could never get a good lash dye at the spa.  Now I do it myself and love the results.  This product is easy to use and saves me money.</li>
    <li> I was a little uncertain about this product, based on the reviews, but I am reasonably satisfied. I have light brown lashes turning lighter at the tips. After the first application of the black tint, I could tell that my lashes and eyebrows were darker, but the difference was pretty subtle. About three days later, I decided to try again, and that attempt made a difference. I have now used the product three times. I think wrapping bits of cotton over the wooden sticks works best. I could not use the paper shields at all; they were stiff and kept popping off. Also they were painful. I had a regular cotton swab wet with the stain remover handy in case of drips. The instructions say to use only a little of the Number 2 bottle, the dye. However, it seems to me that this is what makes the difference. If you are too cautious with it, you won&#x27;t see much effect. If your lashes are going to turn black, you will see it right away. If you are not happy, wash your eyes and try a second application of both liquids. One warning, I have a white hair in one eyebrow that I was hoping to color. So far I have not been able to have any impact on it at all.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and natural looking. If you are very careful &amp; comfortable with it, you can even use as a long lasting eyeliner (even though it says not to attempt coating the base of your lashes I do it anyway). You don&#x27;t have to waste time applying it everyday or removing at night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 30 years.  It is wonderful and last so well.  It actually makes the brows look thicker.  I strongly recommend this to anyone.  I am a former Cosmetology Instructor and could have used any product but chose this one.</li>
    <li> Loved how it worked on my eyebrows wish I had someone to do my eyelashes as well because it was just to difficult to keep eyes open and not get it in them. The one issue that I had was with the tint remover was it was very harsh on the skin but I will purchase this product again when I need it.</li>
    <li> difficult to use without getting it where you don&#x27;t want it...would work better as a gel.  The dye does not last long.  Better off getting it done professionally is my experience so far.</li>
    <li> This eyelash dye works very well. Be careful not to get it in your eyes. It is a 2-step process. Be sure to let the 1st solution dry completely before applying the 2nd solution. Also, I find it easier to apply with a disposable mascara wand than with cotton wound around a toothpick. (Directions in the kit say to use the toothpick with cotton from a cotton ball to apply.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyebrow tinting system since I was a teenager. I love it alot, but I don&#x27;t need to tint my brows that often and the stain remover like DRIES up and evaporates. So, i went on to Godefroy, it&#x27;s okay, it does the job. Just wish this product was better bottled.</li>
    <li> When you follow directions, never a problem.  I have very light, thin brows.  This product helps so much and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> One star, as I haven&#x27;t decided whether or not I will use this product. It arrived out of its original box, with TAPE (no safety seal!)around the caps of the bottles! Enclosed is a a jagged manually cut paper message--like a fortune cookie--that said \\&quot;...we have opened your item, secured all contents with tape, and folded the box...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am hesitant to use this product! It was shipped from \\&quot;iHeart Beauty &amp; Fashion\\&quot; out of LA, and I cannot find them on the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else experience this?? Should I use it?</li>
    <li> this is a great product. It&#x27;s been around forever. And,it works very well. I been using this product for at least ten years</li>
    <li> I was cautious about using this product on my eyelashes because I don&#x27;t want to do anything harmful to my eyes. I followed the tips online (using the brush end of a small plastic dental-pik to apply both liquids. Also used an eyelash curler to keep my top lashes separate from my eye area when applying both liquids. This product worked great and turned my blonde and gray lashes black after I applied the conditioner, waited 3 minutes, and applied the darkening product. With the dental pik brush and taking much care, I haven&#x27;t had to use the color remover. I don&#x27;t use the paper guards either, which are cumbersome. Despite that, I haven&#x27;t gotten a drop of either liquid anywhere on my face. I make sure the brush is wiped on the bottle edge a couple of times before applying either liquid so each liquid stays where I put it. I do this weekly now to keep my lashes looking good without mascara. I rarely use eyeliner anymore either because this product gives my eyes enough emphasis. I am 64, so not having to use eye make-up, which often makes women look older, is a good thing! It&#x27;s cut my make-up routine down considerably. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and still have plenty of product left. I don&#x27;t use it on my brows because I use a brown cream-based dye on them. So I don&#x27;t know how it works on brows. For eyelashes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use mascara and found this product to be a great alternative. I use it only on my lashes. I put the gloves on (the disposable ones, not the thick ones) before I even open the containers. I put enclosed sticks with tiny amount of cotton ball wrapped around them into each container (cotton swabs work too). I make sure there are several sticks in each container since I don&#x27;t want to double-dip. I sit close to the mirror and work on one eye at a time.&lt;br /&gt; It really helps to have the sticks ready in the containers especially the one with the dye remover since you need to work quickly if you accidentally put a dye on your skin. I am careful not to apply the dye too close to lash roots (it will sting your eye a lot !) It is important to wear gloves since the product will stain your skin. You don&#x27;t want to worry about removing dye from both your finger and eye area.&lt;br /&gt;It really helps to keep open container inside the box they came with since it keeps them secure. The dye will stain you counter or whatever surface you put them on if you spill it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are careful, work slowly and have things prepared in advance you&#x27;ll get great results.</li>
