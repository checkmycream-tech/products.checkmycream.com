      <li>It&#x27;s was the perfect gift.</li>
      <li>Great quality and excellent starter kit</li>
      <li>Please work on the wing nuts that tighten the armature bar, If you could just change them to metal wing nuts would be great.</li>
      <li>Everything is just as described the guns run great.</li>
      <li>but great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy</li>
      <li>that everything else was great</li>
      <li>Great service, well represented product, and great quality for the price.</li>
      <li>And yes it&#x27;s all very nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good seller.</li>
      <li>Really good starter kit.</li>
      <li>Nice machines.</li>
      <li>Would have been better if assembly instructions had been included and the cd/DVD did not have anything on it.</li>
      <li>deceptive advertising, you do not get what is pictured, make sure to read the product details.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this kit.</li>
      <li>I love my kit the case and everything else</li>
      <li>Especially the guns and power supply are freaking awesome.</li>
      <li>Everything ok.</li>
      <li>YouTube and google videos had way more information</li>
      <li>Well worth the amount paid!!</li>
      <li>and I was very impressed on everything that was in the case it definitely makes a great starter kit or if you&#x27;re just looking for extra stuff</li>
      <li>Other than that, this kit is awesome.</li>
      <li>This is really nice for how much you pay.</li>
      <li>Also the carrying case is very handy dandy with enough room for all the guns, power supply, needles, and inks.</li>
      <li>Other then that everything was there and it all works good!</li>
      <li>My son absolutely loved this kit for starting out!</li>
      <li>I was very impressed on how much you could fit into a small case</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>Everything seems to be great so far, only thing I&#x27;d change is the screw to be metal rather than plastic, tends to work itself out after a while.</li>
      <li>Good starter kit for the price other than that.</li>
      <li>The only neg comment is the plastic screw that tightens on the armature bar strips out very easy will have to replace with metal.</li>
      <li>however products I did receive worked very well and came as advertised!</li>
      <li>The power source box is about the size of pint box of butter, it&#x27;s very tiny and the peddle provided is equally pint sized, more appropriate for a toddler&#x27;s foot.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth every penny which was pretty reasonably priced &amp; I received as promised within 2 days</li>
      <li>Love the entire kit except ink.</li>
      <li>Starter kit cheep made guns already broke one not even used within the first month.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping exactly what was described in description</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I just want to thank you for being so fast with delivery.</li>
      <li>As expected, mostly... transfer paper was folded and power supply needed reassembled so the display worked --</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>I have bought other tattoo kits on amazon and ebay that don&#x27;t work half as good as this one!</li>
      <li>All in all a decent kit</li>
      <li>Everything is good except for the case was broken on the inside ..</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone who tattoos, either beginner or professional -- go get this tattoo kit!</li>
      <li>Like some of the greens were marked as yellows and some of the Reds were marked as pinks.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy from this company again REAL DEAL for the money.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love it and would add the other 3 stars.</li>
      <li>Pedal is a trip, it&#x27;s tiny and sensitive as hell.</li>
      <li>Few guns worked ok, few took a lot of adjustments.</li>

<li> the only down fall was that the DVD was a blank copy ...</li>

<li> It also lacks any black line ink</li>
<li> That was a small detail for the guns</li>
<li> Not really sure I ordered it for my brother.</li>
<li> I mean awwwesome</li>
<li> The machines were not that bad, though it was almost all shaders except one, so I just changed them around.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Starter kit cheep made guns already broke one not even used within the first month.</li>
    <li> Premium equipment. Runs fluidly though a day work. Absolutely love this kit. Great work!</li>
    <li> i dont understand its a starter kit but cpmes wilth no dvd to show you how to put your gun togethervand when i finnaly put my gun together mu power sorce stoped working and now it will not work at all</li>
    <li> Great quality and excellent starter kit</li>
    <li> As expected, mostly... transfer paper was folded and power supply needed reassembled so the display worked -- *needed* reassembled, the display was detached from the casing and couldn&#x27;t be read. Good starter kit for the price other than that. Pedal is a trip, it&#x27;s tiny and sensitive as hell. Ink cup holder is a bit sad (first time I loaded it it broke). Worth it.</li>
    <li> Really good starter kit. The DVD didn&#x27;t work though. Other then that everything was there and it all works good!</li>
    <li> The machines were not that bad, though it was almost all shaders except one, so I just changed them around. The issue is, my needles I received, though sealed, has ink on them and are oxidized. I bought the kit for spare machines and parts because I work at a tattoo shop.</li>
    <li> Not really sure I ordered it for my brother.</li>
    <li> I love my kit the case and everything else i am very happy with it. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Nice machines. Would have been better if assembly instructions had been included and the cd/DVD did not have anything on it.</li>
    <li> Everything got here but great I&#x27;m really happy the only down fall was that the DVD was a blank copy ... It did work besides that everything else was great</li>
    <li> Love the entire kit except ink.</li>
    <li> deceptive advertising, you do not get what is pictured, make sure to read the product details. two of my machines had striped screw ports and will be unusable, I have yet to assemble and try out the other 4 but they seem undamaged. The power source box is about the size of pint box of butter, it&#x27;s very tiny and the peddle provided is equally pint sized, more appropriate for a toddler&#x27;s foot. The kit does not include tattoo skin or transfer paper as pictured. It also lacks any black line ink but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome I mean awwwesome</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and couldn&#x27;t be happier...</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this! Fast shipping and exactly as described. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Everything is just as described the guns run great.The only neg comment is the plastic screw that tightens on the armature bar strips out very easy will have to replace with metal. That was a small detail for the guns have plenty of power.I would definitely buy from this company again REAL DEAL for the money.Please work on the wing nuts that tighten the armature bar, If you could just change them to metal wing nuts would be great. Thanks Alot Really Love It!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did not receive everything that was in the description that I paid for and the video was not helpful at all..YouTube and google videos had way more information however products I did receive worked very well and came as advertised!</li>
    <li> Got here on time. Missing cd and gloves.(not a big deal) but also missing the transfer paper, which i would have ordered seperately had i known... Wife wanted a tat tonight and I&#x27;m no artist...... will buy transfer paper tonight. Tattoos will have to wait...</li>

    <li> Everything ok. It&#x27;s a good seller.</li>
    <li> The only problem is my power box has never worked since I got it, would like to know who I must contact in order to resolve my problem. Other than that, I love it and would add the other 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is really nice for how much you pay. The only problem with it is that the ink was misprinted for some of the colors. Like some of the greens were marked as yellows and some of the Reds were marked as pinks. Btw I don&#x27;t recommend using this ink on people only fruit and practice skin.</li>
    <li> Everything that was supposed to be in the kit was, and it all works great! I was able to knock out two tattoos, and then the power supply died on me ( must&#x27;ve gotten the bad apple) in less than twelve hours of emailing OneTattoo World, a new one is in the mail. Great service, well represented product, and great quality for the price. I have a buddy that&#x27;s been tattooing for years, and after seeing my kit when it came in, he&#x27;s going to order one to replace some of his worn out machines. Looking forward to doing business with these guys again!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth every penny which was pretty reasonably priced &amp; I received as promised within 2 days</li>
    <li> everything is just as we expected</li>
    <li> items were just as described I am very satisfied !! thank you</li>
    <li> Fast shipping exactly what was described in description</li>
    <li> The power supply gave out after 3 uses</li>
    <li> Everything is good except for the case was broken on the inside ..</li>
    <li> I was very impressed on how much you could fit into a small case and I was very impressed on everything that was in the case it definitely makes a great starter kit or if you&#x27;re just looking for extra stuff but with what you already have and the price was very great</li>
    <li> I just want to thank you for being so fast with delivery. it came just like you said it would. And yes it&#x27;s all very nice. Thanks so much.</li>

    <li> My son absolutely loved this kit for starting out!</li>
    <li> Few guns worked ok, few took a lot of adjustments. All in all a decent kit</li>
