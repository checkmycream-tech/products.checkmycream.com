      <li>but I do, we&#x27;re not as young as we used to be anymore, but I still give him a smooch or two just to show him that he&#x27;s still very sexy to me, the grandchildren think we&#x27;re cute and laugh at us when we hug &amp; kiss.</li>
      <li>the plus side, Tsar is certainly workplace friendly, as no one will smell it on you unless you are giving them a piggyback ride or are lying on top of them, both of which circumstances are uncommon enough in the workplace so as to preclude their likelihood of occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The fragrance is nice but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Bottom line: unless this falls in price to the level of Nausea Voyage, there are many better options for less money.ojones attached.</li>

      <li>I know for me that there are a few cologne&#x27;s out there that really are great.</li>
      <li>Tsar certainly won&#x27;t appeal to most young modern male fragrance buyers who love calone, seaweed, and apple.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it, is an amazing fragrance one of my favorites, I love it, I love it</li>
    <li> Used it for years, great product~</li>
    <li> Ahh at last I have my scent back</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne ever since it was introduced after my mother bought me a bottle on a cruise. I have always received compliments on the fragrance and I have grown very accustomed to the fragrance.  I still get lots of compliments so it is still working its magic.  What may be confusing to some consumers is that it used to come in two different strengths.  One was called a Eau De Cologne (see photo) and the other was the Eau De Toilette spray. The cologne was more expensive and a stronger fragrance.  The essence of both sprays was the same, just that one was stronger and one was lighter.  Since I have always used the Eau De Toilette spray I have noticed no difference.  I don&#x27;t know whether the cologne is still available or not, perhaps it is in Europe, but I have not seen it in the United States for a long time. I am and will continue to be a huge fan of Tsar.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I ordered.  The picture matched the merchandise received exactly.  I would definitely reccomend Tsar to my friends.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both LOVE this scent!  It is definitely a statement maker.  He gets so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this fragrance! My honey won&#x27;t wear any other! THANKS for the super speedy delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Not as I am used to. Could be fake.</li>
    <li> Tsar arrived as stated. I would order from this seller again. Very glad someone still has Tsar. It is mine and my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Truly my favorite.  I&#x27;ve worn it for many years and the ladies love the fragrance.  Manly yet not like wet leather.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3.3 Eau de Toilette Tsar Spray. The bottle looks different, dark green but see-through. Not the light green one or the older I used to buy dark green non-see-through. It doesnt smell like Tsar, it is very light fragance, not the usual powerful Tsar. It even stained my white shirt with a greenish stain. It seems an original product looking at the packaging but you will be dissapointed. I talked to Amazon customer service and they refunded my money - that was nice, but now I dont really dare to order Tsar again :(</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for years and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of Tsar; unfortunately, department stores no longer carry this fragrance. If you are looking for a subtle clean fresh fragrance that is versatile enough to fit from a boardroom to a night club, Tsar is a fragrance worth trying.</li>
    <li> Per other reviewers considering vintage bottles, this fragrance used to be an interesting powerhouse. Unfortunately, as IFRA (regulatory agency) restrictions on perfume content and overall manufacturing costs have increased, many manufacturers have simply stopped trying to inventively reformulate older fragrances, so what the buyer ends up with is the modern version of Tsar: a weak not especially complex or interesting scent with minimal projection and average longevity. When applied, I get a burst of alcohol and green, and then in about 10 minutes, some hint of pine, amber, and florals (carnation, geranium, lily of the valley maybe?). I smell no leather, no oak moss, no vetiver, no tonka beans, and only the slightest hint of patchouli. This becomes a skin scent really quickly, i.e. no projection, but it does last for about 6-8 hrs as a skin scent. This long duration is really the only major advantage Tsar has over Old Spice, which sells for half the price and smells oddly similar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Fragrantica.com, there are like 27 different scent ingredients listed for Tsar (or at least claimed for Tsar by its manufacturer), which is simply absurd. VC&amp;A are either having some fun with us, citing historical formulas that are 10 years put of date, or have succeeded in generating the blandest possible result from the most ornately Byzantine of recipes. In comparison, Terre D&#x27;Hermes, with a mere 8 ingredients cited on the same site, smells like it is several magnitudes of complexity higher, a symphony compared to Tsar&#x27;s hummed nursery rhyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I think most buyers should spend their dollars elsewhere. Many of the old vintage powerhouses have not been reformulated into the same decreptitude that Tsar has; Azzarro Pour Homme, Lapidus, Aramis, Havana, Tuscany, Yatagan: all still around, all smell great, though maybe not quite as good as they used to. Even Grey Flannel, which is currently much cheaper than Tsar, smells much better and still has some of its cojones attached. So if you want to see what the 80s (or earlier!) smelled like, you have a lot of options. Tsar certainly won&#x27;t appeal to most young modern male fragrance buyers who love calone, seaweed, and apple. And if your tastes are for more refined \\&quot;older\\&quot; stuff, the dull ghostwater found in bottles of Tsar holds little appeal at the current price point. Get Azzarro PH or Lapidus for less money and have more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Tsar is certainly workplace friendly, as no one will smell it on you unless you are giving them a piggyback ride or are lying on top of them, both of which circumstances are uncommon enough in the workplace so as to preclude their likelihood of occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other exhibits in the realm of the Former Powerhouse Roll of Dishonor are worse than Tsar: the current Halston Z14, Ungaro III, and Paco Rabanne all have been even more neglected / manhandled into smelling weak / unpleasant/ or both. And even weak Tsar smells better than many modern fragrances, alas, but that&#x27;s beyond the point.

    <li> I have been using Tsar for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Fits my chemistry to a tee lot&#x27;s of complements.</li>
    <li> Tsar is my favorite cologne. It&#x27;s a very \\&quot;mature\\&quot; scent, some people find it strange that a seventeen year old wears this, but the ladies seem to like it! I was very happy to find Tsar here on Amazon because the price was FAR cheaper than fragrance net.</li>
    <li> Tsar is a one of kind, classic scent that boasts more longevity coupled with a brilliant and unique scent. My dad wore this cologne when I was growing up, and I loved it. I still love it now twenty years later and its an honor to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the original cologne, not a knock-off. Packaged well and delivered three days early. Bravo.</li>
    <li> Very nice, smooth, rich fragrance.  It smells like a much more expensive fragrance than it is.  I find that it lasts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of woodsy and spicy but not over the top.  Very fresh and enticing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> excellent fragance like always....</li>
    <li> Arrived early by USPS. Excellent protective packaging. It has been my favorite for years. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This one is really not my style I suppose.</li>
    <li> good for the price, let me know when it will be at same price I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> My husband love&#x27;s Tsar! This is his favorite!! My mom got it for him years ago and he wants it every year!</li>
    <li> Love smelling my Husband when he wears this, mmmmm</li>
    <li> This is not my favorie, but comes very close to same.  Very effective spray bottle and a substantially strong bottle, Can take the impact of falls from mmedium high places. Price rewonqble; delivery excellent.</li>
    <li> This cologne is just as great as I remember.  It&#x27;s the only cologne my husband will wear.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I Love it.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it</li>
    <li> I LUV it , LUVVV it , Absolutely LUVVVVVVVVVV it !!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells sooooooooooooooo  GREAT - For REAL !!!&lt;br /&gt;Spectacular -  FANTASTIC  -  TERRIFIC  5 STARS !!!&lt;br /&gt;Chicago , I L.  August 17, 2014</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for a very long time now. At a great price I would love to get the set. That is the soap, the body wash, shaving lotion and cologne</li>
    <li> I found that this EAU De Toilette, that I had got in the past, last longer, I believe, this had to much alcohol. I did not last, I will not getting again...Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It not sweet and really one that i like . It stays for long time and you don&#x27;t need spray a lot</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you, and my grade is 10.</li>
    <li> Very sophisticated masculine scent for a formal evening.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best place to find this... it is half the price of anywhere else.  My dad loves this colonge he wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> Excelent persistence, does not tire you because is not cloying without loosing its power.&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite and also fit my personality flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Even so, this is not for everyone. Taste it first.</li>
    <li> I have bought this cologn for my husband since it came out.  I think it is the sexiest fragrance that he has worn.  We have been married for 34 years and still, when he puts this cologn on, it awakens me.  It is a fresh scent with enough power to it.  It is so different from other cologns. It doesn&#x27;t have the same general smell.  I wish it was sold in our area.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since he use to use it before but was unable to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as his other bottle had run out.  Although the descriptions are exactly the same, the bottle type is different from the one he had previously.  It also seems that this product is not as strong, which I was actually happy about!  No problems with ordering or shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It arrived within days and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for many years. Good to know I can still get it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Tremendous scent!  Makes you feel as elegant as a tsar!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact!</li>
    <li> The price I paid was an outstanding deal, however the cologne was not what I expected for myself.  I would suggest you know the smell before you purchase and know if it smells okay with your body chemistry.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite man scent!</li>
    <li> Always liked this. Was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> OK, clearly, this is absolutely not like the old Tsar of always. Maybe they have changed the formula a few years ago, I can&#x27;t tell for sure, but hey, it&#x27;s still a pretty good Eau. My favorite, besides all of that. I&#x27;m not regret, not at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> So Many Compliments Great Scent</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my husband wears. When he has it on it sets my senses on fire. I love to snuggle on his side of the bed after he leaves for work the mix of his scent and Tsar is wonderful. I hope they never stop making Tsar.</li>
    <li> Tsar is really under rated.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 20 years and the ladies say they like it.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find in retail stores.  I had it in my \\&quot;Saved for Later Cart\\&quot; for quite a while waiting for a price decrease which finally happened.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience or knowledge about the different colognes on the market...I just know that I like THIS one.</li>
    <li> This product was not my choice, my wife, she like it. I will try also, need time to be understand completely , but no remarks to seller!</li>
    <li> Classy scent for the gentry, great use for evening or office wear. Would highly recommend for summer or winter fall. Scent captures the essence of smoke spiced mint with a lemon twist.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is nice but just doesn&#x27;t last. You&#x27;ll have to keep reapplying every hour or so. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> All perfumes works as per your body chemistry. For me it&#x27;s excellent .</li>
    <li> The items were delivered timely.  I will difinately be ordering more in the future</li>
    <li> my husband favorite for the last 20 years ++++..... Elegant, spicy, not over powering, good scent when faded, not everybody trendy scent.!!</li>
    <li> This did not smell like the Tsar I knew and I was disappointed.  My husband was fine with how it smelled. In fairness, I know that scent changes the longer cologne sits on a shelf.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, he used to wear this fragrance many years ago when we were young in our 20&#x27;s I always loved the smell of it, so sexy. Well, we&#x27;re seniors now, we were talking about this product and he said how much he liked it and used it all the time, he would wear it after a shower and I couldn&#x27;t control myself, I would be all over him because he smelled so good. I decided to get him a bottle so I went looking for it and found it on Amazon. I got it for his birthday, and believe me when he has had a shower and splashes on this fragrance I can hardly control myself but I do, we&#x27;re not as young as we used to be anymore, but I still give him a smooch or two just to show him that he&#x27;s still very sexy to me, the grandchildren think we&#x27;re cute and laugh at us when we hug &amp; kiss. This is a product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought Tsar By Van Cleef &amp; Arpels For Men for my father and he liked it a lot and I liked the price!</li>
    <li> recevied package fast &amp;very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I remember this when I was very young &amp; really enjoyed the smell.  BTW, I still have a little left from way back then.  This newer one, bottle is more translucent whereas the original was not.  Smell on newer one doesn&#x27;t appear to be as long lasting, or perhaps my nose is just not as young &amp; acute as it used to be.  But I still enjoy the fragrance.  Would by again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about 20 years and always get warm smiles from those close to me.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> Terrible!! No fragrance and no lasting effect. Someone has meddled with this! Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Amazon owes me an explanation and it is terrible they will not take it back. I have used this product for over 15 years, and feel cheated with this shipment.</li>
    <li> I have using the product for many years.  Always purchased for a dept store.  The scent from this purchase&lt;br /&gt;did not seem to be as strong.  It was a little weak.  Will continue to used the product.</li>
    <li> I know for me that there are a few cologne&#x27;s out there that really are great. I have found at least two that I like a lot. I am always ready to add another to the collection. This cologne was not one that I will be adding.</li>
    <li> Sure wish that I could give zero stars. This is NOT  the Tsar of old. The scent itself is different, and its strength is weaker, positively pallid by comparison to the original. The packaging appears to be similar, but the contents are different. Over time, knowing of my preferences, friends and family had gifted me with several bottles (spray. plus one of the splash), of which I still have a few partly-empty bottles. Four years ago I had spinal cord surgery, which curtailed my going out or using the product. After long rehab, I have begun to drive again and go out.  As the last of those partly-empty bottles neared its end, I ordered this, expecting the same superlative product that I knew and loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I realized that something was wrong the first time I used it. It didn&#x27;t seem to smell the same, and as the day wore on, the scent quickly wore off.  Fortunately, I still have those five-year-old partial bottles to do an A-B comparison. By spraying each on a separate square of bathroom tissue, kept apart, one can test both the scent and, during the course of the day, the strength. The initial scents were clearly different, with the newer product being anemic by comparison. And the fall-off in strength was ludicrous, with the older product retaining its clear, strong aroma far into the evening, while the newer one fell off asymptotically to almost nothing within less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Van Cleef and Arpels have simply adulterated their product, using cheaper materials, or if Amazon has found itself the victim of counterfeiters (more likely, IMO), but what they&#x27;re selling now is not the Tsar of old. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> The product has changed.  Different scent from the original and is not as long lasting.  I don&#x27;t think I will bite on this bait again.</li>
    <li> great smell luv it got it for my husband for xmas its a great product and my husband luved it</li>
    <li> Love the smell. More importantly, women love it. I get compliments all the time. It is a unique smell and Tsar is just not very wide spread so it is different.</li>
    <li> we both love it, not to strong but has a manly smell, great price on amazon, last a long time because he does not have to wear a lot of it</li>
