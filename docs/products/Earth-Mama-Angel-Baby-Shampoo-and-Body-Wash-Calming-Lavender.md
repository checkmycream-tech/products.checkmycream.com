    <li> this is the best baby wash ever. It&#x27;s foamy so you just pump and apply. Easy to do with one hand while the other is hanging on to bubs in the tub so he doesn&#x27;t go under while splashing about. It&#x27;s pure and natural and has never caused a rash on his delicate skin. I deviated from it once because store was sold out and used honest co wash and he got a butt rash. Never again! Love all of the earth mama products (wash and baby lotion) for my son!</li>
    <li> Has a great EWG rating and has cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema on his back! We love this stuff. You do have to be careful since it&#x27;s not tear-free, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for us at all. We will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love the smell and how gentle this shampoo/body wash is to my daughter. I would purchase this again. Hoping that they will come out with a bigger bottle and better pumps.</li>

    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of fragrance which is good I guess for a baby.  Lathers well.  Eh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> My very favorite baby soap! I have used it on my three kids and it is my go-to gift for new baby gifts for the nieces and nephews. It is not a tear-free formula, which means it has not had anesthetizing agents added to hide the sting. It really hasn&#x27;t been a problem for us!</li>
    <li> I bought the calming lavender and received the unscented one.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for my daughter.  We&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months now (since she was a week old)...I love that it foams and is so gentle.  The best part about it, though, is that it so safe for her.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about any nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> The foam is very fun to use and I understand this is a super healthy product too.</li>

I will say that after rinsing his hair it feels a little dry or stiff, but once his hair dries it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Shampoo &amp; Body Wash. I&#x27;ve been using this since my son was born he&#x27;s 6 months old now. It smells great and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It smells like hand soap. And leaves my daughters hair very tangled</li>
    <li> I love this for my baby. It smells so nice and it&#x27;s nice not to have to wonder if my baby will get cancer from using it.</li>
    <li> Its our favorite organic soap &amp; has a soft fresh scent! I love it &amp; refuse to use any other for both my children.</li>
    <li> Amazing for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. She was brekaing out from the soap at school. Sent this with her and she&#x27;s fine. :)</li>
    <li> Like it a lot. Smell so good and leave baby hair very soft</li>
    <li> Smells so great and leaves my newborn clean and fresh.  Very light soap and doesn&#x27;t irritate like other products have.</li>
    <li> We like this product and scent and would probably but it again.  However, I think it needs to be CLEAR that this is NOT a tear-free shampoo. We have always used organic shampoos on our 11 month old and just switched this product. Normally she LOVES baths.  After 4 nights of hysterical crying we were trying to figure out what was wrong and saw the note on the bottle that it is NOT tear-free. The Amazon listing needs to clearly state, as their website does, that &amp;#34;Mama wants you to know! Natural castile soap is NOT a &amp;#34;no-tear&amp;#34; formula, please use with the self-foaming bottle so the wash stays just where you want it, and use extra care around your angel baby&#x27;s eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
