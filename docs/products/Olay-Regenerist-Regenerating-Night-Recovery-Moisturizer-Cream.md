<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife swears by this night time cream. One look at my wife &amp; you would be buying lots of this Olay Night Recovery Cream product too. Highly Recommended. Very good service from seller.</li>
    <li> Still use similar, the only reason I didnt give it 4 stars was because some of the product had leaked out of the top from heat and lid not on as tight.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream.  It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and it makes my skin look and feel dewy and fresh and happy.  It also costs much less than the Christian Dior night cream I was using.  (Though that was excellent too!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite night creams.  The scent is nice and it does seem to last about 30 days which makes the price right.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years, but now I using the new formula and find that my skin breaks out and I get red spots on my face. Went to a dermatologist, got medication and  it cleared up. Tried the cream again and the same thing happened. Now  I know the cause and I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> As the title says it&#x27;s great for the price, goes on soft and makes my skin feel smooth without feeling oily and the smell is wonderfully refreshing!</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Really makes my face feel so good the next morning.  Not sticky, no residue at all upon absorption, just great looking skin as part of your nightly ritual.</li>
    <li> Love this product...works great...think I already notice results in only one week.</li>
    <li> I love all Olay products but don&#x27;t like how oily this one makes me after using it. I don&#x27;t use this as often. Prefer the regenerist daily moisturizer for night use.</li>
    <li> It is good for skin care at night</li>
    <li> I put it on at night and in the morning it is as if I never had those wrinkles or fine lines ever!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  It works better than any really expensive cream you can buy.</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  I can&#x27;t say I look like a 20 year old...but I don&#x27;t look my age.  I believe Olay products are excellent and this is very cost effective and provides great skin care.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Sorry to tell everyone that most of the 5 star and 4 star reviews are for the OLD formula. I&#x27;ve been using the old formula for the past 6 years, it was one of the best and most affordable products on the market - I&#x27;d seriously compare it to the $100 Estee Lauder creams, that&#x27;s how amazing it WAS. I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams and moisturizers but after one dose of the old formula, my skin was taught, smooth and cleared up in the morning, the old version has been one of my staple products since my first use. (I&#x27;m in my early 30s now but people think I look younger now than from when I was in my early to mid 20s, when I experienced a ton of skin problems, including eczema, and before I started using the old Oil of Olay regenerist cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I gave this new formula a try, and, what a surprise, it doesn&#x27;t compare at all to the old formula. Your skin wont be as moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin soft, smooth, firm and glowing in the morning as the old formula did. You don&#x27;t wake up with that &#x27;mini-lift&#x27; and your skin doesn&#x27;t look regenerated. It feels like a regular cream you can buy for a lot cheaper at the drug store. And oh my gosh, what is with the strong smell? The smell to me is the least of this &#x27;improved&#x27; cream&#x27;s problems. Some people complained the old formula&#x27;s scent was strong, but the new formula&#x27;s scent is over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing Oil of Olay tried to save money and used this &#x27;new&#x27; formula as a way to get rid of costly ingredients found in their original version. In fact, when I saw this &#x27;new&#x27; version in the store I almost laughed out loud! As soon as a product works correctly and does what it says it does, the &#x27;brains&#x27; behind the company decide to &#x27;improve&#x27; it and make it worse - right before discontinuing it. This product is just sitting on shelves all over stores, in fact I&#x27;ve been seeing sales all over stores with this new regenerist night cream for a little over 2 months - but they are just sitting there! I would have bought tons of jars of the old version, especially if they were on sale. You messed up big time on this one Oil of Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note - I was just in the store and I saw a bunch of the new regenerist creams on sale (maybe for the Christmas season), I saw three packages of the OLD regenerist cream hiding behind 50 new ones. I almost cried in delight!! I bought the old ones and will try to make them last as long as possible. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to severe my ties with Olay - The new formula doesn&#x27;t compare and you&#x27;ve now lost a longtime customer (I would have bought the old formula and recommended it to everyone until I was old and grey).</li>
    <li> To be honest ladies, when I buy a moisturizer I don&#x27;t expect it to get rid of wrinkles; all i expect is that it will do a good job of moisturizing my very very dry skin; Up until this past month I used Clinque Moisture On Line exclusively; it is a wonderful product with no scent; that product was discontinued. I have spent the entire month buying products on the internet and at the drugstore trying to duplicate Moisture On Line; guess what, the only product that is the closest is Olay Night Recovery Cream; yes the color is putrid (sorry Olay) and the smell I could live without (but I can tolerate it); this is a really good moisturzing cream; if I want to get rid of wrinkles I&#x27;ll get a facelift; If I want a moisturizer that makes my skin moist and smooth, I will use this product. By the way the only difference between a night cream and moisturizer,as I understand it is that moisturizer has suncreen and night cream obviously doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Just love the soft texture of this night cream.  Could notice the difference on my face the first night.  Soft and helped make lines less visable.  Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> OK I have tried tons of creams for my fair sensitive skin to help with my fine lines and wrinkles.  This is the best cream ever in my opinion.  No sensitivity at all and my face literally feesl like a youing childs the next morning! It is so soft and smooth and I just can&#x27;t get over it because I have never had results like that before.  Please try this night cream and see if you love it like I do!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s so hard to find a product that works. took about a week for my skin to adapt but now, my skin is ultra smooth and always feels moisturized without the oily ick factor.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item several times before thinking that it made my skin smooth...BUT this product contains Mineral Oil!!  I found out Mineral Oil coats the skin like plastic - clogging pores and creating a build-up of toxins.  Mineral oil can slow cellular development, creating earlier signs of aging.  Mineral oil also was implicated as a suspected CAUSE OF CANCER.  Plus mineral oil can disrupt hormonal activity!  Just say NO.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this creme, and I also really like the scent... When I put it on it feels luxurious, and my face definitely glows after. I&#x27;m 27, and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet - but I am looking for something preventative, and in general wanted to get on board with the whole anti-aging product trend.  That being said, I do have a tendency to break out if I use the wrong products. The first time I used this, I woke up with a bunch of little fresh pimples on my face and I was NOT happy. For that reason, I didn&#x27;t use it again until a couple of weeks ago. I decided to combine this with my salicylic acid based moisturizer (I put it on first) and see what happened. So far I&#x27;m having good results, although I have noticed quite a few small pimples I feel like it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m going to use the product until it&#x27;s done and then see where I go from there.  I saw another review about Mineral Oil and looked into it; some people say it causes acne - so maybe since my skin is already acne prone, that could be what&#x27;s affecting it.  If you&#x27;re not acne prone I would say buy this in a heartbeat!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about two weeks and I must say that my skin is softer in the morning time. Also, it appears to be firmer. I feel that there is an all over glow too. I am in my thirties and trying to deter the signs of aging. I am a big fan of the Olay line and recommend their products.</li>
    <li> I bought the 1.7 oz and Amazin service was great! fast shipping and good packaging. Arrived perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, one word: It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer, locks in the moisture and I will be coming back for more in the future.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my mother all the time and she truly loves it. Will continue to supply her so she may keep her youthful face.</li>
    <li> I have to laugh when I see the 20-something reviews complaining they don&#x27;t see a difference.  There&#x27;s no difference to be made for 20-something skin - the most important thing is sunscreen at that age.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a night cream that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for you.  That being said, all of us older gals DO need something that does make a difference.  I became hooked on this product several months ago.  I cannot go a day without it.  Would be one of my stranded-on-a-desert-island choices.  Makes my skin feel ultra-smooth and the crinkling I am seeing now in my neck is much less noticeable when I use the cream - not gone away but much less noticeable.  Thanks, Olay!</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed a difference, after a few nights of using. I see myself everyday, so I can&#x27;t see anything different, but it feels much better. It doesn&#x27;t have that dry, crepe-like feel. I use it along with the daily moisturizing lotion w/UV protection. I will continue using, especially through the winter. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s a face cream, not a kid or pet or something! I like it, not love it!! So silly....</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product and it&#x27;s performance is better than most expensive moisturizers I have used.  IF you are like me and take advantage of olay&#x27;s rebate program then my only advice is to buy the product directly from amazon.  They always ship in the original packaging which is imperative for getting a UPC code.  Other buyers may purchase in bulk and then you are ought of luck because all you get is the jar of cream without the exterior packaging which is what happened to me.</li>
    <li> When used regularly, it makes me look refreshed when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay products since about July 2006 and am very pleased.  I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck, after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap (liquid, navy colored bottle) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night.  In the morning, I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream on my entire face and neck. I think this combo, particularly the Olay Regenerist products have made me look YEARS younger--with the grace of God, of course.  I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about 2 months ago, and it made a difference for me. Lots of people at work tell me I look younger, too.  My skin feels great!  It&#x27;s firm and velvet soft.  And wait till I tell you, I have lost 50 pounds in the last 9 months!  Why do you care?  Well, my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss, especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched.  I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up! Guess what??? It&#x27;s firm and velvet soft.  I won&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t own a wrinkle, but they are very very minimal. I&#x27;ve had people tell me I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, too, but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup. Oh, I&#x27;m 57, too--so don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m 25 and telling you I don&#x27;t have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV. It smells great, too. I am sensitive to certain products with perfumes, but not this. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mighty pleased with these products, BUT, use them awhile.  Nuthin&#x27; happens overnight, Hon! (We call everybody Hon in Balmer) (That translates to Baltimore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2007.  I switched the morning treatment from Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream to Olay Total Effects 7x.  It is great.  Super creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2007--Still using same combination of products--still working great.  Am 58 now and have lost 59 lbs and am still quite pleased with these products.lost 59 lbs and am still quite pleased with these products.</li>
    <li> Bought this with a $15 rebate, so almost like getting second one for free. We have used these proucts for years and find they work great, and when you get them on sale that makes it even better. Amazon is SUPER!!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, and really seems as good as more expensive creams.  I plan to stay with all of the line.</li>
    <li> I typically have very good skin. It is on the dry side but I do not have acne -- in fact I break out very rarely (just the occasional hormonal pimple or two). When I first opened this cream, I noticed the fragrance was unpleasantly strong, but I put it on anyway. When I got up in the morning, I had horrible red splotches and whiteheads all over my face. Some of them were even painful cystic-type sores beneath the skin on my chin and jawline. I stopped using the cream right away, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new pimples, but the old ones are taking days to clear up. It totally ruined my week to have my face covered in painful pimples and crusty sores. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t have any big events to go to, or I would have been traumatized.    On the plus side, I called the 800 number on the back of the jar, and the Olay representative was very courteous and helpful. She said they would refund my money (since Amazon doesn&#x27;t take returns on opened cosmetics). I have used the eye serum without problems but I will not try the face creams again. Just not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong perfumey fragrance that I don&#x27;t like at all.  The color is also a little off-putting (grayish/purple) but I can live with that.  I have very senstive skin and can&#x27;t use something with so much fragrance.  I switched to Loreal Deep Set Wrinkle Night Cream and am much happier with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this night cream last winter when I ran out of my expensive department store brand cream and I was shocked to discover that my skin which is well-cared for and pampered to begin with, but dry and sensitive and 38 yo feels as smooth as a baby bottom in the morning when I wash it. I am POSITIVE there is a firming/tightening effect at the jaw area (not that I&#x27;m sagging, but there was a similar effect to $110 cream I used prior to that) - that was a huge PLUS. Also it MOISTURIZED very well for the winter. I already bought another jar for use in the fall. I gave one as a present to my younger sister and she loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that I have a very sensitive skin (that can fell dry&amp;tight, peel or become red) and it never caused any allergic reaction either, so I have options besides Clinique now in times when nothing feels \\&quot;quite right\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Been using it for six months. I love Olay products , it does really moisturize my skin deeply throughout the night. Dont see any difference in my skin though..</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, I can definitely feel the quality, probably the most enjoyable! Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used night creams that I get as gifts-with-purchase from department stores (primarily Lancome).  If I could afford it, I&#x27;d use Lancome exclusively.  Since those products are just too expensive, I thought I&#x27;d give Olay Regenerist a try.   I bought the night recovery cream along with the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the eye serum and the daily moisturizer has a strong fragrance.  I do like the night cream though.  It is very hydrating and makes my skin feel soft.  I can&#x27;t say I love this night cream though.  It&#x27;s thick and gummy in substance.  However, I think it&#x27;s a very good product for the price.   Update:  I&#x27;m now using the regenerist micro sculpting cream and I find that it&#x27;s not as hydrating as this night cream.  Plus, I&#x27;m not really seeing a huge difference in my skin.  So, I&#x27;ll probably go back to the night cream once I finish up the micro-sculpting cream.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, just like the department store stuff, and moisturizes very nicely.  No need to spend 50.00 for the Lancome stuff- I won&#x27;t be doing that anymore. Results are the same, and I&#x27;ve got extra money for MORE beauty products! :)</li>
    <li> This is a terrific night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is wide mouth and allows for easy application. The smell is simply lovely.  Texture is non-greasy &amp; smooth. But most importantly-it works well.  Apply this, and within 5-10 minutes, it is fully absorbed. I am so tired of using night creams and having to lie on my back till they absorb. As a side sleeper/reader, I get awfully tired of spending money on cream just to slick up the pillow-case. With this marvelous cream, it absorbs readily into your face, not onto your pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a significant improvement almost immediately in my skin with this night cream. It is gentle, hypoallergenic, and just simply great overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, Olay! The price is much better than others and performs better, too. This is the cream that won the coveted #1 spot against LaPrairie, etc., etc......</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and have used them for years. Now I can get them cheaper and without having to remember to go to the store!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about trying this as I&#x27;ve used many more expensive moisturizers (Murad, Shiseido, Clinique, Estee Lauder, etc) and all still left me having to reapply during the day or go with scaly skin. I have very dry skin due thanks to reaching that pre-menopausal age and this has been a life saver. The fact that it is so affordable is even a bigger plus.     Although it&#x27;s a night recovery cream, I use it in the morning (I don&#x27;t like creams with sunscreen in them) and it lasts all day. A little bit goes a long way, while absorbing quickly without any greasy-film feeling. Just feels soft on the skin.    I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and had to come back and write a review as I really recommend this product and am rating it 5 Stars!!     Wish they made a similar product for body lotion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00008ZPGA Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum - 1.7 fl oz]] for about a year and thought it made a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  This product is a little richer, for night time use and has kind of a weird purple-ish color.  Not sure why they added the color, but the cream feels good on my face and keeps it feeling moist all night.  It doesn&#x27;t really get rid of existing wrinkles but hopefully it&#x27;ll delay the formation of new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer a product without fragrance.  This has a light fragrance that seems to dissipate after a few minutes and it&#x27;s not really offensive.  Still, I&#x27;d like to be able to order one without the fragrance.  The Daily Regenerating Serum that I ordered this last time has a fragrance as well; I ordered it by mistake after using the fragrance-free version [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz]] previously and really liked it.  I&#x27;ll order the fragrance-free version when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> could moisturize better</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! The texture is amazing! It&#x60;s so soft, not sticky, and it smells good. My face feels like a velvet. Good size!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 but I&#x27;ve been taking extra good care of my skin since I was a teenager so I&#x27;m always on the look for good age prevention beauty products! I recently decided to invest in a good night cream and noticed this one while shopping at Target but was hesitant and didn&#x27;t end up buying it. When I saw that I can get it for half the price here on Amazon I decided I might as well try it because of the price and I also ended up getting the Olay Regenerest Eye Illuminating Cream (which I love!) I got this in the mail only a few days ago but so far it seems like a pretty good hydrating cream. I only have two complaints with it so far - 1.) the scent. Unlike all the other reviews I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all. It seems a tad overpowering for a night cream.  You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d make it a little more subtle. Also, the smell reminds me of a grandma. Or this aweful hand lotion my mom used to use in the early &#x27;90s! But I guess this cream is targeted for someone a little older then I am?  and 2.) everytime I put it on, it stings my eyes a little and they go red! And I don&#x27;t even get it anywhere near my eye area. But other then that it&#x27;s a non-greasy, extra moisturizing night cream thats worth giving a try if you haven&#x27;t already. Because of my two complaints above, I think I will continue to look for a better night cream for me. I think I will try the L&#x27;oreal Skin Genesis Night Cream next.</li>
    <li> Tried other products for months with no result.  My face was dry and red.  Tried this product and saw a difference in less than 2 days, yes days.  After 6 days my face is back to normal.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Not for oily skin, made my face very oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff was wonderful, for the first few nights.  After that I woke up with a horrible looking contact dermatitis all over my face that itches like crazy and looked horrible.  It took over a week to go away.  I am back to Clinique now.  I have incredibly sensitive skin though, and this product is quite strongly scented.  Maybe of they make a fragrance/dye free product I might be tempted again.</li>
    <li> I use Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment regularly.  It leaves my skin feeling silky smoothe, and rehydrates my skin.  It also keeps those pesky little age spots at bay.  Two thumbs up Olay!  Edited 5/2/2015: I used to LOVE this product. I just bought a new jar. When I opened it I noticed it was a different color. Then the strong citrus smell hit my nose. Then I felt it and it is not as silky as it was before. I will be returning this and will have to find a new product. Why fix something that is not broken? Epic fail, Olay!</li>
    <li> I use Olay Night Recovery, well, nightly. I like it well enough to buy it for my mother-in-law whose papery skin begs for a good night cream. (She&#x27;s 90.)  Here&#x27;s my quibble, I do not care for the scent at all. Please, Olay, make this smell as good as your Antiwrinkle Day Cream / Serum. Then my olfactory can be as happy as my skin.</li>
    <li> Now THIS Olay Regenerist I LOVE!  This night cream is fluid and light, smells great, and I feel like it works!  My face feels more toned, my lines not as \\&quot;obvious\\&quot; - I love this product.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smoothly,  absorbs quickly and my skin feels smoother.  Like some other moisturizers do, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your face.  I am generally happy with any Oil of Olay product that I buy, and the Regenerist line is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products so far for night cream. This is the best cream ever. My skin is healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> I am on my second jar of the product and I am very satisfied. I apply this product after using toner every night. My skin feels very soft and smooth in the morning. I do not think the smell is too overpowering. My boyfriend says it smells nice. I got the subscription because I plan to keep using it and to save money. I am 24 but think it&#x27;s never too early to start wrinkle prevention, before drastic measures are needed. This product also seems to help prevent acne for me. As to those reviewers who think the jar form is \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; and wants it to be in a pump, I think that is a non-issue because you should be using clean hands to rub moisturizer on your face anyway. The bacteria on clean hands are not harmful.</li>
    <li> I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad) the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record. I was saddened to find that Olay is still testing on animals. I have been a vegetarian for 12+ years and I guess I have been naive. I believed that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...boy was I wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream works good and going through Subscribe &amp; Save this price is unbeatable...unfortunately I will no longer be buying any Olay products because 1) they test on animals and 2) most of the ingredients in their products are \\&quot;fillers\\&quot;, which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream.</li>
    <li> OLAY, YOU RUINED MY FAVORITE NIGHT CREAM!!!  I have been wanting to review for a while (ever since they changed the formula.) I had been using the Olay night cream for over 10 years. I had been experiencing problems with this cream ever since the color changed from lavender to the current white. The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming perfumed scent, that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would find pleasant, then when you put it on it does not spread as easily and it actually feel like it is burning your skin. I used to be able to use the old formula around my eyes, it was that gentle! I woke up looking red and tired and don&#x27;t use it around your eyes unless you want to wake up with a severe contact allergy. When the formula first changed, I search and searched all my local drug stores trying to buy what was left on the shelves of the old formula, but no one had it, it disappeared overnight. I have since stopped using the cream and have to say I am still on the search for something as good as the old formula. What a waste. So disappointed in Olay.</li>
    <li> I have many acne scars and sometimes my little children, who cannot help but be honest, comment on the bumpy feel of my face. When I use this cream they cannot keep their little fingers off my face because it&#x27;s so soft. They think I am wearing a peeling mask because my skin has such a smooth look to it. Thanks, Olay! I have always loved Olay products and this one is a winner! Cheaper here than in stores as well!</li>
    <li> I just had to call the Olay line of skin care products as I&#x27;d noticed there being something different about their Olay Regenerist night recovery cream. The representive I&#x27;d spoken with stated this product&#x27;s formula was changed. I then had gone online looking at the Olay Regenerist night recovery cream reviews. Many, though I&#x27;m not sure the percentage of the reviews that I was reading were back to back very displeased with the Olay Regenerist night recovery cream&#x27;s recent change in its formula, as the new formula change in this product is noticed something in it has been lessened or removed from this product. I will be joining the other countless bad reviewers of the new formula of Olay Regenerist night recovery cream in looking for a better night cream that will be similar to Olay&#x27;s original formula of this product.</li>
    <li> First time user.  With first application had an allergic reaction with hives for 4 days, only in the areas that product was applied.  I do not normally have an allergic reaction to these type of products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my skin so soft and creamy.  You should try it.</li>
    <li> Terrific product! I have used it for years!!! Non greasy and absorbs well. It is the only one I use!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister.  Not sure if I like it or not.  She does.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying the expensive, department store night creams as I did for 35 years.  This  Oil of Olay works as well, if not better, than LaPrairie, Orlane, Lancome, etc.  And, just think of what you could do with the money you save!  This cream goes on evenly, doesn&#x27;t clog one&#x27;s pores, has a nice scent (not over-powering) and does what it says it is meant to do...A real winning product.</li>
    <li> I usually enjoy OLAY&#x27;s product ok. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either. However, this was absolutely the worse I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells nice, a bit too much fragrant for a face product though. It applies easily. However, this product is just way too waxy and won&#x27;t absorb into my skin. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice, creamy, soft on your face. I haven&#x27;t been using it too long, and it definitely takes a week or so to see results, but now I notice when I don&#x27;t use it. Overall smoothed out skin, helped with break-outs, not oily - goes on really smooth and absorbs well. Definitely works best right after you wash your face. I don&#x27;t know about the firming part, but I&#x27;m a teen, so it&#x27;s not much of a problem for me yet. Overall, I like it, nothing bad about it, really. oh! some people say it smells bad, but I like it, a very light scent, I don&#x27;t notice it once I rub it in. I also use the Olay 7 in 1, and they seem to work well together. I always have luck with Olay products. :)</li>
    <li> Saw this advertised on the internet and thought I would try it.  It goes on smoothly and does not take much.  My skin feels good afterwards!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not only does it smell heavenly, but it really smooths the skin of this 65-year-old.  I paid a fortune for Lancome&#x27;s Genifique and it did nothing.  This really worked.  I look forward each night to smoothing it onto my skin and inhaling that beautiful aroma!</li>
    <li> The previous version of this cream (a velvety purple) was amazing.  This new version (white, heavier) makes my skin look much oiler and I am breaking out.  Wish they left well enough alone.</li>
    <li> Helps to keep face smooth w/o feeling oily. No fragrance and dissolves instantly.</li>
    <li> The classic Olay Regenerist night cream, in it&#x27;s lavender gel-cream formula was a staple.  This &amp;#34;New and Improved&amp;#34; formula is sticky and its smells.  What a disaster for Olay. This was rated the best night cream by Allure, and even with that Olay decided to mess with it and produce an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of the brilliant corporate minds who thought of &amp;#34;New coke&amp;#34;.  Olay, please bring back the original formula.  And make sure to label the packaging as the original formula so your loyal users will return to using this product.</li>
    <li> Trying out less expensive products lately; it&#x27;s pretty good. Burns my face a bit at first, maybe because the high perfume content, but I wake up smooth...</li>
    <li> I love Olay products but unfortunately this particular night cream made me break out. I used it for about a week before I realized what was going on and stopped immediately afterward. It&#x27;s unfortunate I broke out because my skin was feeling smoother than normal. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this tonight after doing a lot of looking for a great \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brand anti-aging/antioxidant night cream.  This got high marks and reviews from a number of sources.  I thought the consistency and texture were fine, not too heavy and spread easily.  It has a light violet color, certainly didn&#x27;t notice once it was spread on.  I was  not prepared for the overwhelming perfumey smell.      The Smell:  No sooner than it was on I was thinking \\&quot;This isn&#x27;t good...\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;ve ever been to the movies, you&#x27;ve surely encountered a heavily-perfumed woman who you can smell from the moment she walks in.  You just hope that she doesn&#x27;t sit by you...and then she does.  Within minutes you know you can&#x27;t make it to the end of the show let alone eat or drink anything with that stench permiating everything around you, so you get up and leave.  That is the intensity of this scent - I had to wash it off. My husband said he could smell me from down the hall, before he reached the end, and I was sitting in a room around the corner.      I can not give it another night, it&#x27;s going back tomorrow.  WHY on earth do companies feel this intensity of smell is appropriate?!?!?!</li>
    <li> I love Olay products! I&#x27;m 21 years old so probably not in the targeted age group but I use their products because I want to avoid wrinkles as long as possible!! When I put this lotion on at night, my skin is noticeably softer and better hydrated in the morning than when I use my regular Olay Complete All-day moisturizer lotion. I also use Olay Total Effects eye transforming cream with it, and it for real works and helps my eyes not look so tired &amp; puffy in the morning (gotta love those 8 a.m. classes). Also I occasionally use Olay Professional ProX clear lotion which seems to help with breakouts but is not nearly as moisturizing. Olay Regenerist night cream isn&#x27;t very greasy at all but I&#x27;d recommend putting it on at night to let it soak in: it&#x27;s too thick to apply in the morning under make-up. The 1.7 oz tub lasts me 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> I am 35 yrs old &amp; I haven&#x27;t always taken care of my skin. When I started noticing the fine lines, I began to panic &amp; quickly started looking online for an anti-wrinkle solution that was affordable &amp; had good reviews.  I have been using the Olay Regenerist line (Detoxifying Pore Scrub, Daily Regenerating Serum, Eye Serum &amp; the DNA Superstructure UV Cream) everyday for 5 months with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the Night Recovery treament to my regimen &amp; after just 1 night, those fine lines were barely visible!  I wake up every morning with skin that looks smooth, rejuvenated &amp; moisturized.</li>
    <li> How does something this deeply moisturizing leave no greasy feeling?  And your skin is insanely soft within the first application.  And it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I love Olay products and this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream.  My skin looks much better, and smoother looking.  I got lots of compliment.</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist night cream is perfect for my dry skin.  I love the way my skin just drinks it in.  There is no greasy feel and I use it morning and evening, especially in winter.</li>
    <li> I love this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment cream. It is a twice daily ritual to use this cream. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd jar of Olay Regenerist Night Moisturizing cream I have bought, I really like it, works well for normal to dry skin.   I would have given it 5 stars but since it has fragrance in it only 4 stars !</li>
    <li> Great! Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and how smooth it goes on</li>
    <li> I have never written a review about a beauty product before but I thought this product warranted it.  I saw an article in InStyle magazine that recommended this specific night recovery cream.  At the time, I had just purchased a much more expensive product but I wanted to give both a try.  So, I did olay on one side of my face and the other more expensive and more time consuming product on the other side.  I was amazed after a few weeks that the lines on the olay side were fading while they were not on the other.  I am in my early 40s. I do not think the lines will go away but they are getting less noticeable. I think this is a great product for the money.  It feels great going on and does not have an overpowering smell.  Most importantly, it seems to work.</li>
    <li> I saw many great reviews about this product and decided to buy one, only to find out that smell is a very subjective thing - many people found the smell great but I found it unpleasant and too strong. I use other products in the Olay Regenerist line, and found them smell fine. I would recommend others trying out the product before purchasing one.</li>
    <li> I am going to be completely honest here: this stuff looks and smells like someone took Vanity Smurf, pureed him, and put his remains in a jar. It is, for lack of a better description, a tacky blue mess with a hint of floral odor. The texture and feel of it can best be described as warmed lard. After applying this product my skin felt like cyber skin. I don&#x27;t really want my face to feel like a real doll. Last I checked human skin wasnt supposed to feel like high quality silicone. In parts of my face it sat on my skin and although I couldn&#x27;t see the smurfy goo, I could feel it... It made me feel like I had a heavy foundation on (despite the fact I used a spare half pea sized amount for my whole face). I resisted the overwhelming urge to wash it the smurf off, and left it over night. In the morning I had several plugged pores and white heads. Yay.    This stuff is pretty nasty and I didnt feel at all like I was taking care of myself when I put it on. It was not at all creamy or luxurious or even pleasent. It was like spreading congealed bacon grease on my face, nasty.    I am giving it 2 stars ONLY because my normally red skin was much less red after using it, which is pretty darned rare.    I wish I had bought something else. I am going to contact Olay and see if I can get my money back. With the plugged pores I can&#x27;t see giving it a few more nights. I also purchased the SPF 15 lotion and the eye serum and I&#x27;m not even going to open them so I can return them and get my money back. I opened the night cream first so I could get a feel for the products. I got a feel. I don&#x27;t like what I felt.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this cream and I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days and I&#x27;m already very happy with it. It absorbs well and leaves your skin very soft without feeling greasy. I use it in combination with the Regenerist Eye Serum and the Microsculpting Serum and my skin looks very smooth and toned. I definitely plan on purchasing this cream again.</li>
    <li> This product smells great. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change.Been using evey night 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS APPRECIATE HOW OLAY IS AFFORDABLE FOR HIGH QUALITY. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FOR A WHILE AND I AM CONTINUING TO PURCHASE IT BECAUSE IT IS SO GREAT! THROUGHOUT THIS TIME I STILL CANNOT FIND SOMETHING COMPARABLE TO THIS. THIS CREAM SINKS INTO MY SKIM SECONDS AFTER APPLICATION AND IT HAS A NICE SCENT THAT ISN&#x27;T TOO STRONG. THE PRICE ON AMAZON BEATS ALL DRUGSTORES AND COUNTERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT KEEPS MY SKIN LOOKING GOOD.</li>
    <li> Olay products are the very best and this night cream is wonderful.  It makes your skin feel so smooth, is not greasy goes on really well. it is as good as products that cost far more than this one does. Purchasing products in this manner quarantees that you will not run out.</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy texture.  I don&#x27;t like wimpy creams, this one is just right.  Have used about one week, like the results so far.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for sometime and this is the first time I can not use one of their products.  The perfume smell is so strong that it irrates my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had been using Olay Regenerist, and bought the night recover moisturizing treatment. I am so pleased; it&#x27;s so light, not oily at all. I&#x27;ve been using it over a month, and can honestly say there is a difference.  My skin is softer, and being 68 years young, I&#x27;m delighted when someone compliments me on my skin. I use this with the other Regenerist products.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle cream; my wrinkles are still there; but my skin feels so much smoother and softer, and it seems like the wrinkles are slightly minimized; not as glaring.  Great product, great price.  I tried some of those fancy over priced creams, and this is much better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light moisturizer to balance my facial scrubbing and cleansing facial washes, the second time I used it I woke up with itchy pinkish little bumps EVERY where on my face (just like many other buyers said), the scent is nice but it&#x27;s way too strong and the container is TINY considering the price. If you never break out this may work for you, but if you have acne-prone/oily/sensitive skin don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> really helps  moisturize  skin</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that it feels good and doesn&#x27;t smell too much, however, I&#x27;ve experimented with it several times to confirm my findings, and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads.  I&#x27;m 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin. On mornings after using this cream, I have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there!</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for years, but I truly love this night cream.  It feels great and really does help reduce the fine lines and wrinkles.  My skin feels moist and smooth, AND, even more important, looks that way too.  I could not be happier with a product.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, makes my skin feel smooth, great base for my make up. I have very dry aged skin. Not sun damaged, but definately aging. I can&#x27;t say this makes my skin look younger or gets rid of wrinkles etc. But it does make it feel better, look a little better and it does keep my make up from caking or drying out my skin. I am very happy with it. The price is I feel a little steep, but compared to brands like estee lauder....practically a steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a bit skeptical when it comes to creams that promise much, but delivers little.  And yes, for the elitists, I *have* spent $200+ on premium designer labels of regenerating cream, including the overrated Chanel Sublimage series of products.  Using the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing cream, I have noticed a decrease in the appearance of fine lines under my eyes.  It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost, and it has worked great for me.  The weird lavender color is a little off-putting at first, but the cream goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly (someone said it feels like lard...NOT true...I&#x27;d like to smear lard on the person who said it, because obviously she&#x27;s never gotten her hands dirty enough to know what real lard on the skin feels like.  I believe that same person also touted her expensive $200+ products as being superior.  Hey, if spending that much makes you feel superior, as opposed to spending a fraction of the cost to achieve the same or better results...that&#x27;s called stupid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be used as reference, I am in my early 30s and keep my skin in good shape already with plenty of water, no alcohol, no smoking, and plenty of UV protection in the occasional times I spend time in the sun.  The fine lines that I had been starting to notice are due to the inevitable effects of age, but this Olay product does a good job of halting (even though ultimately, I know it&#x27;s a temporary thing) the aging process.</li>
    <li> I have used olay products for a long time.  They are affordable and easy to come by.  This is the first time I have purchased them online.  I did so at the advice of my daughter.  Buying that way did save me money.  I put it on auto ship and will continue to save.</li>
    <li> Have noticed my skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture has diminished with time.  This Olay Regenerist product has truly helped. When I awake in the morning and touch my face, I can feel the difference.  And, unlike some of the other Olay products, this has a very pleasant scent.  Would recommend it if you&#x27;re experiencing facial dryness.</li>
    <li> Her favorite cream at a very good price. Quick delivery. Easy , stay at home ordering. The Olay family of products are excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 weeks. I really like what my skin looks and feels like now. I got the day and night cream and haven&#x27;t been consistent about using the night cream on my neck especially, but I will say I like it and will buy again. I have very sensitive skin and have had no rashes or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and used it for the first time last night. Oh, it smells. It is heavily scented, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me - in a time when everyone is going back to natural, organic and unscented - figure out why they loaded up a product for use on your face with so much fragrance. And it&#x27;s floral. Ick. If it were lemon or peach... maybe. But old lady floral? I kept getting whiffs of it as I was trying to fall asleep. I&#x27;m not sure that I can use this product long enough to give my honest opinion of whether it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try it again tonight, using less than last night, and applying with a tissue (I could not wash the flower smell from my hands). The things we do for beauty! :)</li>
    <li> Since using this I can&#x27;t see that it improves my skin anymore than the micro-sculpting cream.  I don&#x27;t care for the texture and I find that if I get it near my eyes that it burns the eyes.  I do like the Olay Regenerist products but will return to using the micro-sculpting cream for my morning and night routine.</li>
    <li> Well I tried this because I subscribe to consumer reports and they said that the eye cream is usually the same as the face cream but the eye cream is more expensive. So I tried it on my face but I have very oily skin it worked well but I had a breakout but I continued to use on my eye area and I do notice a big difference from before they are not totally gone but they sure have lightened up alot. By the way I am african american but I am very light skin and before using the cream someone asked me who hit me in my eye (no one hit me in the eye they were just dark circles) because it was a little darker than the other but after using the cream they are the same. so it is worth a try and consumer reports said it works better than th $300 creams.     \\&quot;Moreover, the luxury-priced skin-care offerings didn&#x27;t work any better than the drugstore brands. La Prairie Cellular, the most costly product we tested ($335 for an ounce of day cream and 1.7 ounces of night cream) was among the least effective. Our top-rated product line, available at a drugstore near you, is Olay Regenerist--as it happens, the nation&#x27;s best-selling brand of wrinkle cream--which cost about $19 apiece for the \\&quot;enhancing lotion,\\&quot; \\&quot;perfecting cream,\\&quot;and \\&quot;regenerating serum\\&quot; combination that the company recommends. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really like Olay and have used it for years but they have slowly eliminated fragrance free products.  I tried this moisturizer, and while my skin looked nice, the fragrance triggered a migraine.  I am at the point where I need the Regenerist line but can&#x27;t tolerate it.  I am afraid I&#x27;ll have to stop using Olay products.  Olay, please offer Regenerist products in fragrance free!  (Why do they need to put so much fragrance in moisturizer anyway?)</li>
    <li> this product literally melts into your skin and makes it feel like velvet! my skin does look refreshed and a bit more taught(?) (tighter).</li>
    <li> Well...the only reason for me to write this review- just to make clear to High-end users- THIS CREAM IS NOT! even close to expensive creams..I have been using LaMer (my favorite), Arden, Lancome (Absolute is the best in that line), Chanel, Pevonia( for sensetive skin) and of course as many of you I was attracted to the recent ads, claiming that Regenerist is better than all expensive brands. Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.I gave Regenerist 3 weeks of try- every...EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make my story short- you can try it ( 20 dollars not such a big loss) but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know yet how good it is, as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  It does cause my skin to feel soft and comfortable, and not dry and tight.</li>
    <li> This night creme is like a mini facelift.  I love the way it feels.  I can tell a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> Thought about buying genefique by lancome but since i still have a full jar of oil of olay night recovery, i gave it one last try. So i&#x27;ve been using this nightly for a month now and texture of my cheeks are firmer since using it. The laugh lines around my nose and mouth are diminishing. glad i did not turn to using the $100 products because this stuff works as well :)    just have patience!</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream. I have dry skin so I use it as a day cream instead of a night cream. I love the smell and consistency. Only complaint was the box part of the packaging was missing but was protected in bubble wrap. The container did not looked opened or used. Prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Yes I can say that this cream has done the trick, my skin was always dry around my nose and lip area, this has now made my skin feel so soft and worry free of dry skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this in combination with their daily regenerist cream. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I look at least five years younger and it has taken away that tired, drawn look. My wrinkles are much less noticable. More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles. This is no small feat. I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in. This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and darkness. Really a big difference in only a week of religiously using it. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I got some disgusting dry skin on my face, I&#x27;m not talking about your usual severe dry skin, my skin was like flaky and scaling most of the time. I&#x27;ve tried everything from 5 dollar Vaseline to 200 dollar lotions, NOTHING WORKED until I tried this for a week! My facial skin is sooooo healthy now! and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week! For those of you severe dry skin I really urge you to give this a try! The only negative I can think of is why don&#x27;t this stuff come in gallons!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this would be a different formula than what I was used to buying in the past. The old cream was a firm texture, light purple in color and had a very light scent to it. This one is a white, very creamy texture and a very strong scent (reminds me of an indoor tanning lotion smell). I&#x27;m not very happy with this at all.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the feel of this cream - quite luxurious. You don&#x27;t have to try and squeeze out the last drops too, which is handy.  I do not however, have any idea if it had made a difference - just like using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since August 09 and I like the way it feels, not greasy and makes my skin soft. Does seem to tighten my face; which @ 50, is sagging and can&#x27;t seem to get up. Most people are surprised to hear my age. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the tone of my skin. Altho&#x27; not a miracle product, it does do what it claims to do. May not work as well as the pricey skin treatments ($200+), so for the money it&#x27;s a good investment in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a lot better than Neutrogena Triple Defense, which has lead my skin to have dry patches on the forehead and chin. This one absorbed quickly, wasnt greasy, the fragrance is fine and not too perfumey and it didnt give me rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I formerly used Christian Dior skin perfector but it is far too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came well packaged in an Amazon box but the cream jar did not arrive in the standard olay box. I dont know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not important though, the jar was in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick cream I use with the serum on my wrinkles. I use this on my face all the time. It leaves my skin beautifully soft. Alas the wrinkles are still there but softer and I guess I&#x27;ll need to laser them off (or perhaps sandblast them in desperation--just kidding). No cream seems to remove them completely. But Oil of Olay products have always worked very well for me, they&#x27;re a good price too. In some tests it appears they did as well as pricier creams. You have to start really early in life treating wrinkles, wearing sunscreen, etc. I didn&#x27;t know about some of this stuff until later in life.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It absorbs into the skin easily and quickly and has a light fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either and doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts (at least in me).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and I can&#x27;t say I see any difference in the reduction of fine lines or brown spots, but does anything really work for these? But the cream does feel nice. And the subscribe and save program is the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> In my first buy, I bought 1 jar from the store. It did have the &amp;#34;new formular etc.&amp;#34; advertisment on the box, but unlike what I&#x27;ve seen other reviews here, the content was rosy and has nice, mild smell. I liked it, but it did tend to form small white residue on my skin after 6-7 hours.&lt;br /&gt;When that run out, I went on amazon and bought the 2-jar package from Bluevine. These come packaged in nilon and do not have boxed. They are specified as made in Thailand. The cream is purple and, wow, a true perfume house. I have to keep the jar far away from me when I apply the cream. However, my skin does absorb this cream better. No residue! I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait till my 3rd buy to guess what is the actual new formular!</li>
    <li> Used regularly for one month, no visible result. I feel better about myself, doing something supposedly proactive for my skin. That is about it. Maybe it just takes longer than a month... to that I cannot reply. Only that it is NOT a one month miracle.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many facial night creams, I can&#x27;t recall them all.  But for the money, I still love this product the best. It goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly.  I get told I look younger than my 57 years, and I think good genes and this have helped!  I also love the fragrance and so does my husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products since I was a teen..I&#x27;m now a senior. When I first discovered the Night Recovery Cream (purple) I was overjoyed. I have allergies to many scents and this one was not only pleasure to wear but the lightness and fragrance was mild and lovely. I spoke with the company asking why they changed it and they said this was a better product. It&#x27;s works, however the pleasure of the lightness and fragrance is gone and I honestly don&#x27;t see that it works any better than the purple so I&#x27;m now looking for a replacement. I won&#x27;t buy this again unless they bring back the original formula...then I&#x27;ll be an ongoing fan again.</li>
    <li> was just what she wanted, even of couldn&#x27;t remember it&#x27;s name&lt;br /&gt;the new formula is just fine</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t quite used this product for a whole week yet, but I do really like how soft it has made my fair skin feel. It seems to lock in the moisture without being greasy. I&#x27;ve been faithfully using this product every night and hope for some great results.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I got the Clarisonic Mia 2 and it has helped my skin TREMEDOOUSLY!  The only thing is I didn&#x27;t feel like not moisturizing my face at night was very smart anymore so I did what I always do....looked on Amazon.  It makes my skin SO soft and it smells great.</li>
    <li> EDIT TO REVIEW: Just wanted to note that I&#x27;ve begun to have an allergic reaction to either this product or the daytime Regenerist Serum (which I mention below). About 3 weeks after using both I began to develop little red bumps around my eyes, which is the only place I apply these products. They&#x27;re not pimples, they&#x27;re some kind of dry, itchy bumps and I&#x27;ve never seen them before. Also, while my skin and fine lines do look better after applying these products, I&#x27;m pretty sure that my skin actually looks worse now (more dry and more pronounced lines) when I wash them off. The products also contain several ingredients that are considered toxic to natural product aficionados. I&#x27;ll need to research that more to know if there&#x27;s any basis for the claim, but I&#x27;d simply suggest you do your homework. For now, I&#x27;m discontinuing use of both products.   I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product. I&#x27;m only 30, but after 2 years of grad school (stressful) in the Northeast (skin-damaging climate) followed by 2 years of a stressful work situation, I developed fine lines and some deeper lines around my eyes. My eyes looked dry and tired and aged beyond my 30 years. I tried various products but nothing has helped as much as this one in combination with the daytime Regenerating Serum. The fine lines are less noticeable, the deeper lines are still there but softer looking, and my skin is generally more healthy and youthful looking. I also quit my job! :)  My only complaint is that this product has a perfumy scent that is bothersome because I have chemical sensitivities (i.e. allergies), and in general I don&#x27;t care for scented products. The daytime Regenerating Serum has a fragrance-free option and I&#x27;ve written Olay asking them to make a fragrance-free version of the nighttime cream available as well. If you feel the same, please email Olay at[...] to let them know. On a side note, the perfumy scent seems to lessen in intensity after about an hour.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of the &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; skin product line. This is the first time I have tried this particular product; I am totally satisfied with its performance. It has made a significant change in my skin quality and tone within the two months I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and don&#x27;t have alot of money to spend.  I  tried this and so far it makes my skin feel really good.  Now, I live in the high desert where we get miserably dry so this product is perfect.  I recommend definitely for dry skin.</li>
    <li> First i&#x27;ll say that at 54 years old i&#x27;ve tried my share of products including quite a few very pricey items.  This is frankly a fabulous moisturizer with a great scent.  It feels crazy good going on ... and that&#x27;s the key to moisturizers once you have &#x27;em ya got to use &#x27;em.  And this one I do.  So much so that I get regular shipments.  I took one star away because it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles but I don&#x27;t believe that any OTC (pricey or not) does that.  I have Retin-A for that.  But since I&#x27;m using Retin-A I need to follow up with a great moisturizer and this product is a terrific moisturizer.  I love the scent but if you&#x27;re sensitive to products with a strong scent this may not be right for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 18 mos.  The smell is fabulous, and it feels great on my skin.  Absorbes quickly and is not greasy.  Does not make my face breakout, and is great for very dry skin.  As far as any other results, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
    <li> helps maintain moisture. goes on well. nice smell</li>
    <li> This should be listed as a perfume, not a face lotion.  Overpowering scent would be an understatement.</li>
    <li> This feels great when using it.  I have not used it enough to see the full effect it will have on my face.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It leaves my skin looking and feeling better. It does what it says it does and I would definately recommend it for anyone who is looking for an antiaging night time moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> I think is should be a good product. Since I am still young, I did not see good improvement on my face. Hope it works if I continue to use it</li>
    <li> I love this cream very thick and moisturizing. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivery great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great for my dry skin. It does not cause any breakouts and smells great. I have used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and I have to say this one is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery helps maintain a great balance of moisture in my skin.  My skin feels softer and look so much better each morning.  I give this product a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night of use. (Last night was only my second night.) The biggest improvement was the redness in my skin. I have scars on my chin from a bicycle accident as well as from acne, and they were significantly lightened/improved by morning. I did some research and discovered it is because of the allantoin:[...] The incredible thing is, it&#x27;s not even that high on the ingredients list. So yeah, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job moisturising my dry/combination skin. I use it on my face, neck, and decollete/chest at night. I am only 33 years old and was afraid this was more than my skin needed, as I believe it is targeted at people older than me, but it&#x27;s been perfect. As for the smell, I have no issue with it. I am very sensitive to scents (they give me headaches and migraines), and it has caused me no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> when i use olay regenerist night recovery cream i notice that my face has a brighter glow to it when I wake.</li>
    <li> Being a redhead, skin care is essential as aging and wrinkles seem to come quicker on fair skin.  By the end of the day, my skin starts looking a little older and tired, and those small lines start staying when I smile or frown.  I Wash with an Olay cleanser then put this on at night.  When I wake up in the morning my skin looks healthier and firmer.  Originally I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was this product or the Regenerist Sculpting cream I was using during the day.  But when I ran out of the day cream, there wasn&#x27;t much change while I used just a straight lotion/SPF for the day. Then, later when I ran out of the Night Cream I immediately began to notice my skin looking older and the crows feet and laugh lines became more prominent. It is not greasy, but feels light and clean.  I absolutely love it and have been using it for 2 years. I have it on amazons program for sending it out every 3 months. (The jar lasts me about 2-3 months.)</li>
    <li> Why change something that works? This new version looks, feels, smells, works awful! I&#x27;ve been wondering why my forehead has been so dry lately. I attributed it to getting older. Thanks, Olay! How ironic that a cream that is supposed to give clients younger-looking skin makes them feel old and dry. I will have to search for a new product now. :(</li>
    <li> my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily with most skincare products but not this one. love how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> This made me break out and had a strong floral scent. It clogged my pores and I would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Good basic night cream.  I use it every night.  But, the light blue color threw me off at first.  Not a magical potion, but for my price range, it&#x27;s the answer.  Have been using it consistently for the past month and think the product will last at least another month.  For those of us on a fixed income (finally retired) this is very important.    Linda from Florida</li>
    <li> Easy to apply on my aging sensitive face feels good and soothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because of the hype &amp; good reviews I have seen and heard. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work on my skin, I broke out very badly. The smell was a little bit strong, but I did like the texture of the cream. I didn&#x27;t break out until about the 4 night of using it so ladies be careful!   However, I talked to a customer representative and they were kind enough to give me a full refund, so overall it was a bummer it didn&#x27;t work but now I can purchase something else!</li>
    <li> Love this. Makes my skin feel soft.  I can see a difference after using this</li>
    <li> I HAVE USING REGENERIST FOR ONLY THREE WEEKS AND I CAN ALREADY SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.I PUT IT ON EVERY NIGHT AND MY LINES ARE LESS PROMINANT.I AM 68 AND HAVE A LOT OF SUN DAMAGE AND REGENERIST IS HELPING WITH THIS ALSO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 and have tried a variety of overnight creams to combat dry skin. Many are thicker and somewhat greasy feeling and tend to clog my pores. This purple stuff is very different. It feels very light on my skin. After I use the Total Effects Revitalizing Foaming Cleanser Face Wash, I put it on pretty heavy about 10 or 15 minutes before bed to let my skin absorb the excess. You can feel and see the difference in just 15 minutes but without a doubt there is a big difference in my skin in the morning. Your skin feels soft, clean and firm but not greasy or like there is a film on it. When I first used it my boyfriend stopped over and didn&#x27;t know I only slept four hours and said I looked \\&quot;really well rested and vibrant\\&quot;. I&#x27;m disabled and can&#x27;t get to the store regularly so at times I used any moisturizing cream on hand. Every time I begin using the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizer I get positive comments about my skin. Now I can get this [[ASIN:B0007W1R58 Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, 1.7 Ounce]] and other products cheaper online. WORDS OF CAUTION: I always forget and put it on my eyelids and right up to the edges of the corners of my eyes. The fregrances or other ingredients will sometimes make my eyes water so don&#x27;t put it too close to the eyes. Under the eye is ok for me.</li>
    <li> This is really a great moisturizing treatment cream. It goes on great, smells nice and makes my skin looks good right away. My only problem is that if it gets close to my eyes they water like crazy! I do need to find something for my eyes that will not cause this problem. But, do use this cream is is great!</li>
    <li> I use this even in the daytime when the wind is chilling..and I have no choice but to go out.  It is soothing and is not greasy in the least.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for years through Subscribe and Save.  It was a light purple color and had a lovely, light scent which I loved, and this is a big deal as I am extremly sensitive to scent.  This month when I received my shipment, the entire formula had changed.  The color is now white (which I don&#x27;t care about), but the smell was a strong, rancid perfume smell which made me ill.  The cream works - my skins feels very soft.  But the smell is a deal breaker.  I have no idea why they suddenly changed this cream, but I am sending it back and cancelling future orders.  It is very disappointing when a company changes the tried and true formula of a product.  It really feels like a bait and switch.  If you don&#x27;t want something that smells like perfume on your face, I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought four products from this line--the Regenerating Lotion with UV, Daily Regenerating Serum, Night Recovery Moisturizing, and the Eye Serum. After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user. But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples. I also don&#x27;t notice any scent. I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!) but the eye serum is very soothing. I&#x27;m pleased with the results and certainly the price!    Update 9/13/09    Well, I spoke too soon about not having trouble with pimples. Lo and behold, about six weeks after I began using all these products I noticed a few dreaded little red bumps, plus one larger one right in the center of my nose. Ugh! I&#x27;ve never had acne, even in the worst of the teenage years. After much trial and error over a couple of months, I think I&#x27;ve identified this item as the culprit. I notice it doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s \\&quot;non-comedogic\\&quot; on the label, which I think basically means it won&#x27;t block pores. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the other items in the Regenerist line, though, so I&#x27;d continue to recommend them.</li>
    <li> Oh my heavens....This is my new favorite product! I am not only battling with &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; I am also pregnant. My face was getting to the point that it was flaking off under even the most moisturizing foundation. I looked ridiculous and I didn&#x27;t even want to go outside anymore! After researching and researching the only moisturizer that everybody gave raving reviews on was Olay Regenerist Night Cream. SO. I went to walgreens and bought it for $24! I was so stressed out to buy such a tiny little jar of cream for $24! Ugh. But I got it anyway knowing that the reviews were amazing so it had to be good. I brought it home and washed my face as quickly as I could then slathered this on! Even with slathering it only took a pea size drop to cover my whole face...and guess what! No flaking! My skin has been flawless all day long! Even my husband noticed! Which is like a major thing :) I know it says for nights but I have been using it during the day under makeup and it is heaven sent!  I wish I would have had the patience to buy it through Amazon and save almost $10...but I will definitely be subscribing to receive this every few months! I would give this product a million stars if I could! I am in loveeeeee.</li>
    <li> I like to put on face lotion after my shower at night, and every other lotion I&#x27;ve used (including a number of Aveeno creams) just kind of &#x27;coats&#x27; my skin.  I tried a variety of methods (cutting it with other lotions or water) to get it to absorb better, and I&#x27;m sure *eventually* it absorbs, but it&#x27;s uncomfortable in the meantime, and I find myself wiping it away through the remainder of my evening routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS lotion requires very little application, and absorbs into dry areas almost instantaneously leaving the skin soft and elastic (awesome-I can tell when my skin has had enough immediately).  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it needs more moisture later on, and I&#x27;m less oily in the morning. They must use some very nice ingredients because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy-(well, it does if I apply too much), and seems more expensive per ounce than most facial creams at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for the women who have reactions to the lotion-I was one of those people with scarring acne in high school, and continued to have painful acne into my 20&#x27;s, and fortunately this lotion has been nothing but great for me.  I have noticed that many of the reviewers who have had reactions DIDN&#x27;T have traumatizing acne as teenagers so maybe that should be taken into account when ordering this for yourself (probably because I had to try everything under the sun when I was younger, and my skin has learned to cope as a result).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me look younger by any means, but I don&#x27;t like the feeling of my dry/tight skin stretching when I move my face, and that issue is gone when I use this cream.</li>
    <li> This is probably the last &amp;#34;regenerist&amp;#34; product I will attempt to buy. Other people seem to like the regenerist line, but this is the fourth one I have wasted money on that has done NOTHING for me. It does not sink into my skin, but leaves a white flaky residue behind. Even worse it leaves my eyes somewhat irritated and MORE puffy in the morning...NOT what I want.</li>
    <li> I turned  60 this year and was unhappy to see  more  wrinkles on my face.  I had been using a product for several years that promised to make a noticeable difference in wrinkles - smoothing them out, etc - but the fact is, it didn&#x27;t make a difference on my face!  I read about Olay Regenerist in a magazine and decided to \\&quot;treat\\&quot; myself for my birthday.  I tried both Olay Regenrist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment and Olay Regenrist Advanced Aging Moisturizer WITH noticeable results - my skin looks smoother and I&#x27;ve actually had compliments on how \\&quot;good I look for my age\\&quot;!  Oh well, I&#x27;ll take the compliment!</li>
    <li> Although this cream seemed to moisturize well, it made my forehead break out in small red bumps that turned into white heads.  I mean TONS of bumps.  It was a pimply rash of about 50 white-heads.  I washed my face and thank God the bumps went away in a day.  I normally don&#x27;t react to creams this way.  I would try a small amount to test it before use.</li>
    <li> I discovered the olay night cream I had been loving and using for years has been totally reformulated when I tried it after I received it. The smell is horrible and I was allergic big time. I called Olay and they told me all the regenerist products were totally reformulated. I was able to find the night cream with original formula at Costco today.Yay! I  wish I could figure out how to return this product to amazon or I would. I am new to amazon prime and happy with it but need Returns 101course!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing.  I have very dry skin (age 56), and in the mornings my skin is very tight.  I&#x27;ve tried several other night creams, but this one is a keeper!  HIghly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream and happy to be able to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve used for a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells ok but is terribly sticky when applied and doesn&#x27;t rub in too well.  Leaves a sticky film afterwards - your face turns into an instant adhesive sticker.</li>
    <li> Luxurious cream, feels good on my face. Comfortable when I went to bed. It didn&#x27;t stain my pillows.</li>
    <li> I am turning 30 this year and I decided it&#x27;s time to pay attention to my skin as I am beginning to get fine lines. I haven&#x27;t bought anything specifically for the face before but based upon the reviews for this lotion I decided to give Olay a chance. This lotion feels great! Though it is only a night lotion and I wish it was for both day and night. It goes on really smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and makes my skin feel super soft- like felt! I wish there was something similar with SPF protection for daily wear. When I wake up my face feels plump with hydration, I have less prominent bags under my eyes and my skin still feels smooth, not greasy. I have made this part of my nightly ritual as it makes my skin feel so good. My only complaint is that upon application it makes my eyes sting a little- nothing too bad, maybe it&#x27;s from the scent? But it seems like before it dries and sets that the scent or fumes from the lotion make my eyes water a little. Once it&#x27;s dry I don&#x27;t notice it any longer and it doesn&#x27;t take long to set. But for a first time buyer I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely buy this product again. Even though it&#x27;s a little pot of lotion it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream so far. It is like mousse. I love the smell.  Had to buy some for my Mom and she is hooked now too.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this night cream is amazing. It feels like silk when you put it on; it&#x27;s so smooth! I was a little scared when I saw that it was a purple color, but who cares what color it is if it works! I think that this cream may also be good if you have occasional breakouts. I have noticed a reduction in my blemishes after using this cream as well as minimized pore size. I kind of had bigger pores around my nose but they&#x27;re shrinking. It really feels wonderful to put this cream on before bed; I feel like I&#x27;m feeding my face a good, balanced meal so that it can be plump and fresh in the morning. I can&#x27;t say much for anti-aging benefits yet though, I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. BUT! I can&#x27;t say enough about this cream. It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a bonus when a skin cream has a nice, pleasant aroma.  This one certainly fits the bill. I feel great when I apply this cream, and feel it adds a lot of moisture to the skin.  It didn&#x27;t do much as far as anti aging, (reduce wrinkles etc) but for the price, it&#x27;s better than going to be without trying to improve the skin.  Good product for the value.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this night cream, i use it for the day as well.  just moisturizes my skin all through the day, no dry spots, and not greasy.  i hope olay will keep making this cream forever!</li>
    <li> I got this just to try out.  I think it is ok, but I don&#x27;t usually have the discipline to use it every night.  For the week that i did use it religiously, I found that it did make my skin nice and soft and smooth.  One concern I have is that it feels a bit oily and I worry that it will clog my pores.  I only used it for a week, so I can&#x27;t really say that it had any effect, but it is something I worry about.  Since it is an addition to my usual beauty regimen that is hard to keep up, I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars, but it did have some positive impacts on the softness of my skin, so it is worth the money if you are willing to smear it on every night.</li>
    <li> Olay is one my all-time favorites.  Have never gone wrong with any of their products.  Have good skin, and Olay has helped keep it that way.  People always guess my age at least 20 years younger. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product 3 years ago--and returned it because of the scent--it is very strong and smells like very cheap, horrible perfume.  I then tried all sorts of other night creams-- drugstore and department store--and went back to the Olay.  It works well and makes my skin look great--still hate the smell but have gotten use to it.  The Day version comes in unscented-- but not the night recovery. C&#x27;est ca.</li>
    <li> Nearing 40 years of age, I&#x27;ve been using this recovery moisturizing treatment for 2 years now and I continue to get compliments about my skin texture and tone.  What is wonderful about this product is that it does not irritate my facial eczema at all.  I&#x27;ve used a lot more expensive products which immediately cause my eczema to flare.  The lotion smells good, goes on light and your face feels like a baby after application.</li>
    <li> At 74 years, I need a cream that really works -- and this one does.  It keeps my skin supple, moisturized and \\&quot;glow-y.\\&quot; My only complaint is that I miss the Day cream and wish that Olay would re-issue it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite upset, this appears to be a completely new cream in the usual bottle and I&#x27;m not getting the same results I normally see. Additionally, I noted that there was no security seal like Oil of Olay usually uses. I bought this via Subscribe and Save but will no longer be purchasing it from here.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay has been around for many years and it just keeps getting better! I have very dry skin, very sensitive skin and have used many different products over the years. I am 54 years old. I have used products that have cost $50.00 per ounce and it not only broke my face out and burned, but caused redness and a lot of irritation. Oil of Olay leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth without a greasy feeling. I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  I am in my thirties and I have used this product for about three years.  If you like other Olay products (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.</li>
    <li> I use it every night and it seems to help with smoothing and soothing out the texture and wrinkles on the surface.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite night cream for years, until I ran out and bought a new pot. Surprise! Same package, different product. The original left a velvety feeling and a beautiful fragrance. The packaging didn&#x27;t warn about a &#x27;new and improved&#x27; formula, which seems very sneaky. This new formulation has a strong smell, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs fully. Greasy feeling almost. Not what I want on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I put this lotion on an night and immediately feel my face more moisturized.  In the morning my face also feels softer, smoother and not as tired as the days when I do not use it.  it has really worked for me!!!  it is non greasy and my fine lines are not as noticeably.  I do think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My previous review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin.... Best thing about this cream is..  It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.. This is a huge plus, tried so many creams but had reactions. It is magical for me in one way that it even settles my existing acne.. Don&#x27;t know how that can happen, I was looking at the ingredients, nothing special to work on acne I guess, but still it is helping with my acne and cleared my skin pretty good. In the morning when I wake my skin is soft. I have even seen the &#x27;H&#x27; between eyebrows and the lines on nose between my eyes are less visible... So a definite keep... Sometimes feel I should use it as my day cream, but have not tried...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current review....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have changed the formula... Previously the cream used to be light purple and when applied it feels very very light on skin...&lt;br /&gt;But the new formula looks oily... Feels very oily on skin and I had a very severe break out... Wish olay could go back to old formula...</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels and think it is a good product but I really can&#x27;t stand how much fragrance it has.  WAY too smelling for a night time application.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like some other creams do.  I wake up looking moist and refreshed.</li>
    <li> First time ordering creams.  Glad I did. Received in time and exactly what I needed.  Will be back in the future for better deals.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product, the scent, the silky feel and the results.  I actually look forward to my before bed routine to put this on.  It has made a real difference with my skin as well, I swear by Olay products!</li>
    <li> Have used various Olay products over several decades. This product shocked me be the heavy perfume odor and heavy texture of the cream.  Used once and threw in trash.  Choose not to bother with cost of returning item.  Seller shipped promptly and safely, just wish item description had more useful (for my needs) info.</li>
    <li> Something happened to this cream.  If Olay changed it, someone should have said something.  I have been using this product for years and something has changed.  Its a different color, smells bad and is greasy.  I don&#x27;t know what happened and Amazon has no idea.</li>
    <li> ...and I love it. It smells so amazing that my s/o has always commented about how he likes it. But besides that, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do; you wake up with hydrated, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a free tip for you: buy this and buy pure liquid vitamin E from Amazon and mix a dab of the vitamin E into your hand with the night cream and apply it. You will have DOUBLE the wrinkle fighting power.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It is very light and non-oily feeling.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> The old one (a few years ago) was great and very comfortable to wear. The new one is too watery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews that often, but I have to recommend this product. I love, the smell, the texture, and the price.</li>
    <li> good product--price is not so good.  I have had this on subscription and have found the price increasing to the point that Sam&#x27;s and Costco both are priced lower.  I am checking wal-mart today.  I have cancelled my subscription</li>
    <li> I orderthis by mistake,but sence it was olay I decide to try it.It is like olive oil on the skin but not as usefull.Just lays there allnight,ner  ver sinks in.I now use it in the morning on my hands to protect then during my house work.Gives a good treatment with gloves on. Lyn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard some much about this cream, I just had to try it out. I love it and it feels great on my skin at night. Thank you</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference immediately with this stuff. I use it day and night. When I stop my face starts going back to the way it looked. You will notice a difference but will notice a difference if  you stop using it too.</li>
    <li> I have problem keeping my skin dewey.  Traveling every week keeps my skin dry and flakey.  Out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, this seems to be the only thing that works.  The consistency is like that of the definity products I tried a couple years ago.  Silky cream texture that quickly absorbes.  I apply before going to bed and don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer again in the morning like I use to.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for the night time. It helps your skin feel so soft and hydrated. I think it was well worth the money.. Especially with the price I got it for on Amazon! What a steal!! And shipping was amazing!!  Got it a day before they said I would</li>
    <li> This item arrived spilling out on the sides of the jar. It is not sealed in a box, nor does it have a seal inside the lid. It looks like someone just refilled an old jar in their bathroom and sent it to me. I&#x27;m pretty sure that is illegal. It is totally disgusting and I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> My purchase was everything I expected with really FAST delivery!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer relieves my dry skin without feeling heavy. I have used many products that are more expensive, and they offer no better result.</li>
    <li> Its very expensive, but I really do love it.  Use it all the time.  I have used other olay products but this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line of products since they were marketed.  My Plastic Surgeon(not used for facial needs)keeeps remarking on my skin and has to remind himself that I am 61!</li>
    <li> I wish Olay had not changed the formula for this cream. Now it&#x27;s too thick. Why can&#x27;t they leave well enough alone? I won&#x27;t be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream gives instant glow and have noticed difference the next morning too. &lt;br /&gt;Mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well. Very nice smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Night Recovery cream for more than a year.  I&#x27;ve never experienced a product that moisturizes so well while appearing so greaseless.  In fact, because of its matte finish, I no longer use Olay&#x27;s Daytime Regenerating Serum which is also a great product, but is quite a bit shinier than Night Recovery.  Now I use Night Recovery during the day AND overnight.</li>
    <li> My experience with beauty products, including this one, closely mirrors that of Kathy W.  (I am also in the same age bracket.)    This product is a must for me.  It seems to be an excellent restorative (youthful look) and \\&quot;preventative\\&quot; (of wrinkles) --moreso than an extinguisher of wrinkles.   Used alone, it greatly reduces the no. of new wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;bust\\&quot; existing ones.  Other products used in conjuction with this (see Kathy W.&#x27;s review) seem to be the secret in banishing and keeping \\&quot;age tellers\\&quot; at bay.    I have tried going without this night moisturizer but when I do, the wrinkle busters don&#x27;t work as well, my skin loses luster,and new, fine lines appear.      This product, for me, is essential in maintaining optimal skin health and appearance, and so far, no other moisturizer can come close to matching its benefits.</li>
    <li> I have just applied the cream, after having bathed and am breaking out. It is itchy and irritating my skin to no end. Horrible! I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews...and I&#x27;m inclined to go back to only using cosmetics that have ingredients that I can understand!</li>
    <li> I love it, but I was expecting a larger size, yet it is good and it smells pretty good too</li>
    <li> Nice and light, but not moisturizing enough to be a night cream.  Also, not much product for the price.</li>
    <li> The smell is slightly medicinal but fades quickly and isn&#x27;t so strong that it aggravates my asthma. It&#x27;s heavier then Olay Total Effects&lt;br /&gt;but soaks in fairly quickly-no sliding off the pillow! Will order again. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Sometimes they need to leave things alone.  The improved formula doesn&#x27;t work as well as the amazing old formula for my dry skin....too bad &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. It makes my skin feel soft after use. I love the entire Olay series, and this product doesn&#x27;t fail to satisfy.</li>
    <li> I live in the midwest and often have issues with painfully dry skin during the winter. I started using this product in Jan. as part of my daily skincare regime and found it helped a great deal with the dryness I was experiencing. In addition to being dry, my skin is also sensitive to many products and I can&#x27;t handle a lot of heavy scents. I did not have any problems with this product, and I think that the smell is gentle. Hopefully it won&#x27;t prove to make my skin too oily during the summer (if it ever gets here).</li>
    <li> This product has recently changed and not for the better. Please change it back, Olay. You took a great product and made an oily mess out of it. Not to mention that this now makes my skin itch.</li>
    <li> I have used this night cream for years and loved it.  The new formula is absolutely horrible.  The color, texture, and scent have changed - none of which are important to me.  What is important is that the new formula is tacky and doesn&#x27;t absorb at all like the old formula - my face actually sticks slightly to the pillowcase even an hour after application, and I wake up with a film on my face due to lack of absorption.  Because the cream just sits on the surface, my skin is noticeably drier after 1 week of use.&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years, I will be changing night creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found I can&#x27;t use any of the regenerist products as they make my face swell, particularly under my eyes even if I avoid putting any of the product near that area.</li>
    <li> I AM THAI BUT THIS PRODUCT MAND IN THAILAND</li>
    <li> Older version. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer, but I have not see other functions of it.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong when using Olay products. The night recovery cream is a very good moisturizer that I apply at night before bedtime. I can truly see a diffrence in the feel of my skin on my face. It is much softer. Really like this product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This night cream is pretty good.  I do not use it now because I found Meaningful Beauty but I did use olay until recently.  It was much better than most products out there.</li>
    <li> THIS CREAM IS WONDERFUL, ALONG WITH THE REGENERATING SERUM FEELS LIKE NO NIGHT CREAM I&#x27;VE EVER USED. I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry skin and this is the only lotion that really works for me. I have it on a subscription and use it all the time. love it</li>
    <li> i have used a number of olay products. i have been very pleased with all of them. that is why i chose another one. this is the only cream i have used that did what it says and does not cause break-outs.</li>
    <li> First of all - this stuff smells SO good. I can&#x27;t stand unscented products or citrus-scented moisturizers (like most are). It&#x27;s a little thicker than a lotion, but not as thick as a cold cream. I have combo skin that flakes around my eyebrows and nostrils. This solved my problem. No flakiness and nice smooth skin. I&#x27;ve tried several Olay products and I am hooked. I will never try another brand again. I also highly recommend the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer for the morning and Olay Thermal Cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for over 2 years now.  Each jar lasts for quite a while.  I love the smell of this cream.  The consistency is nice as well.  I use it in the evening/night and during the day if I run out of the Olay anti-aging day cream, and it works well - feels good on and absorbs well into the skin.  Remember to wear sunscreen if using this cream during the day.</li>
    <li> This is great to put on at night so I can do my morning routine and not go into work with a greasy face.  It softens the skin really well, and even though I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference with fine lines, my friends have commented that they can.</li>
    <li> This review is for the cream itself... Fantastic product, silky feel, and the right ingredients (peptides) for anti-aging. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and since I started, I do feel like my face is moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is warning for one of the sellers on amazon; UPUPHEALTH when it was known as the seller &amp;#34;PHARMACY-FRIEND&amp;#34;. Service was prompt, but buyer beware!!!  The item I received was NOT legitimate. It was a knockoff Olay Regenerist Cream. Amazon was prompt in resolving the issue, but I will think twice before purchasing my favorite cosmetics for a price that is &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34;.  Pictures of the fake product attached.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay products.  I have never used this one before but it appears to be working.</li>
    <li> I used this every night for about a month as I am experiencing so premature aging. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for on my fine lines. BUT the effect it had on my pores and skin was amazing! Just after the first use I noticed my pores were getting small and my skin was smoother. I have oily/combination skin so enlarged pores are a problem. This stuff made them tinier than they&#x27;ve been since I was a kid. They didn&#x27;t vanish completely but it was a marked improvement. I&#x27;d recommend the Alpha Hydrox line for getting rid of wrinkles (and pores as well).</li>
    <li> I put this on the first few nights and it irriated my skin. I stopped using this after the 3rd day.</li>
    <li> The next morning when I wash my face I can still feel the smoothness of the cream. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s worth every penney</li>
    <li> Nice product with a really nice scent for night time wear.  I like rubbing it in before going to bed. Reminds me of Mama.......</li>
    <li> ***See Update Below***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so all reviews of skin creams need to take into account whether one particular review pertains to your situation. My skin type is combination, and as I age I notice the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; areas getting drier, and the oilier areas still oily, but not as much as my younger years. That said, I wanted a night cream that felt good going on, no greasy, didn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, and worked well for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on unbelievably silky and NOT greasy at all (not as silky as a serum, but similar).  I literally feel like the stress in my face melts away as I apply it from the forehead down. This does have a fragrance, but it is subtle and pleasant. I am extremely sensitive to smells and cannot stand many face creams for that reason. This one is lovely. When I wake up, my skin still feels soft and smooth. My driest areas can be a little dry by morning, but generally it is pretty good. Therefore, if you have extremely dry skin, this may not work for you.  I have used it for several years now, and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;3/14/2014 I just received my latest order from Amazon&#x27;s auto ship program, and I was horrified to discover Olay completely changed this product, but kept the original packaging. It is white now instead of purple, the fragrance is different, and it is now thick and greasy feeling. It is so awful that I had to send it back and cancel my auto ship. I cannot believe Olay would do such a drastic change when the product was so amazing before! So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nice scent but seemed heavy when applied. My makeup went on a bit cakey after using this.</li>
    <li> this would be a five star product, if it weren&#x27;t for the EXTREMELY awful perfumy smell to it!  I love the mouisturizing, better than high priced department store products and I really want to continue using it, but im not sure I can handle it.  I just never understand why these companies insist on such horrible smells:(</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using it for over 2 years now and like it a lot. Good good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The price was good and delivery was quick and simple</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product; however, I have decided to go more natural...</li>
    <li> this is a &amp;#34;reorder&amp;#34;  I am very enthusiastic about this entire line of Olay products for my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and unfortunately opened it after the deadline to return had expired.  The packaging looked legitimate so I did not have any concerns to open it before I finished the jar I was currently using.  When I opened the jar, this product was a different color (not the light purple it should be) and it had a different smell and consistency.  I went to the store and purchased one to see if the product had changed.  It has not.  Needless to say money wasted as I will not be using this product on my face since I can&#x27;t trust its authenticity.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The effect is very good.I used it in all parts of the rough skin, the skin becomes soft and smooth,I like it very much,and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I haven&#x60;t used it long enough to determine the effects, however it feels luscious going on and the fragrance is lovely but not heavy.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before bed for several months and I definitely see that my skin looks more soft and supple, with fine lines and wrinkles that have almost disappeared. I saw on Dr. Oz the powerful anti aging properties of phytoceramides, CoQ10 and Reservatrol, and I tried both Renuvaderm and PhytoDerm PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz! Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant - Sells Out Fast! B00IT4POOG and B00JK5ZN76 Renuvaderm - The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement! CoQ10, Resveratrol, DMAE, Polypodium Leucotomos, Phytoceramides, Vitamins A &amp; C for Younger Looking Skin! Clinically Proven Ingredients to Help Restore and Renew Your Skin and Make You Look Youn...and found that each of these were like a facelift in a bottle, with the Renuvaderm working better for me. Combine the Olay night cream with Renuvaderm for amazing results.</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin especially when your skin this moisture in it I out this on every night before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning my skin look wonderful and youthful. All of olay products are great and I will keep buying olay for all of my facial needs</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mother-in-Law for Christmas and she just raved about this cream so I decided to get two of them for her for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She was so excited when she opened the package.  I highly recommend this cream…she just loves it!</li>
    <li> It was really nice!! Good deal!!</li>
    <li> I have used and loved the night recovery cream for several years.  I just bought a new jar, and when I opened it I thought it had gone bad.  The color was different and the smell was horrible.  When I used it, it felt sticky on my skin and I even stuck to my pillowcase!  When I called the customer service number, they said that the color had changed, but not the fragrance ( this can&#x27;t be true).  I am so disappointed with their &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula.</li>
    <li> I only use this at night and it does make my face softer.  I really like it.  At first, it can feel a little oily but by the time I get up my face is just soft.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. The lot was due.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nighttime cream for about 10 years.  Noticed last month on the box it said\\&quot; Improved Formula\\&quot;.  But now it doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin like it used to.  It seems to sit on top of the skin then flakes off.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they&#x27;d go back to the old formula.</li>
    <li> And evryone thinks I&#x27;m 10 years younger than my real age. It works better if you start early, around 25.</li>
    <li> good value at the time, no special results</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream and I can definitely feel and see the difference in my skin in just a few weeks.  I have been using more expensive night creams that weren&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
    <li> Beware the new formula if you have sensitive skin! I have been using this lotion for some time now because it is the only lotion that my sensitive skin can handle.  However since they changed the formula it gives my face the same rash other lotions have given me in the past.</li>
    <li> This product has a sickly smell and it feels sticky and waxy.  I loved the old product and I would always buy it for friends.  Now I will tell everyone to NEVER buy this.</li>
    <li> The color, smell and texture have changed and I am breaking out.  My sensitive skin is much drier.  Have tried to use this for two weeks, but I quit- after using the great original cream for years.  Note that positive reviews of this product are coming from consumers who are not comparing this cream to its predecessor.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife.  She loves it.  I have no idea if it works, she likes it though.  Given that it is cheaper here than anywhere else, this is where I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I SAW  DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN IN ONE WEEK.  PRICE IS RIGHT TOO.  I ALSO USE NIGHT CREAM WHICH IS GREAT  NOT AS IMPRESSED WITH SERUM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking younger already. This cream smells nice and goes on smooth. Isn&#x27;t oily either and feels very light weight.</li>
    <li> I woke up one day and realized that i do not take good enough care of my face.  After much research i came accross this Olay line and while the other products in this line are great i think the night cream is THE BEST!  it really feels like your face is sitting in a thick milky silky refreshing bath.  It leaves my face a bit oily at first but absorbs really well overnight and i wake up with my face feeling nice and soft and it feels plumped and not wrinkled and dry.  I am 28 and this product works well for me.... i boasted this product so much my mother took a chance on it and she loves it!  really good for the price as a little goes a LOOOONG way!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Olay Regenerist creams. Olay makes so many good products for dry, aging skin, and they all have served me well.</li>
    <li> I wanted a night moisturizer that is gentle for sensitive skin, didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I really love this one and it smells good too! My daughter says I smell like a delicious smoothie when I put it on! It is kind of fruity smelling.</li>
    <li> There is no need to buy the expensive, department store beauty counter moisturizers for 4 times (or more) the price.  This is the most luscious night moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few).  It feels wonderful, and the effects are immediately noticeable.  After the first night of using it, my skin was noticeably brighter, smoother, and softer.  I hope Olay never changes this formula, because I want to use it for the rest of my life :-)</li>
    <li> good night cream for the price.</li>
    <li> While I find the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula acceptable. I would prefer they bring back the older formula, with the purple-lavender colored cream. I use the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, as well, but my skin sweats as soon as I put it on, and I find the moisturizing effect of the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream to be less effective than the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. I will often use the Night Recovery Cream during the day and again at night, if necessary, instead of the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream because it does a better job of keeping my skin deeply moisturized, soft, youthful and feeling good.</li>
    <li> out of your requirement only and only out of that requirement, i can state that this is a great product.</li>
    <li> In with the old &amp; out with the new.  Another new &amp; improved product the company &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; that did not need &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; . Absolutely loved the original version - the purple stuff - do not like the new product at all.  Will no longer purchase Olay.</li>
    <li> use it ever nite leaves my skin not so oily but soft it does keep wrinkles away been using it for awhile</li>
    <li> Not a complete miracle worker but i definitely see some improvement in how great my skin feels in the morning. Also looks a lot less dull- especially great for colder weather</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m headed on to my seventh decade of life, I&#x27;ve been trying hard not to make that look too obvious.  Olay products definitely have helped to keep my skin moisturized and excessive wrinkling at bay.  This is my must-apply before bed, especially around the mouth, eyes, forehead and neck.  Daytime must-apply is [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]].  I love them both and get lots of compliments on my skin.  Not bad for an older lady!</li>
    <li> this is for my mom and she love it this is great for keeping my skin healthy.great product. i recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very smooth &amp; moisturizing. I have very dry skin and use it whenever my face needs hydration. It instantly plumps up my skin and makes my skin soft and healthy looking. I also use it under makeup. But you have be careful not to use it directly under your eyes unless you allow it to dry for 20 minutes or more. Otherwise any undereye makeup will smudge because of the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this night cream as I wanted to have a mositurizer for night and day. After two days I strated to break out bad all over my face. I even tried just using the product on just my neck and chest and noticed that started to break out there as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Olay stuff. This one makes my skin feels soft and beautiful. I will definitely recommend it to all women. Not just older women, but all women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just rating the product NOT the seller. I received my order very quickly, and was happy about that. I&#x27;m just not happy with this Olay. I used it every single night for 6wks, and my skin is still dry, I think it&#x27;s even more dry than usual especially around my forehead. Also I noticed this product made my skin breakout a lot more. I usually just use the Olay complete lotion, and have always been happy with that. I wanted something that was a bit heavier as a night creme for the dry winter months, and this just wasn&#x27;t it for me. I ordered a couple different night cremes (not Olay) hopefully I&#x27;ll have better a experience with them.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and find it works well. The scent is also very relaxing. Good value. Great item.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SPENT OVER A GAZILLION DOLLARS ON PRODUCTS FOR MY ADULT ACNE, PRESCRIPTION INCLUDED.  LOOK NO MORE.  WHO KNEW!!!  I USE THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FACIAL SCRUB AND THE NIGHT MOISTURIZER.  I COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER.  FINALLY!!!!!!  I KEPT HEARING A TALK SHOW HOST SAY HOW WE ALL NEED A GOOD MOISTURIZER SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS ONE.  THANKS WENDY WILLIAMS!!!  I WILL BE USING THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE</li>
    <li> Thankfully, I have never used this product!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product based on the other people&#x27;s reviews, however, upon arrival, I noticed that the ingredient list on the label is different from what is indicated on the website. This product has acrylamide bi product which I just run away from whatever that has acrylamide! This substance is very carcinogenic and I have worked with this product with LOTS of care in the lab. Also, it does contain titanium dioxide which is another carcinogenic item. I couldn&#x27;t return it because it is a beauty product but Amazon customer service is the best for resolving my problem!</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this product due to all the advertising hype but again felt it was only another moisturizer on the market but not something that made any definite changes in the skin.  Hopefully they will find a product that will really make a difference.  Probably have to spend more money than what this item costs.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I just started using this a couple of weeks ago and I have seen dramatic results already. My under eye dark circles lighten a bit, the wrinkles in my eyes are now softer, and my facial pores are smaller. I have few people commented already about how my skin improved a lot and they wanted to know what product Im using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is that, a few days ago, my skin started to break out (under the jaw). I just used an Acne wash to control it. But Im not sure if it is this product that is causing the breakout or it is that monthly thing where our hormones (women) are all whacked out. I think it is the later because I always break out when my period is about to come (sorry too much information).</li>
    <li> the first time I use it, it hurts my face a little, so i thought this one might be bad for skins, and I did not do this review. Now, I almost get done this bottle, and my skin changed. This cream is thick and it does make your skin smooth overnight. I am 23, and I think it helps to reduce your redness on your skin. When the first time you use it, you might feel kinda hurt on your face, but later on, after you use it for one week to two weeks, it makes my skin feel really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I also brought the my beauty dairy, and I use that mask first for 20 mins, and then apply this cream directly to my face. Its really wonderful, I recommend this product. this one also cheap too.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin...this is great to put on before bedtime, I been using this for a few years and its great!!</li>
    <li> After decades of loving the original formula, and using it nightly, I despise the new stuff.  What is that godawful perfume smell designed to cover?  It makes my skin itch.  What are they thinking?</li>
    <li> This product is for my wife, it keeps her happy, and therefore I am happy too.&lt;br /&gt;It says night recovery on it, but trust me, as a man if you had too much to drink, and you think putting it on your face will help you recover from a hangover you are mistaken</li>
    <li> The old version was much better.  Please bring it back.  This one is not as smooth and creamy and it has a strong scent.  The texture and scent of the old one was much better.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and have always been very happy with it.  I have very sensitive skin and find it gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> This product came as described.  Works well for me, I made the right choice.  Seem to be reliable and does exactly what it states.  Feels comfortable on my face.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin that flakes badly without regular exfoliation and moisturizing.  I notice a big difference when I get lazy and go to bed without moisturizing first.  This cream has a mild but pleasant scent, and the small jar lasts me for about 3 months.  It makes my skin feel so soft the moment I apply it, and my skin still feels good in the morning (not overly greasy or dry).  This cream seems to give my skin just the right amount of moisture.  I get compliments on my skin all the time, and most women are surprised when I tell them I use Olay.  I&#x27;m a bit of a department store makeup snob who only uses a few drugstore items.  This is one that I will never give up!</li>
    <li> Great product. my skin shows remarkable results, I will continue to use it for may years to come. I am 67 and my skin looks and feel like I am in my late forties. I have had no face enhancement procedures done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my parents and they seem to be happy with the results that this is giving them.  Remember its not a true overnight process it may take months to work if it even does for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and absorbs well. My face is still soft and not dry in the morning, and since it&#x27;s winter as I write this, and I live in Virginia, the heat in the house dries out everything including my skin (especially considering my age). I have this on my &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; list so I never run out.</li>
    <li> This cream...hmmmm, it&#x27;s very nice, but it does have a kind of strong scent to it. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, if I had my choice it would be unscented. Having said that, it is not too overpowering, once you get used to it. I use it most nights just because my skin gets dry in the winter. As for the anti-aging properties, I&#x27;m not so sure, but it&#x27;s a good nourishing night cream, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Olay products has been my favorites for years now. Each of them are&lt;br /&gt;such a delight to use and this is lives up to its reputation! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how much I love this cream, having sworn by other boutique creams that are many times higher in price.  I use it over a serum (alternate which ones) and find that it really does seem to firm and even out my tone in the morning.  Has a matte consistency on the skin...only need a thin layer.  A great &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; find that rivals the top creams on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it makes your skin look and feel smooth the next day. Worth purchasing again. Great</li>
    <li> Either my skin or the product itself kind of rolls off after I apply this.  Even after I have exfoliated.  Maybe this is the \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot; part, but I don&#x27;t care for it.  Very strange.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  2 stars for moisturizing evenly.</li>
    <li> I love the gel texture of this treatment.  It works really well and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I so loved this night cream (original formula), but now they&#x27;ve gone and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it.  WHY?  The old adage, &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; certainly applies here.  This stuff sits more on top of my face now, leaving a heavy film that I can literally rub off in chunks.  Even in the morning after having been on all night!  They also changed the fragrance, too, so now it&#x27;s not nearly as pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Olay Regenerist products, so went on the hunt for another cream to replace this.  I thought perhaps a day cream might work, but the most recent reviews for their day cream are saying the same thing ... Olay has changed the formula and the results are extremely disappointing to those who have grown to love this line.  Bummer!!!</li>
    <li> Always makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last couple months along with an Olay day cream and serum.  they do not hurt, but I really do not see that they have made any difference.....I do not think they are worth the money to me....you may be different.  what seems to work best for my skin is plain organic coconut oil...not only do I love the smell, but my skin loves it and it does not irritate my eyes.  But the Olay is not expensive, as wrinkle creams go, so give it a try!  it might work better for you!!</li>
    <li> I do not like the new formula, seems a bit oilier for my skin. I miss the purple formula and it&#x27;s fresh scent. I emailed Olay to let them know I did not like the new formula and I never got a response so I guess they do not care about customer feedback. I did find the old formula in some stores so have a couple of bottles but after they are gone I will start looking for a new brand.</li>
    <li> Love Olay products. So convenient to by from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My go-to night cream. Have tried many other, more expensive department store/spa creams, but the results have never been been different enough to justify the price difference.</li>
    <li> Best cream I&#x27;e tried---and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
    <li> I get great smoothness from using this on my 61-year old skin. Recently the formula changed from lavender to white. I assume it will still work as well.  I use it at night and before work.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this night cream , its not real heavy, it has a nice smell  .Thanks Amazon for a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Imagine my dismay when my latest shipment arrived and instead of being the purplish color that I was used to, the jar had a white product inside instead! Okay, I thought, I will try it. This product does not glide over your skin like the original fantastic formula. It feels sticky by comparison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to look forward to putting this product on every night.  No longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out to all my local stores to buy up all the jars of the original formula I could find. When I finish these I will be looking for new nighttime product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumb move Olay!!</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out. I will update once I start using it again. I have stopped for a couple of weeks for my skin to recover. As soon as I stopped using it my skin cleared right up. Seemed to be excellent for moisture though for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This has a great soft fragrance and feels so nice and creamy on your skin.  It has helped my eyes and face wrinkle areas improve and I think makes me look younger.</li>
    <li> I do not know it was good. I did not see all effectiveness.</li>
    <li> ......after using it I felt. A difference in my skin.  After 2 weeks the smoothness is noticible .  Will continue using.</li>
    <li> Started using this when I turned fifty I needed something that would really mostureize my skin and this works great its light and love the smell. I even use it under my makeup in the day time. I mostly use it under my eyes</li>
    <li> This seems to be one of Olay&#x27;s better products.  What&#x27;s appealing about Olay is the price, mainly, and they&#x27;re a popular enough brand to seem reliable in quality and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this really helped improve my skin over the winter, rather permanently (or at least permanent enough it would take months of no use and damage to revert).  It is very heavy, and oily, so it makes applying and sleeping in it a little uncomfortable.  I couldn&#x27;t use my eye masks or this stuff would rub off or clog my pores, resulting in baggy/oily skin in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I slopped it on, because the more I used, the better my skin looked in the morning.  But over time, if used every day, I would get increased blackheads so it doesn&#x27;t seem like a friendly night cream for humidity/summer days, and doesn&#x27;t really need to be used every single night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is too small, imo, even at it&#x27;s cheaper price, as it gets used up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, am not put off by the color or smell.  The smell is okay, passable and ignorable, and I can only think that it&#x27;s purple because of the lavender.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a dye since it doesn&#x27;t color/stain the face or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has, so far, been the best night-time cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  There&#x27;s probably much better out there, but this has worked the best for me on a limited budget.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. It may work well for some people, but for me it caused some skin irritation. Back to square one in my hunt for a new night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, you put it on at night and when you wake up your skin is soft and supple!! I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I barely dipped the tip of my finger in the jar ans used that amount on my face and felt like I rubbed grease on my skin. I also broke out from this. I am not saying the product is bad, it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This is a big deal for me, I break out with most moisturizers so i&#x27;ve tried a few to get here. I did own another brand that I loved, well besides the smell. Which is where this product dominates, it doesn&#x27;t make me smell like my grandma used to smell ;) it makes my face smell great (my gf confirmed) which is a huge plus. I use extremely tiny amounts and it works like a charm</li>
    <li> I cant really say that I see any effect as such on my skin but I can def say that its a brilliant moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> Ok product didn&#x27;t reorder</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase !</li>
    <li> The product works decently (definitely not exceptionally). It&#x27;s a little heavy but not unacceptably so for a night cream. What I really have a problem with is the scent. It&#x27;s so strong!!! I have a hard time sleeping in it, and my husband hates it. I truly wonder just how bad the other ingredients must stink if Olay had to add that much fragrance to the product. Makes me reconsider exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
    <li> A decent face cream---really nothing out of the ordinary. my wife likes it not loves it.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Well priced and saw results within a week of nightly use. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> After two containers, using every night as directed, no visible difference in my skin.  My skin was soft but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what this does, but I do like my skin better in the morning after I&#x27;ve used this the night before.  Been using Olay products almost 40 years.  Started with basic Oil of Olay, but now I&#x27;m using the lotion for daytime with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dermatologist told me long ago not to spend a lot of money on fancy creams and lotions.  It was a waste.  He recommended Albolene for cleansing.  I started using Olay on my own.  I have great skin, especially for my age.  And I don&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Effective soft .. good</li>
    <li> I would have given a rave review...but the original (lilac colored) formula has been changed.  Olay states it is better and more easily absorbed...but for me it is not.  It is now white, heavy, greasy and just sits on my face, getting in my hair and pillow, no matter how much I massage it in...my face is all shiny when I wake up and I get acne breakouts now!  I am almost 63, and  I don&#x27;t want grease or acne on my face!!!  The former formula was absolutely perfect for me.  I will no longer be purchasing this...I&#x27;m very sad :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooooo many night creams from the very most expensive to very least priced and this seems to be the best for me.  It adds moisture without the heaviness that some have and has a light refreshing scent.  I&#x27;ve bought this in the stores but is so much easier online and most times I find it less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love all olay products.</li>
    <li> I use the cream for day and night.  Its light, smells good but I would not say that it miraculously changed my skin or wrinkles.  For the price worth it.</li>
    <li> Finally a Night cream that does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. At 47 my skin has started to get fine lines and my neck isn&#x27;t as tight as 10 years ago (Of course) This really helped the fine lines and also noticeably  tightened the skin on my neck. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this item many times in the past couple of years and just love the way it makes my skin feel hydrated. My skin seems to have gone from being oily in my youth to extremely dry now that I am in my sixties. This is the only cream that gives me the refreshed and hydrated feeling my skin longs for, especially at night. I&#x27;ve also used it during the day when I have been outside for extended periods. If you are looking for a cream that feels like it&#x27;s still on your face and not being absorbed in immediately after applying, this is the one to use.</li>
    <li> Love this Olay cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks and LOVE it! I look forward to getting ready for bed now as I feel that I am really pampering my skin. It feels so luxurious and goes on so nicely! It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel at all sticky. My skin texture seems so much nicer, very velvety. I have recommended this to my daughters and wish I had started using a night cream earlier - I am now 53.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for several years and I think it is time to give it a good review.  I love the feel and the scent, but lots of people can say that. The trick is that I have VERY sensitive skin and I am also allergic to most fragrances.  When I first opened the jar I worried that it was scented because I avoid perfumes obsessively and with good reason. I almost didn&#x27;t try it because I didn&#x27;t want to chance a migraine.  Nevertheless, I tried it and it did not give me a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks good, feels good and even my daughter has liked it when she was without her own moisturizer. Another daughter who makes her own skin care products has even given the ingredients her approval.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a few years, when the cream was light purple. It has always been excellent! Purchased this..NEW FORMULA...it&#x27;s white cream, filled with perfume(perfume belongs on your wrist NOT your face) and every morning I have to scrub my face because this creams peels off like dirt. Its horrible. It no long penetrates just stays on the surface and drys and turns into slivers of dirty cream. UGH!!! why couldn&#x27;t u just leave WELL ENOUGH ALONE??????????????????</li>
    <li> I have been very happy for many years with Olay products.  Would recommend them to anyone.  I am 67 years old and my skin looks like I am 45.</li>
    <li> Of the many creams I&#x27;ve tried over the years, this Olay formula is one of my favorites.  The non-oily cream absorbs quickly into the skin, and the skin remains \\&quot;moisterized\\&quot; for many hours.  I have no problem with my skin breaking out, or from getting headaches from the fragrance, which to me appears subtle.  I use this also as a day cream.</li>
    <li> No better and no worse than a standard night cream.  If you need a night cream, I&#x27;d say fine, buy this rather than the expensive Department store brands.  It is a fine cream and does keep you moisturized.  I consider it subpar during the harsh winter months although it is very good during spring/summer. For Winter, I need something with more UMP</li>
    <li> No problem. Came when it was expected and was pleased with the quality and price. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t  the latest  regenerist night cream, but  still  a great  deal at six bucks.  There  is a later version which is available  everywhere.  The seller should  has noted that.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream.</li>
    <li> I gave this review four stars because I do like it but I LOVED the previous, lavender formula.  I wish they&#x27;d bring it back.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels. they don&#x27;t feel heavy or oily at all but keeps my skin well hydrated at night. i have been using this for the past 3 years and i still love it. i recently let my sister in law use it because we were on vacation together. she usually uses more expensive fancy brands of skincare products and she was so surprised that this was olay. she really liked it. couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> I love all Olay products and this night cream is one of the best. You can never go wrong ordering from Olay.</li>
    <li> I like the way this night creme feels. I have had two small whiteheads pop up on either side of my nose in the crease so be careful not to let it settle there. I&#x27;m 55 years old and certainly don&#x27;t like the idea of pimples! Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied with this Olay product and will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> A favorite night cream for years but this new formula is too flowery and is so oily. Please let&#x27;s go back to the old formula!</li>
    <li> it just didn&#x27;t work out.  I hate experimenting with new creams because there&#x27;s always the risk of a bad reaction, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue buying the department store brand that my skin has grown accustomed to.  After wearing it for less than 1 week, my skin broke out.  It was all, &amp;#34;Stop being so cheap!  I want the good, expensive stuff!&amp;#34;  The cystic-ish acne took over a month of ointments, squeezing (I couldn&#x27;t let the stupid thing just hang out), poking with a sterile needle (no fear, I&#x27;m kind of a professional), and steaming to get rid of.  The search continues for an affordable, hydrating, anti-aging night cream, unless my 3.5 year old gets a job to help mama out....</li>
    <li> Great cream, lovely texture, terrible fragrance.  If you read my last Olay post regarding the fragrance, this one has the same smell as the &#x27;new&#x27; Olay Deep Hydration Regenerating.  Not good for those of us with scent-sitivities.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and loved it!  However they recently changed it and I hate it.  I don&#x27;t like the new smell, texture or color!  For the first time in years I am going to buy something different for night!</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! It smells so good and feels soft and velvety on my skin. I have been using this for a while now, and haven&#x27;t had any negative skin reactions...and I have sensitive skin. I wish I had a big tub of it, so I could use it on my entire body!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! Good quality, non-greasy cream. Have bought Olay products since introduced to them by my Mother. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturing Treatment for about six months now, and it makes my skin feel good. I believe its moisturizing ability helps keep my skin toned nicely on my face and neck. I am no spring chicken, but I actually feel that this treatment each night leaves my skin feeling younger. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Olay really has a nice product line.  The scent of some of thier products are a bit strong for my taste but overall I am happy with them.  Olay leaves my skin feeling more smoothe, and helps keep the dryness away. It also helps fade those annoying  little age spots at bay. Two thumbs up Olay! I use Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment regularly.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years...or whenever it came out... It&#x27;s left my skin softer, I sense (at 56) I have pretty darn niceskin, part genes, part a long-time Olay user (I used to be all Elizabeth Arden, but hen financial reality hit).... Olay is as good if not better. I combine this with a day practice of Olay Regnerist Micro-Scuplting Creme ---and really feel the twice a day regimen is smart...and I tell you younger women: begin now. I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin since my early 30&#x27;s and am not at all sorry for it.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I especially love about this night cream is the scent... I won&#x27;t attempt to describe it, but it is for me a very gentle and soothing scent for nighttime care.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s been buying this moisturizer for a while,  so when she ran out, I told her I can buy it for her from amazon (because it was so much cheaper than the drugstores). Any way when she opened it, she told me it had an odd smell, different from the one she bought at the local drugstores. The color was also slightly different. She questioned whether it went bad, did the formula change? So I emailed Amazon, and like always they have awesome customer service. They asked me to provide the lot number and expiration date. , I was able to provide the number but the expiration date was not found on the jar. They told me to discard it and that they would get back to me with either a refund or replacement. I&#x27;m hoping for the latter. My mom loves this moisturizer and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying it in the stores. I&#x27;ll update the rating after I get my replacement.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have been using this for years and loved it.  This new formula feels horrible and is very perfumed.  I&#x27;m debating whether I should ask Amazon if I can return it, or if I should gag my way through it.  Guess I need to find myself a new night cream...</li>
    <li> Left strange irritation on my eye lids. Just not compatible with my skin.</li>
    <li> No longer purple -- now white -- heavy new scent and a slightly &#x27;tackier&#x27; feel. It&#x27;s still very moisturizing -- lasts all night -- but I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as the old formula which was pure and utter perfection. The new scent is almost too much for me and I&#x27;m not picky scent-wise. The old formula was dessert for my skin -- I miss it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about a year now. I go tanning every day and am worried about wrinkles although I am 22 and my face is very dry naturally. This product smells great and is not greasy. My face looks great,moisturized, and healthy. I highly reccomend this product.Thanks OLAY!</li>
    <li> I am facial lotion-phobic.  Through my teens and 20s I wouldn&#x27;t use them because they made my skin feel so heavy and greasy and some even felt as though they were burning. I tried all types of products and all sorts of expensive brands.  Some years back, I switched to Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment (I was previously using \\&quot;matching\\&quot; day and night lotions) because I ran out of my regular night cream and couldn&#x27;t easily get more.  I picked up the Olay off the shelf at the local supermarket and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I LOVE how this cream feels when I put it on. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky, it has a very pleasant, mild fragrance and it has never burned my skin.  I am now 43 years old and have been using this product for about 7 years. I am very skeptical about moisturizing having any visible effect but I have to say that I think this one does.  I was really thrilled to find it in the Subscribe and Save program. When I first started buying it through Amazon, it was probably about $5 cheaper than in my local store.  I don&#x27;t think the price difference is quite as great any more but it is still cheaper.  I must price it at my store and update this review.  I will never switch to another night lotion after using this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I think it works very well, and when I don&#x27;t want to splurge on +$100 creme, this is my go-to product. I&#x27;m in my early thirties and take care of my skin, and this is part of that routine.</li>
    <li> good value.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> this cream leaves your skin very hydrated in the morning&lt;br /&gt;it smells nice, you cannot go wrong with it</li>
    <li> This is a really nice skin cream.  Right now I need something with a bit deeper moisturizer as I live at high altitude, but when I get back to sea level this is my go to night cream.</li>
    <li> This USED to be a great cream, but the manufacturer changed the formulation.  The cream feels less rich and has an annoying smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent, transaction and product</li>
    <li> I also love this for night cream.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy the feeling of this moisturizer on my face.  It is not greasy and is very effective to prevent dryness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a substitute to the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream.  It&#x27;s ok, but I ended up returned to the Micro-Sculpting Cream.  I like the consistency of this cream, but I believed I got better results from the other cream.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so I would recommend trying it, but if you&#x27;re like me and not satisfied with the result, then try the Micro-Sculpting Cream.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but for me, it seems to work better than the Night Recovery Cream.</li>
    <li> I am using it, so far so good!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have been using it with a high frequency device and my face seems to be absorbing every bit of the cream.</li>
    <li> My skin looks fresh and beautiful the next day after the night I use it, I&#x27;m 23 with normal to oily skin and with this product I have to be careful to just use occasionally otherwise I will break out. Otherwise, you will really see a difference!</li>
    <li> I purposely waited several months before posting a review of the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream to ensure I had a decent amount of time to test the product.  Prior to the recovery cream, I was using the Regenerist Serum as my night regime.  After roughly 90 days, it appears that the night cream does a better job at softening my expression lines (forehead) as well as minimizing my crows feet.  Used nightly, it seems to have preventative properties as well.  I still use the serum in the morning, but stick with the night cream before bed.  It&#x27;s thicker and more heavier than the serum, which I don&#x27;t mind - especially if I&#x27;m going to sleep after applying it.</li>
    <li> addicted to this.  love the smell and the way my skin looks and feels with it. i&#x27;ve been using oil of olay morning and night cream forever.  people think i&#x27;m ten years younger. not sure if it&#x27;s just the cream or the fact that i don&#x27;t sun, but it does help smooth out the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream several different times between trying different products and it always wins out. I helps with my turkey neck where all others failed.  I plan to continueusing it from now on.  It works and is so much less expensive than the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I just wish I could find it at Walmart.  I have to order it online.</li>
    <li> Skin feels better after regular use. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> unfortunately this item must have been out of stock as I was sent a different day time moisture.  It is very good but I think the night time one may have been better</li>
    <li> The previous version of this product would have gotten 5 stars from me... the cream was silky and my skin would just drink it up -- I&#x27;d wake in the morning with my skin looking plump, fresh, and hydrated. Used the product for years and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what they did to &#x27;improve&#x27; the formula (or who thought it was a good idea to mess with perfection?) but the new version is pretty awful. As others have said, it feels tacky when I apply it and my face sticks to my pillowcase at night. When I get up in the morning I have dry and flaky patches on my face. I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed with this product now -- have cancelled my subscription and am looking for a decent replacement, if anyone has suggestions. A real shame.</li>
    <li> Why did they change the formula?! It was perfect the way it was. It used to have a nice, calming scent. Now it is a very overpowering floral and it smells awful. It used to feel so smooth and silky when applying, now it&#x27;s thick and sticky. My skin felt clean and refreshed when applying the original. Now it feels even more dry than before I put it on, it burns a little, and it makes my skin feel tight. I am very upset. I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore. I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I have used this product (night only) for months and see big difference on my skin. Overall, I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This cream felt exactly like a primer, loaded with silica and it had a very strong perfume too. It felt sticy and did not get absorbed into my skin at all. I did not see any difference in the morning. I have been using this for 2 weeks. Will definitely go back to the total effects night cream. That one was a keeper.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my face, doesn&#x27;t make me breakout or cause any other bad side effects, and is pleasantly scented (and I&#x27;m sensitive to scents). But my theory on facial creams -- especially \\&quot;recovery\\&quot; products -- is that it takes 10 years to see the effects! I&#x27;ll keep using it because of the way it feels and theoretically it&#x27;s doing something good for my skin, but I don&#x27;t expect to see results anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Big thumbs down.  Go to Ulta they will help ,started using dermalogica ,very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I use it every night.  I am not sure if I am seeing much of a difference.  But I don&#x27;t mind it.  It smells good too.  Don&#x27;t get it on your lips.  It&#x27;s very bitter.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My dermatologist recommended it. I have been using it for 15 years. My skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on my face.  It&#x27;s very smooth and feels good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I feel I am getting the hydration I need during the night. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell it it&#x27;s going to make me look ten years younger!!  But I will keep using it in the hope that it will! After I wrote this review (above) I read the other reviews.  My cream is a lavender color, so apparently I have the previous formula.  Looks as if it has changed and the new product is not as good as the old one.  My product is not like anything the reviewers are complaining about.  So I guess I lucked out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and found it to be as good as products that are much higher in price. I also have very sensitive skin and have had no issues. i recommend this for older women who want nice skin. When I started using this I had several women ask me what makeup I was using - I actually wasn&#x27;t wearing any.</li>
    <li> Olay number one best International wide product</li>
    <li> I experimented with less expensive facial products and my face showed it. Went back to the Olay line of facial products. Was pleased to find that Amazon carries them for slightly less than my drugstore or even Target. Good because Olay is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff. my face is so soft after using. Guys - listen up - there i no shame in using products that help your skin. you don&#x27;t want to look like a worn out football when you&#x27;re older,do you?</li>
    <li> A patch test may not produce an immediate reaction. At first, I was thrilled with how smooth and soft my skin was after I began using this cream and several others in the Regenerist line. I continued using this along with Olay Deep Hydration Cream for daytime for about a month before realizing that it wasn&#x27;t the excessively dry weather we&#x27;ve had this summer but rather that they were what was turning my skin red, rough and pebbly-textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, I went back to my old standby Cetaphil cleanser and moisturizing lotion. Within two days, my skin looked significantly less red with almost all the roughness gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, there&#x27;s something in the Regenerist line that caused my reaction, and I&#x27;ve never before had any sort of reaction to skincare products. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the fragrances or some ingredients, but I&#x27;m not about to try anything else Regenerist after spending as much money as I already have for such unpleasant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Cetaphil which is not only much less expensive but works wonderfully well for me.</li>
    <li> MY MOM REALLY LIKES THIS PRODUCT. SHE USES IT ALL THE TIME</li>
    <li> I used to be pretty.  As my skin has slowly eroded into premature wrinkles (Thanks, sun!), I lost my looks.  For the past month, I have been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream along with the serum during the day and the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night. Now, people are telling me how my skin is absolutely glowing and how pretty I look.  All I wanted to do was get rid of the wrinkles around my mouth, which this product did, but I didn&#x27;t expect to look prettier.  At almost 54 years old, I can&#x27;t tell you what a kick this is!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best (and most affordable) night creams I&#x27;ve ever used by any brand. You can feel the difference right away when you scoop out a bit of this moisturizer - it feels like heavy whipped cream. Soft, satiny, but also light and airy. It makes my face feel nourished and hydrated, but I won&#x27;t give it five stars at this point just because I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels amazing to put on at night though, and I will definitely be restocking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nightly since it first came out and it was the only product I used religiously. This reformulation is awful. It feels cheap and smells horrible. It feels like I am covering my face in a cheap silicone cream.  It no longer penetrates the skin.  It just covers and is horrible to the touch.  I am so disappointed and desperately trying to find another cream now since I won&#x27;t use the reformulation.  Bring back the original formula or you have lost a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Great for winter skin.</li>
    <li> My mother just turned 91 years old and I always give her Olay products and she loves them and she has beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> At almost 50, and with dry skin, I have tried countless moisturizing creams in every price range.&lt;br /&gt;This is the RIGHT one!&lt;br /&gt;It feels wonderful as I smooth it over my freshly washed face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin will feel soft and moist all day, or all night, long - but never oily.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody has mentioned this. The amount of fragrance in this product is overpowering. It&#x27;s a pretty floral scent, but just wayyyy too much of it.  My husband asked me the other night why I put on perfume just to go to bed.   I hesitate before putting it on now, though I think it actually does a nice job on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers, many on the expensive end and this beats them all.  It goes on velvety smooth and you skin looks great in the morning.  I will continue to use this forever.</li>
    <li> Dry and dull skin is one of the most common problems for most women. As one ages, the skin becomes dry and this was the problem which I have been facing for several months now. Everyone had to go through the natural process of aging, but I believed that there were several products on the market which could make me age gracefully and beautifully. It was a good thing that my friend recommended this moisturizer from Olay! I simply love it because it really works! Just like how the product has been described, it really hydrates the skin while you&#x27;re sleeping. After using it for several days, I have noticed the wonderful effect of this product on my skin. Now when I look at the mirror, my skin just seems to glow. Plus, the wrinkles seem to vanish every morning, it tightened my skin just as if I had a mini-lift.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so I am so upset that I can&#x27;t find it on any stores around my area, this moisturizer is so smooth and silky it leaves my skin feeling so soft and in the morning it just so refreshed. I juts love this product</li>
    <li> I started using this moisturizer when I began chemo treatments for cancer in 2010. My skin was suffering from the infusions and steroids and driving me crazy. Honestly, I was trying to avoid it being obvious I had cancer and looking for any way to keep my skin, hair, and nails looking normal. After using the Olay website&#x27;s product recommending tool, I tried the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment. Two and a half years later, I&#x27;m still using it because it&#x27;s the best night moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like is how a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t need to coat my face to achieve great results. I also really love how this doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like a thick ointment. It&#x27;s light and thin, yet still leaves my face feeling and looking fresh. When I want to do an intense treatment (especially after a few Minnesota winter nights in front of the fireplace), I&#x27;ll use a lot more product and cover my face with a warm, damp towel for 30 minutes for a quick facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my face is a little drier than usual and I want to look extra nice for a date night with my husband, I&#x27;ll use this before putting on makeup as a smooth primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly picky about creams and moisturizers (I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium for Lancome&#x27;s eye treatment products) and this Olay night cream has been awesome.</li>
    <li> Update: 3/30/13&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this to anyone with even slightly sensitive skin. I decided to test it out a second time after my first incident, reported below. I put a small amount on my neck and chest for a few hours while cleaning the house in the morning. I showered it off after 3 hours. Later that night I broke out in most itchy, hot rash all over the area the cream had been. I could not sleep and had to hold an ice-pack on the area. I took another shower in the middle of the night, a cold one, but that didn&#x27;t help either. It took 3 full days, showering and gently cleansing my neck each day, in order for the rash to subside! I slept poorly and performed poorly at work as a result. NOT RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review: I really like the daytime serum but I am not sure about this one. I have eczema and rosacea and I have sensitive skin. I was doing very well, using this lightly under my eyes at night for a couple of weeks. One evening I smoothed it on over my whole face, not too much -- I don&#x27;t think I used it incorrectly. I broke out in THE WORST rosacea I have ever had on my cheeks. 5 days later and it is still not even close to gone. I don&#x27;t know for sure if it is this product to blame, but I have not had skin this bad ever. :(</li>
    <li> I started using so is too soon to see result, hope next time I&#x27;ll be ready but feel the face smooth</li>
    <li> I like it, but find I just will not take the time to apply at night.  When I used it I liked it very much.</li>
    <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I swear by this cream! Honestly, I don&#x27;t put it on every night (shame on me!), but my skin really looks great. I use a whole regimen of Olay Regenerist products. Starte with the regular moisturrizer in the white bottle with black cap when I was in early 20&#x27;s and moving up age ladder to keep my skin youthful-looking!</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because I 1)needed a new one and this had great reviews on amazon and 2)I decided to get an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; one because someone guessed my age was 30 and another guessed 27... I am 18! College &#x3D; lack of sleep which equals baggy eyes and fine lines. I am not overly concerned about it since I am young, but I am not going to lie that I became concerned about starting a routine to maintain my young skin. So I decided to buy this and am happy I did! It is a very deep moisturizer, the smell is lovely, but strong! So people who are sensitive to smells or dislike them beware, but it does smell nice. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, this is greasy, so you might need to watch out for that! I am acne prone since I am still in my teens, but I have had no issues with it besides the fact it makes my face oily, which is why I apply it at night.    The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think this is an amazing moisturizer that really goes deep into the skin, but I feel that is all that it is. I do not see ay difference in firmness of my skin, or less fine lines, etc... but then again, I am 18 so it can only do so much to young skin I guess. Overall, I recommend it and will buy this again because of how moisturizing it is.</li>
    <li> I use his morning and night on top of the roc filler, then regenerist, then this. Very velvety and moisturizing as my skin leans on the dry side. will not be without.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It feels so good when applied to my face.  I was also pleased to be able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The strong scent was a turn off as soon as I opened it and I wish I had returned it immediately but I thought that I would give it a chance. After having it for 4 months, I can&#x27;t bring myself to finish the jar. I really like it&#x27;s sister product [[ASIN:B00006JT6O Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]], which is not as thick and is mild in scent. I&#x27;ve purchased MANY Olay products to find the best ones and this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment wins the medal for strongest perfume smell. Since my nose can&#x27;t handle it, I am unable to rate it&#x27;s performance but it is too thick of cream for my normal-to-oily skin. Sorry, Olay, I can&#x27;t rate it high like the rest of your products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of night creams, but have never found one that soaks in as well as this and leaves my skin as soft.</li>
    <li> I love it very much, it is so good and soft to feel my face with this recovery cream used overnight.</li>
    <li> kind of greasy, made my face break out, maybe just me being sensitive to it, but thats my opinion...small jar big price</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for several years and have never been disappointed by any of the products I have used. The Olay Regenerist series of Olay products leaves my skin soft and smooth with no greasy feel. The product is very thick but absorbs quickly. I am using this product during the winter as my skin takes a beating when I am outside and so far I am thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff plumps up skin better then Anything else Iv tried and lasts all day. I use it right b4 I put on my makeup when I get dressed. Not greasy at all. Not only for overnight! You wont be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  I am women of 65 and have dry skin.  This was just like all the rest of the moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I could use vaseline and it would feel the same.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> first off, I don&#x27;t think this product has a scent to it...it&#x27;s very smooth.  I have used it a few nights and when I wake up in the morning, my pores are huge!  I&#x27;m also getting oily the next day, about 1/2 way through the day.  I would be careful if you have anything but normal or dry skin (I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m combination).</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products that do nothing, and wasted so much money.  I love the Regenerist line and will not use any other face product.  (Even spent big bucks trying stuff at Sephora...what a waste!)  I totally recommend Regenerist!!!</li>
    <li> Works ok. Makes my skin feel nice but I really don&#x27;t notice that much difference from any other moisturizer I have tried.</li>
    <li> This product locks moisture in throughout the night as your face is just soaking it up. It&#x27;s not oily. The man of the house loves the smell. I&#x27;ve been using Oil opf Olay products for the last 20+ years and loving them!</li>
    <li> I received the old formula. used it for several years, but expected to receive the new one, especially since it was featured in the pictures and descriptions. I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products, but am not a fan of being duped by Amazon or resellers.</li>
    <li> YUCK!!  This stuff smells.  At first, not in an unpleasant manner.  But then after it&#x27;s been on your face for a while (and I do mean a while, because it also doesn&#x27;t ever sink it.  More about that later.)  it starts to reek.  It&#x27;s just way too heavily perfumed.  As I&#x27;d mentioned earlier, it sits on your face like a thin film and never soaks into your skin.  It really is just a terrible product.  I used the entire container over a month or so to see if I could get past these two faults.  Nothing changed.  No brightened skin.  No improved texture.  Nothing.</li>
    <li> I like this product at night. In the winter my skin gets really dry and this is a good product before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out as so many creams do. It feels good on my face; blends well.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for years.  I love the richness of this night treatment and at this price it is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it is so expensive in the stores. I got an amazing deal on this product.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She loved it.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE FOR THS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Immediately upon opening the container I was concerned about the alarming purple color and strong perfume of the product. My skin is not overly sensitive but this stuff have me itchy red bumps all around my mouth and nose, and I broke out in pimples. The first night I woke up and my skin was soft and moisturized. The second morning I noticed a new pimple and some itchiness around my nose. It only got worse from there.</li>
    <li> Tried so many different night creams. Always go back to this one.&lt;br /&gt; I have very sensitive skin....this is gentle, non greasy,&lt;br /&gt;and does not burn my face as some of the other creams have.</li>
    <li> I love Olay.  This is a wonderful night cream.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for a face cream that will help moisturize and replenish my middle-aged face. I have used Olay products in the past and was intrigued by the &amp;#34;cell rejuvenation&amp;#34; while I sleep -- plus, it got a pretty good rating/review here on amazon. Unfortunately, this product is so heavily perfumed that I got a migraine using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost seems like a floral fragrance and I thought that it would dissipate after a few minutes, but it did not. The fragrance was also noticeable to my husband when I got into bed next to him. I washed it off when I started to feel the headache coming -- about 20 minutes. Maybe some women LIKE having perfumed facial moisturizers? I don&#x27;t understand why these companies think that it is necessary to add perfume/fragrance to skin care products. I don&#x27;t want unnecessary additives. *sigh* I am incredibly frustrated to have spent, or rather, WASTED money on this product. I will not be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to how well this product performs because I didn&#x27;t have it on for more than 20 minutes. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and it does make a difference. I am a user for life now. Nice product, Olay will always be a staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I like the lavender shade, and the moisturizing effect of the cream, but it&#x27;s a bit sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like. Additionally, the scent is much too strong for me. When I&#x27;ve tried to use it as a night cream, the scent literally keeps me awake - it&#x27;s that noticeable. I prefer an unscented cream. Facial creams should not have perfume in them ! Not wanting to waste the product, I used it as a day cream instead since it&#x27;s not too oily for use under my makeup. I finally finished using the jar, but won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Before going to bed, I clean my face and neck with a cleansing pad and then apply this cream.  It is very smooth and applies easily.  It absorbs quickly, so no greasy face and neck.  Nice, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I like the product so far. It does its job.Im still not sure if Ill reorder once I run out, or try a new product.. The shipping was great.</li>
    <li> I have used the old version of this cream for years and absolutely loved it. The \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version is awful! It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make my face feel silky smooth like the old did. It burns when I put it on and I have developed DRY skin from using it. Worst remake of a product since new coke.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ! Works great and I even got a 2 dollar discount because of an Amazon coupon that was applied at checkout. I would recommend this to anyone who wants their skin to look youngest within the first two or three uses.</li>
    <li> I love this cream so much!!!! I am 28 but I already do have so mimic wrinkles around my eyes. This cream worked so good - almost all of them disappeared. And the scent is amazing!!! It smells so expensive - I would purchase a perfume with the same scent!</li>
    <li> I started using this cream and my first reaction was the smell. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep. I started noticing dry itchy patches on my cheeks and forehead. I&#x27;m not sure if this goes away after using it for a while but I&#x27;m not willing to risk it. I really wanted this one to work since the reviews were so amazing. I&#x27;m thinking about giving it away so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the store bought product.  Has a stronger scent also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for several years and love it!  I also like the Regenerist daily lotion.  They both seem to flatten out wrinkles, especially around my mouth and neck.</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks - can&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this product. However, it has some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;- The container isn&#x27;t opaque, which means that the product is exposed to the sun. Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure. So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed. That is not this product.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is very strong, and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume.  I can&#x27;t imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties. But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.&lt;br /&gt;- After applying my hands become sticky. Really sticky. Strange feeling, like they&#x27;re becoming puckered. I immediately have to wash them. I don&#x27;t know what this is attributed to, but it&#x27;s quite unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying again. After doing some comparisons, I prefer the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin so it&#x27;s really challenging to find a great product to moisturize without being to greasy.  I forgot how such a wonder this product works.  I normally use Retina-A for wrinkle prevention, but the erratic Texas winter weather has tortured my skin.  I had to switch to exfoliating every 2 days, use this for 2 days, and Retina-A on the 3rd day.  My skin is better then normal.  I sometimes don&#x27;t wash it off in the a.m. and continue with my daily skin routine and does not add grease to my skin. I love Olay products, especially when I can find the right products for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and a little goes a long way. I have oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Makes my skin feel hydrated and comfortable even though I use a somewhat intensive acne cleanser at night. Will stick with this product as part of my regular skin care regime provided I can afford it.</li>
    <li> Love this product - have used for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream hoping that it would be a good addition to my nightly routine, but it has been just the opposite. Many reviews online said it was great, however those must have been about the older formula. I have acne prone skin and two days after starting to use this I have one of the worst breakouts I have ever had, I never get acne on my forehead but I have about 30 spots right now, and they are so painful. If you have acne prone skin do not use this product!!!! I&#x27;m not sure if its the fragrance, but this has ruined my skin just as I was getting it back to normal. Initially I loved it, it was smooth and silky and really made my skin feel amazing after using my normal acne routine,  but ultimately I will be throwing this away. Its frustrating to not be able to use adult skincare products on adult skin, now I&#x27;ll have to wait 2 weeks for my face to clear up. I think the only people safe to use this product are people who have never had a zit in their entire life, and even then I&#x27;d be weary to recommend it.</li>
    <li> it was okay... no special effects.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> It works just great for me.Woke up refreshed with a nice soft skin.</li>
    <li> Got before I expected. Great</li>
    <li> The cream is wonderful and you can&#x27;t get a better price!  Having it on Subscribe &amp; Save is great because I never run out.  :)</li>
    <li> I love the way this moisturizes my skin, and the fragrance is pleasant.  I thought it was offered at a fair price (Amazon).  Would recommend to anyone with drier skin who wants a good, deep moisturizer overnight.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have always liked Olay products, so i thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for it because it felt very thick and heavy upon application. And i didn&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;notice any improvement in my skin after using it.</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer that never leaves my skin oily, the smell is amazaing.  It worked on develping wrinkles and made my complexion clearer, but after two monthes I&#x27;m not seeing as much difference from the fine lines as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Broke me out had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Olay facial products are good.</li>
    <li> My skin is so smooth and soft. Been using for a week and it works amazing. I like the smell</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and feels great. A little heavy so I usually don&#x27;t use it in the summer but in the winter it&#x27;s a godsend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay good ole fashion original for over 20 years and everyone asks me what my secret is. It really works! Getting older, I wanted to try something deeper during the night. The one thing I love about Oil of Olay is that its not greasy and I was glad that the Regenerist follows suit. Goes on clean, dries quick and has a nice soft smell, not too overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years and really like it. I&#x27;ll probably try other products from Olay but for now I love the combo I have going.</li>
    <li> This cream is great.  I have used it for more than a year and I am very satisfied.  The price through Amazon is the best!!</li>
    <li> This is a great item for anyone who needs a little help with dry middle age skin.  I love it.  It makes my face feel great at night!</li>
    <li> not too thick  or greasy .penetrates into the skin quickly and firms .Does not sting or leave the skin shiny</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again, but I really prefer the Olay moisturizing cream for day and night but it didn&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Regenerist fan for years! I love this lotion--it is is silky, smooth, and smells great! I have noticed that my skin is supple and soft after use. I am 32 with not too many wrinkles but figure it is never to early to start preventative care!</li>
    <li> used many other night recovery product. This is the best by far. It absorbs quickly. Makes my skin shine and younger after one month use</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It&#x27;s light but moisturizing..also not smelly like others.</li>
    <li> What happened to the old formula!!! This new formula is pink and not as smooth as the light purple smooth old formula. Bring back the old formula! Why mess with a perfect thing! :(</li>
    <li> Takes away wrinkles and feels amazing.  My favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell of the product.  The only reason&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;know if it does what it is supposed to do.  I probably&lt;br /&gt;would need to use it every night to be able to see any&lt;br /&gt;difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.I have seen an improvement in my skin after using this product. The price was very reasonable, too!</li>
    <li> I got this one after looking at a few, I bought this one because its by Olay, had some good reviews, and I like it. Its very light and feels moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> The smell is like cupcake to me , it has a light purple tint to it. and the best part of this is waking up in the morning and really it does feel like my face has been renewed overnight. I am 28 years old and i had alot of problems finding a good night cream and I swear by it MONEY WELL SPENT.  I would say anyone who has Dry Acne Prone skin who needs a little night recovery this is your best friend Olay Regenerist.</li>
    <li> This product from Olay is  very good yet very cheap compared to other products.&lt;br /&gt;I use Clinique products in the morning and the Regenerist at night. I am happy with it and I am using it since 2009 and I had no complains. It give my skin the moist that it needs at the same time it is not greecy my skin absorb it very well ( my skin is dry/normal combination)</li>
    <li> This cream feels so good when I apply it. My skin looks and feels much softer and more pliable. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I hate face products with smells, especially night time products. Hard to sleep with such an odor. Not so sure the product does anything either. I&#x27;ll try a different brand, hopefully unscented.</li>
    <li> Everyone reacts differently, but this product irritated by skin and made me break out. Test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly, and it leaves your skin feeling very smooth and very silky.  Can&#x27;t say if it reduces wrinkles, but at 44 I don&#x27;t show my age.</li>
    <li> I had a very bad reaction to this cream. I never considered my skin to be sensitive until after I used this product. I was really excited after reading reviews on night creams. This product seemed to have really good reviews and not bad for the price. After my first application my skin seemed softer and very moisturized. I was really happy. However after the second application the next morning my skin began to look a little red around the cheek bone area. After the third application it was nightmare. My skin was bright red in multiple places and my I had a full acne break out. (normally i get a pimple here and there, nothing major) It was horrible. My face hurt. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my skin still is not back to normal. If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this for preventative maintenance because I do not have any wrinkles yet. This product is awesome! My skin is fairly oily, but this soaks in and leaves my skin feeling soft. It also smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third bottle, and I highly recommend buying this product! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried every product on the market, and always come back to this.  It absorbs well, is unscented, and leaves my skin smooth and moist in the morning.  A solid basic.</li>
    <li> I love the silky feel of this night cream. It has a nice but subtle fragrance. My face feels refreshed in the morning, and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. My skin is quite sensitive, and I have no problems using Olay. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Olay products, including Regenerist lotion with spf 50 for daytime use.  I have never had a bad reaction to any of their products. I \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; on this night cream a month or s ago, but didn&#x27;t start using it until about a week to 10 days ago.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, although it is strong. And I likeod how it felt going on and it seemed to absorb very nicely. But yesterday morning I noticed my skin felt rough and bumpy, although I couldn&#x27;t see any actual bumps when I looked at my skin. And I had a few itchy spots.  But I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it, and also assumed it could be a reaction to antibiotics I am taking for strep. Then this morning my skin felt even rougher, again, no visible bumps.  But SO ITCHY! I ruled out the antibiotics as the itchy bumps are only on my face, not all over if I was getting hives from medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider my skin sensitive, and again, I had been using this product for at least a week, if not longer, before I had any reaction to it. I don&#x27;t know what the ingredient is that is causing this reaction, but it is a shame, as I have 95% of the jar left and can not use it! Plus, now I have to go out and buy a new night cream.</li>
    <li> It works well. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and makes my face feel nice. I live in Fl and need all the moisturizing I can get. Received it fast. Happy with the transaction. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have already been using this product for the past 1.5 years and feel an amazing difference in the skin texture.</li>
    <li> Very good for its price</li>
    <li> great deal, good product A+++++</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot for the price. :)</li>
    <li> skin is  smooth after Use it</li>
    <li> Great night cream!  I have been using this night cream for 2 years now.  My face skin improved after 2 months of use.  My skin looks a lot better now, no more break out.  Perfect for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Works just as well, in my opinion as department store night moisturizing.  I have normal to dry skin and  my skin feels soft after application.  I sometimes put it on during the day when my face feels extra dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an a Olay girl from way back.  My mom used Oil of Olay, and I followed suit.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and most people thing I am in they 35-44 range.  I usually try any new product they have.</li>
    <li> Oh my skin has never felt better. It&#x27;s prone to pimples and other creams tend to make it worse, but this one does nothing but leave it smooth and silky. No overnight breakouts (of course I follow the rule of thoroughly cleansing my skin before applying the cream) and a fresher look in the morning. I don&#x27;t know about Olay day creams and have yet to try them, but this is what I am going to keep using as my night cream for my 29-year-old skin.</li>
    <li> Lightweight,absorbs quickly,not greasy in the morning the skin looks smoother.</li>
    <li> It just feels so great on my skin and truly believe it keeps my skin soft and firm.  I have used this for quite a while.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six months and its terrific.  I use it every evening and there is a noticeable difference every morning, my skin feels tighter somehow.  I definitely intend to continue to purchase the product due to its great value.  I&#x27;ve tried many more expensive department store brands and this night cream is a great product.</li>
    <li> i loved the original purple colored night cream. It was my favorite face cream. However i was not expecting to receive jar of it in 2015. Yes this seller sent me an unboxed jar of the old purple formulation</li>
    <li> MY SKIN FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL...I LOVE THE SOFT CLEAN SMELL AND NON-GREASY FEELING THAT OLAY REGENERIST NIGHT RECOVERY GIVES MY FACE....LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks, and it is really working.  My skin is much smoother, not dry and flaky as it was getting.  I would recommend that anyone buy this product and try it out for themselves.</li>
    <li> Good product but no miracles seen. I trust the Olay products to provide reasonably good results but not significantly better than several competitors in similar price range. I would purchase again but only when available for great price/on sale &amp; less expensive than similar products from ROC, Garnier, L&#x27;Oreal, etc.</li>
    <li> I always buy this online for a lower cost. I always get it on time and exactly what is expected</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;m allergic to most things, but have no adverse reaction to this cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years. It smells good, goes on light, feels clean on my skin, and is not expensive. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s great under my makeup for day time use too, and is not greasy at all. It has the perfect consistency, and a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used this night cream for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products but this one does the trick and smells great.</li>
    <li> I loved the old formula and have used it for years.  With no warning, they sent this new stuff in my Subscribe and Save shipment this month.  Wow, I really tried to keep an open mind, but it isn&#x27;t even close.  The smell is annoying and the formula is nothing like the original.  I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream. I even use it when my legs get dry and itchy in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products over the years that I could start my own cosmetic counter - LOL.  Finally found something that I really like and I find the fragrance very pleasant.  Not only do I use this product at night but I put it on first thing in the morning before applying my makeup.  My skin looks healthy and fresh and there is no greasy feeling or shine that I have to hide with powder.  I am eager to try more of this company&#x27;s products.  Funny thing is that my Mother use to use this product many years ago so why I didn&#x27;t follow her lead I will never know.  She has always had lovely skin - even, now, at 81 years old!!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price for the results you get. I am happy to now be a part of the Olay Skin Care User family.</li>
    <li> I have used this product as a regular item in my skin care regime for years.  It is okay.  No magical changes or improvements, just a solid, reliable moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used.  The whole Regenerist line is really good.  I use many of their products and have used them for years.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and it is the best night cream I have found.  It feels really good on your face and does not cause any break outs or irritation and it definitely smooth wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the daytime and at night as well for years. Worked GREAT.... I usually order 3 jars at a time for convenience , this last batch has a different texture and is white unlike my previous jars. Ii had a terrible breakoutI from using it. I called Olay and they said its their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 jars of their blemish causing product!! I wish I could find their old formula...</li>
    <li> Yes was same as lotion I used to be able to find in store. Very moisturizing with no harsh side affects like itching and stinging for my semi sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market for my crazy , oily, patchy rosachea prone skin \\&quot;AND\\&quot; always come back to this product.  It soothes my skin, calms the redness down &amp; is not greasy.  Great price on amazon without added taxes, markup or shipping.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is finicy and will be dry and unhappy overnight. I used this once and noticed immediate hydration and woke up with soft baby like skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous, I used this every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even light enough I can use it in the morning too if I want. This helps when I travel, because it&#x27;s all I have to take!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone struggling with dry dull skin</li>
    <li> I tried this 2 months ago and had to return it. I did not try the previous formula but the current one was below average to other brands&#x27; face creams that I&#x27;ve tried before. The original pink Olay face lotion worked better than this. I wish I tried the old formula because I heard it was among the best in the market.</li>
    <li> I really am loving the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream.  I have only had it a few days, but I do see and feel the difference in my skin. I am definitely sold on this product. Expect my skin to improve within the next  few weeks. I will purchase this product again; love it!</li>
    <li> I could use this night recovery cream as a day cream as it just seeps into your skin so you feel like you are truly moisturizing.  I do put it in the afternoon after I have come home from work and cleaned my face. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Feels good going on but the smell is over powering.</li>
    <li> Completely unhappy with the new white formula. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and goes on like cheap hand cream from a drug store pump bottle. I used to rely on this stuff day and night in the winter, now I&#x27;ve got to find a new one. Open to suggestions of products similar to the old lavender version!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It simply stuck to my skin like a coat of glue and did not moisturize at all. After several hours I had to wash it off, scrubbing with a rough washcloth. I tried if eventually on my legs and elbows just to use it up, but even then it was like a layer of sticky goo. I bought the Micro-sculpting cream at the same time and it was fine, but stay away from this one in the grey jar.</li>
    <li> the old formula was 100x better than the new ...want to find some of old cream ...do you know where i can get some...so much better than new formula which feels like it is stuck to my face in AM....</li>
    <li> it seems to be ok. I only use it 2-3 times/week as cost saving measure. It goes on fine, no irritations, and seems to be working. I&#x27;ll most probably buy same product when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and always get compliments on my complexion. People often underestimate my age by 10+ years, but I&#x27;m not telling. Love the velvety texture.</li>
    <li> Its ok. I switched to Korean skincare products and now get stuff that is far superior in quality for about the same price.</li>
    <li> Great buy and product.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Night Recovery is a wonderful moisturizer. Using just a little is all that is needed. It is better than any night moisturizer that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years about 5-6 nights a week. My skin feels incredibly hydrated when I wake up in the morning. The night cream is rich but absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel like when I was 20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 2 dozen jars in 5 years, and also gifted another dozen to family and friends. Thick, creamy, and rich without being oily at all, I wear it in the daytime as well for my dry skin. Love this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - 4/21/2014 - I have to agree with everyone else that the new formula is terrible. It&#x27;s not creamy and smooth like the previous one, and looks and feels (and smells!) like something cheap from Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> Great skin cream, but the scent is quite strong. Keeps skin from being dry, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work. It leaves some residue on your skin, so if you don&#x27;t have dry skin, it may not be the best product. The scent is a little strong too. But if you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your skin from drying out - and won&#x27;t irritate - this is a good option. Has helped some of my old acne scars become a little less noticeable as well.</li>
    <li> From the first night I used this cream, my skin felt and looked smoother at night and in the morning when I woke up. Particularly in the morning, I noticed I had more elasticity in my skin. This moisturizer is an essential part of my skin regime - it&#x27;s the best and a great value.</li>
    <li> This night cream works well and not at half the price, but at a fraction of the price of some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> Best night cream ever. I can really tell the difference. I usually  have trouble with things around my eyes, but so far ... so good. I have been using about 3 months and I can see an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin so smooth and soft. Love it. Well worth the price. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> The cream is absorbed well and never makes my skin feel greasy. &amp;#34;Wake up to a mini-lift each morning&amp;#34;? Um, no.</li>
    <li> Been ordering this for years and loved it, but the change in formula is a deal breaker.  It does not soak into the skin at all.  Try and put a light foundation over this and it flakes.  Bye bye.</li>
    <li> I love this nighttime moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve tried others but always come back to this one.  I can moisturize in the evening after washing my face, and it stays moisturized through the night.  Other similar creams don&#x27;t seem to last as long, and some are so thick they&#x27;re harder to apply.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Ladies (and gents!) - it&#x27;s NEVER too early to START MOISTURIZING your face, neck, and décolleté!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this more often for a day cream/lotion than night cream. I&#x27;ve been flexing between several lotions for daily moisturizer and keep having solid results from this one. Not oily or greasy, does not make me break out, feels great while applied to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this if you haven&#x27;t had a chance yet - it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years and loved it.  However, they have recently changed the formula and not for the better.  The new formula does not moisturize as well. I used to wake up in the morning with my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  With the new formula my skin is dried out in the morning which is not helping with my fine lines at all.  The new formula also has a strong perfume odor.  Unfortunately I am going to have to start looking for a new night time product ASAP.</li>
    <li> This cream absorbs well and smells really good. I love having it as part of my nighttime routine. I haven&#x27;t noticed any help with wrinkles or dark spots though, so probably need something more potent for that.</li>
    <li> In my early 50&#x27;s-I&#x27;ve tried them all but this is the one that when I wake up, I see my face is soft, subtle, no pillow case wrinkles and less baggy, crinkled under eyes.  I put it all over, including my entire eye area.  They changed the formula and scent.  I miss the lavender scent it once had but this scent is pleasant enough and not too heavy.  I think its a floral scent but can&#x27;t detect or describe what it smells like now.  I look at it as aromatherapy for getting to sleep.  I know a lot of people that are turned off to scents in general, I thought I&#x27;d mention the scent factor.  As far as how it works in the long term, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.  I&#x27;ve used it for less than a week now.  I tend to break out with a lot of moisturizers but this one,my face likes.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I wear this at night after I cleanse and it feels great in the morining to wake up and not have dry flaky skin, to contend with. I have less wrinkles after only using it a week and no irritiations whatsoever due to the fragrance. Very gentle to the touch and no stinking, which is what I had grown used to with all the countless creams that I have tried over the years. I will use this again and the Murad are a sure hit.</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes my skin look and feel both smooth and soft.  It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, it seems to be working well, I use it every night before going to bed</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described and I would buy from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. It goes on smoothly, especially after using the Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion cream. My skin feels really soft. I have only used it a couple of times since purchasing it, so can&#x27;t say it has really changed my skin, as far as the texture &amp; appearance. I think I will have to use it for 2 or 3 months, before seeing any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Ever notice certain moisturizers, from the low-end to high-end, go on smooth, leave your skin feeling smooth, but have an almost unpleasant smell/scent to them? Thankfully this product doesn&#x27;t have that problem. Goes on smooth (and you only need a very small amount) and leaves your skin feeling smooth, even on waking. Follow up with the daily moisturizer, and it&#x27;s a good combination for your skin. I don&#x27;t have problems with blemishes or acne, etc., but my skin leans toward dry, particularly in the winter months (as it does for many/most(?) women if they live in homes with central heating/AC--any moisture in the air is sucked right out by all that dry heat). It&#x27;s true that a good portion of the cost of these types of products is in the packaging, but the Olay Regenerist line is worth the price, IMO. The only other line, similar price range, that I find that works equally as well is that made by AVON. As for application, you only need a small dollop to smooth over your face and neck; any more is really overkill and won&#x27;t make your skin any softer or firmer--you&#x27;ll just go through the jar more quickly. If used as directed, one jar of this should last you about 3 months (at least that&#x27;s been my experience; I live in the mid-Atlantic region, so we have very humid, hot summers; the remaining seasons depends on Mother Nature&#x27;s mood!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The BEST night cream on the market in it&#x27;s price range.</li>
    <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the Olay recovery moisturizing treatment.  In the past,I have purchased and used items that cost twice as much, but did not give me the results they promised.  This product does give results.  I can see a difference in the softness of my skin, and the dark spots from sun damage have faded significantly.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of all the regerist products. This smells divine! I just feel that this lotion is so dreamy that it helps me sleep at night and I get up with smooth skin!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It makes my face feel like butter, super soft.  I use it every night and miss it when it&#x27;s gone.  I try everything and have not found something I like better.</li>
    <li> Its a good night cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years and loved the way it made my skin feel and look. It also had a pleasant scent and texture. Recently it has been &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34;. I am not happy with it at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant, it stings when I apply it and it leaves my skin looking splotchy. Will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the old formula, can&#x27;t stand the smell nor the feel of this new formula.  I will be looking for a new night cream.  Wish they could have left well enough alone.&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT**  Within 20 minutes, my face was red and burning, I had to wash it off.  There is certainly something in this new formula that my skin does not tolerate.  It is such a bummer when you are completely happy with a product and they have to go and \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it and now cant stand it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Night Creams.  I love all Olay product and have yet to try one I didn&#x27;t like.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this as part of my subscription orders - - it&#x27;s something I want to keep on hand as a regular part of my nightly regimen.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are disappointed that the formula for this has changed. We both liked the scent it used to have and the purple color. Why did it change? Its expensive but worth it, but I preferred the old formula.</li>
    <li> The old formula is 5 stars, this is so disappointing.  If it is not broken don&#x27;t fix it!!  I would guess that Oil of Olay will lose many faithful customers over this including me.  I have used it faithfully for years.  The new formula doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or level of moisture.  About five minutes after I put it on I feel like I have to reapply again.  Now begins the unhappy search for something new.</li>
    <li> It is creamy, has substance and it really does smooth the wrinkles.  It makes my face look refreshed in the morning.</li>
    <li> I agree that the new formula is terrible.  It makes me break out and I do not like the new smell. GROSS.  Why did Olay have to go and ruin a great product?  With the previous lotion my skin looked amazing and people tell me so.  Now I am constantly worried about breakouts.  I am VERY upset and I am not sure what I will do....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and could not be happier with it.  I am 46 years old and have the usual age related skin issues.  This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling and looking both firmer and smoother and has a pleasant smell.  I will definitely be purchasing this again and again.</li>
    <li> Honestly not impressed. This drab, purple cream (why do they do that? Do they think I&#x27;ll be fooled into thinking there is some secret purple ingredient with a special property? Olay- FYI: It really doesn&#x27;t appeal to me to put purple dye on my skin) did nothing for my dry, sensitive skin. Stays dry on the face, but doesn&#x27;t really moisturize. I prefer a nice, rich, color-free (!), moisturizing formula.</li>
    <li> I have been an Olay girl for 40 years.  Love most of their products.  This has pleasant color (lavendar ?) and goes on smoothly.  Not sure I&#x27;ve seen much improvement over other Olay cremes.  I still like the original Olay moisturized with SPF.</li>
    <li> I GET VERY DRY SKIN IN WINTER. THIS MOISTURIZING CREAM WORKS WONDERS. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.AND AGAIN.BB,MICHIGAN</li>
    <li> Considering my boyfriend believed I was 10 years younger, I now own stock in oil of Olay. lol Amazing line of products.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awesome! It makes my skin extremely soft and I swear it looks fresher and younger looking when I wake up in the morning. It smells great and Oil of Olay makes amazing products at affordable prices. Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> I love applying it on my face after each wash. It smells very good and my face has gotten so smooth. Will definitely get more once I ran out of this jar</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. Nice but not overpowering smell. Doesn&#x27;t break out my face. Goes on smoothly and soaks in very well without residue. When I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period of time, i will return to adjust my review accordingly.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before bed for several months and I definitely see that my skin looks more soft and supple, with fine lines and wrinkles that have almost disappeared. I saw on Dr. Oz the powerful anti aging properties of phytoceramides, CoQ10 and Reservatrol, and I tried both Renuvaderm and PhytoDerm [[ASIN:B00JK5ZN76 Renuvaderm - The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement!]] and [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDerm - The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides!]] and found that each of these were like a facelift in a bottle, with the Renuvaderm working better for me. Combine the Olay night cream with Renuvaderm for amazing results.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for years.  I really can&#x27;t remember how long, but I believe I started using it shortly after it was released.  I needed some new cream so went to the store and bought a new jar.  Much to my horror, Olay changed this cream&#x27;s formula.  It used to be a very light, easily absorbed cream that made my skin feel instantly soft.  I used it under makeup because it did not affect my foundation&#x27;s look.  Now, the cream is thick, just lays on top of the skin, does not absorb and makes my face look greasy.  Even though I am not scent sensitive, the perfume they put in the new formula made my eyes water.  I am so sorry that they took a great product, &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it and now it is just like some cheap, oily, cream.</li>
    <li> Hate the new formula. It&#x27;s white (compared to prior formula, light purple). It feels heavier, and more greasy. I loved the old formula and gave this new one a chance, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized in the morning.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in December and loved its wonderful fragrance and silky feel.  I ordered it again a few days ago, and got the same bland, white, ordinary cream that everyone else sells -- for twice the price.  Look at the last few reviews, OLAY!  I&#x27;m not ordering it again until I read that it has been changed back.  Companies should not be allowed to sell a completely different product under an existing name.  Call it bait and switch or simple fraud, that&#x27;s what it amounts to.  If this is their policy, I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying any more Olay products unless I can open the container and check it out first.</li>
    <li> Not the same formula as it used to be and not the same scent.  It leaves a residue.  Bring back the old formula, please!</li>
    <li> Not greasy and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It feels greasy at night when I put it on, but it makes my face feel super soft in the morning! The main thing I don&#x27;t like is that the product gets in my eyes and it stings. I don&#x27;t use it on my eyes, but I guess it runs down from my forehead or something. Overall, I would re-order the product. I bought it because Web MD recommends it and I like how it makes my face feel in the morning.</li>
    <li> I did &#x27;t have a reaction to this cream which is unusual.  My skin felt smooth and protected.  Not a bad price, either.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received my last delivery of this lotion, which I had on subscription.  The formulation has changed, and it simply is not as good as it used to be.  I&#x27;m canceling my subscription and shopping around.  Now this is a just a regular ol&#x27; smelly lotion.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Feels good on skin, not oily at all.  Have been using it for years now and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It did not moisturize like I thought a night cream would. It says intense moisturizer, but my face still felt dry and started to break out. The scent is a little much too. It is okay with a serum underneath, but given the choice, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for middle-aged skin. Is reasonably priced and feels great going on. Skin is looking better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I prefer a moisturized with no perfume smell, but it&#x27;s pretty mild.</li>
    <li> Love this nighttime moisturizer. So much so, that I often use it during the day too. It smells so nice (my husband even complimented it), and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and hydrated. I have a much more expensive \\&quot;have-to-have\\&quot; moisturizer for daytime, and I feel dry a few minutes after I&#x27;ve applied it. This cream soaks nicely into your skin... it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry and tight, or sticky and messy. I get compliments on how young I look, so I think it improves the way my skin looks. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It hydrates my skin really well. I love it. I have been using it day and night. It is better than the expensive cream.</li>
    <li> Good price point, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing what I need for my skin. It&#x27;s quite moisturizing, pleasurable to apply, and has a nice if strong scent. My skin seems to be benefiting texturally. It looks a little more lush and velvety. I, however, need more help over all with my skin tone, redness in my cheeks and some sun and old acne spots. This product makes my skin look nice, but I am not at all amazed. The Olay Definity night creme gave better results with regards to my needs and it is only a few dollars more. I will probably always use some Olay products, but this one I think is not for me.</li>
    <li> has reqally helped my skin.  Have used Oil of Olay since I was 16</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She didn&#x27;t toss it so I guess she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Product came in a timely manor concidering it was Christmas.</li>
    <li> Purchased in January 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; product I received was overly fragrant, and not in a good way, and left a weird film on top of my skin.  I could not put on my mineral makeup without scrubbing my face clean with a towel.  I tried using this for a week and it did not get any better.</li>
    <li> It has been a week  since I have been using this product.So far the skin in the my T zone is soft and supple and does not have an ashy appearance. My pore size has decreased and I am looking radiant. I am even being asked if I am pregnant.Excellent product which does what it says. better than some expensive products that I have tried</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. I have a combination of dry, flaky skin and oily skin. This stuff works great. It softens my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. My skin is really soft and even now.</li>
    <li> I can have really dry skin when the weather changes, to the point where I had a couple red flaking patches. After a few days of this the redness and flaking were gone, and my skin was back to its normal beautiful self. This does take a little while to absorb completely, and until it does it almost feels greasy. I would advise putting in on after your in your pjs, so you don&#x27;t waste it on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I really like being able to purchase these products online rather than searching one of the local stores.  Can highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells and seems to be keeping my face moist,if there was a miracle product out there I am sure we all would be using it but in the mean time we do what we can.</li>
    <li> When I use this product I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling super-soft and moisturized, almost as moist as when I go to bed.  Not sure how Olay does that, but read it releases hydration over the hours.  It&#x27;s a non-greasy creamy texture with a light, fresh smell.  I love to use it at night and treat my skin to some refreshment while I sleep.  It&#x27;s like a nightly beauty treatment.</li>
    <li> I have this night cream on a subscription so it come automatically every month, and I love the cream.  It helps repair the damage that the day has done on my skin.  I work outside all day long, so I make sure to use this every night.  Fast shipping and notifications when your item is going to be shipping out, and I can cancel at anytime.  I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This cream does feel nice on your skin, but I am unable to get over the horrible overwhelming perfume smell. It is so strong, you can smell it HOURS after you put it on. It smells like rotting flowers, or overpowering grandma perfume. I cannot imagine why they would make something smell so horrible and so strongly. That cannot be good for your skin either. Yuck. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well to moisturize at night. Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. Its really silky-smooth.  Going to get more of this.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment is a very good product. One of the better facial cream treatments on the market at a reasonable price. I have been purchasing this product for years on Amazon with a 15% discount on a Buy and Save Subscription. Over time, I have noticed increases in my putchase price. My last purchase was $5 above the Amazon purchase now price. Amazon repeatedly referred me to their pricing policy in their terms and conditions and refunded me $2. Needless to say, I have unsubsribed to 5 products I was purchasing from Amazon with their 15% Buy and Save Subscriptions where price increases annoyed me. Most of these products currently have only a 5% Buy and Save Subscription now. Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> The product is good, average cream.  I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Prefer Olay&#x27;s Night of Olay Firming Cream.  Like the feel of it better, and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve been using this just under a month and my face is pretty again!&lt;br /&gt;I am 56 with delicate fair skin.  Had a red nose and chin, some nasty clogged pores on my cheeks, and general saggy-ness.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have gone to great  lengths and paid too much for big name products that did nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Retin-A, (ouch!) peels, (ouch! ) department store brands with fancy french names ( $$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Olay Regenerist is the only product that has made a change.  I was nervous about the slight tint and fragrance, but they don&#x27;t bother my skin a bit.  It plumps everything up as soon as I put it on, and in the morning, Oh Mama…I look GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I also use the Cream cleanser, Skin Tightening serum, and Deep Hydration moisturizer ( as a day cream).&lt;br /&gt; The redness is GONE…I&#x27;ve had it my whole life and it&#x27;s GONE.  No more cloggy pores. My jawline and eyelids are back.</li>
    <li> Love purchasing Olay products on Amazon.  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a very thick and moisturizing cream. After the first night I woke up with skin feeling hydrated. Skip forward 8 days of nightly use: terrible breakout. No other new products.</li>
    <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
    <li> younger looking skin. I use olay regenerist serum first then after a few minutes I apply night recovery cream.</li>
    <li> You only need to use a little, not a lot. It&#x27;s an all right product, but none seem to do as they claim. I use it nightly and cannot really see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you Olay love it and good  result my face every time i woke up in the morning,I will buy soon also for day cream ,once again than you amazon</li>
    <li> great product.  I am 74 yrs old and it really helps with wrinkles</li>
    <li> Great stuff and not $$$$$  use other Olay product in the am with this and saw great results in 1 week.  Did better than the super pricey stuff I got at the medi spa.</li>
    <li> Deep moisturizing, lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. ItS very rich and keeps my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
    <li> The new formula is terrible. The smell is offensive, it doesn&#x27;t soak in and my skin is dry and tight in the morning. I NEVER had that issue with the old formula. It was amazing; why change it? You let me down, Olay. I&#x27;m now on the search for a new night cream and it won&#x27;t be anything from your line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I notice that my face is softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvements in the texture of my skin. We will see! I love the smell!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing and light...it just feels wonderful applying this cream on a clean face before sleep....it smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> I just joined the Amazon Prime , and this is my first month after the trial run of 30 days...I love the fact you can add 4 people to your Prime Account , with no hassle what so ever...This item was purchased with a few others for the subscribe and save option for my Mom...She gave me the list of items and I did the rest..So simple, so easy..You can adjust delivery dates, if you want it sooner or not for several months..I have always taken care of skin , even in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s ..I tended to use products that had a lot of hype { and expense } but no real evidence of improvement for the cost to that claim...Well , I like the Olay line , and might start to use it again myself..~!~</li>
    <li> good and smooth not heavy</li>
    <li> This moisturizer from Olay really absorbs well into my skin and when I wake up in the morning. My face feels softer and smoother and it&#x27;s not greasy!</li>
    <li> I like this one for night time - it is gentle - vertict still out as if it works :)</li>
    <li> I like any product with oil of Olay,it will always be on my recommend list for the young and for like a very very senior like me.</li>
    <li> I always use this at night time to keep my face moistured.  I use it with the Olay daytime products.  They work great together.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 or 6 years. It was lavender in color with a very faint fragrance. Now its a new formula in white with no fragrance. And it&#x27;s different. It doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin like the old one, just sits on top. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Very disturbed - I just bought 6 jars. Cream Color is not the usual purple it us white. The scent is different and there is a slight oily residue. - not the usual nice absorption. Is this even the true product?????</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from cheaper products full of parabens, my skin care has been combination of Clinique/Caudalie the last year. I also switched the past couple weeks also the asian Skin79&#x27;s gold bb cream during the day (love!). I used this Oil of Olay night cream for the first time last night, so here we go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like you sprayed yourself with an old nasty perfume, YUCK!.... I hope I don&#x27;t break out from the fragrance. I noticed two small red pimply bumps by my nose this morning (never get those there), so I know that was a small reaction, but my face skin looks beautiful otherwise this morning! Evened out my ruddy complection, mini lift indeed. But I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the two pimples that appeared and the awful stench of it. I hope that they will listen to reviewers and make one that is naturally scented or fragrance free!!!! I&#x27;m thankful that my face isn&#x27;t red or irritated looking so that is also a HUGE plus. Hoping my skin won&#x27;t break out more than it has and get used to this new night cream. It does seem a little on the dry side for my skin, but it is winter and my skin has been in need of something different which is why I purchased this at Walmart. My face doesn&#x27;t appear as dry however, but feels a little tighter and dry to the touch. Tighter is good, my face needs a little lifting. I tend to switch products a lot because my skin gets iritated by them overtime, and yes from experience, I agree that price doesn&#x27;t mean a product is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 34 years old (most people don&#x27;t believe me and think I&#x27;m 25), I have fair and very dry, sensitive skin with ruddy undertones. NOTE - For my skintype, if I could choose and money wasn&#x27;t an option, I&#x27;d buy Vinoperfect Cell Renewal Night Cream. I just can&#x27;t afford to spend $72 for both Caudalie&#x27;s day and night creams on my budget right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: BROKE OUT BADLY, Red pimply bumps all over my face and face turning red. Changed my title and stars on this review from 4 to2. Returned it to Walmart and bought Roc Anti-Stress Night Cream to try instead. No reaction this morning, face looks great.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month due to dry skin caused by the winter here in the northeast. It certainly helps moisturize, but I never really got used to the scent and texture. I think, as with so many such things, that this is a matter of personal preference, so you might love (or hate) it. I bought it, I used it for weeks, I didn&#x27;t dislike it... but I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, either. For me, that&#x27;s a three-star product.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my face feel good&lt;br /&gt;And I look refreshed upon waking in the morning!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any results.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products. Feels good on the skin, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky. Should work excellent with other Olay products.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream. I like the texture, it absorbs well and I think my skin is better for its use.</li>
    <li> I love how my face feels and looks when I wake up in the morning.  Feels so soft and moist.  Great smell also</li>
    <li> love the product , makes you skin feel so silky smooth, a little expensive but it is a great product</li>
    <li> I think you will like this product just for the way it makes your skin feel - let alone how it makes your skin look! Yes, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll see how it goes - I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks but Olay has always been a quality product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference but I love how it makes my skin soft</li>
    <li> So much less expensive here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is smooth and feels amazing.  I use it every night and wash with the Olay cleansing cloths in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and will continue to order from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent, as well!</li>
    <li> Have written several reviews for Olay products. Have used since early 20s and find them very good. Was recently taken for 16 years younger than I am by someone who I know fairly well who just assumed I was their age. A wonderful endorsement since I wear no makeup and am 67 years old.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my wife but then she told me to use it to. With in a month my wife&#x27;s skin is slinky smooth and now is mine to! If you use it every night before bed it will work over time. 100% recommend if you want smooth soft skin!</li>
    <li> Love it. This lotion applies on smoothly... absorbs quickly.. and makes my skin soft! Smells nice too, not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO AND LOVE IT AND RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT RESERVATION.&lt;br /&gt;THE OLAY REGENERIST LINE HAS BECOME A BIT PRICEYBUT NOT THIS MOISTURIZER.</li>
    <li> The cream seems to work well, but I will never buy it again because the smell is so strong. It smells like old lady perfume. I don&#x27;t even want to breathe in through my nose for the first 20 minutes after application. Why does face cream need fragrance anyway?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the texture. It doesn&#x27;t make your face look soggy after application like other brands do. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it has helped or hindered my skin. I have oily skin and it seems like my nose has been more oily since I used this, but I also changed my daytime moisturizer and I think that might be to blame as well. It smells great and I think nighttime care is important. I have purchased my old day cream and will see if that helps the oily nose.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and love this product! Perfect amount of moisture not greasy. Love Love Love it!!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so very soft and moist.  Helps with wrinkles and laugh lines.  Great product.  Will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> The only night cream I have used nice it became available. I have used speciality lines two to three times the cost if this night cream. Olay delivers! The Regenerist line is great. Controls sun spots from damage one 40 years ago when I was lying out in the sun with baby oil and iodine. My skin looks great and despite my gray hair folks never guess my age. Have used Olay for 20 years, wonderful line of skin care products.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer. When I use it everything is great. My skin feels great, and the moisturizer itself smells pretty good (maybe a bit too potent). However, after about a week of using it my skin completely broke out. So I stopped using it for a while, hoping it was just a one time thing. Tried it again a few nights ago with hardly any moisturizer at all, and my face broke out even quicker than before.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and good price.</li>
    <li> Gave me pimples. I have normal skin with slightly oily t-zone. I&#x27;ll use the rest on my chest and neck. I don&#x27;t care for the smell. Too strong for bedtime (or daytime).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Smells like the &amp;#34;American beauty&amp;#34; discontinued perfume, and is a great night time facial Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Over a week or so this will tighten the crows feet up a bit. I now use the gold colored jar of the same stuff. Also gives your skin a healthy look the next day.</li>
    <li> I started out fine with this night cream and then after a week it burn only on my cheeks.  I have very dry skin cause of thyroid issues so it could be that is just to harsh..BUT smells great and the product came right on time.</li>
    <li> Original formula healed dry skin overnight. New formula does nothing - except give me blackheads. I gave the new product a month. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Night Treatment is the perfect moisturizer for my very dry, sensitive skin type. It always leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> OK...I have trouble remembering to use it!</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this over the past few months my skin looks so much better and youthful</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this night cream. It&#x27;s a part of my skin care routine as prevention for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and glides on very smoothly. I always wake up with smooth and hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my face feel smooth and smell amazing. I get constant compliments from my boyfriend when he kisses me. I dont know if its due to this product, but my blemishes seem to be getting better and I look better without makeup.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses this!  He really likes it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because of the Olay rebate. I should have known better, as I&#x27;ve had problems with allergic reactions to their products before, but thought maybe they have gotten savvy to the fact that you don&#x27;t need STINKY perfumes and DYES in a face cream! The first night I tried it the smell kept me awake. Not only that, my skin actually felt drier! The next morning I woke up my cheeks and nose were swollen! OK, I waited another week and tried it again. Same thing. Swollen face, no thanks!</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle, anti-aging cream, but it is a good moisturizer with a nice, clean, pleasing,light scent.  I&#x27;ve used it for some time and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream used to be a wonderful product.  It went on smoothly, was not too heavy, and provided great hydration and wrinkle smoothing for my fifty-something skin.  The fragrance was pleasant and not overpowering.  The new formula is heavy, not well-absorbed, and has a strong fragrance that burns my eyes and nose.  Also, the high concentration of dimethicone can cause milia in susceptible individuals.  (I noticed some within 24 hours of using it).  I&#x27;m very disappointed that Olay has ruined a great product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one of the Olay night treatments.  I used a different one and couldn&#x27;t find it, so I am trying this one.  I have had good results in the past with Olay night treatments, so I giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Love this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream !! I use it every night and it always give my skin some glowing in the morning even I did not sleep much and it truly really helps your skin to recover over night. I have used this product for 4 years.</li>
    <li> hidration with non greasy feeling . Just what I asked. However, if you want something more deep wrinkle-targeted, should try something else.</li>
    <li> good! It has arrived accoring plans and the discription on the site! I did not face any problems with this</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with this night cream. It moisturizers and keeps my skin soft, but that&#x27;s all. I was hoping for something a little more radiant or more. This is by no means a &amp;#34;night recovery&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I wanted so badly to love this product.  I&#x27;m starting to notice some lines on my forehead and on my scowl (lol) line and had high hopes for this cream.  It is very moisturizing, but I can not get over the smell!  It does make your face feel soft the next morning, but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to notice any changes to my fine lines.  I would only purchase again if Olay came out with an unscented version.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product...not greasy, absorbs well and it moistuizes.  I am retired and can not pay $100 for a night -time moisturizer, this works for me.</li>
    <li> It is an intensive night moisturizer so perhaps that&#x27;s why it feels a little heavy for a moisturizer.  Does keep my skin feeling elastic during the harsh Northeast winters though.</li>
    <li> I only have myself to blame for buying this product. I tried a small amount on my neck the first night to see if I would have any reaction. I woke up the next morning and my neck looked fine. That night I used a small amount on my face. I woke up the next morning with huge, raised red welts on my cheeks and forehead. I immediately washed my face and did not use any products at all, including facial wash, foundation and daily moisturizer, for two days. The welts disappeared within 48 hours. I have used Kinerase and Avon Anew products for many years with no problems. This product was just too harsh for my skin. I learned a valuable lesson and have returned to my old products and will stick with them.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!! makes your skin feel like silk!! if you are acne prone, this may not be right for you. i have sensitive skin and broke out a bit but was not too bothersome. nice light scent..</li>
    <li> To much perfume smell, please go back to the old way!</li>
    <li> Best. Night cream. Ever.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have even mildly sensitive skin. I only used this cream for 2 nights and broke out both times.  It took about a week before it to cleared up.</li>
    <li> The old adage &amp;#34;if it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; was obviously ignored by Olay. The new formula is absolute garbage. It pills when rubbing on your face no matter the amount used. The smell is much too strong, especially being applied before going to bed. I want the purple lotion that made my skin feel like silk and didn&#x27;t burn my nostrils!</li>
