      <li>I highly recommend Focus 21 Sea Plasma Skin and Hair Moisturizing Spray--and when I buy it through Amazon it is so affordable.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair like typical conditioners and it smells great.</li>
      <li>I purchased a small spray bottle that sprays a more gentle mist</li>
      <li>Keep a spray bottle available all year round...</li>
      <li>and I think it helps it stay soft.</li>
      <li>Not only is this a really great product to spray after the shower, but it works great on dry hair and doesn&#x27;t lleave and gross residue making your hair look bogged down and dirty.</li>

    <li> Greatest stuff in the world for hard water &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34;. A couple of spritzes after washing makes hard fleecy beach hair look and act like it only gets washed with soft mountain water. Don&#x27;t use too much - it&#x27;ll flatten your hair. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a zillion years.  Hard to find it in the stores.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m back on Newport Beach in 1980 with friends...watching the hot dudes surf the Wedge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah...and it makes my very long hair very easy to comb!  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for skin and hair.  I like to use it on my skin after being out in the sun or on the beach.  I use it on my long hair after I shower.  Great product</li>
    <li> I love Focus 21 Sea Plasma Skin and Moisturizing Spray!  I use it everyday on my face and hair.  I find it refreshing after a long hot day in the sun.  It&#x27;s also great to ward off dry skin during the winter months.  I highly recommend Focus 21 Sea Plasma Skin and Hair Moisturizing Spray--and when I buy it through Amazon it is so affordable.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for over 20 yrs for sunburn relief. It&#x27;s been my little secret for getting relief from a sunburn pain &amp; getting it to heal without pealing. So sad to see the price so unreasonable. I will have to find another remedy.</li>
    <li> I use to use this a while back. I missed it and forgot how much I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Addicted</li>
    <li> How did I not know about this product until now?  I LOVE it.  Not only does it make my skin feel lovely, but it perks up my naturally curly hair quite nicely.  To me, it smells like Coppertone sunscreen ~ some people may be put off by this, but I consider it to be plus.  Other things I like about this:  it&#x27;s affordable, easy to buy (thanks, Amazon!), made in the U.S. of A. and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I finally know about this gem, I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I used to buy it from my hairdresser. It conditions my hair and helps with static, fly away hair. Does not make my hair stiff. Not much perfume smell which I can&#x27;t stand. Biggest thing is it reminds me a product my Mom bought and used on me as a child. I have longer hair and when sprayed on it helps get the tangles out easily.</li>
    <li> The seller is great. I have no complaints there. I got my product on time, a promised. My complaint, is the smell of this product reminds me of my Grandma and I just couldn&#x27;t get past that. Other wise, it felt very refreshing, if not a little sticky. If you&#x27;re ok with that old fashion rose smell, then go for it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my show Persian and we are now all using this amazing product in my home.  Love what it does to our hair.  Smell is perfect....so faint, but nice.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product for the specific purpose of being able to moisturize my back without the hassle of applying a moisturizing lotion or cream by hand.  It does enable me to do this, but I am not enamored of the product&#x27;s scent and I would prefer a smaller dispenser.  Having said this, I do think the product is effective and value priced. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> My family loves this product, which refreshes and revitalizes the hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to \\&quot;set\\&quot; my makeup,spray it on my face after makeup is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to see the product on Amazon as many drug stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair for years and still love it!  I have long curly hair, that tends to be a little on the dry side.

It&#x27;s gotten a little harder to find in stores over the years, but I&#x27;m happy to know I can still order it through Amazon.  Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> Been the greatest stuff for years</li>
    <li> Stumbled upon this again while shopping. Had not been available for so long. Fan for over 20 years. Fresh, moisturizing, cool with great fragrance -great for skin and hair - totatly addictive!</li>
    <li> I would but this reliigiously at my local store untill they stopped carrying it. Found this bargain which comes with 2 bottles. Not only is this a really great product to spray after the shower, but it works great on dry hair and doesn&#x27;t lleave and gross residue making your hair look bogged down and dirty. This also can be used on your skin as a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> luv it been using for years</li>
    <li> Love it so much I even use it on the dog.</li>
    <li> Been using Sea Plasma as a spray in / leave in conditioner / detangler for years. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair like typical conditioners and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and feels on my skin. It does really help my skin absorb my face lotion much better. I also spray this on my hair and I think it helps it stay soft. The bottle doesn&#x27;t spray that well, it sprays out big globs of liquid along with a mist. I purchased a small spray bottle that sprays a more gentle mist and I use it in that. I haven&#x27;t tried this on my body yet but it smells so good and it&#x27;s refreshing I think it would be a great face and body pick-me-up in the warm months.</li>
    <li> Back in the late 80s/early 90s, I discovered this stuff at a local hair salon in Marina, CA. I always kept some on hand to spritz my face morning and night, when it was hot, and to add a hint of conditioning/smellgoodyumminess to my hair. Then I moved away and was never able to find it. Thank goodness for Amazon! I found it again and all is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great at keeping my skin moisturized day and night and smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a lovely cool mist and can be used even if you have makeup on. It doesn&#x27;t muss it up at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> used this for years. makes hair very soft and a good anti-static spray. feels great after being out in sun all day on face and hair</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product...  Cool, refreshing and a great way to keep moisturized...  Keep a spray bottle available all year round...</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my hair, but it made the gray parts of my hair turn yellow-ish, so now I just use it on my skin.  The fragrance is really nice and it feels good on my skin.</li>
