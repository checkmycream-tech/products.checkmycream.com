      <li>I love it, it works great.  </li>

      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use these once or twice a year, and then sometimes in between those times I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;five minute&amp;#34; kind just to freshen/brighten the look of my teeth</li>

      <li>Thank you so much for your excellent service.</li>
      <li>I also tried some other product where you put the gel on the teeth and then a formed teeth guard, that wasn&#x27;t very good, the strips are the best way to go.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen drastic improvement in my smile and am really happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t get professional whitening done, but these do the job perfectly!</li>
      <li>I suck in my lips after applying to get a good fit over each tooth.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the 12 day strips which were very cheap at the time</li>
      <li>These strips give good and quick results.</li>
      <li>I love the crest whitening strips within one week of using the product</li>
      <li>What I do know for sure is that they are flimsy and slide all over.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used much better before.</li>
      <li>I use this once a week to keep my teeth white and it works great!</li>

      <li>I took before and afters (you should be able to see the picture in the gallery.</li>
      <li>They whitened most of my teeth, the areas that had contact with strips the most.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the fancier versions as these.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>All ok.</li>
      <li>They allow you to drink and talk more effortlessly.</li>
      <li>I am a coffee and tea drinker and have been abstaining from two of my favorite beverages to hold the affect&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the way your teeth feel when you wipe off the cleaner</li>
      <li>I used one top and bottom...</li>
      <li>and I was able to talk, drink, even eat</li>
      <li>I wanted better results then</li>
      <li>Better to spend a bit more money and get something that works.</li>
      <li>The strips did not stay in place on my teeth for more than 10-15 min.  </li>
      <li>I bought ones from the store that seemed to stay on better than this type.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well as a post-dinner responsibility; brightens teeth over the course of merely two weeks.  Results appear after third use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest white strips before, so I know the drill.  They stay on fine as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to talk, so I&#x27;d put them on, and settle down with a book for half an hour.  I gave them 4 stars because while they brightened at a 5 star level, they caused massive sensitivity, like so bad that drawing a breath makes my front teeth hurt.  I don&#x27;t remember that from the standard kit, but then I don&#x27;t remember being impressed with the lack of results from the standard kit either, so maybe temporary pain is the price for this products functionality.</li>
    <li> Worked very well and met my exception</li>
    <li> The classic whitestrips don&#x27;t whiten as fast but they are more gentle and don&#x27;t cause sensitivity.  Additonally, the classic strips are more pliable so I find they fit the grooves of my teeth better.  Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These strips are pretty decent, and you can definitely notice results if used as instructed. But beware: these will make your teeth sensitive to temperatures that aren&#x27;t in the tepid range. Both hot and iced coffee, and anything else hot or cold for that matter, will likely cause some tooth pain for a duration of a few weeks after use of the whitening strips. If your teeth are sensitive to begin with, it&#x27;s probably not the greatest idea to use such a whitener.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these. They work well and are easy without irritation.</li>
    <li> Good results---will order again</li>
    <li> The product came on time barely but it did. It was smaller than i expected but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m giving this product as a gift to my sister she is obsessed with cleaning her teeth. She has bought them before and LOVED them but could never afford them a second time (she has kids). I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Not nearly the results I expected, though some improvement.. will be returning to get a refund from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> These are terrible it didn&#x27;t work for me and it&#x27;s so hard to put on I hate them</li>
    <li> Best whitestrips I have ever used, do not go with the cheaper ones. They will slip and slide everywhere while these stay in place and the taste and smell aren&#x27;t bad at all. Always my go to when there is something coming up, whether it be a date or a wedding. Keeps my pearly white pearly and white! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days now and my teeth did hurt alot after I used it. It literally hurt! But I did see a different in just 3 days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;It started hurting after the second time using it. So it does work. I gav eit 3 stars because my teeth hurt alot but it&#x27;s worth the pain.</li>
    <li> Pretty effective, doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I would like but it really works. Though I do have to add it has a disgusting taste to it so try not to taste or swallow any. Simple and perfect for a quick but white look!</li>
    <li> This did the job that I wanted.</li>
    <li> The strips must have been stored at an improper temperature.  They were completely gooey, would not adhere to my teeth and were unusable.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whitier even after 4 days</li>
    <li> While these are whitening strips, they are the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; ones. I find that they don&#x27;t stay on all that well. Especially the bottom ones, they tend to come off of my teeth before the 30 minutes is up. I haven&#x27;t noticed a MAJOR difference in my teeth, but I&#x27;ve only used 3 of the 12  I purchased.</li>
    <li> The strips whitened my teeth as I expected.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the white stripes, the box was very smashed but product was still good. All ok.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have only used them once a day for four days and i can see a major difference.</li>
    <li> The Crest White strips work very well!</li>
    <li> This product is simple to use..my teeth look whiter already. So far, no complaints. Just makes sure you don&#x27;t brush your teeth before you put it on I made that mistake once already. It made my teeth super sensitive but now I have the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White is my go-to whitener; I don&#x27;t use anything else, for I always have great results. I&#x27;ll use these once or twice a year, and then sometimes in between those times I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;five minute&amp;#34; kind just to freshen/brighten the look of my teeth (I drink black coffee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much irritation/sensitivity to these, but if I do, I just cut back and use them every other day. Many times I&#x27;ll use the strips once a day every third or fourth day - just to keep my teeth at the level they currently are. With regular use, and good oral hygiene, your teeth can look amazing and naturally white and bright.</li>
    <li> love this- fast delivery- works</li>
    <li> 12 days was a little of a pain, but my gums have reacted to strong whitening products, this one did not cause any discomfort or problems. My teeth were noticeably whiter after application.</li>
    <li> they worked a little for sure I wont buy the vivid I would but the luxe next time though.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips produced noticeable results for me, and compared to professional treatment are certainly much cheaper. For the ingredients, the price of one of these kits is overinflated, but I guess as a once a year thing dropping $24 on whitening is alright.</li>
    <li> I was not very satisfied with this product. I received them in a timely manner but they did not adhere to my teeth. As I took them out of the package they were sliding off plastic piece and folding over. I ruined 2 packages this way. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I use them once a week and it whitens my teeth. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink wine or coffee. Only drink tea so I don&#x27;t have any real stains on my teeth. No pain or sensitivity from use and not too expensive.</li>
    <li> These strips were atrocious. They slimey, hard to apply, and do not stick well to teeth. I constantly had to rearrange them to keep them on my teeth in the right position. They also leave a terrible taste in your mouth. Basically they were downright disgusting. I cannot even vouch for how well they may whiten teeth, because I was so off-put that I stopped after 8 treatments and tossed them in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these because they were among the highest rated but they are not good, I do not recommend them for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, however, had success in whitening my teeth with Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips. They are easier to apply, much more mild in abrasiveness, and they dissolve so you don&#x27;t even need to take them out. I used these in conjunction with Crest 3D Whitening Intense Mint Toothpaste and my teeth were noticeably whiter. I&#x27;m not saying to stay way from Crest altogether, their whitening TOOTHPASTE is quite good. Just by all means stay away from these utterly disgusting whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I used one of these, and It seriously made me want to throw up. I&#x27;m not sure if I want to try them again or not. It was just very weird to use. If I give it another try I will update this review, but as for now, I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, because my honest opinion is that you won&#x27;t like them!</li>
    <li> Obviously that WILL work differently for every person depending on the condition of your teeth and sensitivity. I totally saw the difference by as early as day ten. I did not have any sensitivity what so ever through out the process. The whitening gel doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste which is a big plus. Totally love it and will get more for to use once in a while to keep it up.</li>
    <li> On a scale of 1-5 my teeth were probably as bad as a 2.5/3.0 and the strips didn&#x27;t work well at all!!  They needed to be stronger, and they don&#x27;t stay put well, especially the bottoms.  They also need to be longer!! Use the professional gel...skip the White Strips!</li>
    <li> got it for my mom and she loved it!</li>
    <li> They do not stay on your bottom teeth. Avoid these.</li>
    <li> Cheaper to buy these online than waiting for a damn coupon to buy these in-stores, plus free shipping you can&#x27;t beat it. I use these every 4 months or so and am always getting compliments on how white my teeth are. They only make my teeth sensitive toward the end of the box (2 weeks I think), and even then, it isn&#x27;t so bad and goes away after another week or two. These stay on my teeth just fine. Will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> These strips work, plain and simple. Is it as good as bleaching? No. But you can do it at home, while watching tv. Much easier!</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for whitening.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem as dramatic as the old crest strips I used to use, but they do the job and they are easy to use.  The old ones were used twice a day and these are only once a day, much more convenient.  I also tried some other product where you put the gel on the teeth and then a formed teeth guard, that wasn&#x27;t very good, the strips are the best way to go.  I will try a different product of Crest strips next time, probably the advanced.</li>
    <li> Unlike the glamorous white whitening strips by the same brand, the vivids did not stick to my teeth whats so ever. They slide around all over the place and even slide off sometimes :/ So if you are used to the glamorous white ones then i would suggest not buying these. But as always did a good job of whitening my teeth</li>
    <li> These do not stick to teeth.  I&#x27;ve used similar products before and this works nothing like them.  The strip it self is thin, always like Saran Wrap, and not matter how you place them, they slip off within minutes</li>
    <li> I used to use Advanced Vivid with the advanced seal and thought this product was a newer version. Sadly, it&#x27;s not. The grip is terrible, like the first white strips ever released by Crest, and they slip around all over the place. Look for their products with the advanced seal. They allow you to drink and talk more effortlessly.</li>
    <li> It works...Not like going to the dentist ..for a whitening...but it does work if you watch what you eat afterwards...Coffee and tea drinkers ...I dont think this is for you...I am a coffee and tea drinker and have been abstaining from two of my favorite beverages to hold the affect&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
    <li> Love the way your teeth feel when you wipe off the cleaner</li>
    <li> The strips don&#x27;t really stay on your teeth; they slip around and get mushy from saliva. I think you&#x27;d have to use a lot of them, and often, to get your teeth white.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 12 day strips which were very cheap at the time but I needed more strips to get the desired white for my teeth only because I did not stop drinking coffee!! It was fair and it worked! Did not cause tooth sensitivity which is always a plus!!</li>
    <li> Got my teeth whiter (not super white), but took a bit longer than I had expected.</li>
    <li> l followed the instructions as they said. I went for the one hour treatment which is supposed to do the best effect. I did not eat, did not smoke, not even had water to make sure it worked.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the strips I waited a while to get something to drink as I was afraid it might interfere with the process. Then I saw it happened, before the treatment I was just a regular dude, then my teeth were SO SENSITIVE. Even when I am not drinking/eating anything now my teeth hurt quite bad, I had never had this problem before.&lt;br /&gt;...oh, on the whitening part I just did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> I always use white strips and these are vert good .My teeth are whiter ;and the price is good to ,</li>
    <li> Eh....it&#x27;s not earth shattering or anything, it whitens but it&#x27;s inconvenient and as soon as you stop using the product your teeth goes back to its original shade</li>
    <li> Does not work on teeth that have been even slightly discolored by prescription medicine.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works great.  I have sensitive teeth, so the first few days I felt some discomfort but that soon went away.</li>
    <li> I believe I saw a difference after using this kit. Enough so that I went ahead and bought the Luxe pack for more whitening before my wedding.</li>
    <li> This was my first and will not be my last time using this magnificent creation. Just from the first strip, everyone has noticed it! it works and i say buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was pleased with the results.  This time I purchased the white strips for my teenage daughter.  We both experienced some tooth sensitivity with use.  We still like the results though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I used opalessence whitening products from my dentist for years. I lost my white trays and did not want to spend the money on new molds. I decided to try the white strips. I loved them! My ONLY complaint is these do not stick to your teeth as the more expensive crest white strips do. But for the money, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> i purchased these in the past and saw results after four days! you must be consistent with these though because the yellow tint does come back. although i do hear that when used in conjunction with the whitening toothpaste from crest that your teeth stay white longer. +the toothpaste could be used alone once you hit your desired white-ness and they will remain white!</li>
    <li> I used all of them and followed the instructions completely, but the results were subtle if not hardly noticeable. The strips constantly move and shift, making the whole experience uncomfortable and doing. They just would not stay in place. The price is not worth the subtle difference at all. Do not waste your money, and buy some different strips.</li>
    <li> Although I had my teeth whiten professionally last year, I felt the need for a boost for a special occasion.  I used the Crest Whitestrips for 12 days - 1/2 hour each day.  I didn&#x27;t realize how excellent they were until I saw photos of myself smiling (especially next to other people).</li>
    <li> These are my favorite. Works fast &amp; easy.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest White Strips before but not this particular one.  I tried 3 different packages of strips from the same box and none of them adhered to my teeth.  They slid write off no matter how dry I had my teeth before application.</li>
    <li> cheap quality. they didnt stick to teeth</li>
    <li> The strips made my teeth substantially more white. But the down side is the did not stick well to my bottom set of teeth.</li>
    <li> I loved this  product it really works</li>
    <li> worked after third day.  Holy cow!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working pretty well</li>
    <li> I thought I bought the wrong kit cause I don&#x27;t drink or smoke but I used it and my tooth are really whiter and it where so yellow cause I used to drink a lot of coffee and coke but now my tooth are really white. I used twice a day, first I caused me some pain the first 2 days but then I didn&#x27;t feel something. It is really easy to put on and really easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Dafuq? My teeth are about the same colour it was when I bought this. I was struggling to see the difference. I don&#x27;t smoke and I don&#x27;t drink that much coffee and apparently that&#x27;s what this is for. If you don&#x27;t really smoke then let me just say, keep your money in your pocket.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased with these. I used 9 treatments out of the 12 and I don&#x27;t really notice much of a change. They slip all over the place and don&#x27;t stay put. I will definitely be going for a different product next time.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips don&#x27;t work as well as the older generation ones but they are easy to use and did whiten my teeth a bit.  I have sensitive teeth and these didn&#x27;t hurt or cause any extra sensitivity.  I&#x27;d use this again in 8-12 months.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t really work. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all.</li>
    <li> Worked great and good price</li>
    <li> Love! As always ... These strips work awesome!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works on the first treatment. I have sensitive teeth &amp; this product did not cause any sensitivity at all. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not as great as just paying to have your teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this kit a try because the reviews said they were convenient and the system seems easy enough to use. I&#x27;ve tried a few whitening systems in the past, so my expectations were pretty high, I know what to look for when doing teeth whitening. I&#x27;m said to say this, but while these are definitely convenient, they do not whiten as well as a professional, dental teeth whitening solution with trays (like [[ASIN:B00QL2JJX0 this kit]] ). The reason being is the strips just don&#x27;t conform perfectly to your teeth no matter how hard you try indent them into the crevices of your teeth. Maybe if you have perfectly flat teeth it&#x27;d work well, but for me, I&#x27;d highly recommend the tray system I mentioned above because in just 2 minutes of molding trays, you have a tray that perfectly fits your teeth. If you have hesitations, try both I guess, it&#x27;s still cheaper then going to the mall and spending 100 dollars, or going to the dentist and spending multiple hundreds. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Use these religiously once a week, my dentist is thrilled with low white my teeth are without paying for expensive treatments.</li>
    <li> I am halfway through the 6 day process and see no change in color....but not done so will give it a chance. What I do know for sure is that they are flimsy and slide all over. Very substandard product. I would love to try another crest strip to see if any better quality. I bought a box for myself and one for my daughter.... Poor investment.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep on, product doesn&#x27;t stay on, after 5 minutes I have to take it off. Did whiten somewhat!</li>
    <li> this product did not work as described and it also made my teeth hurt - they became very sensitive to cold/hot/wind.</li>
    <li> Product worked fairly well. Can&#x27;t always expect miracles, can we? I was happy enough with it and will order it again. Had a problem keeping the strip on my lower teeth for some reason. Had to keep pressing it on the whole time. Anyway, I do notice my teeth are whiter. Coffee and tea stains minimized.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me. I start using it at least for a week.and I didn&#x27;t see any progress.I don&#x27;t recommend it for a friend.</li>
    <li> My GF and I tried this and the more expensive alternative at the same time.  We both had about the same shade of white when we started and I photographed us in the dark with a flash and did a photo comparison with Photoshop.  You know, the little eye-dropper thing that tells you what shade number you&#x27;re looking at.  Then we both used the products.  There was not much difference, but mine was $20 cheaper.  While it tastes AWFUL, it&#x27;s important to read the directions.  DON&amp;#34;T clean your teeth with flouride toothpaste before applying.  Keep on the whole time.  I suck in my lips after applying to get a good fit over each tooth.  I just spit the strips out after the 30 minutes is up and I don&#x27;t brush for an hour after that.  You get used to the taste and leaving it work a while longer has really professional results.  I also read in Consumer Reports that I&#x27;m right in saying this is just as effective as professional office work, but Laser it actually more effective.  All you&#x27;re doing with this product is bleaching the particles still stuck in your teeth.  The laser actually burns them out, but what else are you &amp;#34;burning out?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the crest whitening strips within one week of using the product my teeth are 2 shades lighter, will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I used them before so I know they work.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these were the old style, they still worked but these just don&#x27;t adhere to your teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Teeth became very sensitive but they did become whiter</li>
    <li> I love these strips they work very well. The only thing is they are very strong and if your teeth are sensitive I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> These definitely made my teeth whiter, but a few words of caution: DO NOT brush your teeth right before using these, it will cause your gums to BURN. Simply rinse with water before using. Second, I found that I wasn&#x27;t able to do much talking or moving of my mouth when using these because they move around, so use them 30 while watching tv or laying down.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips work wonderfully.  You do have to bend it around the teeth a bit when putting them on to get it to whiten the whole teeth, but it isn&#x27;t that hard to do.  I was reluctant to buy this product because of reviews saying that it hurts your teeth afterwards.  I bought it and tried it out and it did hurt my teeth afterwards, but I found that using ACT mouthwash after using this takes all of the pain away.</li>
    <li> i does not worth the money , it does not stick on my teeth very loss i do not recommend to buy save your money.</li>
    <li> These strips give good and quick results. However, they weren&#x27;t as I expected in that the strips itself lack adhesiveness. The whitestrips professional effects that I usually use are very sticky and I can walk around in them and even drink water. Whenever I put these on, I can&#x27;t do anything else at the same time (besides lay down), because they come off easily.</li>
    <li> Worked ok for me not perfect. Made my teeth more sensitive and caused some discomfort. Had to stop using with a few treatments left but did whiten all but one bad stain.</li>
    <li> This one expired on 12/2015, but look like a old one or not on good condition, the other ones that i have used,&lt;br /&gt;will remain attach to the tooth until I take it off, this one is in poor condition and, as soon that I detach it can fill it&lt;br /&gt;the poor texture and is even hard to insert it. Poor condition</li>
    <li> These suck! Don&#x27;t recommend at all! They&#x27;re really flimsy and don&#x27;t stick at all to your teeth. The bottom strip literally just slid off my teeth. Plus the shipping was horrible!! Had to wait an extra 4 days to receive my package!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these so I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune but I wish I might have invested a little more in the stronger Whitestrips.  This is probably the third or fourth time I have used Whitestrips over 5-7 years.  I don&#x27;t have very yellow teeth to begin with, I do drink about a cup of coffee every day, but the last time I used these was over two years ago (same kind - the basic ones) and I noticed a bigger difference in the past than I did this time around. I feel like my teeth could be whiter. I also experienced a lot of sensitivity towards the end and my last couple I had to space out over several days but the sensitivity was not so bad any of the other times I had used this product in the past. I recommend Whitestrips but if you really want bright white teeth I&#x27;d invest in the stronger ones.</li>
    <li> Note: I am reviewing this item after purchasing at my local Wal_Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips stuck to my teeth very well, except once. I took before and afters (you should be able to see the picture in the gallery. I felt like they were working but after seeing the pictures I guess not. This is my second time trying to whiten my teeth, my first with these strips, and neither times have the after picture looked different. May try a different whitening product by Crest in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~BritMae</li>
    <li> it tastes wired when I use it but it was my first time to use this product, so I don&#x27;t know is this normal or not. but it is good and work well.</li>
    <li> These are not the best ones made. They have improved them so much. These don&#x27;t stick to your teeth very good. Pay more and get the professional Crest strips.</li>
    <li> Well, less expensive, anyway. I do like Crest and their White Strip products. This is a good one. I just wish I could remember to use them all! They whiten before the pack is finished and I forget I&#x27;ve got them... They are that good.</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work as well as the ones I buy in the drugstore; seemed like old stock. I had to throw them away.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as advertised. I have used non-brand named products that worked much better than this one.</li>
    <li> These ones DO NOT grip the teeth and are the flimsy crappy strips. They slide off and stink! :(</li>
    <li> Strips will not stick to your teeth for any length of time, have to keep my teeth clenched and mouth shut, may get 10 minutes out of them. They do whiten if you can keep them on your teeth</li>
    <li> My dentist when I was a kid told me I would never have white teeth and they would always be yellow (which is how they grew in). I believed him and never bothered trying to whiten them until I was 21 and I had moved from Wyoming to California. Someone mentioned my teeth looked a little dull (RUDE lol) and that I should try crest white strips. I explained that my teeth would never be white but then turned around and bought a pack just to see if it would help at least a tiny bit. Not only did it help but I now get compliments on how white my teeth are. I did a full pack as the instructions said and then after that I do a strip a few times a month to maintain my bright smile. They are super comfortable and cause me zero sensitivity. I highly recommend giving it a try if you havent yet!</li>
    <li> these really worked for me in the beginning but when I used the 4-5 strip the effekct didnt show as much. But I wasnt expecting them to make my teeth pearly white so it didnt bother me too much. I would definetely recommend this if you want a quick fix to make your teeth look more healthy and taken care of. I still use the strips once in a while to touch up. All in all a great product!! Big things up!</li>
    <li> I bought these on recommendation of a friend. I wanted to get whiter teeth without harming them since I have a past of sensitive teeth. I&#x27;m on day 8 and I notice a HUGE difference. If I could attach a before and after picture I would. I usually put them on before I leave the house to commute to the city as its about a half hour drive (the recommended time for the strips is 30 mins). The taste is somewhat sweet and isn&#x27;t completely gross. The strips fit me fine- I applied as directed. I had some difficulty with my bottom retainer behind my teeth but it always managed to stick and stay on the front which is all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a slight bit of sensitivity but nothin I couldn&#x27;t handle- well worth it considering what you&#x27;re putting your teeth through to get them the way you want them. Note: I don&#x27;t smoke, drink wine or rarely drink coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who wants a whiter smile for a decent price. (Did I mention I&#x27;m a broke student?).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the generic brands, I barely saw a difference.</li>
    <li> A++++ gets your teeth white and shiny... definately order this product again...</li>
    <li> There were NO instructions.  No labeling for top or bottom strips.  They mush and stick together just trying to peel them off  of the card they come on.  They mush and do not stay put on the teeth.  I do not see a noticeable difference on my teeth.  They do not touch the yellow between my teeth even the day after a dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Safeway Strips were better!</li>
    <li> These will get you to a very natural-looking white, but if you want the blindingly white Hollywood-look level, try a stronger version.</li>
    <li> This product is not very good. The strips have gone down in quality since P&amp;G developed the new and more expensive strips. This strips do not stay on teeth and you end wasting your money. Too expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t even work.  These should be discontinued and the price should be much lower for the better quality strips.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my daughter asked for. She is very happy now. Thank you so much for your excellent service.</li>
    <li> Works for me, gets the Yellow Out</li>
    <li> Wish I could get the original classic white strips.</li>
    <li> It did help whitten my teeth some what. I wanted better results then what I saw on my teeth- wanted a real noticeable result.  I am going to continue to look for something else.</li>
    <li> Do not use long term - makes teeth sensitive!</li>
    <li> Unlike the glamorous white whitening strips by the same brand, these classic vivids did not stick to my teeth whats so ever. They slide around all over the place and even slide off sometimes. IT was annoying and I had to just toss them all out.  Never buying the Crest white strips again.</li>
    <li> I had embarrassing yellow teeth from my young reckless years when I&#x27;d forget to brush my teeth and horrible coffee stains. This product has helped so much! I&#x27;ve seen drastic improvement in my smile and am really happy with my purchase. *shipping came on time*</li>
    <li> These whitestrips do not stay on your teeth, they are ridiculously flimsy. I&#x27;ve used much better before.</li>
    <li> Why have yellow teeth when these Crest 3D Whitestrips can fix the problem.  They only need to be used occasionally, once you are pleased with the look of your teeth.  They stick on really well.</li>
    <li> Perfect to whiten your teeth without pain and for good price! I always use them and get compliments from people about how white my teeth are</li>
    <li> If you want white teeth fast and you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money, these are for you. I&#x27;ve bought white strips before, but that was years ago, and they only sold packages for at least thirty bucks. I bought these at Target for around twenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using them for about three or four days and I&#x27;ve already noticed results. I drink coffee by day and wine a night or two a week, so my teeth are in desperate need of whitening. After just a couple of days&#x27; use, I can already see the difference! I even took a picture of the inside of my mouth and I can see just how white the front is compared to the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you WILL experience sensitivity. And if you&#x27;re like me, and you already had sensitive teeth prior to using the strips, I recommend using them every other day instead. I also recommend following up your whitening with some Sensodyne toothpaste. I think Crest makes their own sensitive toothpaste now too, but I know for a fact that Sensodyne works. Your teeth will still be coated with the whitening gel after you take the strips off, so I always immediately brush my teeth afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be prepared to just have a weird sensation in your mouth for a half an hour while your teeth are coated with the thin plastic strips. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, personally, and it seems that Crest has improved their formula. I remember there being a really awful medicinal taste when I used them five or six years ago, but now they taste pretty mild if you accidentally get some on your tongue. Also, be careful not to coat your gums with the strips--just your teeth--or they will probably feel a little tender afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend these strips if you want fast, relatively cheap results.</li>
    <li> I have a partial veneer on my front tooth so I can&#x27;t get professional whitening done, but these do the job perfectly! I&#x27;m also a big coffee drinker. I use these about once a week, maybe biweekly if I&#x27;m super busy. Super easy to use, I agree with another reviewer to not brush before using them. The prime shipping was awesome for this product too, would buy again.</li>
    <li> The minute I put them on my teeth they bunched up and stuck together and fell off. Very flimsy. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It worked... Not as glamorously as I thought but I saw a slight difference. My teeth used to be really yellow now they just have that slight tint. Lol (I&#x27;m a coffee addict, I drink 3-5 cups a day) Anyways I paid like $14.99 for it, just to try it. I wasn&#x27;t going to pay $30-$40 for something that might NOT WORK. I wasn&#x27;t going to take that chance! Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. The only problem i had was that sometimes it wasn&#x27;t really sticking to my teeth, this only occurred with the first 5-7 strips but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> It was my second time trying a whitening product &amp; this was really good. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain</li>
    <li> I have purchased these before. However these were very flimsy and wouldn&#x27;t stick to my teeth. Stay away from this one</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m 8 days in and I&#x27;ve seen some changes in the color of my teeth. Haven&#x27;t really gotten any compliments about my teeth but I see it personally and would like to complete the 12 days to see how white it&#x27;ll be after complete .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different Crest whitestrip products and these are by far the worst ever. The strips are super flimsy, they don&#x27;t go on easily because of that, and they do not stick well to the teeth. Better to spend a bit more money and get something that works.</li>
    <li> These classic strips do the job at a good price point. no need to buy anything more expensive.</li>
    <li> amazing! highly recommend</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE. This particular Crest Whitestrip product is extremely low quality. I have purchased 2 boxes of Crest Whitesrips per year for at least 4 years now - this might be the last. I feel like these strips are first generation for the Company. Truly. They slip all over my teeth, the product bleeds out all over my mouth (and doesn&#x27;t even taste as strong as prior boxes - not to mention feeling no sensitivity the next day, which typically happens to me). I used one top and bottom... Figured it would be a fluke. Used a second. No fluke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is impossible to find the difference among the quality of Crest&#x27;s Whitestrips. I&#x27;m speaking about how boxes range something like $40 in price but don&#x27;t really justify what makes each different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not typically write reviews; however, this is warranted. Not that I have the time, who truly does, but I will certainly be going out of my way to send this back to Crest. Truly disappointing.</li>
    <li> Yes this actually works! My teeth were noticeable whiter after only three days and by the last treatment I was very happy with the results. There are moments when you&#x27;re in excruciating pain while wearing the strips but those usually only last seconds. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! next best thing to a professional whitening that I have found!</li>
    <li> I had never tried any kind of whitening product before, and these work great. So far I&#x27;ve used about 4 of the treatments and they have made a huge difference. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try these.</li>
    <li> These strip work so well. They help eliminate/reduce the coffee stains that have been on my teeth for years.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like these strip better than the advanced seal.</li>
    <li> always a good product</li>
    <li> Unfortunately  the strips barely stay on . And you can taste the solution in your mouth since the strips move .</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with this product and hard to apply..dosn&#x27;t even cover all of your teeth. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week to keep my teeth white and it works great!</li>
    <li> Not the newest in the line of white strips, but they still work very well in my opinion. I&#x27;ve noticed results much sooner than 12-14 days. I haven&#x27;t used the other types of white strips Crest has on the market, but I think these ones work just fine!</li>
    <li> Pay more for the newer one.  I did not see a difference this time.  Plus they never stayed in place.</li>
    <li> It had been expired when I ordered</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong white strips. These are the cheap ones that don&#x27;t stay on your teeth. They are like a flimsy celephane bag.</li>
    <li> Very good got shiny healthy teeth i have sensitive teeth and it didnt harm them</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with these strips.  They have been either too hot or too cold at some point, as the consistency is off and the strips won&#x27;t stay where they&#x27;re put and don&#x27;t work right. I&#x27;ve used these many times but this box is useless.</li>
    <li> doesnt work, used al 24 by intructions and 0 results, the strips are impossible to keep on past 15 minutes</li>
    <li> Good price, whitens for a short period of time. Plan to use these every 6 months if you want lasting results though.</li>
    <li> My daughter just got her braces off and these strips are whitening her teeth very nicely!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, as described, is whitening my teeth but whitening is slow.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described.</li>
    <li> Horrible product so thin they fall apart when you try and apply to your teeth.</li>
    <li> whitens teeth like you went to the dentist and charged u a huge amout</li>
    <li> I have  noticed results  in a  very short  period  of time.  I have not  experienced  any discomfort  or extreme  sensitivity.  Will  be reordering</li>
    <li> Works fast.  I just used only 7 of the 12 strips and it made a noticeable difference.  Take a bit to get used to, but after the first few, it isn&#x27;t too bad.  They tend to slip a bit so make sure your teeth are dry when you apply them.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked to whiten my teeth.  I was interested in a whitening product that was economical and successful.  I found both in this product.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Like any other whitening treatments, you&#x27;re teeth will be a bit sensitive for a couple hours.  These strips are effective in whitening and do it rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I was unsure at first about this but I decided to purchase any way. my teeth weren&#x27;t really yellow but it Did the job my boyfriend said my teeth look whiter . I feel more confident to wear brighter lipstick &amp; smile :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised I saw results just after a couple uses, and my teeth were seriously stained from coffee and cigarettes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past several years, approximately once every 12 to 18 months. I have actually had people stop me on the street asking what I use to keep my teeth so white. A great product!</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly and was easy to use. Although, I felt awkward wearing them cause I&#x27;ve never worn any teeth whitening strips before. After using 2 of the strips there was a bit of improvement in my teeth. As you wear em you can just feel them cleaning your teeth. I give it 4 stars cause they work, but my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as I&#x27;d hoped and I just didn&#x27;t like wearing em. Other than that good price and nice results. I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it defenetly makes my theeth whiter in a matter of minutes, it doesnt bother me while its on or causes any sensitivity on my theeth.</li>
    <li> Good product, it whitened my teeth but the white looks very natural, as I expected and wanted it to do. I didn&#x27;t really experienced sensitivity, so I recommend it! ;)</li>
    <li> They made my teeth really sensitive after each use and were hard to keep still on my teeth. They also made my mouth water so much I had to keep swallowing [pause].</li>
    <li> I use these about every 3-6 months to keep my teeth bright and white. The strips are easy to put on, but, I sometimes have a hard time keeping them in place and not feeling like they&#x27;ve scrunched up.</li>
    <li> Product works but with significant pain. I used a sensitive toothpaste to help me get through the process. Aspirin was requires so I could sleep at night from the pain.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t whiten well and has no adhesive -- most of it washes away with your saliva long before it can whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> This will without a doubt give you whiter teeth, but they&#x27;re pretty slippery; they don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
    <li> I take really good care of my teeth but I do drink at least a cup of coffee every day and eventually my teeth need a little pick me up. These work great for me, though. I use this box about once a year and it keeps me pretty white.</li>
    <li> They were noticeably whiter after using the box. Kinda weird getting them in place and keeping them there.</li>
    <li> Worked great but it was difficult to keep the lower strip on</li>
    <li> Always have good results...I use the Whitestrips a couple of times a year.</li>
    <li> For some reason these are extremely painful on my teeth. I&#x27;ve used them in the past and never had a problem.  Not sure what happend but could not wear more then 3 mins and threw away the box. Ouch!</li>
    <li> These are great for using now and again to keep teeth pearly white, I really like them and they are affordable and really do work.</li>
    <li> Brighter smile is younger smile. Works well</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product. But I did overall like it. Next time I will get the more advanced whitening.</li>
    <li> The package was in good condition, there was no sign of damaged and it arrived the day it stated. The product has help my teeth whitening a little.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use (I admit I can be clumsy with products like this) and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even talk with them (kind of). Not as powerful as I had hoped,you definitely need to use them every day.</li>
    <li> Tried this immediately and saw a slight difference, then tried it again the next day and saw a difference - I will be doing it again&lt;br /&gt;this evening and I am quite sure it will be whiter again!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 5th day using this product and I&#x27;m already seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product to anyone that want to have a white smile.</li>
    <li> NOT ENOUGH STRIPS . WORKS GREAT BUT ORDER WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Always a wonderful product!  Price better here  than local drug store.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I did notice a huge difference in the color of my teeth after only one and a half treatments. However, during the second treatment I got a REALLY sharp pain in one tooth and had to stop completely. I haven&#x27;t had enough courage to try it again but the results have lasted quite well. The strips do not stay on very well at all, I find myself constantly pushing them back down so that they cover my entire tooth. However, the results are good. So three stars. Beware that these may cause pain!</li>
    <li> fast shipping , good result, i like it</li>
    <li> Works great if you can manage to keep them on your teeth.</li>
    <li> They made my teeth pearly white so fast, just in one use and the whiteness lasts for about a week. I will definitely buy these again once I run out, they are amazing! 😄</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product came as expected. I&#x27;ve always loved these white strips, can&#x27;t wait to put them to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every year for 5 yrs. Something has changed as it doesn&#x27;t come close in results or quality as it did last year. I I tried it for 3 days and gave up and returned the rest of it.  The strips did not stay in place on my teeth for more than 10-15 min.  The use of the bottom strip was awful. It seems that Crest cheapened their product by changing the consistency of the strips. In the past the back of the strips were smooth which obviously helped them adhere to your teeth.  Now they seem to have little ripples or dimples on the back which is probably why they don&#x27;t work well.  I was extremely disappointed and well never purchase them again. DON&amp;#34;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased crest white strips before. They&#x27;ve changed the quality of these strips. These are constantly slipping and sliding off of my teeth, defeating the purpose. The old ones never did. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I need at least 4 weeks worth to get results. I don&#x27;t understand why this is so expensive...it&#x27;s just Hyrdrogen Peroxide in a gel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times for 30 minutes each and i can tell the difference. I still have yet to try it on for longer but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Getting dental work done and wanted to whiten my teeth before I get some permanent &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;. I used the professional strips by Crest which did a great job. I purchased these to whiten just a little more in the last few days before my appointment. There is a big difference in quality between these and the professional strips as far as fit and sensitivity. With the professional strips, they fit very snugly on the teeth and I was able to talk, drink, even eat if  I wanted to. I experienced no sensitivity. With these, they are very flimsy. I feel I can barely move my mouth as doing otherwise may make them come off. Last night, I had to take the bottom strip off because it felt it was off anyway...and right now, I&#x27;m focused moreso on my top teeth. In using them again, I felt my gums stinging immediately after I placed them on my teeth. I&#x27;m going to finish using them for the two days I have before my dental work, but I would definitely not purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to tell about the whitening effects. With the sensitivity, I can only hope that means its working.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not so comfortable but it&#x27;s does good work. after the second time i can see the change on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. They work!</li>
    <li> AWESOME teeth whitening system. Only one piece of advice do not accidentally fall asleep wearing these&lt;br /&gt;They ARE INDEED made with peroxide in them. So you will wake with very, VERY sensitive gums which can lead later also to a receding gumline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which would then cost you a TON of $$$$$ in your dental office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE these! but most definitely USE AS Directed please</li>
    <li> Just thought I would share this. Despite the look of my before picture my teeth weren&#x27;t bad. But they definitely weren&#x27;t white. Now after only 7 of the twelve days I can see a huge difference! I also had to post this selfie to give an idea of just how white my teeth are now!!!! Also, the strips stayed on perfectly for me and I had no sensitivity whatsoever, which is impressive considering my teeth are usually very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted whiter teeth. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my smile started to yellow and look a bit older.  I figured I would try, hoping for just a shade or two and despite past failures using any product due to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now at the end of the box, my teeth which started off white look 4 shades lighter and still natural. I also found a successful way to manage tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid sensitivity, get some sensodyne and a generic whitening tray at the store. Fill the tray with the toothpaste and leave it on 30 minutes the first few days after you whiten, the around day three you can go down to 20 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion might be to try the advanced vivid. The classic version can be harder to keep in place. So the little extra cost more might be worth if just to make things easy.</li>
    <li> works well, but i still prefer the much cheaper Walmart brand whenever I can find them!</li>
    <li> These are the older version. I bought them because i needed to whiten but didn&#x27;t have money for more expensive 3D strips I usually use. My recommendation spend the extra money and get the newer crest 3D white strips. These do not stay on my teeth at all. They are so thin and bunch up. I do not brush before hand or drink stuff. My teeth are pretty dry. I&#x27;m constantly having to push them back on. I only used them twice bc I couldn&#x27;t stand the poor quality. They whitened most of my teeth, the areas that had contact with strips the most. The other ones stuck on and had to be peeled off and whitened better. I&#x27;m a coffee and soda drinker too I should add. The instructions say to use daily for a week probably  because they don&#x27;t stay on. The other strips I could use 1 time a week and it removed a lot of stain. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product/transaction. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used 4 of them and I haven&#x27;t seen the &#x27;vivid results&#x27; and I have toothache! Maybe the chemicals excite tooth nerves.</li>
    <li> LIghts, Camera, Action!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use these as faithfully as I should have, but when I did, I actually did notice a difference after around the 3rd day.  The only issue I had was a little sensitivity after I took them off.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a present for my Mom for Christmas.  She loves to whiten her teeth but doesn&#x27;t like the cost of the whitening strips.  I bought her 2 boxes which she was very happy about.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Does what is says it does. I like this better than the fancier versions as these. I feel these work faster and are stronger than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Live the product but the company charged me twice!</li>
    <li> I bought ones from the store that seemed to stay on better than this type. These did not want to stay on.</li>
    <li> I have been using whitening products for years, so my teeth are already really white. I use this as a bi-weekly touch up. It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I would give this seller/product NO stars if I could. Each packet should come with both a top and bottom strip. However, it&#x27;s the luck of the draw when I open them. Half the packets only have a top strip. Paid the full price and am getting half the product. Total ripoff.</li>
