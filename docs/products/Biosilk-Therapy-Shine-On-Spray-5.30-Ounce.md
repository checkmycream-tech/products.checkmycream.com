      <li>The hairspray drips on your hand when sprayed, have to continually clean the nozzel, and it is \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; which doesnt allow you to style your hair with it.  </li>
      <li>It provides a natural, yet strong hold, gives my hair and highlights a perfect &amp;#34;glint&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.  </li>

      <li>This Biosilk goes on lightly and doesnt leave a heavy buildup in your hair.</li>
      <li>My fear is they are discontinuing it, as there were only a few in my beauty products store (Ulta), and many of the Biosilk line of products are on sale on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Yes, its expensive but sometimes for a good prodcut you gotta drop the cash</li>
      <li>So now I search high and low for it.</li>

    <li> Great product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This Biosilk goes on lightly and doesnt leave a heavy buildup in your hair. Wouldnt use anything else.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for getting shine in your hair - exactly where you want and quickly.  I have more control with the spray versus the liquid in bottles.  Love the smell.  Also perfect for spritzing arms and legs for a little glow.  Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Gives a nice sheen to my gray hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I don&#x27;t always condition my hair in the shower.  This shine on spray is easy to use while styling your hair.  I give it 4 stars because it is a little too heavy for fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> As an AA woman, I was very pleased with the long-lasting shine it left on my hair.  I got this awhile ago in a gift set with the Biosilk drops.  I highly recommend this product for all hair types!!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered from this supplier many times and I have always receive the product quickly and in excellant condition.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR, GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> I love this BioSIlk product after washing and setting my hair....But, I just went to my own beauty parlor....me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;DR</li>
    <li> This shine spray is absolutely perfect.  It works well without making my hair look dirty and it smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT. I HAVE GREY HAIR AND IT MAKES IT SHINE. I HAVE PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT I USE TO KEEP THE GREY FROM LOOKING DULL. I HAVE A SHELTIE DOG WITH LONG HAIR AND IT MAKES HIM SHINE AND EASY TO COMB OUT THE TANGLES.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blond and blond hair usually could look a little dry but when I use this product it gives my hair such a beautiful shine. A little bit goes a long way. Spray from far. Delivery was on time and everything is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my hair and it gives shine. I love this product \\&quot;Biosilk Therapy Shine On Spray\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchase\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love all of the Biosilk products.</li>
    <li> Biosilk is a fine mist spray that does not leave a heavy residue on your hair, I recommend it to all who like a light hair spray.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product and I love it. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth</li>

    <li> OMG, this stuff does exactly what it says.  I love it. I  used to have a similar product when I was in high school, this is so much better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever like to be without this spray.  It adds shine that is unbelievable!  I&#x27;ve found that it isn&#x27;t always easy to find in the drug stores, so for me, the easiest and cheapest way to purchase it is through Amazon.com, with my Amazon Prime membership.  I usually order at least two cans so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and always get compliments. It makes the hair shiny and smells delicious. Always a great companion when I travel; wouldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Works well to shine hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great for us older ones to make it shine...never leave the house without a little Spritz!</li>
    <li> I love this spray when my hair is dry, flyaway, and needs extra moisture. It can weigh the hair down, so I spritz it ever so lightly on my ends. Makes my hair too greasy if I spray my entire head. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user of this stuff. I love how it makes your hair feel and how it seems  to give a nice sheen. A little pricey but worth it and it lasts a while as you don&#x27;t want to use too much.</li>
    <li> Great product holds hair excellent.</li>
    <li> Gives very good shine. But, it is impossible to add volume in your hair after using this. This product goes on very heavy and you will get absolutely no lift at the roots.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is not sticky or stiff at all like a hair spray.  It leaves my hair soft and gives it a wonderful shiny finish.</li>
    <li> gives my corse hair a smooth, shiny look. also use as i am flat ironing my hair. have used this priduct for 10 years.</li>
    <li> Loved product and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love this product for finishing look</li>
    <li> I have long brown, highlighted hair that is prone to frizzing in humidity.  This is the best hair spray (and I&#x27;ve tried them all!) bar none.  It provides a natural, yet strong hold, gives my hair and highlights a perfect &amp;#34;glint&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> everything was as stated, delivery and all akskfkgf</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used it on my hair about a year ago, it is my hairs best friend now. Puts a natural looking shine on my otherwise dull hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it. It makes my hair greasy looking/feeling.</li>
    <li> Smells strongly of aerosol fragrance.  Maybe because I&#x27;m not used to the smell, but I can still smell it for quite a while after application.  It goes on very evenly, reduces the frizzies, and adds a bit of shine.  It can sometimes border on looking oily though. I don&#x27;t have any products to compare it to, other than your typical hair serum that you have to apply with your hands.  This is MUCH easier &amp; cleaner than that process!  Jury&#x27;s still out if I&#x27;ll purchase it again when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased Biosilk. It really helps my hair.</li>
    <li> Not stiff or sticky, lends a shine to hair and avoids frizz from moisture if used at styling.  but it does have some oil in it if you wear glasses.</li>
    <li> The product that was received was a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; version and is nothing like the original hairspray.  The hairspray drips on your hand when sprayed, have to continually clean the nozzel, and it is \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; which doesnt allow you to style your hair with it.  This product is not recommended.  The \\&quot;original\\&quot; Biosilk is great.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT!! WORKS GREAT ON MY HAIR. ALSO WORKS GREAT WITH FLAT IRON!!!</li>
    <li> I use regular Biosilk with a Chi iron.  Sometimes, I use this spray, VERY lightly the next day for touch ups with the Chi.  Be sure to use it lightly or your hair will look greasy and/or unclean.  Hair that is thick, dry or curly would probably not have this same problem.  It is a definite hair tamer.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY love, love, love this hair spray. I began using this spray unknowingly about 13 years ago when my stylist sprayed it on as a finishing touch. And I have received so many compliments on how healthy and shiny it makes my hair look. So now I search high and low for it. And I&#x27;ve  looked around a lot because it seems like stores carry it sporatically. But it&#x27;s now one of my hair necessities. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product, it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my hair&#x27;s bounce. For me it&#x27;s perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my advice for those looking for unbelievable shine - even on ethnic hair that&#x27;s straightened out - this is your product! Buy it in bulk!</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago, I bought a whole set of BIO-Silk products that included this Shine on Spray - It does a great job of adding that shine and highlights the blond in my hair.</li>
    <li> Good Service on a product I use often.  I continue to use this product to nourish my hair and put a shine on as well.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and I get compliments every day about how my hair shines.  It does not leave any sticky feeling on my hair and it smells great.  It is a must have for all us women who love our hair to shine.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair silky smooth without being greasy. Love this product and have used for many years. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It turns my dull hair into vibrant hair. The only downfall is that you have to be careful with the amount you spray on. If you spray too much your hair turns out looking greasy. However, with the right about it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR, the BEST product I have EVER used....and I have used MANY \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brands. It is SO nice!! My fear is they are discontinuing it, as there were only a few in my beauty products store (Ulta), and many of the Biosilk line of products are on sale on Amazon. I REALLY hope that is NOT the case!!! Maybe they are just \\&quot;re-packaging\\&quot; the line? I sure HOPE so!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this spray but the last one I purchased is very hard to spray. I would send it back if I knew where to send it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes it so much easier to blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Best shine spray I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Enjoy the product, and Amazon access made it easy.  Otherwise product is more difficult to find in our area.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and have found it to be excellent.  My grey hair sparkles when using  this spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly like what you would buy in the stores</li>
    <li> a lot of spray shine products weigh down fine hair and can make hair feel stiff and sticky but not this gem from Biosilk. ive been using this product for years on over processed blonde hair and it makes my hair look and feel like its healthier than it really is. ive tried them all and this is by far the best. the price is also much better than what you can spend elsewhere.</li>
