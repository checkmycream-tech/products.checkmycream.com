### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best stuff EVER.</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful powder to travel with.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is awesome!</li>
      <li>FOUND THE BEST PRICE ON AMAZON,</li>
      <li>I have been using this powder for 3 years now and it is the best makeup I have ever found.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST POWDER FOUNDATION I HAVE TRIED.</li>
      <li>Halo is the perfect reasonably flawless finish that has replaced the cream to powder heavyish foundation</li>
      <li>SMASHBOX HAS CREATED THE BEST POWDER FOUNDATION.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a win, in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have worn this product for three years now and it is a great foundation, very light with great coverage.</li>
      <li>I noticed it, too, but IMO, that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
      <li>IT GOES ON SILKY SMOOTH &amp; KEEPS YOUR SKIN FEELING GREAT!!</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this seller has it at this great price.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing powder.</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t carry Halo in my purse, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but when traveling, I put Halo in its own zip lock bag</li>
      <li>I honestly will not be without this product.</li>
      <li>The Light is warmer, and much more becoming to my very fair skin tone.  </li>
      <li>powder goes on like silk and very light.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>I love the product and use it regularly,however,the brush was not included in the package as indicated in the title.</li>
      <li>I do wish it was refillable though - seems wasteful to toss the very well made and attractive container when the product is gone.</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite makeup.</li>
      <li>Now that I can purchase this from Amazon at a significantly reduced price I am even more of a fan!</li>
      <li>I have used this before and love it.  </li>
      <li>It is very comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>I personally use medium which gives a nice glow to fair reddish skin.</li>
      <li>It does give a fabulous dewy glow.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product and like it (although the plastic case is cheap and the opener broke so</li>
      <li>On the smaller sized powder the holes are perfect since there are fewer of them, but on this larger sized one, there are too many holes of this size and the powder comes out too quickly</li>
      <li>It looks natural, non oily, has staying power, easy to apply, feels light, and makes my skin look brighter and youthful.</li>
      <li>Beautiful makeup which should be applied with a small bukie brush.</li>
      <li>I just use this and it gives me that fresh and awake look all day.</li>
      <li>IF YOU ENJOY USING POWDER INSTEAD OF LIQUID FOUNDATION, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>and I chose to buy the larger more economical size through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This was the exact powder I needed</li>
      <li>I look like myself, only better with than without it.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and this is my third time I have purchased it.</li>
      <li>It does look very powdery and artificial when first applied, but after a while, it disappears, leaving your skin looking great!  </li>
      <li>its ok (consider the cost of all that loose powder on your sink, clothing, etc.).  </li>
      <li>Really, for the price, the packaging should be better.t</li>
      <li>you really need this product for your skin type,</li>
      <li>It gives coverage, but not too much.  </li>
      <li>THE COLOR IS A TRUE SHADE: NOT TO DARK OR LIGHT.</li>
      <li>Normally it&#x27;s much more at other retailers.</li>
      <li>Used alone it amplifies your natural beauty, it creates pure perfection when applied as a setting powder over your foundation.</li>
      <li>I used the Fair for a while, but think it makes me look tired and washed out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not hard on the case - it just sits in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida</li>
      <li>- they should have made fewer or smaller holes on this large size.</li>
      <li>consider this product not much of a higher level quality than most other off the shelf brands.  </li>
      <li>Great long lasting coverage but a bit too heavy for everyday.</li>
      <li>couple of reviewers complained about the yellowish color of the Light shade.  </li>
      <li>If I want to pay nearly $90 per ounce (that&#x27;s equal to almost $1,500 per pound), I&#x27;ll go to a department store makeup counter, get some personalized attention, and the powder might not cost as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Best stuff EVER. I&#x27;ll use it exclusively as long as they make it. I do wish it was refillable though - seems wasteful to toss the very well made and attractive container when the product is gone.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and like it (although the plastic case is cheap and the opener broke so I have to be careful how I close it), but it is way too expensive for what you get.  The colors also don&#x27;t match my skin, so I need to mix two colors to get what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this product not much of a higher level quality than most other off the shelf brands.  If I want to pay nearly $90 per ounce (that&#x27;s equal to almost $1,500 per pound), I&#x27;ll go to a department store makeup counter, get some personalized attention, and the powder might not cost as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really need this product for your skin type, its ok (consider the cost of all that loose powder on your sink, clothing, etc.).  If you can get away with it, get some other less expensive product and go buy a new pair of shoes with the money you saved!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and love it.  The powder gives your skin a glow and a velvet look.  It is very comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> I love the product and use it regularly,however,the brush was not included in the package as indicated in the title. I am not overly concerned about that as it doesn&#x27;t effect the product.</li>
    <li> I personally use medium which gives a nice glow to fair reddish skin. I live in Florida and I use sunscreen on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;This powder goes on like silk and very light. It is easy to apply and this is my third time I have purchased it. Beautiful makeup which should be applied with a small bukie brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> This was the exact powder I needed and I chose to buy the larger more economical size through Amazon.  Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  On the smaller sized powder the holes are perfect since there are fewer of them, but on this larger sized one, there are too many holes of this size and the powder comes out too quickly - they should have made fewer or smaller holes on this large size.</li>
    <li> I honestly will not be without this product. It is powder perfection! Used alone it amplifies your natural beauty, it creates pure perfection when applied as a setting powder over your foundation.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite makeup. It gives coverage, but not too much.  I purchased my first container before a trip, when I ran out of my usual and did not have time to order a replacement.  This is a wonderful powder to travel with.  The way it shaves off as little or as much as you need, makes it last longer, and really helps with the mess you get when you travel with other powders.  Now that I can purchase this from Amazon at a significantly reduced price I am even more of a fan!</li>
    <li> The product itself is awesome! However, I had to give it a 3 due, as with other Smashbox products, to its packaging. I&#x27;m using my 3rd one and with all three, the latches that close the compact have broken. I&#x27;m not hard on the case - it just sits in my bathroom. I&#x27;ve written the company, but to no avail.</li>
    <li> Amazing powder. I have been using this powder for 3 years now and it is the best makeup I have ever found. It looks natural, non oily, has staying power, easy to apply, feels light, and makes my skin look brighter and youthful.</li>
    <li> It actually moisturizes your skin even though it is a powder. I used to use Bare Essentials, but it made my skin look dry. This powder does not, so I believe it is moisturizing to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  If I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t feel like putting on my normal routine I just use this and it gives me that fresh and awake look all day.</li>
    <li> The older I get, the less makeup I use.  Halo is the perfect reasonably flawless finish that has replaced the cream to powder heavyish foundation I used to use.  No, it doesn&#x27;t cover as well as a gooier product, but it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, either.  It does give a fabulous dewy glow.  It&#x27;s some mysterious ingredient, because there&#x27;s not a bit of shimmer to the stuff in the case, but somehow it transforms on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of reviewers complained about the yellowish color of the Light shade.  I noticed it, too, but IMO, that&#x27;s a good thing.  I used the Fair for a while, but think it makes me look tired and washed out.  The Light is warmer, and much more becoming to my very fair skin tone.  I do suggest that you wait a while after using it before passing judgement on either the texture and the color.  It does look very powdery and artificial when first applied, but after a while, it disappears, leaving your skin looking great!  The directions say 10 minutes, but it takes a lot longer, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed it settling into lines and wrinkles, of which I&#x27;ve earned my share, but it&#x27;s not a facelift, either.  I look like myself, only better with than without it.  That&#x27;s a win, in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the case is crap.  I&#x27;ve used several Halo products and on every one, the latch on the case quits working soon after opening.  Since I don&#x27;t carry Halo in my purse, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but when traveling, I put Halo in its own zip lock bag so I don&#x27;t get powder all over everything.  Really, for the price, the packaging should be better.t</li>
    <li> Smashbox HALO Hydrating Perfecting Powder &amp; Brush Set Medium...THIS IS THE BEST POWDER FOUNDATION I HAVE TRIED. IT GOES ON SILKY SMOOTH &amp; KEEPS YOUR SKIN FEELING GREAT!! FOUND THE BEST PRICE ON AMAZON, COULD NOT WAIT TO GET IT. I USE ALMAY FOUNDATION PRIMER UNDERNEATH(IT IS NOT GREASEY OR HEAVY). SMASHBOX HAS CREATED THE BEST POWDER FOUNDATION. THE COLOR IS A TRUE SHADE: NOT TO DARK OR LIGHT. IF YOU ENJOY USING POWDER INSTEAD OF LIQUID FOUNDATION, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product in medium color, as I thought that would work as my concealers are medium, but it is WAY too dark and like others have already mentioned, it really looks dirty when applied. After a week of trying to return the product and get contact with the seller, I finally contacted Amazon which helped me to file for an \\&quot;A-to-Z Guarantee claim\\&quot; - in other words, it&#x27;s a LOT of work to return the product or to even get hold of the seller (it&#x27;s literally impossible). The brush depicted on the picture is not included.</li>
