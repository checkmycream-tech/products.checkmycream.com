    <li> Eek.. it is sweet! I cannot stand lip-gloss/lipstick that has a taste to it. I was hoping for a simple lemon fragrance not sugar in my mouth! Yuk! It will go to the trash just as soon as it can! It also does not moisturize nearly as well as my other brand (Clinique lip gloss) so this is pretty useless in general. Plus really flimsy construction as well. You feel like the lipstick will fall out any moment.</li>
    <li> Expensive but really moisturizes the lips.</li>
    <li> It made my lips feel awesome. I like the lemon scent also. One of my favorite balms and great for winter and colder weather. It prevented my lips from getting chapped.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm ever. Silky smooth lemony sweet lips.</li>
    <li> I have always bought the lotion that is made by this company. I decided to give this lip balm a try since I enjoy the lotion so much. I absolutely love it, and I will buy many more in the future. It is a must have in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s like putting sweet lemonade on your lips. Guys, this will definitely make for an enjoyable kissing experience with your partner!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm out there. Tastes like lemons. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have a test sample from a gift beauty bag at a retreat and this is the best lip balm ever. It is silky smooth and very lemony but in a good, light way. It&#x27;s not sticky but has kind of a glazed feel on the lips. Totally worth the price but I decided to finish up my sample first before buying one. This is my new lip balm of choice!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used!! I keep one by my bed...one in my car...one in my purse...can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Just like a fresh lemon. The smell is amazing. The only reason it isn&#x27;t five stars is because it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Luxurious lip protection for Skiiers, Surfers and Outdoorsmen and women, this lush, lemon flavored lip balm has just the right amount of moisture for dry, chapped lips. It is colorless and protects your lips for quite a long time between applications. Great for men as well as women. Well worth the little extra you will pay to get a moisture rich balm that is so much better than the waxy stuff you get at the grocery store!</li>
    <li> Living in Florida my lips stayed chapped due to running air conditioning or heat all the time.  This balm conditions your lips not just coat them with a waxy film like chap stick.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but have to reapply often.  I&#x27;ve searched for the perfect lip balm for years.  My favorite is Mercola&#x27;s organic lip balm in lemon on his website.  It lasts longer than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Bed, Bath, and Beyond and LOVE it.  It is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps my lips silky soft, and it doesn&#x27;t feel gross on my lips. Added bonus is that it smells, and even tastes like lemon heads.</li>
    <li> I have tried every lip balm and treatment out there... many more expensive than this one.  But I always come back.... It&#x27;s got a great, light scent, it&#x27;s never waxy and works great under lipstick too.  I have finally learned my lesson and won&#x27;t waste my money on substitutes that never live up to this one.</li>
    <li> This also is recommended by Dr.Oz. I really do like this lip balm. It moisturizes my lips &amp; lasts a long time. This is a natural balm.</li>
    <li> I like the Lemon Lip Balm Stick very much.  I would buy it again. Also it came in the mail pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t locate mine for weeks, only to find out my wife STOLE it from me. She&#x27;s now making me order 6 of them. This lip balm is simply effective, and gives a pleasant feeling. Maybe sounds weird coming from a dude, but CO Bigelow&#x27;s got a hit with this one.</li>
    <li> I love the Bigelow Lemon Lip Balm! I used to use the tube version, but I like this one even better! It glides on smooth and has the same lemon scent that the other version had. Great change and option for this product.</li>
    <li> I was given a tube of this for Christmas last year and had been unable to find it in the stores in my area.... your lips feel so much better after using... I would recommend this to anyone and as long as it is available I will continue to order from amazon</li>
