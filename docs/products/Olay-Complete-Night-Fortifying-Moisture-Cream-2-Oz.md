      <li>i bought this for my wife, and she enjoyed using this.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t always find it in the store</li>

      <li>which has been my favorite brand.</li>

      <li>I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was in middle school (my mother always used them) &amp; have always been very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great item, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I tried this and love the results.  </li>
      <li>My skin absorves it really fast and smells nice!  </li>

      <li>this product is full of scent!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream!  </li>
      <li>They always put out a decent product at a good price.</li>

      <li>It has a nice, light, clean, fresh fragrant.</li>
      <li>This cream has a soft, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just ok &amp; did not see quick results</li>
      <li>Very good quality as expected from Olay.</li>
      <li>It works great for my combination skin... penetrates deeply but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>but, this lotion is definitely worth my precious time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light</li>
      <li>Olay Complete Night Fortifying Cream is incredible, I have gone through nearly 4 containers and just purchased 2 more.</li>
      <li>Light, &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34;, doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
      <li>At night after I wash my face I apply the cream, in the morning my face is smooth.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin or any kind of skin really.</li>
      <li>and it makes my face feel so smooth in the morning.</li>
      <li>Light scent that does not linger.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those moisterizers that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smooth and silky, but with some friction.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer is light, but moisturizes well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream!  Last year I was having problems with my skin- occasional blemishes, uneven tone, and dark spots where old breakouts did not heal well.  I started using this cream both as a morning and night moisturizer after my regular cleanser and within a couple weeks I could tell a difference.  Within a month my skin was smooth, even, soft, and blemish free- I&#x27;ve been using it now for close to 9 months.  It even got rid of old blemish spots I thought would never go away.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!  I have paid quite a bit more than the Amazon price at a local store but even then it was worth it.  I know I sound like a commercial but I really do love this stuff.  My ONLY wish is that they made it with SPF &#x3D; but then SPF creams never feel the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.  It works great for my combination skin... penetrates deeply but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I used it when I was pregnant and having lots of skin changes and it worked great then too.  My only complaint is that the package is kind of small, so I go through it quickly.  Great value and works just as well as products I&#x27;ve used that cost triple.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product quite as recommended, or even nearly so.  This is the face cream I use before braving the world, especially in winter when my face gets dry easily.  This stuff moisturizes while remaining entirely invisible, certainly more so than most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I use a different moisturizer which is not even made by this company.  My night moisturizer would make my face shiny.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Olay is generally a good brand. I have used this item for about three weeks now, and I can say that I like and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat of a sensitive skin (for example I cannot wear face makeup or else I will get a rash) but this stuff really helped me alot! I noticed that within one night there was a positive difference. It was not dramatic, but you could see and feel a difference. My skin was smooth and had beautiful color! My pores were not clogged...though I will admit at first I thought it might but it did not. I am for the most part confident but with the winter and becoming whiter, you kind of feel wishwashed.  I am involved in pageants and you feel the need to look great, especially after wearing all of that makeup from that night, so after just a month of using this product, I have never had my skin look so beautiful or even feel amazing in the winter or at all until now. I&#x27;m one of those women that you do not need makeup a lot, but when I do, the next day my face looks like crap! My face is dry and rashy its gross, so I started using this product and I can say that the next day after wearing this, I felt so beautiful and my skin did not look gross or rashy at all!  Yes, it has been a month and I can notice a difference. I have color to my skin, I do not have any zits (although I use Nutrogena face wash) but this is the first cream to not have me break out. I absolutely love this stuff. I will say that the morning spf 15 cream did make me break out at first, but I had to put a little bit on my face, but this night cream works amazing! Even everyone else notices a difference and I have been getting compliments of my skin.    I do workout daily and I clean my face twice a day (in the morning and before I go to bed)&lt;--- yes, I have always done this and yes I had pretty skin but until I started using this cream I have beautiful skin,no pore clogging problems, no worry if this stuff is going to feel all slimy or greasy because this product is not at all like that. You put it on your skin, smooth it around, and instantly theres no greasyness to it or anything.</li>
    <li> I use it nightly and it is a great moisturizere.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this cream, it&#x27;s not greasy. My skin seems to suck the cream right in, and in the past I did not have excessively dry skin. At night after I wash my face I apply the cream, in the morning my face is smooth. To bad it doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles completely go away. However, I would order this cream again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new night cream, so I decided to try the Complete Night Fortifying cream.  I&#x27;ve been using the night cream for the last week and I have not been disappointed. The cream is light and absorbs into the skin quickly.  There is only a very light fragrance and it smells nice.  It&#x27;s too early to determine the long term effects on my skin, but so far I have been pleased with how the cream doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on my skin like other creams.  My skin is moisturized and looks great in the morning.  If you need a basic night cream I would definitely consider Olay Night Fortifying Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to try a Olay product but did not know which line was appropriate.  I went to the Olay website and after answering a few questions, several Olay products from the Complete line were recommended.  If you are a Olay newbie like me, I would recommend checking out their website.  I was going to try a more expensive Olay line like Regenerist, but based on my needs the website recommended the lower priced Complete line.</li>
    <li> noticed no difference whatsoever after slavering this stuff on my neck and chest for a month.</li>
    <li> not bad...not as crazy about the scent, but then again, very sensitive to smells anyway.  On a scale from 1-10, I give this product 7 1/2 or 8 for being decent...they had other stuff out, that was also for night (which I used for day anyway  This stuff was the bomb...excellent scent and did really nice stuff for the skin...this product was discontinued...so when I called Olay Co. directly and asked about the other product and they said it was discontinued, they suggested this one.  I will probably use it again, after I am finished with this supply...but, if they ever come back out with the other one I was using, I will definitely go back to the other one. Basically not a bad second choice, but still prefer my first choice...when I need skin care for face, I always prefer olay products.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work with my acne-prone skin</li>
    <li> This is nothing special for me.  I much prefer the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, as it seems to tighten up my skin more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think there&#x27;s a chemical in this cream that has caused itching in my skin.  Personally, I just don&#x27;t see much of a difference, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this line again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  First time that I bought it and I will for sure buy it again! My skin absorves it really fast and smells nice!  It skin feels mousturized instantly!!  Love Olay :)</li>
    <li> Bought this because I found a good price on it on here.  Its not the normal night cream that I normally buy but I decided to give it a try.  I really love how it smells and its not too thick but just the right amount thick.  I really like how my skin has looked after using this for just a few weeks.  Next time, I&#x27;m going to buy this when I&#x27;m out of my current one.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been trying  to find a night cream for my use that can help moisturize and repairs errors that acne has left on my face without drying it out. So like most people I searched and searched on the internet and came across some potential contenders but this cream intrigued me the most. I recently started using the cream and so far I can honestly say I love  the way it feels on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t make my face too shiny even thought my skin is already oily enough on its own. It smells good too! I do however have sensitive skin, but the cream hasn&#x27;t irritated me at all. I will continue to use it and buy more if the results continue on this path. I recommend this product to those who like myself have oily and sensitive skin...give it shot!</li>
    <li> Just a warning to those of you out there with sensitive skin, do not buy this product. This was recommended to me on the olay site, even with my preferences including sensitive skin friendly products. I bought it, and the very first night I used it, my skin on my chin, cheeks and high chest area broke out in redness and itchy-ness! I quickly washed it off, and applied my usual avon moisturizing cream. There was also a sulfur, burning smell as well as a burning sensation. This product is probably awesome for those with normal skin. But it is not hypoallergenic and therefore not ideal at all for those with sensitive skin. I love their blemish cleansing wash, but just wanted to warn those who have skin like mine.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this product. I would prefer a pump because it is easier to gauge how much to use. Feels great and it doesn&#x27;t burn when applied around eye area.</li>
    <li> First off, you should understand that I have VERY sensitive skin. I have eczema and dry skin. I have tried many face moisturizers from Neutrogena to Aveeno and every other brand and off brand in between. Since I have been using this for nearly 5 months, my face has not had a single eczema breakout nor has my skin been dried out. I know that this is a night cream, but I use it twice a day in the morning and at night. My skin is so much better that I can actually use salicylic acid acne products without having my skin completely dry out. Olay Complete Night Fortifying Cream is incredible, I have gone through nearly 4 containers and just purchased 2 more. I usually order one a month. The product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or uncomfortable. I make sure to rub in the product once it is applied. And for those of you that don&#x27;t know, whenever you get your skin wet such as taking a shower or washing your face, you want to apply lotion within 3 minutes to lock in the moisture from the water (look it up if you didn&#x27;t know this). I highly recommend this product in general, and also specifically for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price. Liked it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product moisturizing my face.  It is not greasy and absorbs well.  It is nice under makeup. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I would use this product over and over.  Light scent that does not linger.  I just do not tolerate scented cosmetics.  No problem here.  Very gentle and no residue (not greasy).</li>
    <li> I guess I was looking for major improvement on my face. I have a few wrinkles are my eyes and forehead. Well as far as I can see there have been no improvement. It does make my skin feel softer though. If you want softer feeling skin. this will work. But if you are looking to reduce the appearance of fine lines, look else where.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, but Olay products have never seemed to bother my face. This lotion is no different. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft and looks healthy. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great night cream. It leaves my dry skin very soft. This product is not greasy. One of the best night creams I have every used.</li>
    <li> My skin was extremely dry over the winter, so I needed a night cream. This went on too thick for my liking and when I rubbed my face maybe 20 minutes after applying, it came off like a glue stick. Left my skin feeling greasy, and my face was still in general very dry. No thanks. I prefer the Neutrogena deep moisture night cream.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using it someone complimented me on how smooth and fresh my face looked. As my skin has never been my best feature I was chuffed. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I tried this and love the results.  It is a medium texture cream, that really sinks into your skin well.  I use it just after my bath at night and do not have the heavy oily feeling that some night creams provide.</li>
    <li> I have extremelly sensative skin and after trying a few rather costly products this seemed to work best for me.  I have no negative reactions and my skin is well moistured. After washing my face in the morning, I notice that it is still hydrated throughout the day.  It  also has a light fragance which is not over bearing, but if you want fragance free this wont work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though everyone gets different results, I would recommend trying this (a small test sight at first), especially to those with sensative skin.</li>
    <li> This night cream is just the right balance of moisturizing for me. I use it every other night and love the results-- smooth clear skin in the morning!</li>
    <li> Olay Complete has an intense perfume odor that is incredibly overwhelming, and the product burns my face when I apply it. I do not recommend this product. I am disappointed that I am not able to return it to Amazon for a refund.</li>
    <li> It does its job moisterizing, but it also leaves a slightly clogged feeling.  It&#x27;s one of those moisterizers that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smooth and silky, but with some friction.  It&#x27;s not awful, but there are other better ones out there from Olay (like the Regenerist collection).</li>
    <li> This cream has a soft, pleasant smell. It is also easy to apply and soaks right in without sitting on top of your skin and feeling heavy, my skin feels great in the morning. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My wife has skin problems from sunbathing in our youth. The performance did not live up to  the advertising.,a nd the price was high.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was in middle school (my mother always used them) &amp; have always been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> No issues, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> It felt really good on my skin but it broke me out. My mom uses it with no problem. It&#x27;s about $2  cheaper on this site than at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This works. Seriously. The wrinkles on my forehead are fading.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Finally, one that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.  It is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that consistently keeps my cheeks moisturized over dry winter nights but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  When you first apply, it feels like it will be heavy, but it completely disappears after a few moments and feels moisturizing without that plastic-y surface feeling of the Regenerist line.</li>
    <li> Wish this wasn&#x27;t discontinued by Olay</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to Love this product but after about two weeks I started breaking out which is odd because I use the daytime OLAY everyday.  I ended up giving it to a friend of mine and She loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom, she loved it. Very good quality as expected from Olay. She saw extra in her face after a week of use. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife, and she enjoyed using this. She also wanted to buy one more again as it was close to completion. Value for money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for many years.  This product has become my favorite.  Apply some at night and your skin will love it.  So very creamy yet not oily.  My skin is not extremely dry nor oily.  I plan to keep this on my shelf.</li>
    <li> I REALLY had high hopes for this cream since reading all the good reviews, so I bought it tried it &amp; after a few days&lt;br /&gt;it started to dry out my face even more! And when I 1st started using it I thought it was just ok &amp; did not see quick results&lt;br /&gt;nor did I send it back just couldn&#x27;t be bothered.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I think this was meant for super dry skin since mine isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well ya gotta try things to know if you will like them. but I think Olay products are just in general&lt;br /&gt;not good for me</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is not greasy. Feels nice on my sensitive skin. No breakouts. Will be keeping it in my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now and love it, especially for the price. It is nice and thick when going on, and has a nice subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> This Olay product covers all the expectation I had of it. The colors and quality are perfect. And I received it on time</li>
    <li> I have used this night cream for probably at least 5 years.  I don&#x27;t know why I have stayed with it this long.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything wrong, but doesn&#x27;t do anything right either. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s \\&quot;firming\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s no different really than the average hand lotion.  It moisturizes while it&#x27;s on the skin, but doesn&#x27; do anything noticably &#x27;better&#x27;. It&#x27;s thick and smells nice, but I want something that helps prevent wrinkles and keeps my skin moisturized feeling all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Con:  It makes my eyes burn~ I am slightly allergic to it.  If I put it near my eyes at all, it soaks in to my eye area and I wake up with red, burning eyes.  Time for a change.</li>
    <li> Olay is a big name so thought this would be a great product, however it just stayed on top of my skin till dry and then just rubbed/flaked  off,  bought similar product from Swan...., it absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> This lotion has worked wonders for me. I have always had acne, but I thought it was hormonal. This moisturizer is light, but moisturizes well. I have always been a Neutrogena girl, and thought Olay was for old ladies. I was WRONG. The first night I used it, I woke up with healthier skin that was bright and soft (not greasy and puffy like I was used to). This lotion has totally changed the way I approach my skin. Thank you, Olay!  UPDATE: I just finished my second jar of this product and I still love it. This product did not fully clear up my skin, as I mentioned before, but it certainly made a difference. I have changed up my skin care routine in the recent months, but I kept this product in the rotation. None of the ingredients irritate my skin and I always wake up looking very fresh faced after using this product. I would certainly recommend this moisturizer if you are looking for an affordable product to add to your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Olay night cream for years now. It works great for my skin. Keeps my skin moisturized all night long, which is a must during the winters for me. It has a nice, light, clean, fresh fragrant. Also helps that it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Another good Oil of Olay product. They always put out a decent product at a good price. Just started using this but expect&lt;br /&gt;it is good and will do the job as Oil of Olay does.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and LOVE it.  It smells nice but it is not strong or perfumey.  It just feels nice and smooth and not oily.</li>
    <li> Light, &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34;, doesn&#x27;t clog pores but I wouldn&#x27;t order again. Had a slight burning reaction and redness on my skin.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but, this lotion is definitely worth my precious time. Let me give you a little background info on my skin. I started suffering from acne at an extremely young age, around 12 I&#x27;d say plus I have extremely oily skin. Being so young I never knew how to take care of my skin properly. I struggled with acne in my high school years as well but, during my sophomore year I decided that I needed a little more moisture in my skin since all the acne products I used dried my skin out. So I randomly picked this up from Walmart. At the time I had one of the worst breakouts I had experienced in school. I used this in the morning and at night. Yes, I wore this throughout the day with my oily skin. Even though it made my skin look like an oil spill, it cleared up my skin quick. So here I am, over 6 years later and I still use this cream. Now, only at night and I&#x27;ve learned how to control my oily skin during the day with another lotion. Yes, it leaves me a little oily at night but I&#x27;m going to sleep and I&#x27;m sure my pillow doesn&#x27;t care. I love this stuff and if Olay ever discontinues it I will burst into tears. Whenever I get a breakout even now, its my go to night cream to clear it up. I love this cream and always will. I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin or any kind of skin really.</li>
    <li> This works fine for hydration, but I can&#x27;t say that I particularly like the way it smells. It also feels quite greasy to me. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really light and it makes my face feel so smooth in the morning. I have an Oily/Combination skin and it does help with the oily part and in the same time doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Not sure if it heals anything but I use it after Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - great moisturizer that feels creamy when applied but gets absorbed well with no greasy feeling. Has a nice subtle fragrance that I&#x27;ve come to associate with relaxation and bedtime. I may sound like a commercial but ... with Subscribe &amp; Save, I not only save more money but also have peace of mind that I won&#x27;t ever run out of my favorite night cream.</li>
    <li> I use this just about every night after washing my face.  It is a fine cream, nothing miraculous or out of the ordinary, but adequate for my needs.  Affordable, compared to some others.  Feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this night time moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not too thick or heavy (but not too light either) and has a very light pleasant smell.  And when I wake up in the morning my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and have for a while! I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, so now I have a subscription on Amazon to ensure I never run out again. My boyfriend loves it too! Even though we have quite different skin, this moisturizer works well for both of us and never leaves my face feeling greasy or oily. I would highly recommend this moisturizer to everyone!</li>
    <li> I am a major fan of this moisturizer, and was SO happy to see that Amazon carries it! I&#x27;d checked local stores, and nobody had it. I was starting to worry that maybe Olay had discontinued it, but here it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like fragranced products on my face, but the scent of this is VERY pleasant and clean without being sharp. I find it very soothing to apply to my face at the end of the day. It&#x27;s a very good moisturizing cream, and luckily for me, a little goes a long way! :) I apply it after washing my face, and it immediately soothes the tight, dry feeling I always seem to get. The Night Fortifying Cream also doesn&#x27;t sting my face, like some of the other creams (that contain beta hydroxy acid) do. If I had the money (and a place to store it) I would definitely stock up on this. As it is, I hope Amazon continues to carry it for a fair price! So happy to have found this favorite.</li>
    <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better moisturizer. The hydration after I put it on is better than Mary Kay or Avon. And it is a lot cheaper. You couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The thing smells like tiger balm for your mosquito bite. Once applied to your skin, it feels greasy and suffocating. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s from Olay which has been my favorite brand. I would only recommend it to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect moisturizer for those looking for something lightweight, non-greasy, and extremely moisturizing. I use it day and night. For the day time, I add a layer of sunscreen over this. For the night time, I apply a thin layer and I always wake up with glowing skin. It contain niacinamide which is an ingredient found specifically in Olay Products. Niacinamide is a vitamin that works to evens skintone, improves skin elasticity, and overall, reveal healthier, smoother skin. It has a slight fragrance that smells amazing. One container last about 3 months and the price doesn&#x27;t burn a whole in your pocket either! If you have normal-combination skin, this will be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I know alot of people write that this broke them out and I took a hit ordering this because I have &amp;#34;EXTREMELY&amp;#34; sensitive skin when I say extremely I mean the first week I landed in Afghanistan my face broke out because of the new environment. So I was worried this product would break me out but it actually is wonderful. Now I am only 25 so I am not that old yet and I was not looking for a time reverse lotion so if you are looking for a lotion to take care of wrinkles well maybe try a wrinkle specific cream this one however moisturized my face and really did give me a sort of glow the next morning. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t always find it in the store so I was very happy to find it here for a good price. It works really well for my skin, and I am not a high-maintenance girl so I need something that is effective and easy and this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> This immediately burned my skin upon application. I made my husband try it to see if it burned his skin too. He said it felt refreshing, no burning sensation for him. It went away after a few minutes so I guess I&#x27;ll see tomorrow morning how my skin looks &amp; feels. Also I&#x27;m not a big fragrance girl &amp; this product is full of scent! Yikes!</li>
    <li> I chose this particular product because I had been checking reviews.  for the price (and because I have used and liked Olay products  before),  I was interested in a complete nightly moisture cream.</li>
