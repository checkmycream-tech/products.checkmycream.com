<li> Yes, ​it cleans your teeth, but it&#x27;s annoying changing between modes.</li>

    <li> Im in love with my new toothbrush.  Works much better than my old one.  Very quiet and brushes well.  Its very compact for travelling .  The case can charged.  Im impressed.  Have not used for lo g but I ve been a Phillips product user for many many years so I expect very good results</li>
    <li> The travel case is a bit flimsy on the inside but does the job. Everything in this package is very well made. I really like the different settings on this brush and how strong the polish setting gets!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not real hot on the charging glass.  A bit bulky on my countertop.  I guess I failed to see that when researching toothbrushes.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening yet.</li>
    <li> I love Sonicare and this is a great package with the travel box and power up glass. Item arrived quickly and well packaged. My only issue is the multiple levels which I&#x27;m not sure I will use.</li>
    <li> The Ferrari of tooth brushes. I noticed a difference in the appearance of my teeth immediately. I did call to order the charging stand because I don&#x27;t want the charging glass to break. I ordered the stand for $10 at https://www.buyphilipsparts.com/model/SCRDIAMONDCLEAN/_/_/Sonicare/DIAMONDCLEAN/Sonicare_Powerup</li>
    <li> I have had other sonicare toothbrushes and this one exceeds the previous ones.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. Worth every penny! I can never go back to a regular toothbrush or even my old basic electric toothbrush.</li>

    <li> Purchased this for the wife and it was a total hit. I found myself using it too since it came with 2 brushes and enjoy it so far. I think I&#x27;ll be on the look out for the black one now.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!!! I now always look forward to brushing my teeth!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush and my teeth are feeling cleaner already.  Love the pink color as well as how it works and my gums feel better also.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Very please with the product.</li>
    <li> one of the brush is keep falling, but really good product better than other brands</li>
    <li> Love it, much quieter than my older model, with much sleeker look.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Really got rid of the plaque that accumulated on my lower front back teeth.  Does what it says that it does.  I do travel and love the case. It is hard and has a usb charger.  No need to worry about having it run out of gas on the road because any mini usb will do the job.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The toothbrush itself is very powerful and the case is elegantly designed with a port.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for years and have mostly used Oral B. My last Oral B was one of their most expensive models and after just one year the red light started flashing on the base. My dental hygienist said they always recommend Sonicare over Oral B, so instead of buying another Oral B I decided to give this one a shot and I&#x27;m really glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical about the whitening claims, but I can tell you that I saw a noticeable difference after just a week. I do whiten my teeth a couple times a year, but they were looking just a bit dingy from red wine stains before I started using this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using it now for over a month and my teeth look like I whiten them weekly. I can really tell a difference in how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth. I also like the light pink color, the charging glass, and the travel case. I highly recommend this model - worth every penny!</li>
