<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not take out my hair efficiently.  I will stick to the Braun Series 7</li>
    <li> I previously had Braun Silk-epil 7681 Wet &amp; Dry Epilator, and I have to say that this epilator is superior in every way. I love that I can use it even while I&#x27;m charging it. I couldn&#x27;t do that with the Braun. The Emjoi is for dry epillation only, but I found that the Braun didn&#x27;t work well at all in the shower, so that didn&#x27;t matter for me. There are way more tweezers in this model than in the Braun, so it works so much faster. The Emjoi AP-18R is quite a bit less expensive than the Braun Silk-spil, so this is a no-brainer to me. I would definitely repurchase the Emjoi over the Braun any day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a year, and it no longer works. I&#x27;ve maybe used it 10 times off and on. The motor in the unit seems to be on the way out. It can barely tweeze anything anymore even when plugged in. I&#x27;m looking for a new epilator, and will certainly be skipping Emjoi this time around.</li>
    <li> I have always wondered if \\&quot;real people\\&quot; write some of these reviews, well here&#x27;s my \\&quot;take\\&quot; on the Emojoi Emagine.  It totally works, just as advertised.  I have battled facial hair for years; waxing, cutting, electrolysis.  You name it.  I decided, based on reviews I read, to try this device.  It definitely exceeds my expectations.  Hair removal on your arms is really painless.  Facial hair can be a tad painful, but nothing bad; especially when you consider the end result.  You have to remember this machine is twee-zing the hair from it&#x27;s roots so, ya, you&#x27;re gonna feel it, but it totally removes the hair with very minor facial irritation.  It&#x27;s so much better than anything I have ever tried!!!!</li>
    <li> Hi.    Really wondering why nobody anywhere on the web posted anything about this epilator? There are two others just like it. The Emjoi Emagin in a red color (non-rechargeable), and the Emjoi Emagin for men in a black color. I&#x27;m sure others like me have bought this one. Are they all afraid to be open and honest to have anything to say about it except me? Well, looks like I&#x27;m the first. I hope this review will be helpful. Here goes...    They say it has 72 tweezer disks as opposed to the regular 36 or so as all the other epilators have. I looked at this epilator and tried counting the disks. I can&#x27;t imagine how there could be 72, since I&#x27;d have to rotate the heads but don&#x27;t want to since that may damage the device? There are quite a few of them though so it&#x27;s possible. Guess I should trust the manufacturer and take their word for it. I have another epilator-a Panasonic wet/dry which has a smaller head and not as many disks so that&#x27;s why I say it is possible that this epilator does have more disks than any other on the market.     Since it is said that it has 72 disks it should grab more hairs out in one swipe than other epilators is true I think. I&#x27;m not too sure about the speed being faster than other epilators because this one seems very fast and my Panasonic is also fast but maybe this one is faster? That I&#x27;m not so sure. I bought this particular one because with my Panasonic which is also very good, it just took me very long to do my whole legs and I wanted one that had a larger head and could get the job done faster. This one does that job. I could get one of my legs done in a shorter amount of time than my Panasonic. Maybe by 5 or 10 minutes of time was saved. However I do think that all epilators are pretty much the same, as that not all the hairs are grabbed and pulled out in one shot. You have to go over the same area 2 or 3 times. As all of them a few hairs are missed. I did notice one downfall on this epilator. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t really grab the shortest hairs like it is supposed to. I think because the head is curved so the tweezers are not coming in close enough contact to the skins surface. Maybe that&#x27;s why. Only sometimes this happens with me. Other times it does if I go over the hairs a few times. It is supposed to pull out hair that is 0.4 mm other than 0.5 like many other epilators. I have a hard time believing this, because of this problem I have. I think it is better for the hair to be a little bit longer.    I like one thing about this epilator of which is one other reason why I chose this one-and my Panasonic too. It has a double head. It grabs more hairs out faster by the more heads on the device. You don&#x27;t have to go over the same area too many times and the way I epilate is not like the manual and others may tell you. You should move it in a circular pattern. That really helps me alot in getting the job done much faster and more hairs are pulled out at once. With a double head you can do that easier than a single rolling head. With a single head you won&#x27;t get as many hairs out at one time. You can even flip the epilator around on the backside facing you and use it that way too. With a single roller head you can&#x27;t use it flipped on the other side like that.    Why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is rechargeable but it doesn&#x27;t stay charged for very long. My Panasonic stays charged for 30 or maybe 45 minutes at a time! I haven&#x27;t really timed it but I felt that this emjoi emagine recharges for about 20 minutes so I feel like I have to rush to get my job done-however maybe that is a good enough amount of time since this epilator is faster due to the amount of tweezers and has two heads on it. Maybe it is ok then but I do wish it went on as long a time lik my Panasonic. Oh, one other thing. If you need more time after the charge runs out, you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged into an outlet. So  Yes, you can use it with or without the cord.     Another reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is made so you can take off the epilator head and snap on the optional shaver head that is made for this epilator. This epilator does not come with the shaver head attachment. It should though. I paid $96.00 for it so they should include the shaving attachment with it in that price, right? But they don&#x27;t. There is no card or order form anywhere that should come with the appliance so if I want I can order the shaving head. The company makes you buy it separately! Every other epilator on the market comes with the extra shaving head attachement. It is always included with the price. You pay so high price so they should give it in the box! I don&#x27;t know if the red emagine that is not rechargeable has an optional shaving head attachemnt if it comes with it or not, but this rechargeable model dos not which really makes me mad. Mad also because other epilators always do and you pay alot for them also. Why there is no order form anywhere in the box? I looked up the emjoi company website and saw they only sell the replacement for the epilator head and the adapter but no where do they offer the shaving head. Why is it mentioned in the instruction manual? Maybe I have to call a number online? That I have to see.     Overall this is a good epilator. I thought about returning it due to the short hair reason because sometimes it misses the shortest hairs or maybe it is just cutting off hairs giving me a little stubble but they do grow longer so I can epilate those next time. All epilators I think do the same as to cutting off the hairs sometimes instead of pulling them. Sometimes you feel like maybe it missed a few hairs. You can just shave those off or let them grow longer and touch them up with the epilator next time. Also because it doesn&#x27;t recharge for too long as I expected-which is why I chose this one over the red one, rechargeable is always better, you do pay a little more but it is worth it when you have more freedom of not having a long cord tangling itself around you and can be quite disturbing. But all in all it does recharge so that is what matters. I am thinking maybe I keep this epilator since it does get the job done in a shorter length of time then other epilators. It is very noisy(my Panasonic is much, much quieter)like a lawn mower however but that doesn&#x27;t bother me since at least it is faster as I said. It is very good for legs and arms since those areas are flat and large. I have tried it on the underarms and face too but the head is quite large so it is a little tricky. I think you really have to raise your arm up in the air very high to make your skin flat enough for the large head to move along to get all the hair. It takes some practice and find some trick to do that, so I need to work on it more. It could be also because they designed the head in a curve so as I said it sometimes can not come in close enough contact with the skin to get the very short hairs. They say they made it curved because the contours of your body is curved but sometimes that makes it harder in smaller areas. On the face it does get the job done and it also is a little hard because the head is so large, so I need to find a way and work on that more as well. It takes some time and patience, but I&#x27;m sure with more and more practice it will work. For these smaller or trickier areas I&#x27;d rather get out my Panasonic which also has a double roller head but is smaller and works easier for the underarm and face like upper lip and chin. It doesn&#x27;t come with much. Just a clear protector cap that fits over the epilator head, a small cleaning brush, the adaptor and a very nice travel bag. Overall it is a great epilator-especially for the legs and arms-oh yea bikini are too. It did work good, but mabe an epilator with a smaller head would be easier. It depends what you feel works the best for you. It does get the job done faster.     Everyone is different so I can&#x27;t say this epilator is painless than other epilators.  I have been epilating for years so I don&#x27;t really feelany pain at all. At first I did feel alot of pain. To be honest I was in tears. It was excruciating!(forgive my spelling). But that pain does go away after maybe the 3r&#x27;d or 4th time you do it. The more you epilate the more the pain gets less and less and down to nothing. This appliance maybe faster than other epilators or has more tweezers than any other. It probably holds your skin more taught like it says it does by the gripping fingers down the middle between the two roller heads. So maybe that would make it less painful for some people. My Panasonic I feel a little pain but this Emagine I hardly feel any pain. The more you pull hairs out the more the hairs grow less, and they grow back in much slower but finer, softer and lighter in color. All hairs grow at different rates, so that is why you may also get stubble or feel some hairs you think you may have missed. You may need to (like me and maybe many others)epilate every 3 or 4 days in the beginning to do touch ups. After a while you end up epilating less often. I think that is why they say you are hair free for 4-6 weeks at a time. Not in the beginning. You will have a few hairs here and there now and then so you find yourself doing touchups. Later on you would be hair free for longer periods of time.     I sure do hope this review helps you. Sorry it is quite long but since I may be the only person who gave a review on the rechargeable emagine, I had to make it worthwhile to help others who are thinking of buying it so I had to put down everything I know. I agree it costs a lot. But it is worth it when it does recharge,(not for too long as one might expect)and gets the job done faster than other epilators, and you don&#x27;t need to shave everyday. My skin does feel smoother and softer except for a few areas of stubble.    Thank you for your time and patience in reading my long review. I really do hope this helps you find the epilator that is right for you. Good luck in your search!</li>
    <li> this is the first epilator i&#x27;ve had and i&#x27;m really pleased with it. i honestly didn&#x27;t think it was painful at first - but everyone is different. it does miss some hair but not much. i wonder if the cheaper emjois are just as good.     the battery life of mine, when charged, doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would have liked but it&#x27;s still ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to say that this is a must have on my list of beauty and skin supplies. Since it has so many tweezers it gives you a fast and less painful epilation. My legs are hair free and the hair stays pretty much gone for weeks. It holds a great charge so you can do both of your legs and maybe have some left over charge for another time or even a different area on your body. My only advice would be to get waxed first then use a epilator to keep the legs hair free. It&#x27;s much easier that way.  I can say bye bye to waxing cost now since this little thing has replace that cost of beauty.</li>
    <li> Does not take thin hair need to go over the same spot. Still leaves a lot of hair. Most of the time just brakes them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a epliator but this one exceeds expectations, it takes a fourth of the time as my old one to do my legs . Thanks saves so much time .</li>
    <li> This product is \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  I purchased to replace my Epilady Discreete because I wanted to cover more area at once.  It works alright but not as efficient as I expected.  It is fairly loud and sounds a bit \\&quot;mechanical\\&quot;.  Head is a little bulky but that is because of the dual heads.  It takes the hair away but I do need to make a couple passes.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or anything and I LOVE the cordless feature while also being able to plug in if it gets low - no re-charging time issue.</li>
    <li> It works great but the pain is a little shocking at first. It was well worth the money and the pain because a week later my armpits still feel smooth! Next I&#x27;m moving on to my legs. Please note exfoliating before hand is important. I did one side w/o exfoliating and it was more uncomfortable/ painful than the side I exfoliated.</li>
    <li> I have owned an Optima epilator  [[ASIN:B00008K4UA Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator]] for 6-7 years, and when the rotating head died (I think),  I debated buying a replacement head (about $20).  Instead I bought this rechargeable Emagine because it was the latest and greatest.  Big waste of money.  It isn&#x27;t any better than the Optima -- and actually I think it is worse.  It seems to take about 25%&#x3D;30% longer to do my legs now.  Believe me, there are things I&#x27;d rather do than spend an extra 20 minutes ripping hair out of my legs.  I wish I could return it.  The one thing I like is that is rechargeable, which basically means you can use it released from its charging wire.  The comfy spot where you want to do your epilating (with a sheet/towel under you) is not necessarily within wire-length distance from the outlet.  Plus, I guess it is a little easier to hold than the Optima, but that isn&#x27;t major.  However, I do recommend the opposing tweezer heads of the Optima or the Emagine over a regular epilator setup.  It does go faster with more tweezers -- important if you are covering a lot of ground.  If you are new to epilating, don&#x27;t be scared by the initial pain.  Your skin (and nervous system) quickly adjust, and it is not any more painful than tweezing your eyebrows.  I always cut myself shaving, which hurts a lot more and longer than this tweezer-sensation.  And the fact that the results last 3-4 weeks instead of 3-4 days is a big, big plus.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  Works like expected!</li>
    <li> I use this for my face, armpits and legs. It works wonderfully! I&#x27;m noticing the hair regrowth is lighter and finer. Hopefully soon nonexistent!</li>
    <li> Awesome epilator!! Sooo much easier than shaving every day, use the epilator every couple of weeks,  Emjoi is the absolute best!</li>
    <li> Legs were painless, but did require going over a few times and slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Bikini was painful at first (I didn&#x27;t wax prior), but the outcome is much better than shaving and it&#x27;s still great a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it because no mess (compared to waxing), don&#x27;t have to buy expensive razor replacements (like with shaving), and don&#x27;t have to do as often as shaving.</li>
    <li> It works perfect. All the hair is removed and they take much longer to grow as they are removed from roots.</li>
    <li> Less painful than I thought. Nice epilator, it works fast and well. I bought it after comparing lots of them and this had the best reviews. So far after a few months it looks like a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago after comparing five or so epilators that had mostly favorable reviews. I love it! That being said, I also had a very high pain threshold and bought this primarily to maintain my \\&quot;landing strip\\&quot; but also use it on my legs and armpits. It doesn&#x27;t take all the hair on the first pass, but it does a great job as long as you stop to clean the head regularly. With the opposing heads it&#x27;s very important to make sure all areas you use it on have the skin taut or I think there could be injuries. DO NOT put deodorant on after using this on your armpits! I read that in a review and still forgot one day and OUCH! Overall I would say it&#x27;s more than worth the price and I have personally recommended it to several of my friends. Good luck and happy hair removal all!</li>
    <li> I adore this epilator! It&#x27;s quick, convenient and the purple color is gorgeous. I also love that you can use it with or without the cord! If you are considering..buy it! I got used to the pain after about 5 minutes and went to town on my legs and bikini area!</li>
    <li> This product is very good. i bought it for my daughter and she is very pleased with it. She plays a lot of sports so she frequently needs to use it for under arms and this product is perfect for it. I would recommand this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> You get ingrown hair, red bumps, and you have to use it every day. waste of time and money... don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> This a great little machine. It does what I bought it for. Yes, it hurts. That usually means it&#x27;s getting the job done. It is very important to read and remember the directions from the user manual FIRST. The Emagine has all these cool features, just enough to rise above the competition then all these tweezers, dual head and cord less efficiency is powered by a plastic gear. I like it but don&#x27;t think the price is justified after taking a closer look.</li>
    <li> Problems for years with \\&quot;mustache\\&quot;.  This device has eliminated depilatory creams every few days!  Great on legs, too.   Would recommend.  There is some mild pain involved the first few times, but then you get used to it...not a problem or deterrent to purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Awful product, it rips the hair out.  VERY PAINFUL!!!  I could not use this on my face (which is what I wanted it for). It is painful to use on legs, underarms, and face.  VERY, VERY PAINFUL. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I had stopped thinking about buying an epilator after I bought a Braun and felt that it was worst buy of my life as it was a big flop on my skin and thick body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought emjoi on my friends recommendation. As she bought the Gold-Plated model 3 yrs back and she was admiring it way too much(i thought so!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had given up tring epilation but after her story of success I thought I will give a try to this one. I have been waxing for 15 yrs now. Its messsand costly but works. When I tried Ejoi-72 head model, I must tell you, this is best. It removes hair in minutes. I have thick hair and sensitive/dry skin. I just applied a sorbolene moisturiser afterwords. Even underarms was fun.I tried on chin area, its awesome. It feels ticklish. I have just done it once. But over a period of time, I am sure it will get better and better. I feel every woman on earth who can afford it must buy it. MUST HAVE FOR YOUR EVERYDAY USE, HAIRFREE DAYS everyday....wow! I love my EMJOI....its worth it and a reward for money I paid!</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator and it didn&#x27;t work from day 1. It appeared as though the emjoi unit never charged once I had followed the initial charging instructions. Even when plugged into the power at the wall, the tweezer discs spin for about 10 seconds and then it dies. Worst purchase I have ever made!! After contacting Amazon and informing them of the faulty epilator, it was going to cost me $90 to send the item back with no promise of a full refund. After spending $130 on this item, its not worth paying postage fees this high if no refund wound be given or if a replacement was sent, the epilator would have cost me $220 in the end after all the hassle. I am now stuck with a brand new item, fully packaged that doesn&#x27;t work!! So disappointed and will never buy from Amazon AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators on my face for about 8 years now.  I&#x27;m 35, oily, acne prone, sensitive, and I take spironolactone and nicamide orally to control my hormonal acne, which works great.  I also use tazorac at night and duac in the morning.  In addition, I use sea buckthorn oil as a spot/healing treatment, as well as tamanu and emu oils. A hell of a lot of research, trial and error, doctors, naturopaths, time, money, tears, and etc went into that treatment plan, believe me.  Anyway, I&#x27;m a bit OCD and a perfectionist, so I cannot stand even the slightest fuzz on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried and returned many epilators over the years, and the best for me was the Emjoi Optima.  I&#x27;ve had two of them.  When my last one wore out, I thought i&#x27;d try this new Emagine.  It is a little different than my trusty Optima because of the shape.  It felt like it didn&#x27;t get as close as the optima. After close inspection and after using it several times ( I use it every 4 or 5 days on my chin and lower cheeks), I realized it gets every bit as close as my optima did.  The shape is just different, and the device feels like it&#x27;s not pressing as close to my skin. The tweezers, however, are. They do get as close as the Optima. I really like it, and I would buy again.  Is it better than the optima? I&#x27;m not sure. But it certainly is just as good.  I&#x27;d buy it again, over the optima, if that tells you anything.  However, if you have a working Optima, dont think you are missing out on something way better. Use your Optima until it wears out, and then buy the Emagine.  I bought the rechargable one just because it is purple, lol.  I never use that feature, though.</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator for a few months. I would say it works great. I have used a single epilator for years and This is definitely faster. Do realize any epilator will cause some pain especially since you are pulling out hairs.  I do wish it was water proof so it could go into the shower with me.</li>
    <li> sometimes the tiny forks miss hairs, but the product works, though it seems my hair grows back sooner than six weeks but maybe thats just my body.  Otherwise, I love it.  quick easy hair removal with a little sting.  I can enjoy smoothe skin where I had problems areas before.  Had mine four months now and still working fine.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading many great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It probably works great for some people, but just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an Asian female, for your reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs under my knees, I have coarse hair that had just grown to be optimal epilating length, about 1/16&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many ways, angles/directions/speed, but 20 passes would leave half my leg hair undisturbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work on longer hair, but as I have black hair on fair skin, I would not want to let hair grow that long before epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finer, longer hair on my arms, and it worked ok there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I inspected and studied the head, it seemed to me, that the part where the tweezers open and close were too recessed by the plastic comb, to be able to reach and grab hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it right away, as it did not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator primarily for my arm pit and bikini area epilation. I opted for this particular model since it was possible to also operate it cordless, because some of the reviewers of the other 72-tweezer discs rechargeable AP-18 Emjoi emagine (for women) had mentioned they found their corded model sometimes cumbersome with the cord getting in the way.     The box contains an epilator, instruction booklet, power adapter, cleaning brush and travel pouch.     Pros:   easy to clean   has dual speed control   can be used cord or cordless   removes hair from the root leaving the area smooth     Cons:   very noisy when in use   rather expensive   often have to go over the area more than once to remove all the hairs   the optional shaving head not included   currently the replacement epilating head only available on the manufacturer&#x27;s website       If you are a first time epilator user who does not have a high pain tolerance threshold, I would suggest the following to make your experience as painless as possible:     1. follow the manual&#x27;s recommended procedure of taking a warm shower &amp; exfoliating the area you are planning to epilate, so that the pores are opened, making the hairs easier to epilate   2. cut the hairs down on the area to be epilated to about 1/4\\&quot; if the hairs are longer   3. consider waxing the first time around and use the epilator to epilate the newly emerging hairs going forward.     I was a first time epilator user and had also never gotten a waxing so I was was quite unprepared for the level of pain I experienced using the epilator for the first time on my armpits. Let no one misguide you, the pain is really intense if you are one of those persons (like myself) who have a lot of hair growth to depilate. My initial use was after shaving my underarms 2 weeks previously, and I waited until then, to allow the hairs enough time to grow back so that the epilator would have hairs long enough to grab on to. I did follow the recommended instructions of having a warm shower and exfoliating before attempting to use it however it was rather tough going even though I had the epilator plugged in to electricity to make sure the motor was going at full strength. I have coarse underarm hair and the pain was unbearable so I gave up after about 10 minutes of trying unsuccessfully to completely shave 1 armpit. I tried again 2 days later, again making sure I exfoliated and had a warm shower. This time around, things went a lot smoother (but just as painful) probably since I was getting the hang of using it but I did get a few nicks which were bleeding but by the time I reached my 2nd armpit, I was a pro and did not experience any other nicks. After this initial depilation, the prick like sensations that most of the other reviewers were warning as the expected outcome were a reality for me, largely because there were fewer hairs each time to depilate.     I have used it on my bikini area since then and though it took longer than I had foreseen, it did a superb job of epilating the hair. It is crucial afterwards to keep the area moisturized for the next several days, especially if you are prone to ingrown hairs (like myself).       IMPORTANT NOTE: The instruction booklet that comes with this epilator does not recommend this epilator for persons with very sensitive skin, or those who are suffering from eczema, psoriasis and other similar skin disorders. I have rather sensitive skin and suffer from eczema however. prior to purchase, I was unaware of this manufacturer recommendation</li>
    <li> I have been using the Emjoi Emagine epilator for a little over 3 months now.  It is an excellent product!  My old epilator (not an Emjoi) would sometimes grab the skin and cut it.  The Emjoi glides smoothly over the skin and stops if pressed too hard.  There&#x27;s no pinching, and no bleeding.  I could never stand using my former epilator on my legs, but this one goes so fast with all of the tweezers that I am able to bear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  Yes, the first few times it is quite painful.  But, if you can endure the first 2-3 times, it becomes less painful.  It&#x27;s just a matter of sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the cordless feature very much since I found it runs out of steam pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this purchase, I have bought the Emjoi Dolphin for upper lip epilation.  Emjoi makes superior epilators.</li>
    <li> I too had nubs when I first used it. Since I must be part werewolf, I decided to try a different way of removing hair. I would do the tradition motion of sweeping from ankle to knee. I also added knee to ankle, and calf to shin, then shin to calf. Since hair grows all different ways, it worked great. Keep in mind, hair has to be a certain length for the tweezers to catch hold. I&#x27;ve used it about a week, and it gets better with each use.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend epilation, therefore I recommend this Epilator, as being the best.  I have been doing epilation for five years now, and realize that the Emjoi&#x27;s are the best.  I have had three different epilators.  Two of them Emjoi&#x27;s.  Once you become used to epilation, you go for the bigger epilators; the ones that go faster; and have more &#x27;winding teeth&#x27;; they don&#x27;t lose their power;  and they do the job neatly, and quickly.</li>
    <li> more uncomfortable than I thought.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected!!!! It is so worth it I love it!! It does pinch a little but I definitely recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very efficient and seems sturdy. Hurts no worse than waxing and a lot less messy. Cost effective too when you factor in buying wax or going out to have it done. Definitely take a hot bath to loosen pores, and if it&#x27;s your first time or it&#x27;s been a while, some ibuprofen. Works super though!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have shave as often like I did with traditional razors.  I like that it can be used with or without the cord.</li>
    <li> It works as described.  The unit itself is great, BUT it IS MISSING the shaving attachment. I had read a review before ordering and thought to myself, so that is just that one person...NOT.  Even the packaging inside says there should be a shaving attachment and the manual tells you how to use the missing attachment, yet it isn&#x27;t in the box.  Are they taking it out of the box before shipping????</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a year.  You cannot complain about a product that works! Anyone who is on the fence...should buy this.  It is better than any other epilator I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators 25+ years, so I&#x27;ve had a bit of experience.  The first one was a vibrating spring and it HURT!. I did only 1/4 of my leg per day.  After you have used one a while, the experience is different, so don&#x27;t despair.  It does take a few uses to remove all the hair. After that, the hairs grow in at different rates, so a touch-up is all you need. When I used to shave, I had to do it every day.  My daughters finally decided to try mine and both loved it. I bought them each one for this Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this model  for two reasons:  the double row of tweezers and the cordless use.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the head is too big to work well on my knees.  Using on the underarms doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I have never tried the bikini area because I haven&#x27;t worn a swimsuit in years. I even used it on my chin until I bought one made for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained about the price. It is high, but if you compare, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad.  Too bad I can&#x27;t give it a 4 1/2.</li>
    <li> worked good at first, but broke really soon after i got it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair (Italian heritage), everywhere, legs, arms, head... At age 50 I&#x27;ve become so tired of waxing my arms and shaving my entire legs every single day.  When I began having terrible irritations all over my legs starting about 4pm every day I had to try to figure out what it was. At first I thought, allergic reaction to soap, or detergent, bug bites... it went on for almost a year.  Then I finally figured out it was due to the hairs on my legs regrowing from the morning shave.  I decided to try an epilator to see if it would help, and IT DID!  Because of the nature of my heritage, I still have to use it more often than most, about every 3-5 days, but it still beats daily shaving.  And it takes me a while since it&#x27;s both legs (about an hour). But I will never go back to daily shaving.  I will say that after a year of using it, this particular unit is getting a bit overheated, but I would expect that since it&#x27;s gets so much use.  I know a lot of people complain about it sometimes not catching the hairs, issues with irritation and ingrown hairs. But frankly that&#x27;s not he products fault.  First, hair grows in all different stages and different directions. And if you&#x27;re pulling the hair out at the roots it&#x27;s going to potentially create problems with ingrown hairs occasionally, I just keep a tweezers beside me to get those out if I need to and it doesn&#x27;t happen very often, and of course there&#x27;s going to be irritation, but frankly that happens with a razor too.  I will say that the initial first use is somewhat painful. With the amount of hair I have it felt like knives tearing through my skin.  BUT, once that initial first step was over, there&#x27;s only tiny pinching, very tolerable.  YES, I would recommend it and YES I plan to purchase another one when this one goes on me.</li>
    <li> I used for 4 months before discontinuing use. I noticed I was getting lots of ingrown hairs and when I would try to remove the hairs using a tweezers I ended up with marks.</li>
    <li> It does not work well at all in the bikini and underarms area.  I had to go over so many times that my skin was all irritated and burning.</li>
    <li> This tool is not picking up my mustache and chin whiskers much to my dismay in spite of following all the explicit warning and information.</li>
    <li> I epilate pretty often and have been used several Braun epilators for years. This time I thought I&#x27;d &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; and try the Emjoi after hearing great things from friends. I am very, very disappointed. It just doesn&#x27;t pick up anything! I don&#x27;t know if I received a dud or what but it just seems to take forever if it picks up anything at all. I&#x27;ll have to run it over my legs a few times and it might pick up 20% of whatever was in its path. With my Braun, it would only take me a few minutes to do my legs but the Emjoi is just extremely frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and just lost out on $100. :(</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this.  I started off using a smaller epilator and very quickly realized that it takes way too long.  Upgraded to this one and I highly, highly recommend it.  It goes much faster with this one and I find that it captures a lot more hair with each pass.  Hurts the first time, but after that it gets 100% easier.</li>
    <li> First time to use an epilator and this was a great one because of the different speed options. I wish it could grasp the shorter hairs better, but I also have fine hair so that could just be the problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased another small one for the face, which was great, but wanted a more heavy duty one.  While this one can be used on the face, it&#x27;s more for &amp;#34;individual hairs&amp;#34; on the face as opposed to doing your whole lip or chin, which the small one is meant for.  It&#x27;s still quite good.  For any other part of the body, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Hair free and living it. Works well.</li>
    <li> This is a powerhouse of a little machine.  I have lots of facial hair and this takes care of the problem.</li>
    <li> When I got this, I had some trepidation about it being painful, so I started out with my legs. I don&#x27;t know what kind of pain threshold other people have, but this didn&#x27;t hurt at all. It wasn&#x27;t even uncomfortable. I then moved on to my underarms with a little fear knowing this area is more sensitive. Still nothing! No pain, no discomfort! It was great at removing the hair...for the first day. The second day I started noticing long scratches up and down my legs. Looking more closely at my leg while using the device, I was able to see that it was being caused on one particular side of the tweezer head. After examining it, I could see that the casing around the tweezer heads, which has a seam down each side, and is supposed to be flush, is uneven on one side, creating a rough edge that is scratching me. This is a HUGE disappointment, because otherwise, the thing works great. Now it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
    <li> Would think the more tweezers, the better hair removal. I&#x27;m giving a few more trials before deciding if waste money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this epilator and sent it to my aunt who was visiting the U.S  so she could bring it back for me. i love the fact that she received it right on time. &#x27;m rating this a 3 Star because i am yet to use this epilator. The charger stopped immediately i plugged it to charge. i was told by my brother who checked the charger voltage that its not for Nigeria current cos it higher than that of the U.S. I guess i should ve checked or plugged it into a stepdown before charging. now i have to search for a charger that will fit this epilator  till i order an international charger for it. if u are outside the U.S please order the international charging cord along with this epilator because i checked out their site and they have an international charger available for when you are outside the U.S i know &#x27;ll be doing that.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to worry bout the battery being exhausted. so you don&#x27;t rush the epilating process.. you can actually BREATHE.. gather some more courage and then screammmm..just kidding... that&#x27;s for beginners by the way!! I have been epilating for a while ...READ 3+ YEARS.. and I used the pnasonic wet and dry epilator. I still have that but the battery barely gave me 20 mins which will just do my 1 arm and it was super slowww[...] this is FAST.. I can do both my legs in less than half the time ...usually 15 mins and my arms in just 10 mins ..BOTH MY ARMS.. armpits now take barely 5 mins and I do them without looking in the mirror... you really don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot more than 3-4 times and it basically propels itself forward. did I mention how FASTTTTT it was? and now for the cons..luckily I have not experienced any &amp;#34;gear&amp;#34; problems.. or motor problems but there&#x27;s a plastic gear which might wear down in 5 -10 years time.. I am not bothered about this right now although as compared to Panasonic this DOESNT seem very sturdy and I am afraid it MIGHT break if I dropped it - it is made of PLASTIC!! ALSO, since it is to be used on dry skin ONLY, you cannot carry it in the shower with you- it would not work for a long time without a cord (which is a plus as well)! The cord is LONG though so no problem hooking and using it! I am glad I purchased it and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and it no longer works. I did not even get to use it all that much either! It gets stuck and won&#x27;t spin anymore, even if I just turn it on without putting it next to skin. I have cleaned it thoroughly but it will only work for a minute and then mess up again (plugged in or cordless). I am really disappointed because I paid so much for this epilator thinking it would be better because it was more expensive. I will not be buying another Emoji that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have just spent $20 on a replacement head for my yellow Emjoi epilator... it is way more effective at removing my hair quickly. This product seems to not pull all the hairs from the root, and a lot of the hairs break at the surface. You have to go over the same spot a sometimes a dozen times to get a couple missed hairs. I took off the grey cover to expose more of the tweezers and it works at removing hair way better that way. Forget about it being cordless... it slows down and runs out power so quickly...for me, it takes about 5 to 10 minutes to remove all of the hair on ONE leg from the knee down ... but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m anal and very meticulous to get every little hair? With my old yellow Emjoi, it took about 10 minutes for BOTH legs from the knee down. My favorite part of this epilator is that it is purple? Hahaha</li>
    <li> After 12 years it was time to put the old epilator to bed and find a new one!  This one is fantastic - the dual heads make epilating so much faster and virtually painless!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!!</li>
    <li> Great product if you are new to epilation.  It is pretty gentle at removing the hairs. I bought it to replace my Emjoi Optima.....which I loved...because of the cordless option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do quite a good of a job as the Optima.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once &amp; so far I like it. I&#x27;ve used others &amp; I barely felt it working but it was. The only thing that I wish it had was a light so I can see better for the underarms. Otherwise, I would give it a 5</li>
    <li> I had one before and liked it, but the head stopped working.  I ordered a new one of the same model and it seems to work even better and faster than the first one when it was new.  I like everything about it except the motor does not sound smooth.</li>
    <li> It hurts but effective even on lady parts-  once you get over some in grown hairs- skin is smooth like butter</li>
    <li> This is my first time epilating. I have never done anything besides shave with a razor. I have very thick dark hair that grows long fast. This epilator took care of it all! For below the knees it stings for a tiny bit but then just feels nice, like itching a mosquito bite you&#x27;ve been trying not to itch. Above the knee is a whole other story, boy does that burn! But still is nicely smooth after. It obviously probably hurt more then it would if I had shaved before, but I was to excited to wait. All in all I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> this product did not have the power and do as good of a job as i expected. it is EXTREMELY loud. wish i had bought the other one i was thinking about.</li>
    <li> First, I just want to thank this company for their awesome customer service. I emailed them and got a prompt response and my questions/issue was taken care of immediately. The epilator itself is pretty darn amazing. It works just as advertised (it IS a modern day torture device) and my underarms have never been happier. I follow the cleaning instructions and haven&#x27;t had any issues. Great product! I will say it probably have been better to get a wax first and just use the epilator for upkeep. I didn&#x27;t, and only sheer willpower got me through that first session, the pain was a 7- 8 on a scale of 1-10 for me. After the first time I&#x27;ve been using it about once per week and the pain is about a 1-2.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 or 6 weeks and according to what I&#x27;ve read about epilation the time between sessions should spread out more and more over time.</li>
    <li> Top of the line product is easy to use with great results - especially value the fact it is rechargeable!</li>
    <li> I got this epilator as a gift because of the raving reviews and how well it compared to Braun, and since I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for many years now, I figured I had to have it and see how it compares, being that my Braun gave in after 6 wonderful years.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the Emjoi.  Braun epilators can do better than this epilator in all aspects:&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi is large and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Hard or impossible  to reach in smaller areas (lip)&lt;br /&gt;Multiple, multiple passes on the same area to completely remove all the hairs.  (I don&#x27;t understand why with the 2 rows of tweezers...)&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi does not have a light like some Braun models to help you in seeing better those tinier hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to Braun shortly.  I cannot return this one because the date has passed to return it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, the wife absolutely loves it - If momma is happy then everybody is happy - why wait, get it for her and start reaping the benny&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have owned an Emjoi Epilator before and was hoping the new one would be a lot better.  It was not!  Did not remove the hair very well and caused bumps under the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Emjoi Epilators for 10 or more years.  With this dual head you can cover a greater area so there is less time involved.  Very good product that I would recommend to all women.</li>
    <li> After using I could not believe how smooth my legs were.  It will be so nice not to have shave again and as often.</li>
    <li> Just received today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try.  It is fabulous!!!  Did my arms, legs and face.  Face hurt a little as others have said, but not the legs or arms.  Worth the money! No more nicks on ankles.  Hurray!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have used a number of epilators.  This one took half the time of any other I used. There was less pain, and in some areas where the skin is more sensitive, there wasn&#x27;t the irritation I had with previous epilators.  All in all, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all. I had to go over the same area way to many times.</li>
    <li> The hair has to be much longer than I want it to be for the epilator to remove the hair and I have to make several passes over the area to remove most of the hair.</li>
    <li> Best investment thus far. First time ever using an epilator. It was very painful at first, but each time you use it there is less hair &amp; less pain.Trust me it&#x27;s worth the pain. I use mine once a month under my arms &amp; bikini area. My underarms are not as dark &amp; there is no shaving bumps on my bikini area.</li>
    <li> I just love it!! Im so glad I purchased it. It saves a lot of time and effort. I would recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this thing!  Great product, great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this epilator for 3 years now.  It is still working like a champ, pulling out hair and keeping it away for weeks.  I can&#x27;t say that there is no pain involved, but the pain is minimal, and you get used to this particular brand of pain.  Plus, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I have thick dark hair and was using a Braun that I had had for years when I decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one thinking it would be much faster. It was definitely faster and hurt MUCH less the first few times I used it. But my legs were getting more and more stubbly every time I would use it. Turns out I could spend an hour doing both legs and they still wouldn&#x27;t be smooth when I was done. Even worse, my legs felt like I didn&#x27;t do anything at all to them by the next day! It was only breaking the hairs instead of actually pulling them out! Waste of money this is!</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I dropped the first one a few too many times and broke it, but loved it so much I had to replace it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but after two weeks on blades I noticed signs of rust and when i wanted to return it i never got respond!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good just not this version. If you barely have hair or you&#x27;re short this one could work for you but it&#x27;s much better to get the corded version. This one after a while it doesn&#x27;t work as fast as it used to. For me 30 minutes isn&#x27;t enough so I&#x27;ve been using it plugged it but I think doing that has messed it up. It&#x27;s too slow now so I&#x27;ll have to purchase another one but this time not cordless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in April 2014, so I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. I bought it to replace my Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator Xpressive Pro, Orange/Copper which cost only $79 and change at the time. It is now $115. I loved the Braun epilator, but it was no longer holding much of a charge. Unlike this unit the Braun cannot be used with the charger plugged in. I paid $95 for the Emjoi. It is only $59 now! Though I still like the Braun a little bit more than the Emjoi because it required less time to use as it is a more efficient epilator I recommend this one. It is worth a little extra time to spend slightly more than half the cost of the Braun. Also the fact that it can be used with the charger plugged in is a great advantage. I suspect that the Braun did not allow use while plugged in because it was a wet/dry product. In other words you could use it while bathing. I never found this to be advantageous. Quite the opposite. I find it is much more efficient to use while your skin is dry. Since it takes time to wait for a recharge if it dies half way through I prefer the Emjoi&#x27;s ability to be used while plugged in. I do no find it painful to epilate with either product, but some people do. When I purchased the Braun I had read a number of reviews that had said it would be very painful. That&#x27;s true of all the epilators I researched. Perhaps I just have a higher than normal threshold for pain. I&#x27;ve been told that by doctors after all, but I do not find epilating painful. Keep your skin taut while using any epilator, especially when doing your underarms, to avoid catching skin. Catching skin IS painful, for anyone. However, if you are careful this will not be a problem. At the current price this product is a fantastic bargain! I hate shaving. I&#x27;ve been waxed and tried waxing myself. Waxing is just too messy. Even having it done professionally leaves some wax on the skin where they miss during clean up. I&#x27;ve used the epilator everywhere. It is much more efficient.If you pay to be waxed, this will pay for itself in a use or two. You can still get your upper lip waxed as that is not very expensive and this epilator is not meant for facial use. I still use it for my upper lip, but I do not recommend it. It is quite easy to get your actual lip caught. I don&#x27;t have much hair there. In fact I didn&#x27;t have any visible hair on my upper lip until I was approaching 40. Now I have a little bit and have become adept enough with the Emjoi to catch it all without injuring myself, but it&#x27;s not easy so consider yourself warned! For all places below the neck I highly recommend the Emjoi. It is more than worth the price and considerably cheaper than equivalent products. Buy one before the price goes back up, and still consider it even if it the price does increase. It is a worthy product after all.</li>
    <li> The product is functional but extremely loud, the tone resembles the sound of a lawnmower. There is absolutely no chance of being able to discreetly use this apparatus as it is loud enough to wake the dead!</li>
    <li> First, I was unaware that it is not meant for facial unless handled in a special way.  Secondly, it does not remove facial hair.  I tried different angles using only one side as required, but was barely able to tell it had been used.  I followed all directions and expected this product would replace waxing.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Painful and did not work on my legs at all.  I would not recommend.  Too bad I really hoped it would work.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for me and hurts</li>
    <li> This is my first and I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better. It does hurt at first, but similar to tweezing eyebrows. I am not real patient so I do one leg one day and the other the next. It can be time consuming to get a really good job for those of us picky people.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because it has more tweetzers than the the last two epiladys that I owned. If you are like me, and you use your epiladys to do your whole legs, armpits, etc you should cosider investing in this product. It saves me so much time!!! This machine is super fast, less painful and does an amazing job. The fact that it is cordless is a puls, but If you want to save a couple of dollars I am sure the non cordless (red one) works just as well. I am very happy with this product!!! I would highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before, but I have to say that once you get over the intimidation factor and the first few attempts, this product is very useful. I REALLY appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used an epilator before...&lt;br /&gt;1. Be prepared for pain in the beginning (which is due to pulling the hair from the root)... after taking a hot shower and drying off very well, I highly recommend turning on some music or TV to provide some distraction... also remind yourself &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; and that this is only temporary.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you can do it every single day for a week, you will notice that by the 3rd or 4th day, the pain will start to decrease. Then move it to every other day for the following week, etc (I found this useful).&lt;br /&gt;*Tip- if you have ever waxed in the past, the pain should be less (depending on how often you did this)&lt;br /&gt;3. Start to enjoy the benefits! It&#x27;s SO nice not having to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FYI- there are a few hairs in a couple of spots (i.e. shins) that are more difficult to epilate, but if you consistently go over the area and pull the skin in different directions, you can get those spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m mostly giving it 4 stars because of the great customer service. The product came on time AND I also recieved a free upgrade! The product work just fine... the only problem is that it doesnt grab all the hair. I was expecting to use it in my arms underarms legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;I first did my legs, it took maybe about and hour to do booth legs. I notice that it doesn&#x27;t work with fine hair. My lower legs feels smooth, but in my upper legs it just brakes the hair. Same thing with my arms, it wont grab the hair from the root. With my underarms and bikini line it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;So i will not recommend this if you have thin body hair. In the other hand, if you have thick body hair it will be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;Other thing i want to mention is that the epilator is really noisy., and the cordless function is useless because it just lasts 1/2 an hour.</li>
    <li> this epilator is one of the best I have used and does what it claims it will do with pain or scarring.</li>
    <li> We have a single head and the small battery powered Emjoi epilator already, and this is an addition that was well worth it.  The dual heads make it go so much faster, and you don&#x27;t have to be quite as precise.  Super effective.  Really doesn&#x27;t hurt much on the legs, of course it can be painful on more sensitive skin (inner thighs, backs of knees and thighs, etc.), but this is the best of the ones we have.  The small one is nice for smaller areas, like the face, but of the two larger ones, this is definitely my favorite.  Spend the extra money to get the dual head and save yourself a lot of time actually using it.  Once you use it the first time, it takes the hairs it removed a long time to grow back, so it makes it faster just doing maintenance as the new hairs grow in.  Does well on fine hairs as well as coarse.  Great quality, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Yes, it covers more area faster but I prefer the smaller, less pricey Emjoi model (it&#x27;s pink) for smaller areas.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several different models of Emjoi epilators through the years and can say that this is the best one yet!  The dual opposed tweezers make epilation fast and painless.  You don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same area thereby irritating your skin.  The ability to use it cordless gives you flexibility and makes it convinient for travel.  As a bonus you dont get tangled in the cord :-).  For anyone who has never epilated at home here are a few pointers.  First and foremost take a couple of tylenol the first few times.  As the hair get sparse and fine it stops hurting and the results are worth it.  I have dark hair and after 10 years epilate every 8 weeks or so and it is pain free.  I use a light dusting of baby powder so that the epliator glides smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.  After I let the epilator run for a few seconds to let any powder that stuck to it fall off and then remove the head and wash it with soap and water and let it dry overnight.</li>
    <li> I bought the corded Emagine for myself and the Cordless for my niece.  I think either way, the product is excellent and does the job right the first time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase.  Less shaving and less \\&quot;shade\\&quot; in the underarm area because the hair is being pulled out at the root.  I know some are concerned of the pain. Let me tell you, the sound when you turn it on, is more intimidating than the pain itself.  On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the most painful, I rate it a 2-2.5(if that) and it lessens with each use if you maintain the area because there will be less hair to epilate!  It&#x27;s a piece of cake ;)  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~By the way I&#x27;m an African-American woman and after researching, decided upon this particular brand for better results regarding the \\&quot;thick\\&quot; of our hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried other epilators but this is the best.. Little painful initially but second time onwards no pain. Very smooth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work all that great.  Some people said it hurt a lot which I didn&#x27;t find to be an issue.  It was just a lot of work for little return.</li>
    <li> can someone that uses this epilator tell me how well it works? i want one with a double head like this and more tweezers but ive seen how others have commented and complained for so long about how the epilator&#x27;s gears mess up for after so long or one of the little teeth break off then all the rest do and i want an eplilator thats of good quality and will last a long time. so which should i go for?Emjoi, Philips, Panasonic, or Braun? and i want one with the most tweezers on it like 40 tweezers or above and i wont take less than 36.</li>
    <li> I am replacing a Emjoi product that I&#x27;ve had for over 7 years that finally stopped working.  I like the double heads and it is more efficient at getting the stray hairs.  I would like the battery to last a bit longer, but it is not inconvenient to use plugged in.  I feel that the pain level is much better than the older versions and did not have any discomfort.</li>
    <li> best purchase ever! I use this pretty much everyday. I got one for my sister she loves it too. Nice to have it</li>
    <li> This is the best product in the market&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny fast very little discomfort&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very much</li>
    <li> The Most Comfortable Epilator available! I have been epilating since the early 90&#x27;s and this is by far the most comfortable epilator I have used. For the first time ever, I was able to epilate my underarm hair! No Pain! (it got a little uncomfortable, but no pain!) Even other tender areas were much easier to epilate with the Emjoi AP-18R. I have to use it less and less since the hair does not grow back as fast as it did using other epilators. Worth the investment. You can use is cordless or plugged in. This will save you time compared to other epilators. Better than shaving and easier than waxing. Try it and you will truly fall in love!</li>
    <li> My other Emjoi&#x27;s were the comma shaped Caress ones, but thought I&#x27;d try this one.  It does do a superior first pass, but if you want to save money, buy the Caress type, which only has to have a second pass &amp;#34;sometimes.&amp;#34;  And I find the Caress fits my upper lip easier.  Still I love this one as well. For those who say it doesn&#x27;t get much or any hair...you are probably holding it at too much of an angle. The little tweezers close tightest  at the TOP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pain, you get over it after a few uses, as it then becomes only a slight discomfort. Why?  Because the hair begins to die out as the follicles become damaged from tweezing. Look at your eyebrows, I bet you don&#x27;t have to remove as much hair as you did when you first began tweezing. Yes, there is some regrowth,  but it&#x27;s fewer and finer hairs.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t even see the regrowth until you really look, because it becomes so fine. And no more scratchy feeling stubble to annoy you (or your partner, LOL ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real bonus is NO HARSH STUBBLE.  The hair that does grow back is baby fine, and soft to the touch. And you don&#x27;t have to do this but every few weeks.  NO MORE AFTERNOON STUBBLE! . I suggest, when you begin, do it more often, so there are only a few hairs to remove at any one time, thus, you only notice a slight discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT:  Before your very first use, make sure you have shaved (or trimmed as in the bikini area) the hair a couple of days prior.  This gives you very short hair to begin removing. If you try this on long hair it will hurt like heck!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it a lot.  She had the corded version before and enjoyed it for years.  We upgraded her to the cordless version for Mother&#x27;s Day LOL</li>
    <li> I have tried electrolysis, salon waxing, tweezing, home waxing with Nads strips, and of course shaving for many decades. This product is FAR preferable to any of the other options, in my opinion (except electrolysis which is permanent even though it&#x27;s only pragmatic on small areas due to the high cost). To me, this epilator tingles and does not hurt like waxing or tweezing. I have not used other epilators so I cannot compare but I was pleasantly surprised that this one does not hurt much on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving makes my sensitive legs have redness, hives, excema and extreme itching-- it&#x27;s hideous!  So that&#x27;s why I regret that I didn&#x27;t try epilating earlier!! I had read that others got red bumps from epilating but I did not, thankfully. And boy was I surprised, since I get hives and itching just from shaving!!! However, please note that when I epilate bikini line and armpits with this product, I do get the red bumps but they went away within a couple hours-- and thankfully, they did not itch but were just sensitive and felt \\&quot;hot\\&quot; for a little while.  I appied Aveena lotion and they were back to normal within a couple hours. With that said, the results are GREAT-- very smooth bikini and armpits once the redness goes away- I am thrilled! I had been seriously considering expensive laser treatments for these areas but now I will not bother. This is SOO much cheaper and less scary than laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark hair on pale skin, so it typically shows if it&#x27;s grown in 48 hours after shaving.  Now, do my epilated legs feel as smooth as freshly shaved legs? No. Epilating and waxing always seems to leave some of the shortest hairs behind-- for me, at least. But  with this epilator, me legs LOOK smooth for daaaaaays.  The regrowth is soft rather than prickly so I don&#x27;t mind that its there. And since shaving irritates my legs very badly, I much prefer the temporary tingling/spark sensation of epilating over the ongoing itchy discomfort that shaving creates for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I do not press hard when I epilate but I go over some areas 5,6,7, times.  I wonder if maybe some people get more irritation because they press too hard and force the tweezers too close to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try this on my face. Working up the courage for that. I will post an update if I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, I think the purple is more pretty in person than it looks in the photo-- it&#x27;s slightly sparkly (like how the red, corded version looks). Amazon should consider updating the photo for this one-- I DO recommend paying a bit more for the cordless version. It&#x27;s nice that you can use it with the cord or without.</li>
    <li> Its no different than shaving except it hurts more . The hair grows just as fast .Too  big to use on your lip or eyebrows</li>
    <li> Having never used an epilator before, I was nervous about whether I would be able to tolerate the pain that would likely come from using this product.  Surprisingly, it was not as painful as I imagined, in fact it was very tolerable.  I use it on my legs and arms and only have a few sensitive areas that are uncomfortable.  The first time doing your legs does take quite some time and it the most painful, but again, the pain is VERY tolerable.  I use regularly about every 10-14 days just to catch any strays that may happen to grow out.  I am completely satisfied with not having to shave my legs anymore!!! I&#x27;m hooked, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one - mostly due to the # of tweezer heads, and the technology to  help avoid ingrown hairs.  The reviews on Amazon were extremely helpful to me in making my decision.</li>
    <li> I have been epilating for over 2 years. I have thick dark hair that grows fast. I used to be a daily shaver, because I had to. Previously I had the Braun Epi 7. Which I thought worked ok. But I was still using it at least twice a week. and left many hairs behind. It also was very time consuming. The Braun burned out and I decided to try this one. Hands down this is the one you want. Works great, fast and does not leave little hairs behind. This unit actually tweezes more hairs instead of breaking them off like other models I&#x27;ve tried. And wait there&#x27;s more....this unit is actually is virtually painless in comparison to other models. I even did the bikini line with very little discomfort. My prior Braun I wouldn&#x27;t even think of using near that area. This unit won&#x27;t disappoint. This unit is more powerful to run the dual heads. So if you are a first timer you really want to start with this one.</li>
    <li> This worked amazingly.  Is such a good product that my daughter stole it from me and now I have to buy another.  Would have liked the price to be a little less but I&#x27;ve been using these items for years and it&#x27;s well worth the money.  I found this particular Epilator to work well in sensitive spots and was less painful than the other ones I&#x27;ve been using.  I will say if you can deal with the initial discomfort, it&#x27;s well worth the use - I go months before I have to shave again after using it for a few months.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  is better and faster than my previous epilator. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product was easy to use and pulling of the hair was not too painful, I do threading on my face so using this was not too bad. It only took about 10 minutes to remove hair from both underarms.Made my underarms really smooth, not all the hair was removed but only some small hairs remained however still satisfied with the end result.</li>
    <li> If only it didn&#x27;t hurt like hell to use this would be the perfect product for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I was actually looking into getting the No No when I came across this Emjoi and I decided on the Emjoi. I&#x27;m a first time user and yes, it does hurt a little bit when you first use it. After the 4th or 5th time, it&#x27;s a breeze. I have a Chewbacca kind of body, so hair removal is a must. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms. Hooray, I look like a girl now! Why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine now for about six months and I use it once every two to three days to get rid of a few stubbles. My hair grows quickly (never on my head but everywhere else), so I probably use it more often than others. I&#x27;ve also used it to shave off my two inch sideburns. Wow, what a difference that makes! I&#x27;m still jittery when it comes to my mustache though. As for the land down under, I haven&#x27;t ventured too far down, but it does a great job trimming the edges. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that once my hair is pulled, it would never grow back. Not the case here, but I deal with a lot less hair for sure. I just touch up and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> This is a great product the hair is gone for days....the only thing is it hurts like HELL lol but it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have used depilators for the last 25 years and have seen a lot of improvements since the days were wax was the only option.  Starting with the Epilady, etc.  So I was hoping that the dual blade 72 tweezer Emjoi would offer some new advances in the world of epilation.  I was quite disappointed, it was not a clean sweep, I had to go over and over the area repeatedly.  It took longer than the Braun 7 I was replacing it with.  It was numbing, to a point where I didn&#x27;t really feel it taking any hair out, which it did, so perhaps this would be a good first step into the world of epilation?  Don&#x27;t know.  I just wanted something quick that did the job. After 25 years of epilation you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to begin with, the hair is very fine and almost unnoticeable, but it still needs to be removed.  Another negative is the amount of vibration your hand receives while using this appliance,  I have carpal tunnel syndrome and this machine made my hands go numb with in ten minutes.  Bummer!  Was really hoping for it to live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Love that it is rechargeable and holds the charge as promised. Dual head works very well.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had the Emagine that only worked when plugged in, and loved it.  My mother needed a new epilator, so I gave her that one so that I could get this one with the cordless operation.  It works while plugged in, and just as well when not.  I like to be in a bright sunny spot if possible, so I can see those tiny hairs even better.  Now my use is not restricted to a plug proximity.  I use this on my legs, and just started on my underarms.  It was really painful to do my underarms the first couple times, but now I just touch up every couple days, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I like the Emagine because it will even get really short hair, keeping a nice smooth surface!!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and removes same length hairs as the Braun.  A little noisier, but not bad at all.  And you can use it while it&#x27;s charging-which you can&#x27;t do with the Braun.  Good value for price.</li>
    <li> Great in shaving legs, under arms, chin ..... bikini line .... Stunts the growth ..... It is awesome.  Pinches slightly ... but no big deal for the good results !!!!</li>
    <li> I tried with longer hair, shorter hair, with moisturizer, without moisturizer, at different speeds,and at different angles on my chin. It didn&#x27;t remove the hairs. But it did break the skin. I finally returned it. Its back to depilatories and the waxing salon for me. Let&#x27;s here it for Amazon&#x27;s return policy!</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for 20 years and thought that using this would be easy and relatively pain free.  Not the case.  It was excruciating and did not remove the hairs without redoing, which is explicitly warned against in the instructions.  You have to be extremely careful in order to not catch your skin, which is difficult because the dual heads move very quickly.  I would not recommend this for novices.  If you have experience and like epilators, this may work for you.  I haven&#x27;t used one since they first came out years ago and disliked this one just as much.  Back to waxing I go.</li>
    <li> Significantly improved product from what it was a few years ago. Its cordless feature is more useful and handy to use.</li>
    <li> Have had a Braun- Silk Epil for many years that I loved. The Emjoi Emagine manages to get more of the shorter hairs and lasts longer. I also like the wireless feature allowing me to use it where the light is best. It&#x27;s nice to have a travel bag to keep it in. It cost twice as much as I paid for the Braun, but the additional money is worth it for the wireless feature and getting a better longer lasting job.</li>
    <li> The epilator I ordered was new and arrived on time. I had no issues with the order or seller. In my opinion, the Emjoi Emagine is better than shaving and faster than waxing. The only thing that disappointed me was that the Emjoi Emagine breaks some hairs off without pulling them out all the way. I noticed that I have some ingrown hairs eventhough I exfoliated before epilating. Other than that, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 3 days in a row and while I must admit, it did take out some hairs, my legs are still not as smooth as they are after I shave. The first day I spent 3 hours on my legs, the second day I spent an hour and a half, and today I spent an hour. My legs are no where near smooth and hairless. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong! I followed the instructions: bathed in warm water, exfoliated, circular motions... I&#x27;ve decided to wait it out another week or so before I make my final judgement on the product but I must ask, is there any advice anyone can give me to get my legs smooth?</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product as a first time epilator user. I have waxed in the past, and I tolerated the pain. So I thought why not give this a try..Instead of paying all the time for waxing professionally because the at home kits really never worked well!  Well I love the results. I read some reviews that the process was painful, and sometimes long and tedious.  I will agree it was painful at the start  but once my adrenaline started the pain started to dull out. I really recommend the cordless feature and it really kept it&#x27;s charge during my entire upper thighs. It is a noisy devise but I really have nothing to compare it too, as I said my first time using one. The epilator runs smooth over your body never pinched my skin or felt any vibrations in my hand while holding it for at least 30 minutes at a time. I do not reccomend using this and wearing anything that reveal your freshly epilated areas, as the process leaves you will tiny red dots for about 24 hours just as waxing does. (for me any ways I have somewhat sensitive skin and am considered a \\&quot;whity\\&quot; lol!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased a cheaper model that turned out not to be cordless, but I am very happy with this purchase. It was more expensive, but it exceeded my expectations. 30 more tweezers than the previous model and its much quieter (for an epilator) and takes much less time. convenient travel pouch and wide brush to clean heads is a plus.</li>
    <li> I ordered this it took about 9 days to receive it. I have used it about 3 times so far. So I can&#x27;t say for sure if its going to make my legs hairless. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all. Although I.have used epilators in the past. I had an epilady I bought from sharper image it came in a really really nice case. But it was lost when I moved. So I have not used an epilator in over a year and a half! So when I got my new epilator I was a little worried it would hurt but it didn&#x27;t at all. Except the bikini area it hurts a little so if u have a husband that can help u keep the skin pulled tight while you epilate it helps a lot and hurts much less! :) the more you use it the less hair grows back and the hair that does grow back is so much softer and lighter! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. The only disappointing thing was it does not come in a nice case. It has a cheap ugly white plastic bag/pouch that they send with it for you to keep it in. It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t make a nice matching case to keep the epilator in. But that was the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> Not my first one of these...I LOVE IT!!! My life is so much easier now and I only have to use it like 1x every 6 weeks!! :)</li>
    <li> It works great so far! One thing I have noticed is that I do have to plug it in after 1 or 2 times of use but other than that I haven&#x27;t seen any red flags with this product yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this online and had to buy a $40 adapter before I could use it! So I may as well bought it at a shop here.</li>
    <li> I have owned an emjoi epilator (EMJ AP-96) previously. I had that epilator for many years (6 i think) before it finally burnt out. I LOVED that thing! My legs would stay smooth for weeks! So when I began my search for another epilator I was excited to see this bigger version, thinking it would be even quicker to get the hair removal. Although this does remove some hair, as other reviewers have mentioned, it breaks alot of the hair as well. so it is too short to epilate. Also, I have been getting way more ingrown hairs. It works okay. I will keep it for now. But honestly, I may look into getting the smaller version I had before. That thing was the best!</li>
    <li> About 13 years ago I purchased an epilator, it was also an emjoi but had fewer gold plated tweezers. It hurt...badly and was promptly returned to the store. In the meantime I shaved or used creams to remove hair, which is tedious, messy, smelly and expensive. After reading numerous articles and reviews I concluded that no matter what brand or type epilating is going to hurt. I figured if it&#x27;s gonna hurt let&#x27;s get it over with, hence my decision to buy this model with its 72 tweezers.  After much child like anticipation I received it today. I didn&#x27;t bother charging it, just skimmed over the manual and plugged it in. Being that my underarms are most sensitive I went for them first. I braced myself and and put it to my left pit....and nothing. No pain whatsoever, just the sensation of the hair being pulled. It took all of 30 seconds to get it done and it is super smooth....impressive. I went on to finish my other armpit and legs with zero discomfort. Took about 30 minutes all told. I noticed it had trouble with a few flat lying hairs but other than that it did great. I would love to give it 5 stars but it did miss a couple of hairs so it&#x27;s not perfect. But I love it and my smooth skin. I also let my 13 year old daughter try it and it didn&#x27;t hurt her either (now she wants one). We have an average amount of rather coarse hair just so you have a point of reference. No pain...totally surprised.</li>
