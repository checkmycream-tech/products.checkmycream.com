    <li> Great Product! Does what it says and does not weight hair down at all!  CRUELTY FREE- NO ANIMAL TESTING OR I WOULD NOT BUY IT :)</li>
    <li> I have gone through my fair share of hair serums, but Gloss and Toss is the first one I have developed a long term relationship with!  The lightweight serum smooths frizz without weighing down hair or making it appear greasy.  And the best part -- if you do happen to use too much of the gloss, it is easily brushed out!</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found for smoothing gray hair.  And it is unscented!</li>
    <li> It made my hair very soft and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Just a little dab smooths out my hair and adds lots of shine.  Friends noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> Just okay product.  Did not improve the shine in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does work well do thin out other hair products like pastes/balms as it does not have a greasy quality to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of shine enhancement products from cheap drugstore items to more expensive private products.  None perform as well as Gloss &amp; Toss. Plus, as an additional benefit, this is a product that was NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stick straight, fine hair that is colored. It gets dull easily and most products weigh it down.  This is the first shine product that I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t give me the greaasies and cause my hair to look like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a month.  I&#x27;ve received compliments from a lot of friends about how healthy my hair looks and even my hairdresser commented about it when I went in for my appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloss &amp; Toss isn&#x27;t as inexpensive as the drugstore products, but it performs much better and one needs very little of the product to obtain results.  This bottle should last at least 9 months to a year.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have ever used. You could put a lot on and your hair never feels greasy. I use it with my hair extensions and it keeps them soft and frizz free. It just absorbs instantly.  Never heavy. No fragrance.</li>
    <li> This serum is weightless and leaves the hair feeling soft and shiny! I love that it&#x27;s versatile, works great on wet hair before you blow-dry to help eliminate frizz, and on dry hair to smooth out the ends. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair nice and shiny.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff. This seller shipped super fast too. Love</li>
    <li> Awful stuf....not worth it.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair with this product. My hair is fine and straight and since I am allergic to fragrance, I was very interested in trying this product.  I tried putting in on the ends of my hair when it was wet and also when it was dry (like the directions suggested), but saw no difference in my hair as compared to without the product either way.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be the same or similar as other hair serums I have used that are less expensive.  Cost of this product is too high for the value.</li>
    <li> Great and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Billy&#x27;s salon to try out and just love it. Perfect for my life style..... I just wash, dry and go. I don&#x27;t style much. This product is great for throwing in my hair to calm down frizz and give it extra shine without putting much work into it. I also love that it is such a natural product!</li>
    <li> LOVE this animal cruelty-free product! I live in GA - the humidity plus damage from color and heat styling takes a toll on my hair. I apply Gloss and Toss after blow drying and before curling/flat ironing and it helps calm the frizzies and adds shine (I also apply between shampoos if my hair gets a bit frizzy during the night). I really like that it has no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with any perfumes I might wear. The texture is great and does not make my hands feel greasy after applying it. Will definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products that promise silky shiny hair that isn&#x27;t weighed down only to be disappointed time after time until now. Gloss and toss is the best product ever hands down. I find myself taking it to the hairdresser&#x27;s with me and having her use only it in my hair. She was like wow no frizz and its so shiny and soft. I love running my fingers through my hair spray free hair and not have it get greasy or flat time after time thank you thank you thank you oh and I posted it on facebook and already several of my friends have thanked me and ordered it too</li>
    <li> I have chemical sensitivity syndrome and have been in search of an unscented hair serum since I had to stop using the major ones on the market  because of their chemicals and smell. I read the reviews carefully then purchased the gloss and toss. I cannot believe everything I read is absolutely true! it is not greasy, leaves hair shiny and most of all there&#x27;s absolutely no fragrance whatsoever. It is absolutely amazing !  I just hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I love toss and glos!I used it for the first time the other day and fell In LOVE. It left mine and my daughters hair nice and smooth.i was surprised how fast it works, especially with my damaged bleached hair.definately would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Just 2 drops works so well on frizz and for shine, and my hair is several inches past my shoulders. Best of all, it&#x27;s #LeapingBunny certified...cruelty free!</li>
