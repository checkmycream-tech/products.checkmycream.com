      <li>WELL PLEASED !</li>
      <li>hair feels amazingly silky now.</li>
      <li>Nice quality, shipped well.  </li>
      <li>top of the after shower spray, I put a couple of drops in my shampoo and conditioner just for good measure.</li>
      <li>Very strong, as it should be.</li>
      <li>The scents are excellent and the size options make it easy since I like to use them more for my own blends and only use a bit at a time.</li>
      <li>I make a huge bottle of it and use it as needed!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look and</li>
      <li>Love this oil - one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Im sure i&#x27;ll find a better use for it.</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I really like the Aura Cacia brand and think it is a great value.</li>
      <li>So excited to start using my Rosemary!</li>
      <li>Great product, delivered super fast!</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it very quickly as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-The reason for 5 stars: I absolutely LOVE the fact that it helps my dreams become more lucid and vivid.</li>
      <li>and I get such a pleasant sleep.</li>
      <li>I was what I expected and worked great</li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;d definitely say the Rosemary is a good idea if you want fuller, softer head of hair.</li>
      <li>FAST delivery of a reliably fine product.</li>
      <li>smell is ok, slower delivery than expected, ok price</li>
      <li>Rosemary is a fresh smell, shouldn&#x27;t be pungent</li>
      <li>and they shipped right away.</li>
      <li>She was right.</li>
      <li>It is a very strong smelling oil, and it should be mixed with a carrier oil like jojoba.</li>
      <li>When I place 6 drops to the specified amount of water listed in the diffuser guidelines, the aroma is quite strong at first and then seems to completely be undetectable after about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This works and smells exactly like the brand name type but at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>I use Grape Seed Oil because it&#x27;s light, and I read it also helps with hair loss and keeps hair soft moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this essential oil!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite brands of essential oils.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I put too much in my shampoo and couldn&#x27;t stop sneezing for like 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>On top of this, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of recent shedding, so I did what any normal person would do and went straight to Google.</li>
      <li>I did some research and came up with my own little after shower hair loss spray</li>
      <li>how fast it&#x27;s made it grow</li>
      <li>packaging, fast shipping,</li>
      <li>But i guess is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Just be careful not to use too much in the shower, or you&#x27;ll have a sneezing fit</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been much longer than a month, but I got completely sidetracked.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it&#x27;s helping with filling in my bald spot, but the way my hair feels and the major cut back in shedding worth alone is worth</li>
      <li>I use this along with several other essential oils to make my own home made &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to waft under my nose when I get my frequent headaches.  </li>
      <li>I have only just begun using it, so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it works.</li>
      <li>The oils are fresh, uncut and pure.  </li>

    <li> This came on time. Good package. Good fragrance. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  Very potent.  Affordable alternative to expensive MML oils.  I use this as a mental &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; in the afternoon, as well as massage into my scalp for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Love this oil - one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The seller shipped it very quickly as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using lavender and eucalyptus essential oils in a diffuser. When I place 6 drops to the specified amount of water listed in the diffuser guidelines, the aroma is quite strong at first and then seems to completely be undetectable after about 30 minutes. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> The order delivered on time and it was just as described. So excited to start using my Rosemary!</li>
    <li> Nice quality, shipped well.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks so bad.. But i guess is the real deal. I bought it to use ut diluted on other oil for puffy eye bags, it dont do much for my eye bags, and even deluted it stinks like strong bitter herbs. Im sure i&#x27;ll find a better use for it.</li>
    <li> Rosemary is very nice.</li>
    <li> My niece had lice, and my mother suggested rosemary oil. She said the bugs hate the stuff. She was right. I had my niece mix a few drops in with her shampoo, and I was able to watch the nasty little buggers run off her to get away from it. I now use the oil to give my hair a shine, and a great scent. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Oil was leaking when recd.</li>
    <li> great quality! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good Quality. Would Purchase Again From This Seller.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I have used this manufacturer before and will continure to use them.  The oils are fresh, uncut and pure.  Perfect for my inhalants, rubs and bath fuzzys.  They were shipped on the given date and packaged appropiately.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered super fast!</li>
    <li> received timely and intact</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> Smelled spoiled, like a few other oils I have ordered off the internet. Rosemary is a fresh smell, shouldn&#x27;t be pungent</li>
    <li> This here is a great oil.</li>
    <li> Due to an accident, I have a small bald spot that feels like it&#x27;s never going to grow back in. On top of this, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of recent shedding, so I did what any normal person would do and went straight to Google. I did some research and came up with my own little after shower hair loss spray and it works like a friggin charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the after shower spray, I put a couple of drops in my shampoo and conditioner just for good measure. I actually hate the smell though. The first time I used it, I put too much in my shampoo and couldn&#x27;t stop sneezing for like 3 minutes. The good thing is, the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long if you use it with a base oil. I use Grape Seed Oil because it&#x27;s light, and I read it also helps with hair loss and keeps hair soft moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels amazingly silky now. I went from shedding like a friggin Maine Coon, to losing only one or two hairs a day. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it&#x27;s helping with filling in my bald spot, but the way my hair feels and the major cut back in shedding worth alone is worth the continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a month or two and say if I&#x27;ve noticed any growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been much longer than a month, but I got completely sidetracked. Anywho, the Rosemary sadly didn&#x27;t do much for my bald patch, but it has however stopped my excessive shedding and now my hair is a lot fuller than it was. I added caster oil to the mix and I can finally see my patch filling in (woohoo!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d definitely say the Rosemary is a good idea if you want fuller, softer head of hair. Just be careful not to use too much in the shower, or you&#x27;ll have a sneezing fit like I did and you&#x27;ll have people knocking on your bathroom door asking if you&#x27;re alright.</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil! I use it with my carrier oil for scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and it was improved my hair tremendusly! I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look and how fast it&#x27;s made it grow</li>
    <li> it is what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> smell is ok, slower delivery than expected, ok price</li>
    <li> I love this brand. The scents are excellent and the size options make it easy since I like to use them more for my own blends and only use a bit at a time. This rosemary is a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Can&#x27;t wait to improve my memory!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil indeed. Very strong, as it should be. Invigorating, makes me wake up and start breathing deep.I&#x27;ll be adding it to my body lotion, in my linen, and occasionally a drop or two on my sleeve, so that it refreshes me during my day. I&#x27;ll try also adding it to my witch-hazel tonic, for rosemary is so good for regulating and reviving oily skin.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive the package on time. Also the quality of the product is very good</li>
    <li> I was what I expected and worked great</li>
    <li> A small health shop used to carry this item and I would get it every chance I had. Though, sadly, the shop closed and I was anxious to find this brand again, luckily amazon carries it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick benefits as to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Helped with scalp health which led my hair to grow longer and leave a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;-Added concentration / as a pick-me-up&lt;br /&gt;-The reason for 5 stars: I absolutely LOVE the fact that it helps my dreams become more lucid and vivid. I usually add some on my forehead, temples, and under my nose before bed and I get such a pleasant sleep. (It doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on everybody).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good packaging, fast shipping, and I even think they have their products organically made now. Aura Cacia all the way &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works great in my chapstick</li>
    <li> I bought this to waft under my nose when I get my frequent headaches.  It helps and I do not have to take medicines as often.  Good product</li>
    <li> I use this along with several other essential oils to make my own home made &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34;.  This works and smells exactly like the brand name type but at a fraction of the cost.  I make a huge bottle of it and use it as needed!  I really like the Aura Cacia brand and think it is a great value.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in a facial moisturizer, soothing and stimulating!</li>
    <li> Beautiful oil, great smell, very pure.</li>
    <li> Authentic and great smelling oil. I use it as a scalp treatment combined with other oils.</li>
    <li> FAST delivery of a reliably fine product. WELL PLEASED !</li>
    <li> I read on line that this is a good oil to use for hair loss. I have only just begun using it, so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it works. It is a very strong smelling oil, and it should be mixed with a carrier oil like jojoba.</li>
