      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product,</li>

      <li>The KM hair stay give me true body!</li>
      <li>The fun part about it is that it crackles,like a skillet of fajitas when you put it in your palm, and as you work it around you hand, the crackling stops and the product becomes more pliable.</li>
      <li>Or I have combed my hair out into a smooth style and it stays smooth.  </li>
      <li>What is the most wonderful attribute of this product is the second day if you just wet your hands and run them through your hair</li>
      <li>FUN-</li>
      <li>This is the best kept secret for hair care.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun product and works wonders.</li>
      <li>I think the noise it makes and the crackle is kind of gimmicky, and make sure you don&#x27;t spray it out too fast.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed that it completely took away the frizz and actually looked pretty good</li>
      <li>this stuff does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>I is the static I am experiencing - though it doesn&#x27;t last (the static)&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>

      <li>I originally got this as a &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; at BB.....and was surprised how much I like it.  </li>
      <li>When I purchased this product the stylist warned me that she had a client return it because it made too much noise and sprayed all over her bathroom???&lt;br</li>

      <li>This product really works and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair product.  </li>
      <li>The cost, however, is rather high</li>
      <li>this product highly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving three stars because it does make your hair look good and full, but I&#x27;m wondering what the chemicals in that crazy crackle stuff does to your scalp over time.  </li>
      <li>Especially in this hot humid weather, I could not do without it.</li>
      <li>Put on hair fresh from the shower before applying styling gel, and my fine lifeless hair becomes manageable and has staying power that I&#x27;ve not experienced with styling gel alone.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>when I use this I do not need to use anyother uplifting product in my hair and it leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really enigmatic stuff, but it works wonder.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser had used this on my hair and it has helped so much with my fine, limp and flat hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair prone to frizz, and one day after swim practice I was running late and decided to use this as my product and leave with wet hair.  </li>

<li> This product really helps my rather thin hair to behave and keep a style.  </li>
<li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
<li> The only thing is it does make your hair feel stiff and dry, but with a little hair shine product</li>
<li> This is a critical step in making my limp and lifeless hair stand to attention!</li>
<li> only negative</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s from this product hurting my scalp follicles, but this is the one thing that is different in past few months.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The product says to spray down into palm of hand and allow to crackle and expand....</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my colored hair everyday-</li>
<li> I have very thin hair.  </li>
<li> I either got a faulty can or this product is awful.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars because it does make your hair look good and full, but I&#x27;m wondering what the chemicals in that crazy crackle stuff does to your scalp over time.  All of a sudden I am finding hair coming out in the shower at an alarming rate.  I can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s from this product hurting my scalp follicles, but this is the one thing that is different in past few months.  I&#x27;m going to stop using it and see if the hair loss continues.  Will give an update in maybe six months - don&#x27;t want to pan the product if it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for super fine hair.  The product provides fullness and lift! I use it with Goldwell Double Boost Rootlift Spray and Goldwell Style Sign Texture Unlimitor 4 Wax Spray.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product the stylist warned me that she had a client return it because it made too much noise and sprayed all over her bathroom???&lt;br /&gt;The product says to spray down into palm of hand and allow to crackle and expand....&lt;br /&gt;This is FUN- Oh it does make some noise and it expands but then you rub your hands togther to disperse in your hair, I follow up with my styling mousse and then blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I is the static I am experiencing - though it doesn&#x27;t last (the static)&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my style for over two days- I don&#x27;t like to wash my colored hair everyday- so this perfect&lt;br /&gt;I am on week three and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product,when I use this I do not need to use anyother uplifting product in my hair and it leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had used this on my hair and it has helped so much with my fine, limp and flat hair.  It gives me body and fullness.  Especially in this hot humid weather, I could not do without it.</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and I use this on every single short haired client. It gives great volume and they love to watch it crackle. It&#x27;s a fun product and works wonders. To reactivate it after the hair is dry, I squirt water on my hands and finish styling the hair how I desire and it works great. Sometimes I notice it leaves a little white residue but not every time only as the product sits for a while without use. Overall I love this and so do all my clients.</li>
    <li> I either got a faulty can or this product is awful.  Its supposed to come out like mousse I think.  But this spits out gross flat white dust and bubbles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before - gives a lot of body + the price was good!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair product.  I have very fine thin hair.  The KM hair stay give me true body!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year. I have very thin hair.  It makes you hair look and feel fuller. Awesome stuff. Much cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it gives my hair body !!</li>
    <li> Really is great for fine hair.  Adds volume</li>
    <li> This is a critical step in making my limp and lifeless hair stand to attention! Put on hair fresh from the shower before applying styling gel, and my fine lifeless hair becomes manageable and has staying power that I&#x27;ve not experienced with styling gel alone. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fine hair.  This gives my hair a texture it doesn&#x27;t have with mousse alone, which is also the KSM brand.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  If you have thinning hair this is the product for you.  The only thing is it does make your hair feel stiff and dry, but with a little hair shine product it&#x27;ll be okay.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It&#x27;s perfect for my hair.  My style holds throughout the day.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair product for about a yesr. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best kept secret for hair care.  After washing hair you shake the container and spray in your hand and a crackling foam comes out.  You rub your palms together until foam has changed into liquid.  Rub in your hair.  It will dry and keep your style in place.  I have naturally curly hair so I just put in hair after washing and I have curls.  Or I have combed my hair out into a smooth style and it stays smooth.  What is the most wonderful attribute of this product is the second day if you just wet your hands and run them through your hair you can start all over styling without having to wash your hair again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for lifting and giving your hair body! It smells amazing as well. The fun part about it is that it crackles,like a skillet of fajitas when you put it in your palm, and as you work it around you hand, the crackling stops and the product becomes more pliable. It&#x27;s really enigmatic stuff, but it works wonder. I will be recommending this to everyone and using it from here on out.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my rather thin hair to behave and keep a style.  The cost, however, is rather high so I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  It is interesting to use what with the popping and crackling when it comes out of the container, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all.</li>
    <li> This product really works and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> this stuff does exactly what it says.  it gives my hair great staying power and body.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My style stays for a long time  it makes my hair do &amp;#34;what I want it to do&amp;#34;.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; at BB.....and was surprised how much I like it.  I have fine, curly hair prone to frizz, and one day after swim practice I was running late and decided to use this as my product and leave with wet hair.  I was amazed that it completely took away the frizz and actually looked pretty good given I didn&#x27;t fix my hair.  I know you&#x27;re supposed to use it prior to your product and I&#x27;m sure that is great but honestly I use is as my hair product.  I think the noise it makes and the crackle is kind of gimmicky, and make sure you don&#x27;t spray it out too fast.  but overall I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the product.</li>
