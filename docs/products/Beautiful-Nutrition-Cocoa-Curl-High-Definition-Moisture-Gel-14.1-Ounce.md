      <li>On wet hair I&#x27;ve gotten great definition and my hair is has a stretched out pattern compared to just using eco(which I still love).</li>

      <li>Used Cocoa Curl for the first time since receiving it.  </li>

      <li>The cost on Amazon is higher than what we got it at the hair store</li>
      <li>Great for my naturally curly hair, it gives my hair hold without being crunchy and stiff.</li>
      <li>I use it for my twists or braid outs after deep conditioning and it gives me great definition and a softness that I have not found with any other product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other similar products and this one works best for me.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair very moisturized and  shiny.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for several months now and it has not disappointed one time.</li>
      <li>I was too excited to try the product to send it back, so i just kept it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>$9.99 + shipping and handling is high.</li>
      <li>so it really defines your natural curl pattern.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it restored her hair to healthy curls, rather than a dried out puff.  </li>
      <li>However, it can be found cheaper at your local beauty supply store, but it&#x27;s also a rare find and is not located everywhere.</li>
      <li>i didnt need much a small amount goes a long way, which is good because when I opened my package the top was off the jar, and about half was spilled all inside the box.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is not like a typical gel, it feels like yogurt, not the greek kind, and it has a lot of slip.</li>
      <li>But when my son tried it, his hair looked the way it did when he was 3 years old!  </li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>CC keeps my curls soft for days.</li>
      <li>My hair stays as styled which is comb out and do its natural response.</li>

      <li>this stuff makes my hair so soft and supple and the curl definition is on point.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>The only reason this received one star is because the shipping was fast, but that is a given with Amazon prime.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried it both ways, with water first or dry</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft and moist (not wet) .  </li>
      <li>Normally around $6.99 (In local Stores).</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for this gel when my local BSS ran out.</li>
      <li>I wish I had found this before I decided to go back to permed after being natural for 3 years.  </li>
      <li>I wear a very short natural style.  </li>
      <li>I applied some to my wet hair for styling and then after my hair was dry, I teased the curls with a little more product to hold them in place.  </li>
      <li>I have very coarse dry natural black hair and so far this product is the only one that manages to keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used it before and I like the result I get on my hair and even my childrens hair as well..</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for this gel when my local BSS ran out. CC keeps my curls soft for days. After day 1, I just reapply a little to my edges and I&#x27;m good to go. The consistency is not like a typical gel, it feels like yogurt, not the greek kind, and it has a lot of slip.</li>
    <li> Probably the best product on the market for dry coils. It packs a punch of oil with the perfect amount of &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; to gel your tight coils together. Apply the product intentionally and liberally from tip to root for shingling. Great on short hair.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this for my hair but this did not work on my 2c hair. It completely weighed down my curls. Works wonders on my 3 boys though. One of them have 3a hair, the other has 3b hair an another 3c/4a hair. The hair is moisturised for 2-3 days with this product. I love this product so much that I am going to have to send some to my niece in Germany. I have yet to find a product that works on my hair but when I purchase this it was a hit and miss that was worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This horribly dried out my multiracial 3B/3C hair. It was like instantly on contact I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Left me with an embarrassing bird nest! It was expensive and I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, so I gave it to my biracial boyfriend with 2B/2C hair and it dried his out at well. WTH?  He then gave it to his sister with 2B hair who loves it. Thought this coca butter would work wonders, guess not!</li>
    <li> [...]  IT LEFT MY HAIR VERY DRY AND THE PRODUCT GUMMED IN MY HAIR AFTER SEVERAL VINEGAR RINSES FINALLY GOT THE GOOEY OUT. JUST NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> The best product for curly hair. I honestly never used another product like it, it brings out my curls the best.</li>
    <li> I got a small sample from my local beauty store and looked all over for it locally.  I was grateful Amazon sold it.  The sample made my hair soft and smelled good it all so gave a nice curl pattern  However this pudding is very sticky, extremely oily stick and wet.  Now the one I ordered from Amazon from this seller, stink.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but it did not smell good, smelled like chemicals.  This batch I received also made my scalp itch terribly.  Horribly.  I had to wash it out, Twice!  The only reason this received one star is because the shipping was fast, but that is a given with Amazon prime.</li>
    <li> Really good but need to go down on the price lil bit to make it a deal but really good.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!!Super moisturizing. You get soft ultra moisturized hair with this product. Would recommend to anyone with very dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Great for my naturally curly hair, it gives my hair hold without being crunchy and stiff.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair with curls ranging from 4a- 3c and a patch of i don&#x27;t know what that is. Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried it on soaking wet hair and 70% dry hair. On wet hair I&#x27;ve gotten great definition and my hair is has a stretched out pattern compared to just using eco(which I still love). It give me about 3-4 day hair because it has a softer hold than eco styler gel. on 70% dry hair, I do twistouts, it came out pretty good but my hair looked like it need moisture even though it felt moisturized. But overall it was good and I purchased at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  It does just what it&#x27;s name infers.  It defines the curl (of natural black hair).  I wear a very short natural style.  I have mixed grades of hair.  The Cocoa Curl gel equally defines the curl all over.  Some gels shrink your hair to a very tight curl, but not this one. It keeps my hair soft and moist (not wet) .  I apply a small amount of gel (the size of a nickel) to my hair daily between shampoos.... more right after I shampoo.  Also, it has a very pleasant fragrance. I love it.  I&#x27;ve tried several other similar products and this one works best for me.</li>
    <li> I really like do not like this formula! It is crap! It is too thick and fails to offer the conditioning properties of the original formula!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOWWWW..... this stuff makes my hair so soft and supple and the curl definition is on point. I bought this stuff at my local Korean beauty store for like 7.00. I was kindy skeptical at first; but to my surprise it work. I put an glob on my hand and work it into my TWA Hair with water it come out so soft and shiny and great definition. I really don&#x27;t write reviews. But this Products deserves one. Ima make sure I take this product during my Hooneymoon.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and my niece&#x27;s hair and it works like a charm, we are both natural so it really defines your natural curl pattern. It&#x27;s a very light product considering it is a moisture gel, which is perfect for me. The whole line of this product is extremely useful and worth it. However, it can be found cheaper at your local beauty supply store, but it&#x27;s also a rare find and is not located everywhere.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair very moisturized and  shiny. I love that it also has the gel like way about it. It slicks my hair down but without drying it out! DEFINITIVELY LOVE!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing stuff ever!!  I use on my 3b/3c hair, I get the most amazing defined curls with this product!!  My hair is shiny and soft to the touch.  There is zero crunch and smells amazing.  Time to rid the closet of all the other products.</li>
    <li> I love it, love it, love it!!! It works wonders on my hair!!</li>
    <li> this is a great gel as a moist and creamy hair product.</li>
    <li> Best for my Natural Hair!  My hair loves it and I love the price.  Normally around $6.99 (In local Stores).</li>
    <li> Cocoa Curl High definition Moisture Gel is a life saver to me going natural and finding the right product was a task I am extremely happy with Cocoa Curl. THIS IS IT!!! My hair stays as styled which is comb out and do its natural response. This gel assist my hair in not becoming a frizzy mat. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> bought this at an asian hair supply place for $6.99 loved it. went back for more and the supply store went out of business. looked everywhere for this product and can&#x27;t find it. $9.99 + shipping and handling is high. will continuce looking for this product</li>
    <li> Less shrinkage in curls than in other products and curls will POP! I was looking for a product for my son who has loose curls and we found this in a hair store.  We actually cracked up at the name because it sounded so simple. We even did a \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; for it in the store. My daughter has curls but it had begun to not have the same reaction with her regular moisturizer.  I thought her texture was just changing. But when my son tried it, his hair looked the way it did when he was 3 years old!  I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it restored her hair to healthy curls, rather than a dried out puff.  We&#x27;ve tried it both ways, with water first or dry and it works best with very little water, pulling it through the hair to the ends.  I wish I had found this before I decided to go back to permed after being natural for 3 years.  My biggest fear is that as an army family, we won&#x27;t be able to find it when we move.  The cost on Amazon is higher than what we got it at the hair store but I suppose if we go overseas, it will be worth it. The ingredients don&#x27;t stand out as anything amazing, but the product works and it does not feel greasy, leave residue, or stiffen.</li>
    <li> This product did not give me curl definition. My hair is 4b/4c medium textured, and low porosity. The product I found to be heavy, and oily. But it did seem to moisturize my hair. I will wait for the season to change before pulling this product out again. I don&#x27;t hate it but I am unimpressed</li>
    <li> I really liked the Neutrlab high curl definition moisture gel.  It kept my hair moisturized.  It didnt do too much as far as curl definition but that&#x27;s ok since the moisture is good. I used this after shampooing, on damp hair. I didnt add any other products. The curls were there while my hair was wet, but once dry it was like a soft fluffy ball of cotton. i didnt need much a small amount goes a long way, which is good because when I opened my package the top was off the jar, and about half was spilled all inside the box.  I was too excited to try the product to send it back, so i just kept it but amazon needs to do better. they should make sure lids are secure on bottles, and maybe put a couple pieces of tape on the lid to keep it place during shipping</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I have been using it for several months now and it has not disappointed one time. I have very coarse dry natural black hair and so far this product is the only one that manages to keep my hair soft and manageable. I use it for my twists or braid outs after deep conditioning and it gives me great definition and a softness that I have not found with any other product. And just a little bit goes a long way, so my last jar has lasted me for months on end. I love this product very much. I wish I had known about it sooner, it would have saved me years of dry and unmanageable kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My hair is naturally curly after undergoing chemo.  I have tried a million products to see what &amp;#34;agrees&amp;#34; with my hair.  Some are very good, but most are too greasy, or dries my hair out, or has gross build up.  This stuff is magic!  It defines my curls, no more frizz!  Also, I only have to use it sparingly because it last for days.  I&#x27;m impressed and so grateful to have found my &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product for my hair!</li>
    <li> Used Cocoa Curl for the first time since receiving it.  WOW!  I am thrilled with this product.  I applied some to my wet hair for styling and then after my hair was dry, I teased the curls with a little more product to hold them in place.  My hair looks amazing and is so soft. Finally, a hair product that lives up to the hype.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
