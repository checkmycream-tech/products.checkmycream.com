      <li>These do a good job at taming and smoothing hair without getting curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Good curlers.  </li>
      <li>but afterwards it&#x27;s recommended to blow out your hair with the dryer to have the salon finish look. &#x3D;]</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it love how they perform.</li>
      <li>These are not for people with medium length fine hair.  </li>
      <li>comfortable, easy to use.</li>
      <li>2 in Rollers that work great on long hair.</li>
      <li>Order was fulfilled quickly and the product was well protected.</li>
      <li>the hair.&lt;br /&gt;the size is good as I expected, but it&#x27;s tooooooo slippery, I cannot roll the hair.</li>
      <li>the size is good as I expected, but it&#x27;s tooooooo slippery</li>

      <li>Too large for my head.  </li>
      <li>They were in better condition than I expected.</li>
      <li>The way to use it is you need to have your wet hair for it to stick, secure it as I said with bobby pins.</li>
      <li>When I want to wear my natural hair straight I roll my hair with these, sit under a hooded dryer and then wrap with a silk scarf.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I realized after buying this pack, is that I spent way more money than I had to.</li>
      <li>They may be great for thin short hair.</li>
      <li>magnetic....or very soft.</li>
      <li>The old school way is to use setting lotion and papers at the ends....</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve no clue how 12 curlers can become a 36 piece set; the price is WAY too high for only 12 2&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the tight curles these these give her.</li>

<li> Thank you to the other Amazon reviewers for warning that I&#x27;d need to order clips separately.</li>
<li> These are for a medium length so if you have very long hair it wont work unless you do it in small portion  of hair.</li>
<li> They are slick so strands of hair don&#x27;t get caught when trying to remove.</li>
<li> They have been called magnetic for at least 40 years that I can recall....</li>
<li> They&#x27;re not magnetic (duh), and made to use on hair longer than neck length.</li>
<li> Too hard to keep in the place!</li>
<li> This should not receive a bad rating.</li>

    <li> My wife really likes the tight curles these these give her. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Shipped as promised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> 2 in Rollers that work great on long hair. Order was fulfilled quickly and the product was well protected. This order included three packs.</li>
    <li> Too hard to keep in the place!</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described and just what I needed. When I want to wear my natural hair straight I roll my hair with these, sit under a hooded dryer and then wrap with a silk scarf. Thank you to the other Amazon reviewers for warning that I&#x27;d need to order clips separately.</li>
    <li> It does what I need it to do. What people don&#x27;t understand is that these are not magnetic. I know it says that, but I believe that is just what they&#x27;re called. They&#x27;re NOT magnetic. I did not buy them thinking that they were so.. If that&#x27;s what you want, you wont be happy with these rollers. The only thing that I realized after buying this pack, is that I spent way more money than I had to. Just go to a beauty supply store. They sell the same thing for a cheaper price. I&#x27;m happy with this product though.</li>
    <li> Good curlers.  But I&#x27;ve no clue how 12 curlers can become a 36 piece set; the price is WAY too high for only 12 2&amp;#34; curlers</li>
    <li> I got my rollers today and it was just as i expected. These are for a medium length so if you have very long hair it wont work unless you do it in small portion  of hair. After using them my hair was perfectly dry and with nice curls.</li>
    <li> They were in better condition than I expected. Beautifully packaged and received in great time! This should not receive a bad rating. They are slick so strands of hair don&#x27;t get caught when trying to remove. They&#x27;re not magnetic (duh), and made to use on hair longer than neck length. So if you&#x27;re hair is shorter don&#x27;t bother because you won&#x27;t have enough hair to roll.</li>
    <li> I prefer these than any other rollers because I grew up using these at the salon to dry my hair. I recommend bobby pins rather than metal ones to hold it, because it won&#x27;t burn your scalp. The way to use it is you need to have your wet hair for it to stick, secure it as I said with bobby pins. Of course it&#x27;s going to leave a dent but afterwards it&#x27;s recommended to blow out your hair with the dryer to have the salon finish look. &#x3D;]</li>

    <li> These rollers are great. They have been called magnetic for at least 40 years that I can recall....I don&#x27;t know why, but it love how they perform. The old school way is to use setting lotion and papers at the ends....still works like a dream.</li>
    <li> These are jumbo rolers but there is no grip. They may be great for thin short hair. Make sure you get clips.</li>
    <li> These rollers work very well! They have the diameter of a soda can! They do not come with clips. I use bobby pins.</li>
    <li> These are not for people with medium length fine hair.  Too large for my head.  Seems different in description too, they are&lt;br /&gt;not magnetic....or very soft.</li>
    <li> These do a good job at taming and smoothing hair without getting curly hair.  I think I may get a set of 1 inch curlers as well.</li>
    <li> i love it, exactly what i expected and i would recommend this product to another friend. comfortable, easy to use.</li>
