### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It looks like a million bucks and is perfect for all my gear when needed.</li>
      <li>Great bag!</li>
      <li>Everyone likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Enough space, great looking, good quality!</li>
      <li>Very nice quality at a great price.</li>
      <li>Very nice bag.</li>
      <li>With the strap adjusted all the way, it hangs perfectly and yet the strap can adjust to fit a man.  </li>
      <li>very very satisfied with the quality and fill of this bag</li>
      <li>But I still love it!</li>
      <li>Really quite impressed.</li>
      <li>Nice looking.  </li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m very happy and at this point can recommend this to friends and family.</li>
      <li>Style is very clean lines.</li>
      <li>I think that one would fit in there, but I think that you would be better served if you don&#x27;t think of this as a computer bag because there are no padded or protective pockets.</li>
      <li>The bag was fine for a couple months.</li>
      <li>Cheap materials.</li>
      <li>Stylish and compact, came super fast!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the $20 price for such value!</li>
      <li>It is not over-sized for an 8 year old and yet would be appropriate for a man.  </li>
      <li>This stylish bag is the perfect size and the magnetic flap makes it really easy to get to the front pocket and grab my vape for a few quick tokes or to retrieve my Note 3 phablet when it starts annoying me--it&#x27;s more secure and even faster and easier than digging stuff out of any pocket.</li>
      <li>When I first opened it, there was the leather smell.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed to hold my wallet, phone, eye and sun glasses, and the keys.</li>
      <li>I was very happy, no tears or broken zippers yet, but it has only been a week, the delivery was super fast.</li>
      <li>Cute bag, expected to be bigger, but its still cute and portable</li>
      <li>and it was fine for him to use the next day.  </li>
      <li>Very impressed!&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 8 year old grandson had gotten very interested in having a &amp;#34;man-bag&amp;#34; and wanted to send his dad one for his birthday, (dad needed one slightly larger to hold his full size I-Pad), and wanted one himself.  </li>
      <li>Nice little bag!</li>
      <li>Strap is high quality &amp;#34;seat-belt&amp;#34; material, however much thinner than a seat belt.  </li>
      <li>My grands loved this bag, sturdy enough for what we needed, to small for some of the books, but I will buy another larger one.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Product I received is the Large size (9.1&amp;#34; high by 8.3&amp;#34; wide).  </li>
      <li>But ill pay a few dollars more to make sure</li>
      <li>Good looking,but bad quality.</li>

    <li> It looks like a million bucks and is perfect for all my gear when needed. I got tired of gathering up my phone, vape, camera, gloves, SNUS, wallet, keys, etc. and then weighing down my pockets until my pants start falling down. This stylish bag is the perfect size and the magnetic flap makes it really easy to get to the front pocket and grab my vape for a few quick tokes or to retrieve my Note 3 phablet when it starts annoying me--it&#x27;s more secure and even faster and easier than digging stuff out of any pocket. The main compartment is zippered and there&#x27;s also several built-in zippered and open-top pockets for cards and other small items. It&#x27;s really hard to believe that a product with such high quality design, construction, materials and hardware can be had for so little moolah. Even my handbag-loving spouse was astounded at the price vs. the quality after she laid her skeptical hands on this bag, and then complained about how it&#x27;s obvious that she&#x27;s getting ripped off in comparison. I no longer have a 7&amp;#34; tablet and I think that one would fit in there, but I think that you would be better served if you don&#x27;t think of this as a computer bag because there are no padded or protective pockets. However, it would work if your 7&amp;#34; tablet or e-reader had an enclosed cover to protect it from scratches.</li>
    <li> Very nice bag. Small but it big enough for all your little essentials</li>
    <li> Very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product I received is the Large size (9.1&amp;#34; high by 8.3&amp;#34; wide).  Strap is high quality &amp;#34;seat-belt&amp;#34; material, however much thinner than a seat belt.  The strap is a bit wider than I had expected; it&#x27;s over 2&amp;#34; wide.  When fully lengthened, the strap is long enough for the bag to fall just at the waist line (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this item since I was looking for the Medium size, but the quality and presentation almost makes me want to keep it, and perhaps gift to someone.  Really quite impressed.</li>
    <li> very very satisfied with the quality and fill of this bag I&#x27;ve only had it for a week and a half so far it is held up to everyday use. I will update if anything happens with it that might be a downside but so far I&#x27;m very happy and at this point can recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to hold my wallet, phone, eye and sun glasses, and the keys.</li>
    <li> The size of the bag is now smaller than before :(  What I mean is that I purchased this bag before, and the recent bag is for some reason smaller.</li>
    <li> Nice little bag! Everyone likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Enough space, great looking, good quality!</li>
    <li> Good looking,but bad quality. zipper, magnets and pockets break in few weeks.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old grandson had gotten very interested in having a &amp;#34;man-bag&amp;#34; and wanted to send his dad one for his birthday, (dad needed one slightly larger to hold his full size I-Pad), and wanted one himself.  I bought this one for my grandson since he was moving across country.  It holds his mini-IPad, his DS, and his wallet.  It is not over-sized for an 8 year old and yet would be appropriate for a man.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  With the strap adjusted all the way, it hangs perfectly and yet the strap can adjust to fit a man.  When I first opened it, there was the leather smell.  I put it in my garage overnight and it was fine for him to use the next day.  It was even in a cloth-type bag to protect the leather from scratches.  I am very pleased with the $20 price for such value!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice looking.  But ill pay a few dollars more to make sure if doesn&#x27;t fall apart after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Cute bag, expected to be bigger, but its still cute and portable</li>
    <li> The bag was fine for a couple months. Got lots of compliments. Then it just gradually fell to pieces. Cheap materials. You get what you pay for I guess. Very little of the bag is actually leather.</li>
    <li> My grands loved this bag, sturdy enough for what we needed, to small for some of the books, but I will buy another larger one. I was very happy, no tears or broken zippers yet, but it has only been a week, the delivery was super fast.</li>
    <li> NOT PLANNING TO USE THIS AS INTENDED.GOING TO INSTALL IT IN MY WWI AIRCRAFT REPLACIA AS A MAP HOLDER.AND FOR MY IPAD MINI GPS SYSTEM.</li>
    <li> I like that thank you</li>
    <li> Great bag! Stylish and compact, came super fast!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sorta on the smaller size compared to regular men&#x27;s bags. Style is very clean lines. My only negative thing would be that the front zip pocket doesn&#x27;t open really wide enough. But I still love it!</li>
