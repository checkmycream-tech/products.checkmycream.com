      <li>the after shave leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The scent is acceptable, but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I really love the aftershave as well.</li>
      <li>After using this daily for a week, I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
      <li>product is more of a shave lotion.</li>
      <li>Simply the best shaving cream on the market</li>
      <li>guess it must be the caffeine and the mint, but what really pleases is the smooth shave--I can work up a good lather with my shaving brush--although you don&#x27;t need to, the shave cream works as well as a nice lubricating film--</li>
      <li>The sizes are decent, and the packaging is very nice.</li>
      <li>I now enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Shaving Company showed PHENOMENAL customer service towards my \\&quot;negative\\&quot; review.</li>
      <li>I have shaved with this only twice so far, but it feels great, leather up pretty good, the razor glides on you skin, damn good.</li>

      <li>Both of these products are fantastic.</li>

      <li>but I do enjoy the scent and the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>Really smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>PERFECT LITTLE GIFT FOR MY HUBBY FOR FATHERS DAY!</li>
      <li>Unique product.</li>
      <li>Doing some research I saw that I need to try a wet shave, after looking at many good reveiw I tried this product.</li>
      <li>It made for the perfect &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift, and he was surprised that I bought him something related to shaving.</li>
      <li>Truly special.</li>
      <li>He always jokes that he never shaves because he never has the right tools!</li>
      <li>The shaving cream worked as expected and the aftershave felt great after the shave.</li>
      <li>Leaves a cool sensation on my face.</li>
      <li>however, I think it will be appreciated and enjoyed.  </li>
      <li>Full disclaimer, I got a discount on the product to try this....</li>
      <li>shaving cream has a strong scent of spearmint, and tingles when applied at first.</li>
      <li>I LOVE shaving creams for my legs, so I&#x27;m always looking to try out new ones.</li>
      <li>The minty smell is great and it&#x27;s slightly cooling on my face.</li>
      <li>Results in a very close and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The after shave also smells lightly of spearmint, and it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is still a cute set for anyone without sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny?  </li>
      <li>I love the cooling action of the mint and menthol.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the cooling action of the mint and menthol.</li>
    <li> Two great products in service of good grooming and a nice tingly feel!  They work--guess it must be the caffeine and the mint, but what really pleases is the smooth shave--I can work up a good lather with my shaving brush--although you don&#x27;t need to, the shave cream works as well as a nice lubricating film--and then I get the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  And the after shave tops off the experience.  I&#x27;d buy them both if I were you.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best Shaving Cream I&#x27;ve had.  My facial hair grows very fast, this has been that extra kick that I need.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I guess my husband must have extremely sensitive skin or something but his face is RED after using these products. I bought the set for his birthday, so he could try something new, and he is giving it a chance but I feel like I&#x27;m torturing him. The first time he used it he cut himself three or four times when he never does. Today he came down and said he will continue to use the aftershave but not the shaving cream and said its like shaving with toothpaste. He also seems to be breaking out after using it for two days.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving set! This set is primarily made for men, but I actually purchased this for myself. I LOVE shaving creams for my legs, so I&#x27;m always looking to try out new ones. My skin gets very irritated after shaving, so I was VERY interested in seeing how the after shave works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came with a 3 oz shaving cream and a 3 oz after shave.. The bottles are about half full, which is a bit strange.. I guess they wanted them to appear larger than 3 oz. Ehh.. The packaging is pretty nifty. I like the design a lot. They are also very easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream has a strong scent of spearmint, and tingles when applied at first. Because of this, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this cream on sensitive skin or intimate areas to prevent irritation. The after shave also smells lightly of spearmint, and it&#x27;s very hydrating. I also would avoid applying this to sensitive skin or intimate areas, which ultimately defeats its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still a cute set for anyone without sensitive skin. The sizes are decent, and the packaging is very nice. Cute set! (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with this set. It made for the perfect &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift, and he was surprised that I bought him something related to shaving. He always jokes that he never shaves because he never has the right tools! So, with shaving cream and after shave... we got him set up! He loved the scent and how it made his skin feel. I liked how silky smooth he was after his shave!</li>
    <li> Received these today and immediately shaved. I had waited to shave for an extra day because I knew these were on the way. They arrived on the day expected and were packaged well. The shaving cream is different than the normal foam cream I am used to using. It&#x27;s more like a lotion than a cream. I suggest applying it to one side of your face at a time so while you&#x27;re shaving the one side, the other doesn&#x27;t dry out. You will want to apply a little water to your face to keep it moist. The smell is not overwhelming and smells good. It does a good job at keeping the skin lubed while you are using the blade over it. The after shave smells the same as the cream. Minty to be exact. You will feel a tingling sensation what feels good. The tubes should be about double the size and they should be completely full as these tubes don&#x27;t seem to be filled completely. But also remember that a little does go along way. This is a good product and I would recommend it. Also I should mention that I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Good shaving cream, leaves the face feeling smooth &amp; supple! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> PERFECT LITTLE GIFT FOR MY HUBBY FOR FATHERS DAY!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both of these products! I typically use Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s Shave Butter and aftershave and these were comparable (I love DSC&#x27;s stuff, so that&#x27;s a big compliment). Both the aftershave and shaving cream have a similar, thick consistency and smell a bit like mint. The shaving cream worked as expected and the aftershave felt great after the shave. It&#x27;s hard to tell what effect the caffeine had on my shave, but it is an interesting gimmick and I believe it&#x27;s doing something that I just don&#x27;t notice. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This shaving set does what it advertises &amp;#34;Starts your morning with a kick&amp;#34;. The smell of the cream and after-shave is also good. I would love to buy it again. I hope they produce larger tubes.</li>
    <li> You know when i saw that it was caffeinated I thought oh thats cute and got it cause my man is a coffee junkie.. But this smells soo good and I was amazed by the difference in the color and brightness of his skin after he used it. So smooth too!</li>
    <li> Nice price. Great idea. However, not the greatest or best lather of any shaving cream I have ever used. The scent is acceptable, but not my favorite. It is nice for travel, but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pacific&#x27;s Caffeinated shaving cream is awesome. The smell is great and lathers fast on a brush. Best lather I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;the kick is great!&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Price, you&#x27;re paying around the same rate as you would for brands like  jack black and art of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size, I appreciate they have a size for the airport, but it&#x27;s way to small for nromal use unless you don&#x27;t mind ordering dozens of these a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell, Best scented shaving cream ever made, so put more caffiene in it! better scent and more of a kick</li>
    <li> I was so excited to stumble on this set of shaving cream and aftershave. I had never heard of the Pacific Shaving Company before, but I will definitely be buying from them again! My husband loves to try weird new things, so it was a perfect gift for him. It smells WONDERFUL, and leaves his face smooth and slightly tingly while reducing any redness. I might buy some for myself because it smells so good, just like spearmint, but its not too heavily or overwhelmingly scented; and it leaves your skin smooth and hydrated. I would definitely give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Full disclaimer, I got a discount on the product to try this....ALSO I prefer shaving soaps and creams that lather….this product is more of a shave lotion. I applied with hand and brush with little to no success. Smell: they both smell a bit like toothpaste, kind of a turn off for me. The aftershave was also a bit too thick and greasy. Caffeinated? I was not jumping off the walls after my shave nor did I “feel” any different other than not having hair on my face.</li>
    <li> After using this daily for a week, I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  I cannot say that I noticed any benefit (or downsides) to it being caffeinated.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream package states that it is concentrated, and they weren&#x27;t kidding - a little goes a long way.  It behaves more like a lotion, with no real foam, but coats well enough for multiple passes with a razor.  The mint/menthol odor is strong, but not overwhelming, and it doesn&#x27;t have the cold-burning feeling (something I detest) that I have come to associate with most mentholated products.&lt;br /&gt;The aftershave was ridiculously thick.  Also concentrated, it didn&#x27;t matter how little I used - my face felt heavy and greasy for hours afterwards.  I have oily/combination skin, so a heavy lotion aftershave is uncomfortable and not my usual preference.  I finally gave up on the aftershave after the third day as I could no longer tolerate the way it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each package is labelled as 3 oz, making it a decent option for those who regularly travel by air.  My opinion is that retail price seems a little high for the performance I observed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, which I have tried my best to provide.</li>
    <li> Unique product. Truly special.</li>
    <li> Smooth, clean and close, excellent . Worth every penny?  The shave cream gives an exceptionally close and comfortable shave and the after shave is really great as a comfort</li>
    <li> The company that produces these was interviewed on BizChix.com.  It sounded like a good company, so thought I would try it out, even though they seemed pricey for me.  I got the best shave ever!  Like there was no blade.  I use just a tiny bit on my hand and just rub it on.  Because it is clear, you don&#x27;t have shaving cream showing where shaving has occurred.  The after shave is also very nice and just a very small bit is needed.  Highly recommended by a cheap Barbasol user.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with this only twice so far, but it feels great, leather up pretty good, the razor glides on you skin, damn good. Aftershave great also, not oily like some other balms, just leaves your face soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> He liked it, said that it smelled good and kind of made his face tingly (in a good way!). :)</li>
    <li> Not very good compared to the reviews. The after shave is a little better than average. However, the shaving cream is watery and takes quite a bit to even make it acceptable. I will not purchase that again based upon the first tube@</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves a cool sensation on my face. Perfect size also.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have purchased it as presents for family and friends.</li>
    <li> Both of these products are fantastic. The shave cream does well lathering either in my hands or with a brush. The minty smell is great and it&#x27;s slightly cooling on my face. The shave is great. I really love the aftershave as well. It&#x27;s very thick, a bit on the heavy on the side - a little goes a long way, but it&#x27;s not oily, greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine. It&#x27;s incredibly soothing, but given it&#x27;s thickness I&#x27;ll save this for colder weather.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shaving cream on the market</li>
    <li> This cream provides good lather on the brush for 3 passes. Results in a very close and smooth shave. It also has a very pleasant smell which is not over whelming. I will be ordering this again in the future. The size of the tube could be larger. An idea for the corporate owners to ponder for future consideration. I will use this more at home then travel for which the small tube will suffice.</li>
    <li> NAW PASS ON THIS. DID NOT STOP THE REDNESS EITHER</li>
    <li> Smells nice, hubby likes it, he says it feels sorta tingly when he puts it on his face:)  Not sure that you get enough product to justify price.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great fragrance and great looking product. Will buy again. I would like to see your product as a cup shaving soap, also.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all. The mint (spearmint?)caused my lips to dry out, and left my face less than happy. Had to trash it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person that does online reviews but I felt compelled. I first used this product after I help crowd source it and was rewarded with a freebie. Well I&#x27;m now buying more, I love it! My skin felt great after shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used shaving cream before, mostly going for a dry shave but as of late I noticed I was getting razor bumps and in grown hairs a lot. Doing some research I saw that I need to try a wet shave, after looking at many good reveiw I tried this product. This stuff is great not only does it make it easy for my shaver to cut my hair without irritating my skin the after shave leaves it nice and smooth. The ingredients also are natural which is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> These guys make quality shaving products that work great ,smell good, and are natural and non-irritating. My husband and son are both fans.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected.  It smells real good, like Spearmint Gum.  The aftershave is short lived and the shaving cream is ok, not great.</li>
    <li> My husband loveso it!! He said he will never use another kind of shabing cream again!!</li>
    <li> Provides a decent shave but has not done a thing to prevent ingrown hairs. It is extremely as just shaving products.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! Gives a very smooth close shave and he says it leaves him tingly and awake.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if I actually notice the caffeine but I do enjoy the scent and the quality of the product.  I might have use it for a few more weeks and stop to see if I notice any difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very novel concept. It worked as advertised and I had nothing really negative to write home about here. I wanted to love it but I ended up going back to store bought gel. Try it and make up your own mind.</li>
    <li> Seriously, how did I ever shave without this? I can never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the words of my husband who absolutely loves the entire line of products. He&#x27;s gifting them for the holidays this year to all the males in the family.</li>
    <li> Great product...will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> The shaving cream smells like spearmint--but the smell washes away.  Kind of reminds me of chewing gum--not sticky though.  Very lubricating.  Really smooth shave.  Aftershave has much less aroma--soothing--not greasy.  I did this as a whim.  As a point of reference I have shave with everything under the sum--brushes, canned goos, all sorts of snazzy and less snazzy stuff.  I really like this product.  Skin prep is a breeze and the shave is very nice.  So easy to use, great result, and very respectable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Must use bristle brush to optimize lather though.  Really does protect the face.  Smoothest, closest shave I ever had.  After shave is excellent.  Just use a dab though since it is so concentrated.</li>
    <li> Have&#x27;nt given it as a gift yet.........however, I think it will be appreciated and enjoyed.  Delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.</li>
    <li> I am amending a previous review that I was not very happy with the product. I don&#x27;t know if I did get a bad batch, but the replacement batch that Pacific Shaving sent me worked a lot better. I now enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Shaving Company showed PHENOMENAL customer service towards my \\&quot;negative\\&quot; review. They made things right. Great company!</li>
