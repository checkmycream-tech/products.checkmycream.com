      <li>My wife has used Halston cologne for many years and wanted to replenish her supply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like an oil with the halston smell.</li>
      <li>Easy shopping to get exactly what I wanted at a great price.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive my favorite vintage fragrance.  </li>
      <li>so I can easily return it if it is faulty.  </li>
      <li>It can easily give one a headache.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so strong and over-powering it almost gags me.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it is me, and I should have know that the perfume was oily because of the &amp;#34;alcohol free.&amp;#34;  It is also twice as strong and my bottle kept leaking all over my dresser.  </li>

      <li>Not at all like the original Halston Cologne Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>next time be sure to by the alcohol kind..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted that it avoids the sins of the original yet is true to its former self.</li>

      <li>Merchant delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>The products were received quickly and intact.  </li>
      <li>IVE WORN HALSTON FOR DECADES AND ITS ALWAYS EXCITING TO GET A SWEET DEAL ON HALSTON, IN THE STORES</li>
      <li>My grandma told me this was her favorite perfume, so I was excited to find it at such a cheap cost.</li>
      <li>Alcohol free is pure GARBAGE.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>However this just didn&#x27;t smell right</li>
      <li>and she bashfully told me that it was mostly water, and wasn&#x27;t authentic like what she had from the store previously.</li>
      <li>Wife&#x27;s favorite is REGULAR</li>
      <li>, I WILL BE BACK TO BUY MORE</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>This was an absolute joke of a product!</li>
      <li>lovely lasting fragrance</li>
      <li>Not the crisp Halston</li>
      <li>good scent for everyday use</li>
      <li>I love Halston but the scent is a little too light.</li>
      <li>Most frustrating is the fact that I ordered two bottles and there is a no return policy since cologne (liquid) is considered a hazardous material.</li>
      <li>They have watered it down or something since it was popular in the &#x27;80s.</li>
      <li>and it came out as pure oil</li>
      <li>rip off, liquid is very oily and could not use</li>
      <li>However this non-alcohol spray had a very greasy feel, so I got rid of it.  </li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend anyone avoid this version and find the real deal.</li>
      <li>Too much oil in the cologne spray.  </li>
      <li>SO REASONABLE</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR HAVING IT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Halston for 30 years and this product smells correct and color is correct but is much oilier than any thing I have ever used before.  </li>
      <li>I know what it smells like, and when I opened this bottle I knew immediately that it was not the real thing.</li>
      <li>The delivery was very prompt.</li>
      <li>Where I spray, my skin gets very greasy.  </li>
      <li>Alcohol Free was a big mistake -</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real Halston.</li>
      <li>I have been using Halston for Women for years -- it really works with my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t think it is the real thing.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>ALCHOL-FREE COLOGNE SPRAY is very Halston but without the harsh-ness or beasty oakmoss (which you now can find in Halston Couture, btw).</li>
      <li>-her mother died a number of years ago and she only wore it on special events and just loved to smell it because it brought back such vivid memories-</li>
      <li>I have had good orders before and the only other time this happened</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s new!  </li>
      <li>I was craving a taste of this classic, and I decided to take a chance.</li>
      <li>is an acceptable product but the smell does not last nearly, would be good at the time of offer it will describe which is an imitation of the origina</li>
      <li>Please note that this is the alcohol-free version and does not wear like the normal cologne.  </li>
      <li>I noticed your people had pretty much the same experience.  </li>
      <li>, my mother knew right away that this wasn&#x27;t the same Halston</li>
      <li>Guess it was old bottle.</li>
      <li>which is a big difference as when sprayed on is really oily.  </li>
      <li>However, although not listed, it feels like a soft leather on me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a peachy floral that reminds me of spring, but the top lasts only a fleeting few minutes.</li>
      <li>As far as fakes go, it wasn&#x27;t even a good fake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find</li>
      <li>This cologne is becoming hard to find in retail stores</li>
      <li>Ordinarily I would spray once, as lightly as I could, so it would not be too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The product is like no other Halston I have purchased before.  </li>
      <li>The amber is clearly there - it&#x27;s a different amber than I am used to in the mass marketing.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to learn that the product was non-returnable, especially since it is alcohol-free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Please note that this is the alcohol-free version and does not wear like the normal cologne.  I was unaware when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Halston by Halston is my favorite perfume so there is nothing to say there I love it!  The shipping was fast.  The products were received quickly and intact.  Amazon is the only way to go for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;I was charged for shipping which I was under the impression the shipping was for free so I was disappointed on that note only.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this cologne all the time, and loved it. For some reason it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, I was really disappointed, it has changed.</li>
    <li> My friend told me she had just a little perfume left from her mother&#x27;s bottle of Halston-her mother died a number of years ago and she only wore it on special events and just loved to smell it because it brought back such vivid memories-so on Valentine&#x27;s Day I sent her a bottle-she was so touched!! I could feel her happiness over the phone-thanks!</li>
    <li> It sprays like a thick oil. Do not spray after your clothes are already on. Terrible!</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift for my mother who has worn Halston since I was a child. However this just didn&#x27;t smell right and it came out as pure oil, my mother knew right away that this wasn&#x27;t the same Halston she&#x27;s always worn. So in conclusion, I am deeply disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not as represented.  I will be very careful what I order from Amazon.Com&lt;br /&gt;in the future. Have been waiting for a week for label to return. I am very&lt;br /&gt;disapointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be perfume. It is perfumed oil.. next time be sure to by the alcohol kind..this stuff is awful :(</li>
    <li> rip off, liquid is very oily and could not use</li>
    <li> I am allergic to alcohol, and we did not want to expose our little one to alcohol sprays. This one is a happy marriage of a good mild smelling perfume that does not need alcohol for effervescence.</li>
    <li> Easy shopping to get exactly what I wanted at a great price.  I found the product I wanted immediately in the size I needed..</li>
    <li> I have been using Halston for Women for years -- it really works with my body chemistry.  It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find so I am delighted Amazon is still a good source for it.</li>
    <li> This is a go-to scent for many occasions.  The oiliness of the alcohol-free product may be a surprise, but it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfume was expired and had an awful smell....just threw it away</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for over 20 years and this is the SECOND time I have been disappointed with my purchase when ordering online! This came from an online company through Amazon called &amp;#34;FragranceNet&amp;#34;. This cologne has NO fragrance to it and feels like cooking oil on my skin! Colored water would have been better as this was difficult to wash off after I sprayed it on! I have had good orders before and the only other time this happened I thought it was just a mistake so I did nothing about it, but since this happened again, I have decided to find another product that I can buy at a regular store front business so I can easily return it if it is faulty.  This was an absolute joke of a product!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Halston for years and usually purchase at the mall in town.  I decided to buy from Amazon this time because I didn&#x27;t have the time to travel to town and this is a convenient way to do my shopping.  The product is like no other Halston I have purchased before.  It had the same box and bottle, but the contents are a bit lighter in color, very little scent to it, and is oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t try to return it because I threw everything away (packaging, box) before even trying it....just so use to getting a quality product!  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> My grandma told me this was her favorite perfume, so I was excited to find it at such a cheap cost. I sent it to her last Christmas. I went to go visit a few months ago and she bashfully told me that it was mostly water, and wasn&#x27;t authentic like what she had from the store previously. I was completely appalled. Who does that? I recommend anyone avoid this version and find the real deal.</li>
    <li> Everything  I expected delivery was on time</li>
    <li> is an acceptable product but the smell does not last nearly, would be good at the time of offer it will describe which is an imitation of the origina</li>
    <li> However this non-alcohol spray had a very greasy feel, so I got rid of it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
    <li> This is very oily to use, doesn&#x27;t last very long gets on clothing and makes my skin break out in bumps</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother in-law. I was skeptical because of the reviews. She has been using Halston for years and said that this was it and she loved it and I loved the price!!</li>
    <li> I like this cologne, but it has an oily feeling that I don&#x27;t like.  But I like the fragrance it gives off</li>
    <li> Smells the same as it use to and was a great gift item.  The person loves the perfume and will buy again if needed</li>
    <li> My wife was quite disappointed in this alcohol-free version of Halston.  The scent was not the same and the cologne itself was disagreeably oily on the skin.  I was surprised to learn that the product was non-returnable, especially since it is alcohol-free.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a favorite of my wife and she was amazed and delighted that I was able to get this for her.  The fragrance is soft and feminine and brings back memories. The size is right for the price and it made a perfect present.</li>
    <li> I have always had great service from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Halston cologne, exclusively, longer than I can remember, probably 40 years or more.  Could this be a counterfiet product with additives?  The aroma seems right, but I have to spray 5 or 6 times hard to try to get enough.  Where I spray, my skin gets very greasy.  That&#x27;s new!  I spray my hand and ask my husband, &amp;#34;Can you smell it?&amp;#34;  He says &amp;#34;barely&amp;#34;.  That has never happened before.  Ordinarily I would spray once, as lightly as I could, so it would not be too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I am not asking for my money back.  It was a good price, a fraction of what we used to pay.  I just don&#x27;t think it is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering, nice product</li>
    <li> I love Halston but the scent is a little too light.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was alcohol free which is a big difference as when sprayed on is really oily.  This was my fault. Merchant delivered quickly.  I just don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Guess it was old bottle. Almost no smell at all.  Should have returned it!  Waited too long to take care of that.</li>
    <li> I wore this back in the day, and I remember it being a bit harsh and oakmossy. I was craving a taste of this classic, and I decided to take a chance. I bought a full-sized bottle of the ALCHOL-FREE COLOGNE SPRAY at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my. It&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s a peachy floral that reminds me of spring, but the top lasts only a fleeting few minutes. It then turns into something a bit dusty, dark, &amp; dirty. The amber is clearly there - it&#x27;s a different amber than I am used to in the mass marketing. However, although not listed, it feels like a soft leather on me. In fact, it reminds me of a more wearable EL Azuree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ALCHOL-FREE COLOGNE SPRAY is very Halston but without the harsh-ness or beasty oakmoss (which you now can find in Halston Couture, btw). It is quite oily, more along the lines of a perfume oil, so this is something best sprayed after a shower. Not to be sprayed on clothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ALCHOL-FREE COLOGNE SPRAY doesn&#x27;t wear like an EdP. However, it morphs into a skin scent and lasts a long time. I&#x27;m delighted that it avoids the sins of the original yet is true to its former self. I&#x27;m crazy about this formulation!</li>
    <li> This was not Halston. This was watered down, something, without any fragrance whatsover. It didn&#x27;t smell like anything, it was lighter in color, as though it was watered down, and it even went on oily, which is not typical of Halston. Not sure if it was intended by the seller, but this product was crap and is now in the trash!</li>
    <li> I never received Halston for women. It was a knock off brand. It didn&#x27;t even smell the same. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was awful. I didn&#x27;t realize it was &amp;#34;alcohol-free&amp;#34;. So it is just oily. Seems to have no fragrance. And you can&#x27;t return it. Sad for me I bought 2 at the time! I would give it zero stars it is such a dud.</li>
    <li> Must be a fake.  Oily, terrible. Doesn&#x27;t even smell like Halston. Bought as a Christmas gift. Will ask for money back!</li>
    <li> My wife has used Halston cologne for many years and wanted to replenish her supply.  This cologne is becoming hard to find in retail stores so I was please to find it at Amazon at a great price and free shipping.  I bought three bottles.  Unfortunately, the product is not remotely what she wanted even though the name and packaging are the same.  First, one bottle in the shipment arrived approximately 1/4 empty.  Second, the fragrance is not remotely the Halston scent she&#x27;s had before.  Finally, the stuff has an awful, oily feel that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would want to spray on themselves.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift to my daughter in law, she just loves the spell and I am glad she likes it!!</li>
    <li> realmente es aroma un fuerte</li>
    <li> Alcohol free is pure GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt; Wife&#x27;s favorite is REGULAR Halston;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle arrived LEAKING ALL OVER.&lt;br /&gt;Wife tried it; GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;NON-RETURNABLE small print was not seen&lt;br /&gt;prior to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;I threw the bottle in the dumpster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY ! ! !</li>
    <li> This cologne has NO scent..it&#x27;s greasy when sprayed and has very little scent.  Not at all like the original Halston Cologne Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product!</li>
    <li> IVE WORN HALSTON FOR DECADES AND ITS ALWAYS EXCITING TO GET A SWEET DEAL ON HALSTON, IN THE STORES THE PRICES ARE THRU THE ROOF. THANKS FOR HAVING IT SO REASONABLE, I WILL BE BACK TO BUY MORE</li>
    <li> The cologne is oily and it stains my clothes, therefore it is unusable as a cologne spray.</li>
    <li> This product is totally unacceptable. The spray button did not work well, performing as though it was blocked (although it had been rinsed),  there is minimal scent, and the product remains greasy on the skin. Most frustrating is the fact that I ordered two bottles and there is a no return policy since cologne (liquid) is considered a hazardous material. It was an expensive mistake</li>
    <li> I didnt like the smell.  It wasn&#x27;t the same cologne I was looking for.  It was exactly what I ordered, I apparently ordered the wrong product.  I kept it and gave it to someone else because it was priced so well!!  Wish it had been the one I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product purchased for a gift and yet a lot like when you give it away... good scent for everyday use</li>
    <li> it was&#x27;nt the halston i was use to having , it was oily &amp; the color was not the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Halston for more than 30 years, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The Alcohol Free was a big mistake - I hate the oily feeling and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;Still have one bottle that has not even been opened - can I return.  Halston still is my&lt;br /&gt;favorite cologne, but I absolutely hate the Alccohol free and will NOT use it.  Very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw it away, would not wish it on anybody else.</li>
    <li> This item is great and the price is good!! Want a great deal use your reward points!!  This item was a gift!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t halston perfume. It&#x27;s more like an oil with the halston smell. Not very good when you wear office blouses. It leaves oil stains...</li>
    <li> They have watered it down or something since it was popular in the &#x27;80s. But it still smell the same, just doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it is me, and I should have know that the perfume was oily because of the &amp;#34;alcohol free.&amp;#34;  It is also twice as strong and my bottle kept leaking all over my dresser.  Just do yourself a favor and pass!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Halston for 30 years and this product smells correct and color is correct but is much oilier than any thing I have ever used before.  I would hesitate to repurchase this product because it is not the quality that I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I have been wearying Halston cologne since it came out in 1975. I know what it smells like, and when I opened this bottle I knew immediately that it was not the real thing. As far as fakes go, it wasn&#x27;t even a good fake. It didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real Halston. The bottle also did not have the Halston name etched into the glass. I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately (good customer service) and I threw it in the garbage. The guy on the phone told me it was the second such call he&#x27;d received about a fake cologne that week.</li>
    <li> Too much oil in the cologne spray.  The oil does not evaporate, just stays oily on the skin.  I do not like it at all.</li>
    <li> Love it. Staple in my collection. My mother used it now im using it. Great when put on after shower</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> My mom has always loved Halston Cologne - she is 93 years old and I purchase at least 3 every year for holidays.As always ordering is easy and shipping is great</li>
    <li> lovely lasting fragrance</li>
    <li> Perhaps it was my mistake to order the Alcohol-Free version.  The spray is very oily, and the scent is very heavy.  Not the crisp Halston I remember from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m disappointed I can&#x27;t return it, but again, probably my fault for not reading their return policy.  I was so excited to receive my favorite vintage fragrance.  I don&#x27;t want to wear this.  Just not my signature.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several fragrances from Amazon.  But, I didn&#x27;t happen to buy the Halston I got from Amazon.  The reason I am writing is because I bought mine at a well known store and it is horrible.  I haven&#x27;t had it in years, but it does not smell like I remember it.  I noticed your people had pretty much the same experience.  I think the problem is definitely with the perfume maker.  It&#x27;s so strong and over-powering it almost gags me.  I should write to Halston.  As it is I have to wear a very small amount around my ankles so the smell is not close to my nose.  It can easily give one a headache.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent at a great price.</li>
    <li> The delivery was very prompt. However, when I used the cologne the first time, it was oily unlike any cologne I have ever had and that includes previous bottles of Halston cologne.  I guess that is what alcohol-free means.  I am very disappointed and feel that I&#x27;m stuck with a product I will not use.</li>
    <li> It has a pretty good smell, but I really don&#x27;t like the fact that it goes on in an oily fashion.</li>
