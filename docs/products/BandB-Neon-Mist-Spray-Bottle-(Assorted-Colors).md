      <li>Nice size to easily fit in the hand.  </li>

      <li>Never mind, I should have known better.</li>
      <li>Also I was able to write on the bottle with a permanent maker labeling it Clorox.</li>
      <li>okay</li>

      <li>I am not making this a centerpiece of my home or anything, so I couldn&#x27;t care less what color it came in :D</li>
      <li>I like that the spray is even and fine.  </li>
      <li>I took the nozzle apart, and after reassembling it, it does mist just fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for my deep sink. I wanted a small enough spray bottle to put Clorox Cleanup in and leave it in sink. I have a metal sink protector in sink. This bottle is perfect. Small enough to last about 2 weeks spraying the sink down everyday. But big enough to not have to fill every week. Also I was able to write on the bottle with a permanent maker labeling it Clorox. Sprays perfect and sprays quite a bit each time. Easy spray so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands. Yay! Perfect bottle!</li>
    <li> Cute little spray bottle. I use it for my leave in hair conditioner. Sprays a nice mist without drenching me. I love the pink color too. This spray bottle is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> As described. It can stand pretty steadily, and the tube goes all the way to the bottom. Can spray from mist to direct jet-like streams.</li>
    <li> The order puller could see (if they looked), that this item was for a guy. The product was fine. I just couldn&#x27;t keep a hot pink mister on my counter, so I had to give it away. I know it stated multiple colors and I thought well, red would still be ok, but I just couldn&#x27;t do the pink. Got a green one at the dollar store (for a dollar)!</li>
    <li> This is the best mister that I have ever used.  I actually didn&#x27;t realize that a mister could work so well.  You barely need to squeeze the trigger and this perfect spray comes out.  No more dealing with a blast of water on one section of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great mist for houseplants!</li>
    <li> The clear part fits inside my hand, it&#x27;s only a few ounces big, so if you need something bigger, look elsewhere.  The product description or other reviews didn&#x27;t state how big/small it was, so I took a chance and ordered it.  Very, Very small.  Other than that, seems to work pretty good.</li>
    <li> As others mentioned, this bottle is smaller than you think it is--about 6 1/2\\&quot; high to the top of the nozzle, 3\\&quot; wide, 1 1/2\\&quot; deep.  Also from the picture I thought the bottle would be round, but is is flat on the sides.  I just need it for spraying my cat when she messes with my blinds, so it works great for my purposes.  Sprays nicely on both mist and stream settings, and is super cute.</li>
    <li> I got this water bottle primarily to spray my cat when she does something she shouldn&#x27;t be doing. It is totally awesome for this purpose. I can hit her from 15+ feet away with deadly accuracy. Not to brag or anything, of course. It&#x27;s nice and small too, so it isn&#x27;t in the way too much. Kind of a bummer you can&#x27;t pick a color, I got hot pink, which I don&#x27;t mind, but probably wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice.</li>
    <li> This bottle does what it is supposed to, it sprays water.  It feels durable and should last.  The only issue is that you do not get to pick a color, so of course, I received a pink one.  Awesome.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t take a star away because the company that ships doesn&#x27;t let me choose a color, but if you order, be warned, you may not get the color you like and be heckled by your co-workers as you spray your indoor plants with a tiny pink spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle, it&#x27;s easy to get flimsy junk bottles that break, but this is strong, durable, comfortable in the hand, and great size and shape. It might seem like a small item, but quality matters in the little things too.</li>
    <li> Bought 3, started out great and all 3 deteriorated to horrible performance within just a few weeks of moderate use. One got so bad I had to throw it away (pure water, no debris). Not to mention 2 of them came in wretched purple-pink.</li>
    <li> Needed a cheap spray bottle to mist my terrarium.  Does a perfect job of delivering just the right amount of water with an adjustable nozzle which controls the amount of water dispelled with each spray.  No complaints for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the first water bottle I&#x27;ve purchased that didn&#x27;t break within months of minimal use.  I love it!  It shoots super far (8-10 feet?) with a thin/direct spray which is what I wanted.  This is not for hairstylists or anyone wanting a fine mist.  I also love the small size of the bottle as it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot counter space as I leave it out all the time for ease of use.  We found that a few squirts to our hyper-barking dogs, (who bark at the wind, the trees, squirrels...basically everything), helps to calm them down. I also like that the inner tube/straw reaches to the very bottom so you get to use all of the water, not just most of the water.  Overall, it feels solidly constructed and for under $5, it&#x27;s a slam-dunk for this family.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently and really like the bottle. The material appears strong, it holds a good amount, is easy to use regardless of what is on my hand and has a nice spray.  I use it daily on my natural African American hair so it&#x27;s getting a work out.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to be able to purchase these mist spray bottles, because lately the only bottles that are available are spray bottles which in some cases, while sewing and doing crafts, the spray provide too much water.  Another hard to find item provide to me by Amazon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It was sent in the time frame allotted by the seller.  It was packaged safely to prevent damage and arrived in mint condition.  The actual product itself (the mister) works well too.  I use it both for my hair and to train the kittens when they&#x27;re on the counter :D.</li>
    <li> Have bought quite a few flimsy spray bottles over the last few years, this one seems like it&#x27;s good quality, and more durable than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find that the bottle is made from sturdy plastic, and that it is easy to adjust between a fine mist and a strong stream like a water gun. I got it mostly to mist hair, but I can also use it to get the neighbors cat off my door mat!  It is a small bottle so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space, and is very handy.  I read the reviews before I purchased it so I was prepared to receive a different color than pictured, my spray bottle is hot pink, which is fine with me. However it would be nice to be able to pick the color you want. From the reviews I gather you get either green, pink, or purple.</li>
    <li> It is funny, like another reviewer, mine is purple too--I am not making this a centerpiece of my home or anything, so I couldn&#x27;t care less what color it came in :D It is totally functional (really even misting) and it is small and won&#x27;t tire you out holding it (spraying, cleaning, have you). I don&#x27;t like to waste the cleaners I mix (earth-friendly, but why add more into the environment than needed) and this allows me to make small amounts. The pumps on larger ones often don&#x27;t reach all the liquid and you waste it! This is just the right size for a variety of purposes where all I&#x27;m left with is a tiny amount of liquid to clean it out, rinse it and put it away til I need it again.</li>
    <li> I use this to spray my roommate with whatever whenever he says something offensive (seriously).  It works well.  You can twist the cap to select a squirt or a spritz!  I have trouble getting it dry for some reason, though.</li>
    <li> Product arrive quickly and as expected. Would purchase this product again. The description given is very accurate. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Well made little bottle.  I use it to spray peppermint essential oil mixed with some water around the house, especially around doors &amp; windows.  This is to keep bugs out bc I really, really hate them.  Well it&#x27;s working, I only saw a cricket, no spiders.  Well the bottle is very well made, easy to spray.  A very good spraying mechanism, it won&#x27;t break after a few uses.  We&#x27;ve all had THOSE spray bottles.  This one has an impressive set up.  I wish all spray bottles were made this way.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these bottles. They are cute, small and they spray well. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t choose the color you want. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t break on me like I thought it would &amp; I have no idea what has happened to it so I had to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Bought this bottle to make a natural hair daily moisturizer. great little bottle and apply a natural even mist</li>
    <li> As with another review, I thought I would get the color depicted in the picture of the product, however I received a pink one, also it only sprays a stream throughout the entire adjustment range of the nozzle, does not mist.  UPDATE:  I took the nozzle apart, and after reassembling it, it does mist just fine. up from 1 to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this spray bottle!!!!  I started mixing my own insect repellent and this bottle sprays very well!!  Good strong spray and good coverage!!  Easy to hold as well!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two. It would have been nice if they&#x27;d sent me two different colors.  Other than that, a decent sturdy sprayer.</li>
    <li> It sprays a nice little mist that my plants love. They thank me every day.</li>
    <li> Great little spray bottle that works perfectly. In the summer, I use it to spray my dogs down to keep them cool during a walk, and I carry it with me to spray them down during the walk. I also use one of these bottles to mist my hair when I want to give it a quick restyling with the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Can squirt cat from across the room, which is fun.</li>
    <li> This is a medium size bottle. It does the job and I am pleased with it. It gives off a fine mist which I love.</li>
    <li> Seems like a spray bottle is one of those things where if it works, there&#x27;s not much more to say in a review.  This works just fine, and the spray is nicely adjustable.  So it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Purchasers should keep in mind that this is a smaller squirt bottle, not the large kind that you might see used for cleaning solutions and such.  I use it to help manage the cats when they get naughty, and it&#x27;s great for that occassional kind of use; I prefer a smaller bottle for that anyway.  You don&#x27;t get to pick the color, but I received the green one as pictured and the photo is pretty true to color.</li>
    <li> I wanted one of these to keep vinegar in and got hot pink. This thing is ugly, too ugly for my kitchen. Throwing it away</li>
    <li> I had it for over a month so couldn&#x27;t return this so just tossed it out. Very flimsy and what else can you say when it stops working after 10 sprays. Just junky &amp; doesn&#x27;t mist well anyway. I was looking for something with a finer mist than your average spray bottle. Never mind, I should have known better.</li>
    <li> Best sprayers I have ever had the fortune to but. When they say mist they mean it. Perfect for adding just the right amount of spray for my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love these little mist bottles. They actually work very well. Better than any others I have ever bought.  Good price just don&#x27;t like the fact that they are an add on to other orders.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect for me. I have no complaints. You can use for anything requiring a mist. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a little barker dog and I am trying to train her not to bark.  I have shock collars and those work but they are not comfortable for her to wear.  With these spray bottles, all AI have to do is point one at her and she stops barking.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these to keep our cat from scratching the furniture and to keep our dog from randomly barking.  We&#x27;ve used them for more than a month and they work great.  Now we can just shake the bottle and the cat stops.... the dog is a bit slower but he&#x27;s catching on.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent spray bottle</li>
    <li> Perfect for daily misting of a few delicate plants</li>
    <li> Just like it&#x27;s described, it&#x27;s a small spray bottle. It mists perfectly the way I need mist to be. The bottle I received did not look like the photo, however. The top was blue on my model, and it didn&#x27;t have the springs (I think?) along the tube as depicted in the photo. I believe the product description mentioned that the pic may differ from the actual product, so none of that bothered me. The bottle performs fantastic.</li>
    <li> Compact and works! I have used it every day with peppermint oil mixed in the water to send spiders packing. Used it in storage and anywhere you need a dependable spray bottle!</li>
    <li> These are the best spray bottles I&#x27;ve used in my ceramics studio, hands down.  They&#x27;re not huge: they stand maybe 6 inches tall.  The spray is nicely adjustable, though, and they hold enough water for a full day&#x27;s work.  I like that the spray is even and fine.  The bottle stands up on its own easily, so I can keep my focus on my work.  I also find that the back of the grip, with the extended tab, makes the sprayer fit securely in my hand.  Having the nozzle colored, but the reservoir clear, means that I can easily see how much liquid is left, and can find the right sprayer (water, rubbing alcohol, vinegar) easily.</li>
    <li> Works great and looks nice. Mine is more of a teal blue.</li>
    <li> Did not last long.  The sprayer stopped and I could not get to restart.  I&#x27;m disappointed - cheap!</li>
    <li> This item did not last long before it broke. It was perfect for the size I needed but not long after using it, the internal parts just broke.</li>
    <li> I use this to wet my daughters hair down in the mornings. She gets her bath at night, and by morning time, her curly hair is a hot mess! So I use this spritzer to calm her hair when she gets up. It&#x27;s a really nice, fine mist. The tube inside is long, so it still sprays well even when the liquid is low. And my daughter thinks it&#x27;s fun to get spritzed! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/2015: Still using this every day. Love it!</li>
    <li> Compact, good quality.</li>
    <li> mist my plants with it</li>
    <li> Wonderful spray bottle. I use this mostly for my hair. I am a natural and I spray my hair almost daily.</li>
    <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t find small spray bottles in the local stores, so I was forced to order online.  Works great, but, beware that ASSORTED COLORS means that you will get a random color.  Of course I got pink.  Blech.</li>
    <li> The image is neon green and there is no mention of other colors in the description, yet I received a purple one. I hate purple. It&#x27;s too cheap to bother with a return, so thanks for nothing, I guess.</li>
    <li> Tired of cheep spray bottles? Don&#x27;t like using up a lot of space? Like a fun design? Then this is the bottle for you. Well built and small profile. We use it for keeping the cat off the counters. I broke several other types of bottles during my spray frenzies. Only issues was a non issue. The items shown is green and we received an orange one. I like the orange though.</li>
    <li> It sprays. It holds water. It does what its supposed to. Nothing amazing. But it sure is good to have a little bottle sprays well, no leaks.</li>
    <li> The bottle stopped working after two days. It only gets one star for coming in the color shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Nice bottle.  The pick up tube on this is nicer that other bottles I looked at.  Very happy with the spray on this one too.</li>
    <li> This is a great little bottle. Adjustable spray nozzle works well and I have had no issues with it leaking which is nice. If you need a small spray bottle for odd jobs look in further this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spray bottle that would have a nice fine spray to mist my plants with.  I bought 3 so I could get all 3 colors, and the other two I&#x27;m now using to spray my naughty cats with which it works very well for.  The stream setting goes out about 8 feet, long enough to reach across a room, and it&#x27;s small and stylish.  Lots of good uses for these, I may buy some more!</li>
    <li> This is a cute little mist bottle and you can turn the top to switch what kind of spray you would like. I love the neon green as well, it isn&#x27;t that big, but that was what makes this product perfect for me. I use this to spray water in my hair in order to wet it and style it. I love this and I think the quality is perfect. Defiantly , recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a cute small spray bottle for general use.  This spray bottle works great no issues.  It is self explanatory, you just fill it with water and spray.  The only reason i did not give 5 stars is because:  You dont get to choose your color,  its a surprise apparently.  I happened to get purple which i was very happy with lol!  Lucky me.</li>
    <li> We wanted a way to correct our dog when she understands what we want but refuses to comply.  We discovered that she doesn&#x27;t like water sprayed toward her, so we bought 4 of these small spray bottles and keep them in areas where we think we may need to correct her.  We haven&#x27;t actually sprayed her yet, as just the threat is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer does a fine job as the nozzle adjust easily from a fine sray to a stream.</li>
    <li> nice price and quality</li>
    <li> Amazing range. It shoots far and wide with a nice steady stream and minimal drippage. I use it to prevent people from coming too near me at work and making people leave pretty quickly when they&#x27;re not moving fast enough. I can hit people from my desk to the doorway and a little outside it which is about 8 feet. I&#x27;m getting pretty good with the aim, even for shooting from the hip. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had difficulties finding a bottle that really mist my hair. This bottle works perfectly. It&#x27;s a really good investment. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think i purchased the green color but received a pink one instead. It does serve the function, so be carefully with the color</li>
    <li> Bought this to squirt our cat when she does something she shouldn&#x27;t be doing. It&#x27;s just right for that job: small, but generates a powerful and accurate stream of water, even from across the room.</li>
    <li> The picture shows a green spray bottle, but mine came purple; which I don&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s really sturdy and works great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  From mist to spray.</li>
    <li> These squirt bottles work great.  I use them to keep cats off counters where they can hurt themselves. Now if I can just convince the cats to not jump on the counters when I *don&#x27;t* have one of these in my hands.  Durn situational learning.</li>
    <li> this is my third one and the sprayer seems to last forever</li>
    <li> I like this spray bottle. In particular, it&#x27;s very stable (not too tall, doesn&#x27;t fall over).</li>
    <li> In my quest for a spray bottle I stumbled upon this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its made in Taiwan so get over that fast because this baby SPRAYS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable nozzle works excellent with great precision and a large array of spray settings from a delicate mist to a accurate super soaker power stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as seen is what you get. The lip on the back is a great addition to the design allowing a much easier spray with the support on the top of your hand doing the work your wrist would normally be doing. This makes me think of elderly persons and their limited physical strength, the support requires less strength to use the sprayer so that design is critical to the device functioning easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and satisfied with this product for its price. The container is small so this is not meant for spraying a greenhouse worth of plants, but it is great for indoor plants and other various uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to clean my bicycle the other day. Just mix Simple Green and water and spray away! Let it sit for a minute, scrub if needed, and then spray again to use it all up, then just reload with water and clean all that grime off! This is where the nozzle played a key role, i misted the bike so that there wasn&#x27;t too much cleaner and it just ran off, and i then adjusted it to power spray spots with a lot of built up dirt and grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to clean and i recommend washing with dish soap and spraying some of the wash out of the nozzle to ensure the tubing is clean as well as the chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This continues to function well after a few months.  Inexpensive, small and functional.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray bottle I&#x27;ve ever had!!!  I stopped buying bottles because they always sucked major.  Love my new spray bottle!!!</li>
    <li> It holds a lot more water than it looks plus it has a nice stream and spray. I use it for my ceramics class to rehydrate clay and it is able to spray large mounds of clay over larger surfaces.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a fine mist sprayer.  This is not a mister.  Just like a household spray bottle for cleaning.  You can adjust to squirt or to lighten up and spray more widely, but definitely not a mister.  The spray comes out in drops, not as a mist.  Probably works okay but if you are look for a fine mist sprayer, not the best.</li>
    <li> Who knew it would be so difficult to find a small spray bottle that actually works! Use for spraying/misting my indoor plants and about to purchase another one for spritzing my hair.</li>
    <li> The cats keep getting on the counter. This little bottle is easy to have on hand and packs a bit of a punch. I can easily spray them from 20 feet away, much to their chagrin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for what its worth. I use this for my natural oils and water to spray to make my house smell good and to spray my pillows/comforter with lavender, lemon oils and water! Good bottle</li>
    <li> Goode sprayer. Works well and delivers a good spray pattern</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little spray bottle. I used it to spritz my hair with fruity aloe vera juice (the water in Florida is just so hard!). The bottle itself deserves 5 stars but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because you don&#x27;t get to choose your color. I wanted green and received pink/purple. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I bought this to squirt my dog when he barks. I like that it is flat and not round so it fits easily in a large purse.</li>
    <li> I should have returned this when I filled it and water was still able to come out of the nozzle even though I hadn&#x27;t pulled on the lever.  A small squeeze of the bottle itself is enough to get water to drip out so handling the bottle is a chore.  Against my better judgement, I decided to keep it anyway and take extra care to not squeeze the bottle (why is that even something I have to think about??).  It&#x27;s now just past Amazon&#x27;s 30-day return window (of course) and the lever is stuck somehow so it can&#x27;t spray.  Useless and a waste of money.  Do yourself a favor and get something else like I wish I had done.</li>
    <li> my plants like it ;-)</li>
    <li> I got this &amp;#34;misting&amp;#34; tool to use with the Neutrogena body oil.  It sprays just the right amount to maintain moisture without feeling greasy and slippery.</li>
    <li> First of all they do not MIST....they only spray.  The Vendor told me they were adjustable so I tried again.  They did adjust for mist with only water in the bottle...........but when I used olive oil (which is why I purchased the bottle) in the bottle I could only get a SPRAY, no mist.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle works well, it&#x27;s durable and easy to handle, however, I wish the mist came out in a finer stream.</li>
    <li> Needed a spray bottle for traveling and this work seems to be just what we needed.  Not too big and fits in the suitcase nicely.  Easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective, cute, nice, great little spray bottle for plant food, etc. Stores easily, holds a decent amount of liquid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice,I like But any other Color But Pink....... Would have Been Nice!!!  Maybe next time AGreen,Yea! Yea! yea</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
    <li> Ugly color but works good</li>
    <li> The tube goes all the way to the bottom allowing you to utilize pretty much all of the liquid in the bottle.  Primes quickly and gives a good strong stream or a fairly fine mist.  Nice size to easily fit in the hand.  Great for misting plants or correcting misbehaving cats.</li>
    <li> bottle looks very different in person than in photo</li>
    <li> The product was just what i was looking for. I&#x27;m ordering a second one now. My first one came in pink.</li>
    <li> It works as you would expect a spray bottle to work. I like the smaller size container. It seems to be a sturdy, functional product. It holds 8 ounces, that&#x27;s one cup of water.</li>
    <li> Pretty, works well, good price.</li>
    <li> I didnt bother sending this back because it was inexpensive. But right out of the box it didnt work. Didnt spray one bit.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle is a lot smaller than I expected, but it actually last a long time with one fill of water.  It works great when you have flowers in the house, and need to keep some water on the leaves.  It does exactly what I was hoping it would, and it is hard plastic so I think it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Best little spray bottle ever, especially when you need a quick spritz on the go. 😏</li>
    <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 5 of these after reading the enthusiastic reviews from cat owners, and I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not *exactly* cured my one cat of mewing incessantly in the hour before dinnertime, but I *have* cured him of doing so when i&#x27;m near one of the sprayers :).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By dialing the nozzle, I can select anything from a short-range, fine spray to a *very* long-range, direct stream.  I can reach at least 14 feet with the nozzle set to &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; - easily across my largest room.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised. Good size for my needs. Sprayer nozzle and trigger seem to be good quality ... Doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; as i use it. I noted some expressed caution about using this bottle with essential oil solutions, but it&#x27;s worked fine for me so far.</li>
    <li> This broke and is unusable.</li>
