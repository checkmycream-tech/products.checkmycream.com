      <li>I also have more volume in roots.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>it was a leave in conditioner, but it turns out it is more of a moisturizing hair spray.  </li>
      <li>This is a better price than anyplace else I have seen.</li>
      <li>love  this product  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s some of the best smoothing lotion you can use daily with out having to worry about build up or breakage from overuse.</li>
      <li>it creates a lovely curl which lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>So I thought it would be ok for me spray more.</li>
      <li>I have medium length layered hair and have not found anything that works better on my hair than this product.  </li>

      <li>As its not a hair spray, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold.  </li>
      <li>This product gives my hair body without weighing it down and leaves it with great shine!  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble styling lotion gives fine hair body and bounce.</li>
      <li>I have fine color treated hair</li>
      <li>Maybe helps build body, but I dislike the smell and it can make my fine hair sticky.</li>
      <li>Works great on my fine, color-treated, short hair.  </li>
      <li>It did not go through the sprayer as a spray but as a stream, meaning it was thicker than the genuine product.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for several years and happy to see it cheaper at Amazon vs the saloon.</li>
      <li>received this product as a free sample from Sephora a while ago</li>
      <li>Great product, but I can only use once a week because I&#x27;m probably allergic to it.</li>
      <li>The product is so light it does not feel like you have anything in your hair at all.</li>
      <li>This provides the perfect amount of gold without my hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>I love the product and enjoyed the fast service through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the Bumble and Bumble products and use many, but this one is my new favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells nice and I like the packaging but the product is no better than any cheap product I have from the drugstore - save your money!</li>
    <li> Great for the &amp;#34;day after&amp;#34; hair blow out</li>
    <li> I compared a bottle of Bumble &amp; Bumble styling lotion I had purchased from a hair salon to what this seller sent me.  The salon lotion felt clear and clean.  The lotion I received in my Amazon order felt slimy. It did not go through the sprayer as a spray but as a stream, meaning it was thicker than the genuine product.  Amazon quickly handled the situation and issued a full refund.  If this review were for Amazon&#x27;s customer service, it would be a 5-star review; however, it is for the product, itself--thus, 1-star.</li>
    <li> love  this product  i have used it for many years</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a leave in conditioner, but it turns out it is more of a moisturizing hair spray.  I LOVE IT!  I have used it twice now and both times it has left my hair shiny and voluminous!  It actually helps hold in my curls, which traditional hair spray has failed to do.  I am hooked on this stuff.  I have fine color treated hair and it was in extreme distress!  This styling lotion is a MUST if you dye your hair often and use styling tools often!</li>
    <li> I meant to order the Styling CREAM, but ordered the LOTION in error. (\\&quot;Lotion\\&quot; is more descriptive of the \\&quot;Cream\\&quot;)  This product is a watery styler (thus my misunderstanding).  Thought I&#x27;d try it, as shipping changes the dynamics of an exchange.  It does a nice job, is light-weight, but you have to use more product.  The result is nice body and natural shine.  (With the Cream, you use less, but there is a heavier, dry, dullness.)  As both products are pricy for what they are, I will probably save this Lotion for special occasions, as I do the Cream.</li>
    <li> I have medium length layered hair and have not found anything that works better on my hair than this product.  I spray on towel dried hair and style with a roll brush and hair dryer.  I get such great soft volume.  Whatever frizz I may have is gone with the use of this product.  The best thing about the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; is that I can&#x27;t even tell that there is any product in my hair.  It makes for a nice soft hold.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and had high hopes for a miracle when I bought this product.  I was looking for something that would smooth out my crazy frizzies and make my hair look more sleek.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I followed the instructions on the bottle and something went very wrong.  My hair became sticky and I could barely pull my brush through without extreme pain.  The lotion did make my hair a little less frizzy, but I was expecting dramatic results for product that is popular and much more costly than other brands.  I used up quite a bit of the product trying to acheive the results that were advertised.   Unfortunately it never happened.  It may work on different types of hair though.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before from retail stores. I love the product and enjoyed the fast service through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, but I can only use once a week because I&#x27;m probably allergic to it. If you are sensitive to hair products like this, test it first, they sell it in a smaller size.</li>
    <li> Seaweed conditioner is good but the lotion is not all that good. I read the ingredients on the bottle I bought. Rosemary and other herbs was listed first. So I thought it would be ok for me spray more. It appears to me that the makers of this product kept the acrylics and alcohols hidden from in its contents. My hair felt stiff with less shine.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FROM B&amp;B - WORKS WELL IN HAIR</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product that I keep in stock.  A little goes a long way and it is not too sticky.</li>
    <li> I used Bumble and Bumble a few months back and it worked wonders on my hair - whether it was dry or wet, it was a good product that protects my hair when I&#x27;m blow drying it. After I ran out, I decided to try another popular product, TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, and it was not nearly as good. Suffice to say, I&#x27;ve gone back to B&amp;B Styling Lotion for my blowdrying/styling needs.</li>
    <li> Bigger than my usual spray size, but for the sale price it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m a return buyer, love this product. Smells nice and works great. Only tip: must dry hair soon after applying this.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my B&amp;B Styling Lotion bottle arrived yesterday.  I recently started going to a salon where they use B&amp;B products and just loved the results from them and from the samples they gave me to use at home.  I wanted to get some shampoos and the Prep and Styling Lotion for sure but was hoping to find them at a discount.  When I found the Prep and Styling Lotion on Amazon I was very excited.      I used both for the first time last night and see a noticeable difference with how my hair looks and feels.  It looks like it did at the salon which I am not usually able to achieve.  The styling lotion helped smooth my hair when I blew it dry and it just looks fresh and not oily.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more B&amp;B items!</li>
    <li> I like the idea but it weighs my straight hair down.</li>
    <li> Really works.  Spray it in and your hair looks better than you could imagine!  Recommended by my hairdresser and greatly reduced when buying at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the real product. Smelled/looked watered down. Very disappointed, won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I love this styling procut from Bumble and Bumble!  I have lots of fine hair and so many product will weigh the hair down, but this one does not.  It gives me enough body to blow dry and just go.  Combine with a little grooming creme and you are good for the day.</li>
    <li> came in a very timely fashion and was exactly what I wanted product seems authentic</li>
    <li> I think that each product works for a different type of person or hair, and this turned out to be the case with this line of product that has an unbelievably good reputation, especially here in CA. Sorry, not for me. I found it ineffective and totally taking away whatever little volume my hair had. Oh well, I tried. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work.  It&#x27;s a excellent &#x27;base&#x27; to any other styling product.  Use this on damp hair before you style, and it really does amplify the usability of all of your other styling products... or if you are going for the natural hair look... this makes my other wise unruly, fine, easily tangled hair soft and compliant to stay where I&#x27;ve put it.</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair.  Adds lots of volume.  Pair with hairspray for all day volume. Leaves hair a little frizzy, rather than shiny smooth, but if your cut has lots of texture, it works well.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this to help hold in curl.  Spray on wet or dry hair.  This really helps the curl from falling out or straightening.  I have used this for several years and happy to see it cheaper at Amazon vs the saloon.</li>
    <li> Everybody needs staying power for their style!  This is the best product I have tried.  And a nice size bottle.</li>
    <li> works for&lt;br /&gt;blow drying&lt;br /&gt;styling&lt;br /&gt;heat protection&lt;br /&gt;straighter&lt;br /&gt;curling - heat or natural drying&lt;br /&gt;scrunching&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like having this one product that works well for everything so I don&#x27;t have to keep trying multiple speciality products that together cost more than this and that never seem to work. This stuff is an easy go to that works better than pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Depending on how much you use, you can get different effects. It seems to reactivate with water too. It is a wet fine mist so when using it for straightening make sure you have it pretty far away to avoid wet spots.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now. I have fine, thin hair and have never used anything before or since that has provided the volumizing effect without weighing my hair down that this product has.</li>
    <li> works great, 1/2 the cost than my salon charges, no scent, spray wet or dry, great for thin hair!  yahoo</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Found it works better than most spray on lotions. Been using this product for 10 years! Easy purchase through Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best!  I live between the states and Mexico so I always order a boxful to ship south and keep plenty here to have on hand so I don&#x27;t run out.  It is great for spraying on my hair as I use my hot rollers ... it creates a lovely curl which lasts all day.  I don&#x27;t see it on the shelves anymore so order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I loved Bumble and Bumble years ago and had a hard time validating the price, but this product is just GREAT and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Use it with the Bumble&amp;Bumble tonic lotion and the thickening hairspray for the perfect blow out. This is a better price than anyplace else I have seen.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  If it came in some form that didn&#x27;t require me to spray it on (sprays end up all over the bathroom) I would give it 5 stars.  I have fine, thin, straight hair and this stuff allows me to keep a style in for a few days and it feels like there&#x27;s no product on my hair.  I&#x27;ll admit that I still reach for my mousse if I want to keep tighter curls in for several days but for looser styles that look and feel very natural, this is great.  You do need to saturate your hair with it though for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, keeps my hair from frizzing or being too dry, but I feel as if I could get the same results elsewhere for cheaper.</li>
    <li> Product did not work as I expected. My hair is fine and product made it soft and limp even after using volume products.</li>
    <li> This costs 3 x more in salons. Great for scrunching hair in morning- Love the smell too. They have great products all in all</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine, color-treated, short hair.  You don&#x27;t have to use much to get some good support for your style.</li>
    <li> Ah, not as great as the kerastase products, albeit significantly cheaper. Makes my hair sticky when it&#x27;s humid outside.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem that great of a product. Helps with tangles a bit, fewer flyaways when I blow dry, and I do like the shine it gives my hair, but I don&#x27;t notice any changes to volume or hold.</li>
    <li> Works well. Priced below salon prices.</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble styling lotion gives fine hair body and bounce.</li>
    <li> Product was not the same quality as in the store</li>
    <li> I accidentally order this rather than the Bumble &amp; Bumble Styling Cream, which is a totally different type of product.  Don&#x27;t use too often, but when I do, it works o.k.</li>
    <li> I made this comment about another B&amp;B product but it is exactly what it is and doesn&#x27;t appear to be fake in any way. Good buy.</li>
    <li> ....the spray top was faulty, so I had to buy a spray bottle and pour the styling lotion into it so I could use it. The product itself is helpful at giving my thick and wiry straight hair some body.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just me but I think this product smells a little like a wet dog .  the smell really turned me off but it also made my hair sticky and tacky feeling . I haven&#x27;t used it before this so I am wondering if it is expired or a bad batch?</li>
    <li> It is not at all like the Bumble and Bumble styling lotion I used to use.  I was very disappointed in how thin it is.  The one I always used before was a mix of mousse and gel, and was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Most  excellet product!  You don&#x27;t realize how good it is until you don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and It holds without being heavy or sticky feeling. It can be a little hard to find but won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It gives my hair body and holds the style well.</li>
    <li> Love this light medium hold styling lotion. Bumble &amp; Bumble is one of my favorite product lines for my long &amp; thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a little pricey, but lasts a substantial amount of time. I am constantly asked what products I use on my hair. This gives you control, but also gives that touseled look we all want that doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;overly fixed&#x27;. I use this product, the volumizing product (purple label) and just a spritz of hairspray, and I&#x27;m set for the day.</li>
    <li> It protects without weighing my hair down.  I don&#x27;t have much else to report on the product.  It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I just spritz it through my hair after towel drying; then blow dry and style as usual. My hair is slightly layered and a bit below chin length and the clear \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; gives body, shape, and light control while its light moisturizers maintain a soft, natural look. Those moisturizers also help to detangle your hair and give it more strength.  It offers excellent protection from the heat and stress from styling tools.  Another thing I like about it is that there&#x27;s absolutely no flaking off of the dried lotion. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and, unlike mousse or gels, you don&#x27;t have to work the product through your hair with your fingers...so no sticky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been buying this styling lotion for years at a local salon, but I found that I can usually get it for a much better price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Decent product. Too pricey for me, when others like it are available for less $.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s not crunchy or stiff and doesn&#x27;t even look like something&#x27;s in my hair.  It helps maintain that just-finished-blow-drying volume for an all day look.  As its not a hair spray, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold.  I found it a lot more effective when I had shoulder length hair.  Now that my hair is a good 7-8 inches past my shoulder, it doesn&#x27;t hold up the volume like it used too-- probably just from the weight of my hair alone.    After blow drying my hair every day for years prior to using this product, and everyday after finding this product, I can definitely verify that it has protected my hair from a lot of damage.  Its been almost six months since my last haircut and I barely have any split ends! and no dry tips!</li>
    <li> I first got this at a salon$$$. The price is a bit more tolerable on amazon. I have wavy hair and I can style straight or curly with just this one product!!  Don&#x27;t need to use much or it can become a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have EXTREMELY thick and long hair. I have long layers in my hair and I like it when the ends have a little flip at the end, it makes the layers more noticable and gives my hair some movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a free sample from Sephora a while ago and I never used it because I had no idea what it was and I always forgot to look it up. I sprayed some in the ends of my hair before blow drying it with a round brush just a few weeks ago on a whim and I am HOOKED! This product holds the shape from the round brush prefectly and it holds it until the next wash (which for me can be 2 days). The product is so light it does not feel like you have anything in your hair at all. It also has a very faint smell, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I think once you blowdry it any scent is gone. The item is a little pricey but personally I feel it is worth it for when I blowdry my hair to go out on the weekends and want my hair to look nice for pictures and such. I also may use a bit too much, I will try to cut back and see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend this product to anyone loking for a lightweight style hold.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s very light weight and it smells great. The product lasts a long time. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE B&amp;B&#x27;s styling lotion. It&#x27;s some of the best smoothing lotion you can use daily with out having to worry about build up or breakage from overuse. Also the smell is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I had originally been given samples of this product. I was reluctant to try it. Once I did I was pleased at the results and have used it since. ordering here on Amazon is a convenient way to obtain the product.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair body without weighing it down and leaves it with great shine!  I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love the B&amp;B Styling Creme, but because my hair was getting a little dry, I decided to try the lotion. It might work well on long hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hold mine well at all.  I kept it because I have a gel I can mix it with for more hold.  From now on, I&#x27;ll use the creme!</li>
    <li> This staying lotion is great to layer with a defrizz solution.  You can get a very polished and sleek look that stays in place.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I spray it on my hair while my hair is still went, then style with a round brush and blow dryer. It&#x27;s light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down or sticky, yet allows me to style my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this spray on a whim and I am not regretting my impulse purchase! I am a fan of the Bumble and Bumble products and use many, but this one is my new favorite. I use it after I curl my hair, or just spritz it on if my hair needs a little lift.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth trying!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very good, do not spend the outrageous amount of money they want for this!  Get some cheap stuff, it will work better.</li>
    <li> I use this after every wash. It does not seem to build up and really helps my long hair hold curl in the ends.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that does not hold style when curled or straightened easily, however, this is my go to styling product when I curl my hair, holds the curls nice and long without making my hair crunchy feeling, I got it from a CCO.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair or styling when using this product. This has been disappointing for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; Christmas stockings.  They have been raving about this product and others from Bumble so I gave it a try.  Where have you been most of my life!!!  You use very little and it goes such a long way!  It has made my hair much more manageable, easier to style and keeps it looking great for days.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love the results!  I also love the holding spray.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years &amp; the 2 bottles I got from this seller seem really watered down! It is not working the way it should! This stuff is great, I would recommend buying it straight from Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
    <li> We love Bumble and Bumble products. We use the Seaweed Shampoo and the Seaweed Conditioner. This is their styling lotion product. The scent is very nice and it gives a nice, silky sheen.</li>
    <li> Otherwise I would never pay this much ...but it will last a very long time because you only need a little, little bit.  It does make the difference with my long, limp, hair that gets the hot iron daily.  So...try it.</li>
    <li> This holds the curl well when I use hot rollers.  I think every product out there will dry your hair to a certain degree when used every day...</li>
    <li> I love this styling lotion. I have thin, fine, fragile hair. I highlight it often, blow dry everyday, &amp; flat iron at least 5-6 days a week. I use it heavily before I blow dry, and light before I flat iron. My ends are softer and I am noticing less split ends. I also have more volume in roots.</li>
    <li> Maybe helps build body, but I dislike the smell and it can make my fine hair sticky.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have very dry hair from blow drying and using a flat iron daily and this seems to make my hair look a bit less dry! It smells really nice and is also a great heat protectant spray. This is definitely a deal for this, the salons normal sell it for aroun $28 so buy it here!</li>
    <li> Great product! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a flexible hold when styling!</li>
    <li> Like others have pointed out, this product comes out heavy of the bottle, instead of as a mist. I even changed the pump, and it still comes out like a stream, making it impossible to get a light, even application. Instead I get sections of my hair with way too much product. It&#x27;s pretty much useless - I am guessing this is a grey market product, because I loved it when my hair dresser used it and misted it on.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but to expensive at my salon. You can even use this on your skin. My stylist keeps a bottle in his car on hot days to spritz his face while his AC is cooling down. Instant refresher.</li>
    <li> I use this first on my damp hair and then layer over it with Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hair Spray before blow drying.  The combination of these two products gives me a blow dry like no other products I have tried (I have a shelf full) and lasts on my straight hair for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This lotion ids very kind to the hair as well as a good styling product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have very fine hair and most products weigh it down too much. This provides the perfect amount of gold without my hair feeling greasy or heavy. Thanks bumble and bumble!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It gives my hair some control while styling without leaving it stiff or full of gunk.  I recommend this to anyone who wants some control without looking &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the Bumble and Bumble name. I have very thin hair flat hair. This styling lotion gives my hair just enough hold to style while keeping it soft and shinny. The price is worth it for the fresh out of the salon look everyday!</li>
    <li> I have short, very fine hair and have found that this B&amp;B styling lotion helps give me some body without the wieghing my hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried using several other products but keep coming back to this styling lotion (which is kind of a misnomer since it&#x27;s a light spray).  I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy product or hair that is stiff so this works great.</li>
    <li> Could be less expensive.</li>
    <li> I love Bumble and Bumble products, however, this is not that same product I buy directly from Bumble and Bumble.  Knew the price was too good to be true.  Would not recommend ordering this from anywhere except Bumble and Bumble directly</li>
