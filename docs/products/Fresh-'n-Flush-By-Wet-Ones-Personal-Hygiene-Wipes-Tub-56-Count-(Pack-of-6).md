      <li>I can&#x27;t begin to explain how glad I am</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times we have placed orders to make sure we always have them on hand.</li>
      <li>More per box for price.</li>
      <li>and these are pump and tank friendly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all the brands of wet wipes and these are the best.  </li>
      <li>My family really enjoy and love these.&lt;br /&gt;Myself for fishing and camping</li>

      <li>so it&#x27;s great that Amazon offers it on subscribe and save program.</li>
      <li>I love to always be clean</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re easy to dispose of afterward.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t pop up, but they are easy to take one by one.</li>
      <li>They are folded and piled in the container and are fairly easy to get a hold of.  </li>
      <li>It is strong and seems to hold up and not break apart like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>They are strong.</li>
      <li>These are not bad, but there are better products and dispensers out there.</li>
      <li>She has a need for these and being able to flush them without stopping up the pipes (as has happened in the past with non-flushable stuff used), is excellent.</li>
      <li>The Fresh &#x27;n Flush is the best thing to come along in a long time.</li>
      <li>Our septic tank was just pumped, and it was filled with these wipes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these (purchase from a different vendor) and they are great, except they are not truly flushable because the do not breakdown in the sewer system or septic tanks.  </li>
      <li>We really like the Fresh N Flush wipes--very good for the skin.  </li>
      <li>What I love most about these wipes is they are gentle and flushable.  </li>
      <li>keeps you freash clean and no resedue.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that will keep that area smelling clean and refreshed these will do the job.</li>
      <li>I gave it as a special thank</li>
      <li>These are great wipes because they don&#x27;t irritate my bum like some other brands, but I wish they didn&#x27;t have any scent to them and the container had a dispenser.</li>
      <li>hard to find in stores around me and its great to be able to buy them in bulk instead of one at a time.</li>
      <li>Wipes are moist, but not overly so, and have a clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Anything to keep fresh and feel clean.</li>
      <li>I can reuse only so many of the tubs, but buy them anyway as it is more cost-efficient.  </li>
      <li>These are a decent size and great for personal use, in the car, picnic baskets, and will not clog the septic system.</li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>When you are sore, Wet-Ones Fresh&#x27;N-Flush is the one you will reach for.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>Fresh</li>
      <li>I think that they are superior over other brands.</li>
      <li>I know that I am clean &amp; refreshed and not have to worry about clogging up my septic with twice or thrice more toilet paper.</li>
      <li>Large enough with a nice amount of moisture.  </li>
      <li>these are nice, not overly scented, very strong and stay moist right to the last wipe if you keep the box closed</li>
      <li>I love these, very wet and strong.</li>
      <li>I was happy that these come in a smaller box than I expected, however, the containers do not have a quick grab slot.</li>
      <li>They are the only one&#x27;s that hold up and are comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;clean up the kids from playing or eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I just wish more of the store&#x27;s had them</li>
      <li>Most of the time you cannot find them locally.</li>
      <li>They contain the most moisture, are larger, and seem to be the strongest.  </li>
      <li>They clean well, are soft and unlike the others, they are almost frictionless in use.</li>
      <li>When I first got these, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the lid was going to keep the wipes moist after long period of non-use.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing as advertised and flush easy (even if you don&#x27;t have a super flushing toilet!)  </li>
      <li>Thanks much!</li>
      <li>The product itself if far superior to other brands.</li>
      <li>The box is  bit flimsy, the top may come loose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are a decent size and great for personal use, in the car, picnic baskets, and will not clog the septic system.</li>
    <li> Couldnt find them in the stores anymore. I was getting discouraged. Then when I saw them on line for a good price I was very happy. Thanks for getting the product to me fast.</li>
    <li> I seldom review products but I have to tell you this is the best flushable wipe out there.  I have tried many brands and most are so weak that my fingers bust through the wipe.  This one is larger and stronger than others and the aloe and witch hazel are very soothing.  Great product.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so it&#x27;s great that Amazon offers it on subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> These are the only personal hygiene wipes that truly stay moist.  Buy only this brand for an effective assist to personal hygiene.</li>
    <li> These are a great complement to toilet paper, they work great. I just hate not having them when I have to use a public bathroom.</li>
    <li> Use them once, and you&#x27;ll never go back to conventional paper again! I can&#x27;t begin to explain how glad I am I found these things. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Works like its supposed to :) The pack of 6 is a great deal, probably the best I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
    <li> these are nice, not overly scented, very strong and stay moist right to the last wipe if you keep the box closed</li>
    <li> Fresh &#x27;n Flush&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re in a rush&lt;br /&gt;If in your haste&lt;br /&gt;You left some waste&lt;br /&gt;Skidmarks are in&lt;br /&gt;Very bad taste!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife, who states that she really don&#x27;t know how she as done without these Wet Ones. Great.</li>
    <li> The Fresh &#x27;n Flush is the best thing to come along in a long time. keeps you freash clean and no resedue.</li>
    <li> Most of these types of wipes are alcohol based, which can be irritating and dry out the skin. These aren&#x27;t - and don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These wipes do the job. They are tough but flushable (unless you use like 10 of them) and the scent is alright too.</li>
    <li> Stays moist, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and they&#x27;re easy to dispose of afterward. Will continue to use/purchase.  Thanks much!</li>
    <li> After using these wipes for several years, my grocery store stopped carrying them.  I was greatly relieved when I discovered I could get them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both really like these clothes. They are a little larger than some and strong. I have purchased several times and plan to continue.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it literally cleans up all dirts on anywhere. Bad thing about this stuff is that tower must be used after to clean up soaps-like stuff after using this item. Overall, it is best for the price. I think it is good to have in the car if you are a smoker. xD</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in the drug stores. They have witch hazel and aloe and are simply the best &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; wipes on the market.</li>
    <li> the description is a lie, they are not large. they are very small. Useless except for toileting. I recommend Tranquility cleansing wipes.</li>
    <li> Got these because of the witch hazel, but we think they&#x27;ve irritated our sensitive parts where a different brand containing witch hazel did not &amp; have discontinued their use. They are quite perfumey.</li>
    <li> I had used cottonelle wipes in the past, but they dried out my skin and were a little irritating on the bum. These smell nice, get the job done, and are non-irritating</li>
    <li> Great product! Unlike other wipes it doesn&#x27;t have a rough grain that tends to grab hairs as you wipe. According to consumer reports this product is 1 of two wipes that you can actually flush without to much concern of clogging your plumbing. Don&#x27;t know how I managed before I was introduced to this wipe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. I love to always be clean an these make sure I am. Will be getting more.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy these at Walmart but for some unknown reason they stopped carrying them.  I will continue to buy online even though it is a hassle but well worth it. All other BW&#x27;s on the market pale in comparison.</li>
    <li> These are not bad, but there are better products and dispensers out there. They are mild, except for the witchhazel which can sting a little, but it&#x27;s an antiseptic and is healing. My complaints are that the country of origin is not listed anywhere. When that is the case I suspect it&#x27;s China and that is a little concerning re the integrity of the ingredients. My other complaint is that the package has no interior separator, so pulling a single sheet out can be a bit of a frustrating.</li>
    <li> These were a very favorable purchase.  I wish that I could find them again, on Amazon, and I would buy them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the brands of wet wipes and these are the best.  They contain the most moisture, are larger, and seem to be the strongest.  They don&#x27;t develop mold like other brands I have owned.  I wish they came in a pop up tub, my only issue is that they can be difficult to separate.  Wish I could install them in public restrooms.</li>
    <li> Wipes themselves are the best on the market......but they claim to be flushable and safe.  Have learned that just might not be the case.  I haven&#x27;t run into trouble on that end and won&#x27;t since I am not flushing them any longer.  Oh well...</li>
    <li> Fresh &#x27;n Flush By Wet Ones Personal Hygiene Wipes Tub, 56-Count (Pack of 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the price &amp; the natural soothing ingredients. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I know that I am clean &amp; refreshed and not have to worry about clogging up my septic with twice or thrice more toilet paper.</li>
    <li> I used to wipe my butt with plain old toilet paper, but now that I got these products my butt hole has gotten really spoiled.  Now it wants only the finest in cleansing products.  It even whispers to me when I sleep, though people tell me that I&#x27;m just hearing flatulence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these (purchase from a different vendor) and they are great, except they are not truly flushable because the do not breakdown in the sewer system or septic tanks.  After doing a little research, I discovered that wipes (bum wipes, baby wipes, etc.) are clogging up sewer lines and septic tanks all around the world because they do not breakdown. Even so called &amp;#34;flushable&amp;#34; feminine hygiene products do not break down after flushing! All of these items have to be manually removed from the sewer system at the water treatment plant (unless they get stuck in a clog before they get to the plant!). Once they are removed from the sewer, they usually buried in a landfill by the tons! One notable example of flushable products causing clogs was recently reported in London where sewer workers reported removing a 15 ton clog that was comprised of &amp;#34;wrongly flushed grease&amp;#34; and wet wipes! The removing these clogs and repairing the damage that cause is driving up utility cost for all of us. Sewer and waste management authorities are recommending that people dispose of all of these so called flushable products by throwing them in the trash after use---not the toilet! The only thing that should go down the toilet is human waste and toilet paper!  Following these recommendation would make using the toilet even more fun than it already is, right? Yeeeeeech!  http://youtu.be/JvoJbsnBdlg</li>
    <li> Have tried others and always go back to the Wet Ones they are hard to find in the stores so always able to get them from Amazon and the price to me is good.</li>
    <li> Used similar wipes in the hospital, so added these to my bathrooms when I got home. Never used wipes like this before, but I find they&#x27;re useful and a good addition to the bathroom. Guests seem to like them as well, and the packaging is reasonably attractive.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I usually used wet baby tissues but I decided to take this product because of its good reviews and the ratings were totally wrong. I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wish they were a little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> They stopped carrying this in local stores near me, so I was excited to find it on Amazon!  Great product, works well!  As another reviewer commented, I would not flush these either as they are thick.  Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> These wipes are tough to get the job done but don&#x27;t have anything in them that irritates... unlike another brand.  They are folded and piled in the container and are fairly easy to get a hold of.  I like that they aren&#x27;t all perfumed up nor smell like baby wipes.  So far, they are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> We really like the Fresh N Flush wipes--very good for the skin.  HOWEVER, just because you CAN flush them, you should not.  Our septic tank was just pumped, and it was filled with these wipes.  They don&#x27;t break down and will eventually clog your system. I gave these 3 stars because the packaging leads one to believe that you can safely flush these...it&#x27;s even in the product name.  If you use them, don&#x27;t flush them and save yourself some aggravation and money.</li>
    <li> This is a must for those with sensitive skin. This is the only wipe that does not cause irritation. It has natural ingredients like aloe &amp; witch hazel which is soothing and won&#x27;t chafe your skin. It is strong and seems to hold up and not break apart like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love these, very wet and strong. No tearing like other brands. Leaves you feeling much fresher than toilet paper alone. I have to have them! Please bring back Prime shipping on these!</li>
    <li> More per box for price. Fingers won&#x27;t break through. Larger size wipes than other brands. They smell good. Best I have tried!</li>
    <li> Love these.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve discontinued them.  Doesn&#x27;t make any sense.</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores around me and its great to be able to buy them in bulk instead of one at a time. they work real nice.</li>
    <li> I had been buying the refill packages for a tub that we already have.  The top is coming off the tub though and that&#x27;s not very practical.  Refills can be opened and resealed but that&#x27;s not very convenient when you have kids. Bottom line, it&#x27;s about the same price to get them in the tubs or soft packs.  I figured by the six pack of tubs once and save them to continue to use with the refill packs.  We recycle but still I wouldn&#x27;t want to get the tubs every time.  So that&#x27;s the outside, now for the inside... I recommend this product for all ages.  Very soothing as advertised and flush easy (even if you don&#x27;t have a super flushing toilet!)  There are some brands of TP that we don&#x27;t use because of flushing issues but have had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Much better than Charmin or other brands.  So much softer and not drying like TP.  Recommended by a doctor.  Great</li>
    <li> I was happy that these come in a smaller box than I expected, however, the containers do not have a quick grab slot. When you open the lid, you must try and scrape each direction to find the fold in each wipe and slowly peel it from the stack. Otherwise, the whole stack will pull out of the container, which is inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with wipes being so irritating and burning.  These are superb.  They are a little expensive, but I believe they are worth it.  They used to sell them in individual packs, but due to loss of sales, they stopped.  I guess I could wrap some in foil and baggies for travel if I had to.  Anything to keep fresh and feel clean.</li>
    <li> I keep these on the back of the toilet for a final cleansing after using TP. I also use them occasionally to freshen up my underarms. They say they are flushable, but I usually don&#x27;t chance it because we&#x27;re on a septic tank and these don&#x27;t look like they would break down very quickly. They are strong. I just throw them in the trash afterward. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you have to open up a box lid, but that&#x27;s more reliable than some products (the rolls) that are supposed to pull out but always seem to fall through the lid so you have to go in to retrieve the end of it.</li>
    <li> The perfect balance of smoothness, wetness, and size. Were always hard to find fir some reason. Too bad they discontinued these.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use especially with the Bottom Buddy. Although product says flushable; with my septic system I cannot take the chance to do so. I left a sample sheet soaking in water to see if it would dissolve; it did not. I just spent $3000 dollars for a new system and I do not want to run the risk of septic failure due to decomposition issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does not irritate. Also they can be use  for cleaning just about anything, I wish they continue making individual wrapping  to take in my pocket.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t pop up, but they are easy to take one by one. The box is  bit flimsy, the top may come loose. It works though. The wipes are thiner than other brands, but the get they job done.</li>
    <li> smell nice not so easy to take out with one hand but when used with toilet paper for a cleaner wipe it works</li>
    <li> I like the dispenser boxes of other products better.  I had a problem with the lids on these breaking off before the contents was used. This means you can not use for refills.&lt;br /&gt;I like the boxes of other manufacturers who have a more stable box and lid</li>
    <li> We have used this brand of Fresh&#x27; n Flush Wet Ones for a long time, these are our brand to use .</li>
    <li> She has a need for these and being able to flush them without stopping up the pipes (as has happened in the past with non-flushable stuff used), is excellent. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times we have placed orders to make sure we always have them on hand. And in all that time, the pipes have never backed up as, like I said, they did with other products.</li>
    <li> This product is not available in retail (or big-box) stores.  Why are there fewer sheets in the refill packages than in the tub?  I can reuse only so many of the tubs, but buy them anyway as it is more cost-efficient.  The product itself if far superior to other brands.</li>
    <li> These personal wipes have witch hazel and fewer chemicals than other wipes.  I don&#x27;t see why you require so much from a user.  I have used these wipes for years and I no longer can find them in stores.</li>
    <li> I have used wet ones fresh&#x27;n flush in the past which I bought at my local store.  I recently moved, could not find them and ordered on line.  I think that they are superior over other brands.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes.  They have witch hazel in them, so they are very soothing.  They cleanse well, and don&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> A good wipe but sometimes, &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; can be irratating to a sensitive bottom.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Love the witch hazel.  Large enough with a nice amount of moisture.  Can not find at stores.  So, very happy to be able to purchase here.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. They are much more expensive in the local drug store.  Most of the time you cannot find them locally.</li>
    <li> When I first got these, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the lid was going to keep the wipes moist after long period of non-use.  I&#x27;ve been using the same container for a couple months now, and they&#x27;re just fine.  Wipes are moist, but not overly so, and have a clean fresh scent. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My family really enjoy and love these.&lt;br /&gt;Myself for fishing and camping&lt;br /&gt;My folks for bathroom use since they are flushable.  They are the only one&#x27;s that hold up and are comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;clean up the kids from playing or eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I just wish more of the store&#x27;s had them but at least I can still find them Online for now.</li>
    <li> These are great wipes because they don&#x27;t irritate my bum like some other brands, but I wish they didn&#x27;t have any scent to them and the container had a dispenser.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this item I thought it was a bit expensive.  But I still have 2 tubs after 3 months.  What I love most about these wipes is they are gentle and flushable.  If you are looking for a flushable wipe there isn&#x27;t a better one.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. Best price out there. Furthermore they don&#x27;t irritate me at all and the soothing + cleaning effect is very very nice. Will continue buying them when needed. Highly recommended! Thank You Wet Ones! A life saver!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will keep that area smelling clean and refreshed these will do the job. Good value and price.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST. FORTUNATELY, THEY DISSOLVE AND ARE OK FOR USE IN A SEPTIC TANK.</li>
    <li> Does the job and they will flush, but ....our plumber drug out a couple handfuls of these from our stopped drain. Costly!</li>
    <li> I gave it as a special thank you gift to a very special friend, the kind of guy who has everything.</li>
    <li> These wipes are okay! They&#x27;re a bit small and very wet for the size of them, but they do work and are flushable, which is an added bonus. I like that they do not have alcohol, and do have witch hazel, another bonus.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and with Prime shipping you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> great product, I wonder why noone ever talks about it.  But we like them anyway and these are pump and tank friendly!</li>
    <li> Ahhh! Why aren&#x27;t these on shelves at my local stores? They are far better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. They clean well, are soft and unlike the others, they are almost frictionless in use. You know the last thing your &#x27;rhoids want is friction. I&#x27;ve tried Charmin, Cottonelle and CVS brands, and the Wet-Ones are the run-away favorite. Of the others, Charmin has the better fabric, soft enough, though the liquid ingredients are inferior to Wet-Ones. Cottonelle is not as soft and a bit dry and non-lubricating. The CVS brand is equivalent to a sheet of notebook paper that&#x27;s been buffed with sandpaper and soaked with isopropyl alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;  When you are sore, Wet-Ones Fresh&#x27;N-Flush is the one you will reach for. Hard to find, but worth it at almost any price. If you suffer, you know, there is no pain like a pain in the bleep.</li>
