    <li> This is one of the best scents on the market. Why spend $60 for a bottle when you can get this so reasonably priced!!</li>
    <li> Received in good packaging with no damage. Just the fragrance I was looking for. It is the same as the clear \\&quot;moves\\&quot; that comes in the Adidas 3-pack that has the 0:01 or something. Sorry for the bad info on that but I no longer have it anymore. Would recommend this to anyone looking for the cheapest price on this cologne.</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive cologne.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Its my #1 cologne since I was 15. Needs to be a tad bit cheaper though!</li>
    <li> I thought I I was buying the liquid, but I guess I did not read the page correctly. And I ordered the airasol that I did not want. Maybe your page could have been clearer.</li>
    <li> Scent didn&#x27;t stay very long, suspect it was watered down.</li>
    <li> I bought my best friends 2 oldest boys these because they smell good my son use to wear it and it smelled nice hope they like it for Christmas</li>

    <li> The picture for this product is very misleading. The bottle itself depicts Adidas Moves, not Adidas HIM. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I like. It smell good. Sometime women like it too. Buy with money. Use on many clothing, never have to wash clothes again. Smell stick real good in warm weather but fade off in poop weather. Don&#x27;t spray into mouth, taste bad, smell good.</li>
