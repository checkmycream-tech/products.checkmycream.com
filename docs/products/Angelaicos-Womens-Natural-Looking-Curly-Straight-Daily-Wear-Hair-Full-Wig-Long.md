      <li>If this happens I hair sprayed it with aqua net and curled it with curling tubes and it worked great.</li>
      <li>If you are a cosplayer like me who wants everything perfect and as close as possible then this wig isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>I got it really quick, and I was like a kid at Christmas.</li>
      <li>but besides that, it&#x27;s very pretty colors.</li>
      <li>super soft, doesnt shed much, not too shiny, love it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
      <li>This was a fun costume addition for halloween.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
      <li>I prefer that extra security when wearing wigs of any kind.</li>
      <li>but it is NOT the right color</li>
      <li>and I thought this one was the right one....</li>
      <li>First I tried to trim it off, but I don&#x27;t want to ruin it, so I stopped doing that.  </li>
      <li>The color is exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t look cheap but is obvious its just a &amp;#34;for fun&amp;#34; wig.</li>
      <li>It is very noticeable that it&#x27;s a wig.  </li>
      <li>This wig is purple lilac on top and very bright/light pink tips.</li>
      <li>Big enough for my huge head, I wear it whenever I go out and always get compliments!</li>
      <li>The fade to pink looks more natural because of the this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super obvious and I have no idea how to fix this.  </li>
      <li>The front kind of shows the wig line but overall its really not noticeable.</li>
      <li>I still highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wig for costumes and cosplays.</li>
      <li>But if I&#x27;m wearing a wig in a packed night club and it&#x27;s hot, then I don&#x27;t really want to wear extra head gear.  </li>
      <li>The only con I have to say about it is that the front part on top where the threads come together you can kinda see it on the very front and that&#x27;s a thumbs down</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>Very adjustable, my head is small but this wig fits very well and could accommodate a larger person easily</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
      <li>The reason I give it a 3 stars is because it is soft</li>
      <li>The color was as pictured (purple to hot pink) and it was softer hair than I thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>Super thick and soft.</li>

<li> The part and hairline are extremely well done.</li>
<li> Please, don&#x27;t read the other reviews &amp; just buy it</li>
<li> For the same price range at costume stores such as Costume castle and Party city you get cheesy wigs for about 30-50 dollars.</li>
<li> If you ask me it was a little too heat resistant.</li>
<li> I had a little trouble curling it with a curling iron.</li>
<li> totally wrong!!</li>
<li> I hate thinking that it&#x27;s just going to sit on it&#x27;s stand and never be used.  </li>

    <li> This seller goes out of their way to make customer feel better. Thanks Angelicos for you communications and great product. Efficient returns procedures.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and very soft! Very adjustable, my head is small but this wig fits very well and could accommodate a larger person easily</li>
    <li> It fits well and looks like I dyed my own hair. A lot of people didn&#x27;t know it was wig.</li>
    <li> This wig is fabulous! I got it really quick, and I was like a kid at Christmas. The wig is very soft, and is a beautiful color. This definitely did not disappoint!</li>
    <li> This was a fun costume addition for halloween.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! Super thick and soft. Included the wig cap as well. I cannot believe the quality for the price. Will by any future wigs as this brand n the future!</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Came on time. Love it</li>
    <li> It did its job. It is very noticeable that it&#x27;s a wig.  I still highly recommend this. It&#x27;s very soft to the touch. It is great quality for it&#x27;s price. For the same price range at costume stores such as Costume castle and Party city you get cheesy wigs for about 30-50 dollars. I prefer this wig over costume store wigs any day. I had a little trouble curling it with a curling iron. If you ask me it was a little too heat resistant. As soon as you get it I recommend that you spray it with hair spray so it doesn&#x27;t uncurl. If this happens I hair sprayed it with aqua net and curled it with curling tubes and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I just love it 😍 the color its beautiful and it&#x27;s so soft. It&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
    <li> I love the color, the softness, the curls and the fit.  The only complaint I have is that the very front part of the wig shows the black cap underneath.  It&#x27;s super obvious and I have no idea how to fix this.  First I tried to trim it off, but I don&#x27;t want to ruin it, so I stopped doing that.  Then, I did a loose front braid to try and cover it to hang it to the side.  That may or may not work. It looks good with a headband or hat on top to cover it.  But if I&#x27;m wearing a wig in a packed night club and it&#x27;s hot, then I don&#x27;t really want to wear extra head gear.  It tangles easily, but also brushes out nicely and still holds the original curls. I hate thinking that it&#x27;s just going to sit on it&#x27;s stand and never be used.  I&#x27;m not buying anymore wigs in this style though.  They will have to have some kind of bangs or side bangs to be sure to hide any design flaws like this. Thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Gamora wig for the longest and I thought this one was the right one....totally wrong!! The wig might be beautiful but it is not the right color for Gamora. If you are a cosplayer like me who wants everything perfect and as close as possible then this wig isn&#x27;t for you. The color does not match the picture and it&#x27;s totally lighter. Gamora&#x27;s hair is black/brown with red/pinkish tips/ombre. This wig is purple lilac on top and very bright/light pink tips. The reason I give it a 3 stars is because it is soft but it is NOT the right color AND it doesn&#x27;t even match the picture displayed.  Cosplayer BEWARE of this item!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig! I get compliments every time I wear it. Quality is great.</li>
    <li> Very pretty wig! The only con I have to say about it is that the front part on top where the threads come together you can kinda see it on the very front and that&#x27;s a thumbs down but besides that, it&#x27;s very pretty colors. Looks just like the picture!</li>
    <li> super soft, doesnt shed much, not too shiny, love it!  the color transition is smoother in person too:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a wig before and I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It does have flaw of not being a place front wig but, honestly it&#x27;s a great price for what it is. I love it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quicker than anticipated. They kind of overestimate on it. This is a very nice wig. It fits my larger head because the wig netting is stretchy. The part and hairline are extremely well done. The color is different than pictured as they warn, but it works perfectly for my needs. The purple is lighter and has pink hairs within it. The fade to pink looks more natural because of the this. I highly recommend this wig for costumes and cosplays.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic quality wig! Doesn&#x27;t feel synthetic at all! So soft and styles wonderfully and it&#x27;s a fabulous fit! I&#x27;ve been doing theater productions for 10 years and have been a costumer for 9 and I LOVE THESE WIGS!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wig and it is simpley gorgeous and fun to wear!! Big enough for my huge head, I wear it whenever I go out and always get compliments! You will love this wig !!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig and feels soft despite being synthetic. Sheds a lot when I brush, but I won&#x27;t be using this much, so no big deal. My only big complaint is the bulky pattern around the front forehead area. That could be a manufacturer issue. Also not having built-in combs for extra security is a concern. I prefer that extra security when wearing wigs of any kind. Maybe I will have a stylist add some. The color is exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture. That was mind blowing. I was expecting the picture to be exaggerating color like majority do. The color is what influence me to buy from the start.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a bachelorette party. Loved it! The color was as pictured (purple to hot pink) and it was softer hair than I thought it was going to be. I put it over my curled hair without the wig cap and it stayed on all night. Didn&#x27;t look cheap but is obvious its just a &amp;#34;for fun&amp;#34; wig.</li>
    <li> This was AWESOMEEE! I got a zillion compliments at the wig bachelorette party and mine stole the show!!!</li>
    <li> Used this wig with my Gamora costume and everyone loved it. The front kind of shows the wig line but overall its really not noticeable. It looks great on me and flows naturally.</li>
    <li> Love it love love it, by far the my favorite wig, doesn&#x27;t shed bad, love the color, feels amazing , I am very happy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ok.. This wig is amazing!! I saw some of the reviews, and I started to have doubts, but I bought it anyway. And I&#x27;m so glad! It&#x27;s so pretty! It&#x27;s the best quality wig I&#x27;ve ever felt! Please, don&#x27;t read the other reviews &amp; just buy it😂💞</li>
    <li> The netting under shows at the part.</li>
