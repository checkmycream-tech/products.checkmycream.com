      <li>In reality, they are virtually identical and pleasantly so.  </li>

      <li>Did I mention it&#x27;s amazing?     </li>
      <li>I bought some of this lotion for her on a whim, and she said it was amazing.</li>
      <li>This lotion moisturizes and has a nice liquidy texture but without being too oily.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and silky and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I have to say I am absolutely thrilled.</li>
      <li>The scent is awesome; very feminine.  </li>
      <li>I liked the silky feeling but noticed that I could feel a bit of tackiness under my clothes afterward.  </li>
      <li>It was nice to try</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly say I believe it does this mineral renewal it claims.</li>
      <li>but I always use body lotion after the shower, and Sheer Infusion is a perfectly satisfactory moisturizer; however there isn&#x27;t anything particularly remarkable or above-average about it.</li>
      <li>The mineral smell is nice; it was my favorite of the three scents.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and feels good after 8 hours.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Sheer Infusion is the best lotion I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent, not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is Mineral Renewal.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is more slippery than substantial, so not for after-bath application.</li>
      <li>This is every bit as good as higher priced lotion.  </li>
      <li>This new mosturizer worked great.  </li>
      <li>The lotion absorbs quickly and seems effective.  </li>
      <li>I really like the Aloe Fresh lotion better for a hand lotion, but this one is good for legs and arms and smells nice.</li>
      <li>I received has a very pleasant smell, and my skin was left feeling smooth and non greasy (like the lotions brands that I have).  </li>
      <li>From the silky smooth feel to the ever so light smell of jasmine!</li>
      <li>I love using it on my hands as it leaves them smooth and \\&quot;silky\\</li>
      <li>The pump on the bottle I received doesn&#x27;t work, but I am going to ignore that and give this lotion 4 stars based on how smooth it makes my skin and the lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I like to spend time outdoors and a good lotion/ointment can be very beneficial.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, the fragrance is very strong, not unpleasant</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion that provides supreme moisture in a very light, sheer finish.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and you could feel the mosturizing effects.  </li>
      <li>The smell is divine, the absorption easy and complete.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>The lotion smoothes on realatively easily, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of rubbing to work it into the skin.</li>
      <li>After applying it, my skin feels very silky, not greasy, not sticky, but silky, almost like running your fingers over a soft wax, would be the best way I can think to describe it.</li>
      <li>This lotion still leaves my skin looking amazingly radiant and silky feeling for a good 12 hours after application before I notice it&#x27;s effects starting to fade away.     </li>
      <li>Vaseline has come out with an outstanding product that not only leaves the skin silky smooth but also smelling so great.</li>
      <li>and this really helps to keep my hands hydrated, healthy and crack-free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the smell of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>it provides relief for thirsty skin with super-moisturizing ingredients, disappears into the skin leaving no greasy residue and makes the skin feel silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Both are great products and I&#x27;ll definitely use this product again.</li>
      <li>my skin feeling: smooth, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing:</li>
      <li>If there was a fragrance free version or another choice of fragrance</li>
      <li>But what is important is that it smells</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this lotion is, having been a Lubriderm user for many years.</li>
      <li>Note that it&#x27;s a small bottle, but this lotion could easily be the best out of the Vaseline label.  </li>
      <li>Another lotion claiming to keep your skin super smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have had great results even using it on the dry skin on feet.</li>
      <li>The lotion has a very light, almost imperceptible scent that I personally liked because I was able to use it with any number of body soaps or washes.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
      <li>Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is a good bargain buy.  </li>
      <li>it feels nice and soft.</li>
      <li>The amount of lotion in a bottle lasts a good bit of time even with daily use.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t verify the \\&quot;mineral renewing\\&quot; properties, but the lotion seems effective for keeping my skin supple and soft in this early-winter weather.</li>
      <li>I thought it was good, but didn&#x27;t think it was all that, especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>This lotion provides a nice balance of moisturizing action and fragrance.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin moist and smooth, it has a very light scent that isn&#x27;t offensive (and I have a sensitive nose).</li>
      <li>Get this lotion if you are having trouble finding a great priced, light scented lotion that soaks into  your skin and doesnt feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>The effects of the lotion itself, however, do not fade away quickly.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I keep having to order more because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes her skin feel better.</li>
      <li>We have also been very impressed with how long the moisturizing effects of this lotion last.  </li>
      <li>I originally reviewed this product when it first came out in 2009.</li>
      <li>I would definitely try it since I really liked the feel of it on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin when it comes to scented products and this product did not bother it as much as most lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It is not very smelly which is good.</li>
      <li>Silky smooth upon application and is absorbed into the skin very well.  </li>
      <li>To be quite honest, I have never been a big fan of Vaseline brand lotions.</li>
      <li>Seems like it kind of heals and moisturizes at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Probably just as good as any other lotion.</li>
      <li>Believe me, I have all kinds of lotions and this one ranks right up there on my list.  </li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s got a very perfume-y smell that was pretty strong at first.  </li>
      <li>I thought Aveeno was good until I tried this lotion, now Aveeno is just average in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used another version of this lotion, Vitamin Burst, and couldn&#x27;t tell a great difference between this mineral version and the other, except for a slight difference in the very light scent.  </li>
      <li>After application, the lotion leaves the skin with a soft, radiant glow that manages to give my skin a very healthy look, especially in sunlight.</li>
      <li>but rather smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;d like to note, is I suffer from moderate t severe Dyshidrotic Eczema on my hands and feet, and many skin care products, even moisturizing lotions tend to cause a lot of stinging and burning sensation when applied.</li>
      <li>I always like Vaseline products but recently, found them to be even better.  </li>
      <li>have used many different kinds of lotions...</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Sheer Infusion.  </li>
      <li>The first thing is that it works and works well.  </li>
      <li>I would love it if they made Vaseline Sheer Infusion into a shower gel or body spray.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is also a certain smell that I cannot identify.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> New Body Lotions From Vaseline.    From the giant Anglo-Dutch combine Unilever&#x27;s Vaseline brand come three new body lotions under a Sheer Infusion marketing title.  Two of them: Mineral Renewal and Botanical Blend, have been tested here, each being a pleasing product within an enormously crowded field of competitors.  Each comes mainly in a 13.5 ounce plastic bottle having a pump atop.  One might wonder at why those responsible for the product&#x27;s distribution would opt for its claims and ingredients being printed in small black letters upon a dark blue background, therewith making the reading of this material very difficult.  The products do have identical content except for fragrance, where the Botanical Blend item offers eucalyptus and cypress tones.  In reality, they are virtually identical and pleasantly so.  Following several weeks of usage, it can be stated by this reviewer that each does its job of moisturing quite well.  However, with literally many hundreds of other body lotions available, it would be very difficult indeed to state that they are better than most competitors.  However, based upon such factors as the ease of absorption into troublesome dry areas such as elbows and knees, and a tendency for the texture to remain non-runny, these can be recommended for most individuals.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have become big fans of this Vaseline Sheer Infusion lotion for a number of reasons.  The first thing is that it works and works well.  Even on dry or cracked skin this lotion seems to sooth and soften.  As I type this its winter time here in Chicagoland, and this lotion is really helping with the dry skin caused by winter extremes.  We have also been very impressed with how long the moisturizing effects of this lotion last.  Applying it once or maybe twice per day seems to do the trick! Finally, I personally hate the greasy feel of some lotions and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to leave that greasy feel on my skin for hours after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a superior product that I would happily buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was on sale at my supermarket and I&#x27;ve been looking for a new lotion. It&#x27;s overly fragranced and felt sticky going on. Even worse, when I took a shower that evening, it felt as though I had a slimy film to wash off my skin! I would never buy this again, and frankly the only reason I will finish the container is because of the price.</li>
    <li> This Product is above the rest. It has items, within its compounds for Healing skin problems. It     has been a Great asset to me.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth upon application and is absorbed into the skin very well.  No greasy or oily residue.    It has a great fragrance that is appropriate for men or women.  I have used this for few weeks and it keeps my skin from becoming dry especially since we are coming in to the dryer months leading to winter.    I have had great results even using it on the dry skin on feet. It has softened the skin and helped rid any cracks.    The amount of lotion in a bottle lasts a good bit of time even with daily use.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: August 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like this lotion enough that we continue to buy it in preference to other brands.  I think that says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different kinds of lotions... Eucerin, Aquaphor, Curel, etc.  I like to spend time outdoors and a good lotion/ointment can be very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big deal here is the alleged (and patented) \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot; complex.  Which promises to moisturize each layer of your skin.  The lotion does work above average, but its difficult to say how much better it is because of this complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  Not neutral enough for me, but its ok.&lt;br /&gt;Left my skin feeling: smooth, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: Above average.  We&#x27;ve all used those crappy hotel moisturizers, or those \\&quot;bath and body works\\&quot; cutesy scents.  This moisturizer definitely outperformed those.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity:  Above average, but I think slightly less than aquaphor (which can leave you feeling quite greasy).&lt;br /&gt;Value: Fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  it came across as a high quality moisturizer.  Everyone in our family has tried it and has reported that it was satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the mineral renewal?  Well, maybe I would be able to report on that with extreme, long term usage.  But as it stands today I feel its not possible for me to isolate this feature and identify whether it provides a real value.  it could just be marketing hoopla.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion is a quality product. It&#x27;s unscented, not super thick or thin, absorbs easily. I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry skin but I always use body lotion after the shower, and Sheer Infusion is a perfectly satisfactory moisturizer; however there isn&#x27;t anything particularly remarkable or above-average about it.</li>
    <li> This new mosturizer worked great.  It was easy to apply and you could feel the mosturizing effects.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This review is written after I&#x27;ve used this product every other day on my arms and face for three weeks.  I gave it this long to see if had any positive or negative effects since I have very sensitive skin that can be easily irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion went on a bit thick but it didn&#x27;t leave behind and greasy or waxy feeling though I could still tell it was there for several minutes until it all soaked into my skin.  I&#x27;m not a fan of scented products and this had an undefined scent that also faded after a few minutes.  As far as renewing minerals... yeah, I&#x27;m not sure what that is supposed to look like or feel like. All I know is that my skin felt less dry for about two days after I used it, nothing irritated my skin, and nothing felt too greasy or heavy after the first few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good lotion but I can&#x27;t honestly say I believe it does this mineral renewal it claims. So just buy it help your skin feel less dry without some of the negative a lot of lotions can deliver such as rashes, greasiness or overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not really all that much that can be said about lotion. Either it does what you want or it doesn&#x27;t. This lotion moisturizes and has a nice liquidy texture but without being too oily. It works as a face lotion even though it&#x27;s not specifically designed to be a face lotion. For anyone with dry skin this lotion does the trick and lasts a long time after being applied.</li>
    <li> This lotion is more slippery than substantial, so not for after-bath application. The smell is divine, the absorption easy and complete.&lt;br /&gt;But the surface emollient quality is, well, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Five minutes after application, I was reaching for more.&lt;br /&gt;And five minutes after that, I was reaching for another product entirely.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with extra dry skin on my legs.  This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that consistently cures the itch.  It also has a soothing &#x27;neutral&#x27; scent.  Really want the company to bring it back!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very nice.  I love the fragrance.  The pump on the bottle I received doesn&#x27;t work, but I am going to ignore that and give this lotion 4 stars based on how smooth it makes my skin and the lovely fragrance.  I actually have the Sheer Infusion lotion in Vitamin Burst, too, and I like this one much better.  There seems to be a difference other than just the fragrance.  I didn&#x27;t like using the Vitamin Burst on my hands because of the greasy feeling but I don&#x27;t get that with the Mineral Renewal.&lt;br /&gt;This line seems to be a bit pricier that some other Vaseline lotions.  I really like the Aloe Fresh lotion better for a hand lotion, but this one is good for legs and arms and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I had never used any Vaseline products beyond their Petroleum Jelly, before trying this body lotion. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this lotion is, having been a Lubriderm user for many years. This lotion has a light fragrance that is slightly floral, but fades away rather quickly. The effects of the lotion itself, however, do not fade away quickly. The lotion comes out of the bottle at an average consistency, though the pump on this bottle dispenses slightly more lotion per full pump than I expected. The lotion smoothes on realatively easily, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of rubbing to work it into the skin. After application, the lotion leaves the skin with a soft, radiant glow that manages to give my skin a very healthy look, especially in sunlight. Vaseline hit a homerun with how this product makes my skin feel as well. After applying it, my skin feels very silky, not greasy, not sticky, but silky, almost like running your fingers over a soft wax, would be the best way I can think to describe it. This lotion still leaves my skin looking amazingly radiant and silky feeling for a good 12 hours after application before I notice it&#x27;s effects starting to fade away.     One thing I&#x27;d like to note, is I suffer from moderate t severe Dyshidrotic Eczema on my hands and feet, and many skin care products, even moisturizing lotions tend to cause a lot of stinging and burning sensation when applied. Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion does not sting, burn or otherwise seem to irritate my skin, which is a huge plus for me. Compared to the Lubriderm with Shea and Cocoa Butters I have used regularly for the past several years, this Vaseline body lotion is better feeling, longer lasting, and produces more noticeable results. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin.  It does not matter that I use a moisturizing body wash and then slather oils, cremes, lotions on my still moist skin - by the next day, I am flaking white flakes off my arms and legs and the rest of my skin looks leathery.  Now I have found a product that keeps me feeling soft and silky the next day and beyond with no flakes!  I don&#x27;t think I will ever run out of Vaseline Sheer Infusion!  I really had given up hope of ever having youthful, moisturized skin again until I tested this.</li>
    <li> So, this lotion goes on well, absorbs fast, and leaves my dry, winter skin well-moisturized thoughout the day.  But, it&#x27;s got a very perfume-y smell that was pretty strong at first.  It hasn&#x27;t bothered me thoughout the day, but on first application, I&#x27;m not thrilled.  Still, I&#x27;ve been using it regularly.  But I probably won&#x27;t buy it again; I&#x27;m still looking for a lotion with no distinctive odor, but that goes on well.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I have ever used and I am sad it is discontinued.    I ordered the pump bottles but got the smaller travel size, that was disappointing but  am really just glad to still have some product.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and have tried almost every lotion on the market.  I absolutely love Sheer Infusion.  My favorite is Mineral Renewal.  The scent is awesome; very feminine.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of scented lotions so this is just enough.  It goes on nice and silky and lasts all day.  The only con is that it is a little pricey.  I go through a 6.8 oz bottle in about 2 weeks.  But I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not a fan of body lotions that are scented since using them all over can smell a bit too much for me.  I liked the silky feeling but noticed that I could feel a bit of tackiness under my clothes afterward.  It was nice to try but I don&#x27;t anticipate buying it.</li>
    <li> Another lotion claiming to keep your skin super smooth and moisturized. Does it work? Probably just as good as any other lotion. I like it and use it, but I don&#x27;t have exceptionally dry skin, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.</li>
    <li> This offers some powerful moisturizing.  I have dry hands from working outside and they take a beating with the extreme temps (especially right now, winter) and this really helps to keep my hands hydrated, healthy and crack-free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and feels good after 8 hours.  Do not care for the scent. But my kids like the scent.</li>
    <li> I tried a little while I was shopping around for lotion and had to get it. I am still amazed how soft and silky it makes my skin feel. I thought Aveeno was good until I tried this lotion, now Aveeno is just average in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes your skin all day and it feels nice and soft. It even makes my skin LOOK healthier. The mineral smell is nice; it was my favorite of the three scents. Since I am a man I guess it was the least woman-ish smelling (it is pretty neutral, smells like any \\&quot;original\\&quot; scented lotion). I recommend this to anyone. Amazons price is roughly the same as Walmart so you have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion that provides supreme moisture in a very light, sheer finish.  I&#x27;ve never experienced a lotion that goes on so light, yet provides such deep and lasting moisture to my extremely dry skin. The lotion goes a long way, because only a small pump provides a lot of coverage.  The lotion has a very light, almost imperceptible scent that I personally liked because I was able to use it with any number of body soaps or washes.  I&#x27;ve used another version of this lotion, Vitamin Burst, and couldn&#x27;t tell a great difference between this mineral version and the other, except for a slight difference in the very light scent.  Both are great products and I&#x27;ll definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion lives up to its assertions:  it provides relief for thirsty skin with super-moisturizing ingredients, disappears into the skin leaving no greasy residue and makes the skin feel silky and smooth.  However, the fragrance is very strong, not unpleasant but it is not the type of fragrance I like to wear. It also lasts a long time. So even though I loved the moisturizing effects I didn&#x27;t keep using it because I could not get used to the fragrance.  Therefore I cannot testify to the long-term effects of this lotion. Those who like the fragrance will be delighted! If there was a fragrance free version or another choice of fragrance I would definitely try it since I really liked the feel of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I originally reviewed this product when it first came out in 2009. I thought it was good, but didn&#x27;t think it was all that, especially considering the price. Then my mother, who lives in a cold dry climate in a nursing home with forced-air heat, told me she was having terrible issues with dry itchy skin. I bought some of this lotion for her on a whim, and she said it was amazing. I keep having to order more because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes her skin feel better. I started using it myself this winter, and I&#x27;m now hooked. Apparently, so are a lot of other people, because the retail stores have trouble keeping it on the shelves. The only place I can buy it is through Amazon.com.     I love this stuff. It keeps my skin moist and smooth, it has a very light scent that isn&#x27;t offensive (and I have a sensitive nose). I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll keep using it when winter ends - it may be overkill for warmer weather - but it&#x27;s going to be my winter lotion forever. Did I mention it&#x27;s amazing?     Vaseline, please step up production! We need more!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of lotion, especially in summer and I enjoy the smell of this lotion.  Although I do not find that it is a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; which is much more needed than plain lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I use it for my hands, elbows, and face.  When you wear it, you get that feel for hours and hours that your skin is protected.  It stays on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a certain smell that I cannot identify.  But what is important is that it smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a vaseline product, attractive bottle.  ...Rizzo</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin especially during the winter months. My wife and I use this product on our hands and we are both impressed on how silky it feels. For us, there is no need to use a lot of this product when applying. A small amount goes a long way. I recommend to those with dry skin who don&#x27;t want to keep reapplying during the day or after washing hands.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Mineral Renewal, 13.5-Ounce Bottle.  I received has a very pleasant smell, and my skin was left feeling smooth and non greasy (like the lotions brands that I have).  I plan on trying the other two (Botanical Blend and Vitamin Burst) versions also.      I would love it if they made Vaseline Sheer Infusion into a shower gel or body spray.  I think it would be terrific!</li>
    <li> Most excellent product!  I recommend it to anyone that needs a lotion to moisturize (as opposed to using Mineral/Baby Oil)!  Five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Buy both the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Mineral Renewal&lt;br /&gt;2. Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use them together - for the skin you came in!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this, especially in the winter. Elbows, hands, legs, and chapped cheeks. It works well everywhere. It&#x27;s just lotion so there is not much else to say. It is not very smelly which is good. I hate smelly soaps and lotions.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this lotion.  I can&#x27;t verify the \\&quot;mineral renewing\\&quot; properties, but the lotion seems effective for keeping my skin supple and soft in this early-winter weather. I love using it on my hands as it leaves them smooth and \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feeling, a sensation some may think feels greasy, (but they aren&#x27;t), as well as on my body and feet, which have dry, calloused areas that I&#x27;ve been trying to resolve. I like the scent.  It&#x27;s lighter than many other lotions and would be acceptable for a man too, in my opinion.  The effects seem to last through light washing, which is a big plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I recommend this product if you are looking for a fair-priced body lotion that your family could use.</li>
    <li> This lotion provides a nice balance of moisturizing action and fragrance. Rubbing easily into the skin, Sheer Infusion does not leave behind the unpleasant greasy feeling one gets with some other brands; rather, the after-feel is as light and silky as the bottle promises. The very pleasant, gender-neutral fragrance is fairly strong and long-lasting, so this product is best for those who are looking for a scented lotion. Only a small amount of lotion is needed to feel the moisturizing effects, making the bottle long-lasting.</li>
    <li> To be quite honest, I have never been a big fan of Vaseline brand lotions. They always seemed to make my skin drier and flakier. Well, when I was given a chance to try this lotion I was apprehensive but decided to try nonetheless. I have to say I am absolutely thrilled. Vaseline has come out with an outstanding product that not only leaves the skin silky smooth but also smelling so great. I highly recommend this product if you have excessively dry skin.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is a good bargain buy.  The lotion absorbs quickly and seems effective.  I have sensitive skin when it comes to scented products and this product did not bother it as much as most lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands and legs and when I got this, I thought, here we go again,I won&#x27;t like it.  But...I was wrong.  First of all, the dispenser only dispenses the correct amount, doing away with waste.  It is light and soft and it sinks into your skin immediately.  I always like Vaseline products but recently, found them to be even better.  They are wonderful.  This is every bit as good as higher priced lotion.  It has a nice light scent, not overpowering.  Believe me, I have all kinds of lotions and this one ranks right up there on my list.  Get this lotion if you are having trouble finding a great priced, light scented lotion that soaks into  your skin and doesnt feel greasy.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Note that it&#x27;s a small bottle, but this lotion could easily be the best out of the Vaseline label.  Seems like it kind of heals and moisturizes at the same time.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! From the silky smooth feel to the ever so light smell of jasmine! Leaves my skin sooo soft; I can feel my skin drinking it up!</li>
    <li> Sheer Infusion is the best lotion I have ever used!  It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.  And my skin no longer is dry and cracked....but rather smooth and soft.  It is simply wonderful!!!!!!!!</li>
