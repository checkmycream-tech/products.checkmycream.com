      <li>The smell is amazing</li>

      <li>Then enjoy the sweet, delicious cotton candy vanilla fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite of all the Delicious fragrances!  </li>
      <li>Very nice musk but not as sweet as what the name Cotton Candy implies in my mind.</li>
      <li>but I have to leave the cap off because the lids has a very strong plastic smell.</li>
      <li>Candies is a sweetish citrus that I love, Gap Dream has kind of a grape/fruity smell</li>
      <li>It did smell sugary but at no point during the wear time did it become what I could call a warm or sexy scent.</li>
      <li>Candies is a sweetish citrus that I love, Gap Dream has kind of a grape/fruity smell</li>

      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>It smelled like a skunk around the top of the spray er where the cap comes off.</li>
      <li>Then I took a whiff of the lovely soft-plastic cap formed to look like a mountain lion.</li>
      <li>but like I said men love it and women ask what it is.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, get compliments every time I wear it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the smell and so does others around me. It was delivered to me faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this scent. So do I.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle smells good</li>
    <li> This is for sure delicious,I get complements everytime I wear it.  I also spray this on my sheets and pillow cases everytime I change them, the aroma is both soothing and relaxing.  Great fragrance for the summer (and all year) for it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves this scent.Very good price!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the loss of Candy Baby by Victoria&#x27;s Secret. Lusciously decadent.</li>
    <li> I ended up buy this at the mall one day after I had had it on my wish-list for months. Very true to cotton candy yet when I used it it had a warm smell and on my mum did it had more of a floral scent. Both where still very sweet smelling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume in high hopes that it smells like cotton candy based on customer reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy to me at all. But my daughter likes it so I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;I like Body Fantasy Cotton candy, now that smells just like Cotton candy and its way cheaper than this.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry...</li>
    <li> Wife really likes the scent - not over bearing.</li>
    <li> It is simply amazing. I love this perfume. I have &#x27;Delicious Feelings&#x27; which is a light fragrant. I also have &#x27;Delicious&#x27; which is a more heavier scent and long lasting. I give this perfume 5 stars. Most of the time when I put on perfume at the end of my work shift I can&#x27;t smell it anymore but this &#x27;Cotton Candy&#x27; I have been able to smell it all day. It&#x27;s great!!!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume actually smells ok, but it has so much musk in it that it literally chokes me to death when I put it on.  My husband likes it, but I can&#x27;t stand it... and I&#x27;ve tried several times.  It&#x27;s the first perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought that I can&#x27;t stand the smell of enough to wear it now and then.  Others I can take or leave but this one is horrid.  If you love musk you&#x27;ll love it, if you hate musk you&#x27;ll hate it!  I&#x27;ll give you mine if you pay the shipping just to get it out of my house lol!  :)  Heather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather UpChurch&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a cheaper perfume instead of &amp;#34;Pink Sugar&amp;#34; from Sephora. The smell of this perfume is GREAT, just as I hoped for; However, you do have re-apply as it doesn&#x27;t last as long as name branded from Sephora. I would def recommend this product if looking to save a little money. I will def. purchase again.</li>
    <li> The body spray smells great but I have to leave the cap off because the lids has a very strong plastic smell.</li>
    <li> If you love Cotton Candy, this is it, I love this cologne . It makes you feel pretty because you smell so sweet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s literally skunk in a bottle. I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas and as soon she started to take the manufacturer&#x27;s plastic off the box, we could smell it. Then she opened the box and to my horror, sprayed it. Our nasal passages began to burn, eye&#x27;s watered and the dog made this primal, guttural noise, got up and ran out of the living room. It was 22 degree&#x27;s that day, but every window in the house was open. Day&#x27;s later, I could still get a waft of it when I walked into the room. If you really hate someone or want a &#x27;Delicious&#x27;, literal, gag gift, this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance everybody comments and says I smell cotton candy or cookies and I be like its me. This fragrance can go for any occasion and is very pleasant and sweet. Good for kids or adults</li>
    <li> Reminds me alot of Aquolina pink sugar.</li>
    <li> The perfume came as promised. I love the smell lasted along time. I will definitely be ordering more from this seller</li>
    <li> I was wanting something that smelt yummy and pleasant to me, yet could turn a head.&lt;br /&gt;This is the sweetest smelling perfume, it lasts too!&lt;br /&gt;I work with a bunch of females, as well as men, so we tend to compliment one another when we smell something that we know is good.  This is it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too strong for your teen, but it isn&#x27;t too YOUNG smelling for you, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman likes to &#x27;sweeten&#x27; it up a bit and even if it is only to turn your husbands head, this will do it.</li>
    <li> It smelled so bad I threw it right in the trash when I got it!! Didn&#x27;t smell anything like cotton candy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and I get compliments constantly!</li>
    <li> I have had people follow me around in the store and ask me what perfume I was wearing! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love this fragrance! It was a blind buy that paid off well! Sticky sweet and delicious! Get compliments and curious questions all the time. I have been told they smell birthday cake to cotton candy.  I apply a few spritzes in the morning and one spritz in the afternoon for a refresher. Will buy again! Unforturnately, the Original Delicious and Delicious Feelings were a complete dissapointment.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells like a cheap version of Aquolina&#x27;s \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot;. It is way too musty and smells like rotten vanilla instead of cotton candy.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a sweet smelling perfume i would recommend buying Aquolina&#x27;s perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. There are cheaper and way better smelling body sprays.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,and smells like it should but with a more musky grown up not candy sweet is very nice,bottle is nice with a  cougar ornament on top bottle and top at a slant so cougar looks like its ready to pounce its a dangerous look I like it.😉 recommended for cotton candy lovers!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with full knowledge of the manic frightmare of chemical assault that would be unleashed upon my home with the unwrapping of this delightful item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll get right to the point:  The plastic crouching panther is made by cleaning the creases of Satan&#x27;s nether regions, mixing it with the concentrated squeezins of about a million plus two skunks, adding a decoction of old vinyl carseats from some junked 70&#x27;s muscle cars (and their little trees), including all the anxious high school athletic aggro-sweat from a whole lotta frustrated after game wrestling matches.&lt;br /&gt;Then they add some really bad stuff, then some nice pink color, and mold it into the lovely panther you see crowning the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received mine, it had spend its day travelling around in a UPS truck in 90 degree weather.  The power of the Hellish Sex Panther was in full roar.  it literally dissolved the pink color off the box, under the cellophane.  When I opened it, my husband, a grown man, openly wept and pawed ineffectively at his eyes.  The dog came to see what had bested him in creating a truly awe-inspiring stench to rival anything his small body could produce.&lt;br /&gt;I smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take the lid off, hide it far far away (perhaps secreted carefully away in a car of someone you despise, in the summer?  You&#x27;re welcome.  Then enjoy the sweet, delicious cotton candy vanilla fragrance.  You&#x27;ve earned it.&lt;br /&gt;You sex panther.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. I am in love with yummy cotton candy scents and was so excited to try this. I don&#x27;t know if its because I got a fake or what but literally this smells repulsive. I now know what people were describing when they were talking about the disgusting chemical plastic cap. I immediately threw mine away and washed out the spritzer hoping it would help and it didnt. Literally smells like garbage. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances and not only is this great and i dont get headaches, but it stays on for a full 24hrs and i get lots of compliments about it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this perfume  by 5 star  this is a slight  different, it works  Im happy with it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but decided to grab it on a whim at a local store because I like sweet fragrances and the price was right. It smells so similar to Aquolina Pink Sugar that I had to Google to see if Delicious was a knock off of that one. It&#x27;s good for the price. It does not smell like skunk (some must&#x27;ve gotten a very old batch) but agree that the cougar cap is cheesy looking and has a plastic smell but it&#x27;s nothing serious like some are making it out to be. I&#x27;ve purchased Pink Sugar in the past and didn&#x27;t buy again because it didn&#x27;t last more than an hour. Delicious is cheaper, and I think lasts longer, so if you&#x27;re a die hard Pink Sugar fan then try this one. Britney Spears Fantasy is still my #1 go to fragrance.</li>
    <li> This just smells horrible. It smells nothing like cotton candy, more like cheap perfume and stinks. DO NOT BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> I love this purfume. It smells like candy and to my surprise it lastt all day on my clothing. I enjoy it and will re purchase. Thanks</li>
    <li> Sweet perfume that lasts all day. You will always get the attention from people because it really smells like cotton candy.</li>
    <li> Lovely! My guy loves this soft scent! Lasting too!&lt;br /&gt;I use it after a shower before romance. Funny kitty top.</li>
    <li> ........weird kind of  plastic smell in the background on me....Nothing close to Pink Sugar.  However, you might have better luck as all of our chemistries are different.....</li>
    <li> Very much like Pink Sugar by Aquolina. Does not have a bad, plastic smell but it does not smell sweet and cotton candy-ish like Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Beauty Rush candy, baby (which is what I was wanting).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this one star, but not sure why I&#x27;m doing that. This does not smell like cotton candy, not even close. If you want to smell yummy, get Pink Sugar. I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
    <li> This scent has always been my favorite! I get compliments almost daily. Not too sweet, not overwhelming. Just an absolutely perfect scent!</li>
    <li> Everyone has their own tastes for perfume, so reviews for scent are exceptionally subjective.  I like this perfume because I like soft, sultry, musky, warm, delicately sweet scents.  I dislike floral and scents that are overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicious Cotton Candy does smell like cotton candy, but that is only the first note.  After that, you detect warm vanilla and musk.  I would say this is musky like Euphoria or Princess (Vera Wang), but sweeter.  However, the cotton candy scent is NOT as sweet as Pink Sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer cool fruity or floral, you may not like this.  I love it.  It is a sexy, sweet, soft, and warm smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Minus one star - it does not last long.  I get about four hours of scent.)</li>
    <li> Sorry, this didn&#x27;t meet my expectations!!</li>
    <li> I got this in hopes it would smell like the cotton candy perfume I normally love and wear, but this has more of a chemical smell to me and gave me headaches, so I trashed it.</li>
    <li> well buy another one as soon I am finished with the first bottle&lt;br /&gt;so sweet and stays for a long time</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I have bought so many brands of perfume, and for the price ;this has to be the best. It smells like candy- but how a women would want to smells , not a child. Every time I wear this perfume, everyone asks me; what I have on?( I just love it! )If you love Prada or Hard candy you will love this...I love you Gale Hayman.... Yummy! that is all I can say. 10 stars !!!!!</li>
    <li> ... I had to throw the entire package away, perfume and all.  It made my house smell so bad, that we had to leave to air it out.  What a shame b/c I have had this perfume before, and loved it, but ... bought it at a department store last time.  And, now, Amazon won&#x27;t even let me return it, so I am out the money, of which I can&#x27;t afford.</li>
    <li> No other way to leave this comment for others to know so I&#x27;m leaving it here.  Did you know that, if you purchase a perfume/cologne from Amazon... even under &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;, that if it leaks, is broken, etc... you can NOT return it because it is considered hazardous/flamable?????  Wish I had known this before as this arrived leaking all over the box, and now I&#x27;m just going to have to toss it in the trash and be out the money I spent for it.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks so bad. Musty smelling. I just threw it away. Then I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out of my nose all day.</li>
    <li> Yes ... my friends it is true my husband even gets turned on each and every time he smells&lt;br /&gt;Delicious Cotton Candy on me. I don&#x27;t plan to wear anything else,and refuse to even try anything else&lt;br /&gt;and to the people with the 1 star rating..... uummm all I can say is that if you lack the body chemistry&lt;br /&gt;for this type of perfume, do yourselves a favor and , yes try something else., don&#x27;t hate. thanks for reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lm&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
    <li> Very beautiful perfume bottle and I love the smell. My only concern is that it smells identical to a perfume called Pink Sugar. So I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have a different scent, but I still love it</li>
    <li> The yucky scent is coming from the cap, not the perfume. Throw the cap away and the problem is solved. That being said, the perfume itself is just so-so. It&#x27;s a sweet, mild scent... pretty, but no staying power. If you want something simple and light (maybe for a kid) this will do the job. If you want something more complex and with better staying powder go for Pink Sugar instead.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent for the last three years. I get many compliments on it and I love the way it smells. BUT, the bottle I received had very little of this delicious aroma in it. It smelled mostly of alcohol. I don&#x27;t know if they have changed the ingredients, or if I got an old bottle. I bought it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore. Sad that I don&#x27;t smell like I did:(</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this was at Ross but when I ran out I was bummed, until I found it for the same price here on Amazon! I love this perfume, even after hours of wear you can still lightly smell it on your skin. It is a sweet but mild smell and I get complimented on it all the time!</li>
    <li> This scent is not just for the younger generation. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and it smells wonderful. I get so many compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s not overwhelming...just a light, sweet scent that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> gave 2 stars cause of the packing process. the box was soaked, the packing air was soaked, the slip statement was soaked and the product itself all smelled just like POT! Not joking in any way.  It just blew in my face when I opened it. I smelled a little of it when I got near the box, then when I opened it, it was like a plume of stale pot air in my face. I am still trying to de-scent the bottle now and it has been 4 days. It is not the scent of the perfume, it is from whoever was packing the product. I will never order from these people again if this is how they take care of their customers. I was at odds to figure out if I should request a refund, send it back or try to keep it. I have yet to go near it. I have such a sensitive nose, asthma and I can&#x27;t stand the smell! They should know better!</li>
    <li> How many compliments I get wearing this cologne! It is one of the least expensive colognes and gets the compliments! What a great find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed with finding the perfect cotton candy smell I&#x27;ve bought a lot of perfumes like Prada Candy and Pink Sugar but this is by far my favorite!!!! I bought the set and from the body wash to the lotion and cologne I smell so good!! plus it&#x27;s not sticky or changes smells when you get sweaty! It&#x27;s great and more affordable than some of the others...Great wonderful yummy perfume...don&#x27;t eat it - you will want to but don&#x27;t lol!</li>
    <li> it got here and it stunk i threw it away</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good, makes me hungry for my lady. I was expecting it to smell a bit sweeter, but still up to par for a solid el toilet.</li>
    <li> I get compliments from strangers every day on how delicious I smell! Its subtle enough that you don&#x27;t have a cloud surrounding you, yet pervasive enough that it will have everyone in a 10 foot radius sniffing around to figure out where that devine scent is coming from. When someone walks into a room and says &amp;#34;something smells good&amp;#34;... yeah... IT&#x27;S ME!!! I love scents and put a lot of effort into coordinating my parfume, body spray and lotion to create a unique fragrance profile. After 10 years as a dedicated Victoria&#x27;s Secret PINK wearer, they discontinued and left me scrambling for a new base for my signature scent. I found this in one of those stanky mall perfume shops and I LOOOVE it! DCC is soft and sweet without being immature.... as if Love&#x27;s Baby Soft and that Cotton Candy spray for little kids grew up, got married and lit a vanilla yankee candle in their house. The scent lasts all day &amp; all night. Even after dancing for hours and being drenched in sweat, I still smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to anyone considering this instead of Pink Sugar - there seem to be 2 camps on the cotton candy fragrances; I thought the Aqualina smelled like charred sugar, but if you like it you probably won&#x27;t like DCC.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but it does not last and that is why I can only give three stars.</li>
    <li> I compared this with Aquolina Pink Sugar because I would really have liked to find a cotton candy scent I could enjoy for less than half the price. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t even a contest. What I love about Pink Sugar is the vivid olfactory illusion of fresh, warm cotton candy and skin, making it a scent as grown-up and sexy as it is comforting and nostalgic. While Delicious Cotton Candy lists the same notes as Pink Sugar, almost word-for-word, I found it to be thin in comparison, lacking depth and dimension, and with a strange artificial berry-fruit note. It did smell sugary but at no point during the wear time did it become what I could call a warm or sexy scent.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price for this product. Fragrance also has a lovely smell, doesnt stay on you for too long but for the price its definately a steal</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells like cotton candy without being too overwhelming. My hubbie loved it too! and it was very affordable - BONUS!</li>
    <li> love the bottle and the smell just like cotton candy got this for my niece, just might re order for me</li>
    <li> i love this smell very fun and sexy and lasts all day long i get tons of compliments on it</li>
    <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t really smell so bad, but it&#x27;s got so much musk in it that it literally chokes me to death!  My husband likes it, but I hate it so much that I can&#x27;t even wear it for him.  I&#x27;ve never purchased a perfume in my life that I couldn&#x27;t wear.  Usually I can take them or leave them, but this one is just nasty.  If you love musk, you&#x27;ll love it and if you hate musk you&#x27;ll hate it.  I&#x27;ve tried Pink Sugar too and it was way better but still not what I was looking for.  There&#x27;s an odd smell to it that I don&#x27;t care for either (like a hint of a burnt smell or something), but it&#x27;s ok and I can wear it.  My favorite is Fancy by Jessica Simpson.  I know, I wish someone else made it... anyone else lol, but it has a light, not too sweet/candy/girlish scent of cotton candy and vanilla.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite perfume along with a few others I&#x27;ll list below.  The only downside to it is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I think it should, but I get a ton of compliments on it every time I wear it!  Especially when I use Victoria&#x27;s Secret Candy Baby body spray underneath.  Other scents I like are:  VS Candy Baby, Lucky You, Versace Red Jeans, Candies (yellow and orange), Gap Dream, Halle Berry (purple, pure orchid I think, but it doesn&#x27;t smell flowery... it has a little bit of a fresh fruity smell), Euphoria CK, Intimately Beckham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Euphoria and IB are my least faves of the whole list... and the list pretty much goes in order from fave to least fave, though I might flip Halle and Gap Dream.  I got IB bc it was supposed to have a cotton candy/vanilla smell.  It smells good, but it&#x27;s got this note in it somewhere that reminds of me of horrid old women&#x27;s perfume and I can&#x27;t shake it.  I can wear it and it really does smell good and last a long time, but that one note turns me off just enough that I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.  Euphoria was given to me and it like it pretty ok.  Smells better in the air than on the skin for me, but still a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CB, LY, RJ smell kind of sweet and candyish.  LY and RJ smell a little more like an adult woman&#x27;s perfume, but not old.  Just right.  Candies is a sweetish citrus that I love, Gap Dream has kind of a grape/fruity smell as does Halle Berry but Halle Berry is better quality and smells less teenager-y.  As you can tell, I like citrus, sweet/vanilla and fruit smells.  I HATE musk and flowery smells.  Hope this helps someone!  :)  Heather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather UpChurch&lt;br /&gt;Art &amp; Design Studios&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]mell kind of sweet and candyish.

    <li> This stuff is great.  My daughter turned me onto it... she bought it at the outlet.  I cannot tell you how many people ask me what I am wearing... at work... on line in the grocery store... dr&#x27;s office etc.  Everyone says it smells great.  Some say it smells like something baking in the oven, sugar cookies, etc... I&#x27;ve heard a lot.  I love the spray and use it all the time...</li>
    <li> Okay-The fancy cougar-top is a pull-off, not a twist off. I made that mistake and spilled a bit on my sink!&lt;br /&gt;By itself it hits you with a very heavy \\&quot;skunky\\&quot; smell when not in contact with skin! (My bathroom smells like a skunk and I can&#x27;t get the smell out easily..)&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER- it absolutely changes when in contact with human skin (it metabolizes very well!) and the musky/skunky smell dissipates within 5 minutes. I&#x27;d say this smells far more like a warm marshmallow than a cotton candy and really the only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy it, but I was really hoping it would be more of a specific cotton candy smell.</li>
    <li> Enjoy this product very much!People  always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. My little secret to smelling sweet.</li>
    <li> Before finding this perfume I had a small 12 oz cotton candy perfume from a little gift shop that i loved. I was going to buy the same perfume when I ran out but it was far too expensive with shipping and handling. I wanted to continue to wear a cotton candy scent so I went searching for a new one. This scent was exactly what I was looking for. Its a sweet, musky, long-lasting perfume that is the perfect mix of warm vanilla and cotton candy. Its not over powering but it is definitely distinct. I love it!</li>
    <li> Its fair. I will wear it but would not order again. My thirteen year old daughter loves it. Smells more like air freshener to me.</li>
    <li> Smells just like Cotton Candy...yummy!!  If you love Pink Sugar you will love this also.  Great Price for the product.  Would definitely purchase again...</li>
    <li> When you first spray it on it smells very pretty and light, however, after a very little while the smell fades completely.  I really do love the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  The bottle is very cute but I was disappointed that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long at all.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful but I need to reorder as my package was badly damaged and all I got was smashed remains - needs better packaging</li>
    <li> Very nice musk but not as sweet as what the name Cotton Candy implies in my mind. I still enjoy the sent and it will be a nice switch from time to time.</li>
    <li> I received this fragrance tonight and it was tightly cellophane-wrapped from the factory, obviously new and unused.  So you can imagine my surprise when I removed the flacon from the box and saw some kind of dark matter or sediment floating in the liquid.  It obviously happened at the factory - perhaps the bottle was not clean?  Anyway, I had been eager to try this fragrance because it has received some wonderful reviews, but if the Quality Control where this is made is that careless, I don&#x27;t think I want to try another bottle.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that before in a brand-new bottle of fragrance, and I disposed of it in the trash immediately.</li>
    <li> It smelled like skunk straight up smells nothing like cotton candy Don&#x27;t buy if you are lookin for cotton candy... Made me vomit</li>
    <li> I love cotton candy smells. I usually use a cotton candy body spray (Body Fantasy) but I saw this and thought I would give it a try. The price was right and if you want to try something new, it&#x27;s worth a try. It is STRONG. I don&#x27;t really like a musky/vanilla type smell and I think this perfume might have too much of that for me. I am still trying to decide if I like it. I do get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Smells like old lady perfume...barely cotton candy at all...Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return it</li>
    <li> Smells good but b o thing beats Victoria secret unfortunately they discontinued theirs</li>
    <li> waste of money, there&#x27;s no lasting fragrance . Possibly too old of a bottle. Whatever it is I&#x27;m very disappointed . Paying the higher price I expected to receive a product that worked . Too bad, it&#x27;s probably a great fragrance I&#x27;ll never know as I&#x27;m too scared to try again</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! It smells Delicious!!</li>
    <li> very weak--smells good in bottle but does not linger on skin and have never gotten a compliment on wearing it--I love the bottle and figured when I bought it ,if the fragrance wasn&#x27;t great--I still had a very cool bottle--I have been tempted to give it to my friends 8 yr old--she would love that smell --but again--that lovely bottle</li>
    <li> On my second bottle already. Great smelling stuff. Love the bottle and price is awesome.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 16 year old daughter, she loved it so much she asked for more for Christmas. Everyone loved it at school even the teachers. Sweet, soft &amp; and very feminine.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this zero stars. So nasty. Smells nothing like cotton candy... it smells absolutely horrid.</li>
    <li> product is excellent smells sweet and beautiful would recommend to others to purchase if you like a sweet smelling fragrance</li>
    <li> love this.  also love the bottle it is just wonderful.  I have a collection of perfume and this just added to it</li>
    <li> My husband can&#x27;t get enough ! Also people around me always say...&amp;#34; Mmmmm I smell cupcakes &amp;#34; haHa they are always guessing what it is</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite of all the Delicious fragrances!  I love this stuff and so does my hubby when I wear it. Mom and sister want it now too.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, get compliments every time I wear it. Also the company is Awesome with their delivery, always on time or a day early.</li>
    <li> I love the sugar fragrance from other makers and couldn&#x27;t figure out why this one smelled like industrial plastic. Then I took a whiff of the lovely soft-plastic cap formed to look like a mountain lion. Well, the lion smells terrible, just like, well, industrial plastic. I took off the cap and spayed a couple of times to get rid of the residual odor. Now everything is fine. The spray smells great, the bottle looks pretty on my vanity even without the lion, and the lion went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great scent and not too overwhelming.  Large bottle received, so will last me awhile; I use this fragrance almost everyday.  Love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this perfume as a gift for my sis out of a bargain bin she really liked it! When My my dad  took me shopping for my B-day I wanted some fragrance to go with my fashions. I chose this and Baby Phat Goddess, not really knowing what either one smelled like. I fell in love with DCC! At times I have a serious sweet tooth and it spills over into my fragrance choices. It&#x27;s very sweet I don&#x27;t sense the musk, perhaps I remember the musk from the 70&#x27;s when I was a little girl and it was stronger then. This perfume smells of cooked sugar and vanilla. I get a lot of compliments. It seems to sneak up on people. After I&#x27;ve been around them someone mentions that something smells light and sweet. I seldom tell them it&#x27;s my perfume.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance so much. We relocated due to work and could not find it. Amazon has the best price and the perfume is the real thing. It is addictive. It is sophisticated and very playful at the same time. It is a high quality fragrance and you do not have to reapply it. It reminds me of my BVL 2 but it is so much better and lasts for days. BVL doesn&#x27;t. When you wear this men are crazy about this fragrance. It has chocolate and then vanilla and then the middle notes are like pink jasmine maybe a little ylang ylang and the base smells of sandalwood but what I love is during the dry down you never lose any of the top or middle notes. Your clothes and bed linens pick up the scent because of the oils even thought this is an EDT it is like a perfume. This isn&#x27;t a little girls scent nor an old lady&#x27;s scent but like I said men love it and women ask what it is. I won&#x27;t tell though. I have BVL 2 but it has nothing on Cotton Candy so yes I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the smell was awful. It smelled like a skunk around the top of the spray er where the cap comes off. The very first bottle I used was good it smelled like cotton candy I bought it from a department store in Jackson, Tn. This bottle no I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> i love the smell and would recommend it to my friends great price i paid i would order it again</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews i was so excited about ordering this perfume........ it took over two weeks to arrive and i was so anxious!!  i couldn&#x27;t open it fast enough and smell it!!  IT SMELLED LIKE BUG SPRAY AND BLACK LICORICE!!  i can&#x27;t believe anyone could say this smells good, i wouldn&#x27;t even wear it if it was the only thing i had on hand, actually going to trow it away so i will never have to smell this again!!  seriously!!!  and i didn&#x27;t notice when i ordered it but it has some sort of cat as the lid, mountain lion, cougar, don&#x27;t know but should have a skunk!! so tacky!!</li>
    <li> I do not smell the cotton candy scent as much as I would like with this fragrance.  It has more of a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; smell to me.  The cap did not stink on my bottle.  I will probably give this away.</li>
    <li> Smells like Cotton Candy! thanks</li>
    <li> Does NOT smell like Cotton Candy. Very upsetting :(</li>
    <li> I luv the smell of cotton candy so I purchased this perfume. The smell is amazing but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I give this perfume three stars out of 5 because of that reason</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy. Bottle was leaking. Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i see alot of bad posting but on the package it doesnt say its just the scent of cotton candy . theres more to it. i would say cotton candy vanillia is the best discription . and i like it . it does smell good and last a fair amount of time . For the price you cant beat it really . im giving it 4 stars becuasue its no DKNY but it does smell pleasent . :)</li>
    <li> Received on time. Bottle was cracked perfume all over box but ups still left it at my door step.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she LOVED it! She is a BIG fan of sweet perfumes and she says this is her favorite :) Shipping was incredibly fast too!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing perfume.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  I am addicted to it and so is anyone that is around me.  You know it is an amazing smell when you walk into a building and they say &amp;#34;Theresa is here&amp;#34;  I love that.  Never stop making this product.  I&#x27;d be lost without it..</li>
    <li> The fragrance is awesome, but it does not last as long as I would like. I love it though and have purchased another bottle of this perfume. I woiuld pay a little more for a stronger perfume.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I didn&#x27;t like it because when you smell it directly, it&#x27;s not as sweet as expected. However, when I walk around with it on my clothes, after a while it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. My cheapest perfume and the most compliments. I think I will continue wearing it!</li>
    <li> Just totally enjoy the sweet sugary smell. Each time I have it on I get several complements.</li>
    <li> It came within the projected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite impressed with the packaging, They definitely  wanted to make sure it came in one piece; bubble wrapped and those rectangular air pockets.&lt;br /&gt;As a sweet little bonus they included two fragrance samples AND a coupon!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely divine. My man LOVES candy scents on me and said I smelled good as soon as I had one spritz on. Five hours later and I STILL smell like a fluffy, syrup and vanilla covered pink cloud!&lt;br /&gt;It was a blind buy based on reviews and a happy one at that.&lt;br /&gt;LOVELOVELOVE.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this Perfume . I&#x27;m glad it was available.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It stays for a long time. :-)</li>
    <li> la fragancia es deliciosa, donde quiera que voy quieren abrazarme o acercarse a mi por mi olor. recomiendo este perfume</li>
    <li> Kind of weird. A little bit candy, a little spicier than I expected. Strong and intense. Maybe even cloying, but it wears down nicely and lingers close to you rather than walking with you like a big cloud of cotton candy and men&#x27;s cologne. If you want pure sexy or eat me up I smell like dessert, try Britney Spears Fantasy in the hot pink bottle. Smells like sex and candy, for real. Still looking for the one that makes my bf swoon.</li>
    <li> I know that this is a scent primarily targeted to teens and young-20s.  But, I&#x27;ve always gravitated towards scents that are sweet and food-related.  (I watch my sugar intake--so this is a great substitute!)  I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, and I get compliments every time I wear it.  If you like Pink Sugar, you&#x27;ll also like Delicious Cotton Candy.</li>
    <li> I got this Friday unexpectedly as I thought it would be coming in around the 1st of April. I opened and smelled the wonderful scent of &amp;#34;Cotton Candy&amp;#34;. It was&#x27;nt too overpowering, but does have a nice scent. I still could smell it hours later, but would re apply if I wanted to wear this out and have it continuously smell .</li>
    <li> I am a lover of gourmand fragrances. I have quite a collection of them. Cotton candy is my number one signature scent. Delicious Cotton Candy does not disappoint! I get so many complements where ever I go wearing this fragrance. It brings me back to my childhood. I find it wholly comforting.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume - I wear every day.  It smells like cotton candy and it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece,  but decided to open the cellophane wrapper and smell it before I gave it to her. Glad I did because it smelled like &amp;#34;peppy la phew&amp;#34; aka Skunk!! Needless to say, I did not gift this! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly the gift that my sister was looking for. It was hard to find in store, but the exact one she had been searching all over for.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves it and so do I. Great long lasting smell. Excellent packaging and super fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> A little powdery for my smeller. Stays on well though. The lotion actually stays longer and smells a little better though. But it is a sweet, girly, candy scent. I now mix mine with a vanilla body spray to cut the powder smell.</li>
