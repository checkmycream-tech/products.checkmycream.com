      <li>/&gt;This is by far the best cream/lotion that I have every used and for the price</li>

      <li>It feels good, smells good, and keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except I&#x27;m trying to move away from products with so many chemicals in them</li>
      <li>Got a better deal on a 3-pack of 8 oz tubes than I could find at grocery or drug store.</li>
      <li>This does not make your skin all oily and absorbs into the skin where as others just sit on top and leave a residue</li>
      <li>I love this Eucerin lotion.  </li>
      <li>Work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it even works better than the Eucerin Eczema cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought the 3-pack, as one is in my car, one in my kitchen, and one at my office.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve noticed when i put these on, they are drastically better</li>
      <li>Skin looks and feels better than fever</li>
      <li>Sometimes I overdo the retinol-based products and need something to moisturize without adding more irritation.  </li>
      <li>I love It</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s even better.</li>
      <li>got it for a lot better price.</li>

      <li>However, I need to be sure to use it twice a day or the rosacea reappears.     </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>As long as I am using this on my body and not my face, it is excellent.</li>

      <li>Sure makes you more willing to buy.</li>
      <li>Ordered Cerave, per doctor, and it works fine.</li>
      <li>It does indeed calm the itchy feeling and allows one to rest more comfortably.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not oily but so smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Bundle pack is well worth the savings!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve tried so many products for both myself and my one year old son.</li>
      <li>Use with Eucerin body wash for nice soft skin every day.  </li>
      <li>Our whole family love this product.</li>
      <li>Feels good just doesn&#x27;t seem to improve overall dryness.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best creams on the market for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
      <li>This one is good as long</li>
      <li>It is fantastic for sensitive skin since it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>And of cores received it right away.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing effect is good, thick paste, but easy to apply</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>It appears as redness, prominent spider-like blood vessels, swelling, or skin eruptions, These symptoms cause discomfort from itchiness, and burning, and can also cause your skin to become disfigured, such as, a bulbous nose.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got three giant bottles, and I will be reordering when we run out.</li>
      <li>I use this cream on my face instead of a regular face lotion and this works so much better.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s about to run out of his first tube, so I got him this multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Eucerin!</li>
      <li>I mainly use this cream on my face to help with my mild seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free &amp; made by same company that makes Aquaphor (product my artist recommended) that I used for the first 2 days.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to apply but just a little amount for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>Eucerin Calming Creme works great for me and it is unscented and very thick and creamy</li>
      <li>I have very itchy skin and have tried everything.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin products really seem to help me.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a real improvement in smoothness of my skin.</li>
      <li>I was very allergic to this cream.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing and not greasy, but stays on.</li>
      <li>Thanks ...</li>
      <li>Really lives up to the name.  </li>
      <li>And it is not greasy like so many other hand creams are.  </li>
      <li>I have spent top dollar on high end face lotions and creams and they do not compare to this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably on the heavy side for people who don&#x27;t have very dry skin, but it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many “high-end” brands, such as dermologica, clinique, kiehl&#x27;s and philosophy, but none of these performed well on my dry skin, and none of them are compatible with Retin A.</li>
      <li>I expected it to work a little more quickly than it does.</li>
      <li>I have acne prone and very sensitive skin also.</li>
      <li>I compared prices with multiple other retailers before purchasing this, and this was definitely a better deal.  </li>
      <li>they sent packaging for me to return to them and will give me a complete refund of cost paid to Amazon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am studying in Norway now, and the weather is dry, windy and freezing cold, all this plus the hot showers make skin dry, itchy and flaky...this lotion is amazing for all this issues, it works better than the organic, olive oil and shea butter offered here!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, a chronic skin condition involving inflammation of the cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, or eyelids. It appears as redness, prominent spider-like blood vessels, swelling, or skin eruptions, These symptoms cause discomfort from itchiness, and burning, and can also cause your skin to become disfigured, such as, a bulbous nose.      My doctor prescribed metronidazole (MetroGel), a topical antibiotic gel. MetroGel is very costly, between 50-60 bucks per tube, and can have some serious side effects. It flakes when it dries and I was constantly being told by people that there were flakes on my face; rather embarrassing.     One day, I asked the pharmacist if there were any over-the-counter cremes or lotions that may help to control rosacea. He immediately directed me to this Eucerin Calming Creme. I bought some and began applying it to my face twice a day, morning and evening.  It took a few days, but to my surprise, my skin began looking and feeling normal again!  However, I need to be sure to use it twice a day or the rosacea reappears.     Eucerin Calming Creme works great for me and it is unscented and very thick and creamy so one tube lasts a long time and I don&#x27;t need to apply but just a little amount for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing effect is good, thick paste, but easy to apply</li>
    <li> The pediatrician recommended this creme for my baby boy&#x27;s dry skin... This is good for adults as well. We tried it - it really worked perfect for both!</li>
    <li> The Eucerin creme does soothe my dry itchy skin. I expected it to work a little more quickly than it does. However, it is a good creme and does relieve my itchiness. It works best if you use it right after your bath. I signed up for auto shipments of every 3 months. The creme works well enough for me to continue receiving shipments. It also has a very faint pleasant smell. I do not like strong scented cremes.</li>
    <li> I have tried many “high-end” brands, such as dermologica, clinique, kiehl&#x27;s and philosophy, but none of these performed well on my dry skin, and none of them are compatible with Retin A. To my surprise, the cream fulfills its job as stated on the label: “provides 24 hour moisturization”,&amp;#34;helps soothe dry, itchy skin&amp;#34;. Moreover, it is a savior to Retin A itch ! Highly recommend to people with dry skin and Retin A users !</li>
    <li> I love this Eucerin lotion.  For some reason I have noticed that the pump bottles tend to be too greasy, but the tube is not very greasy at all. It has done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> MD gave me some samples. Really lives up to the name.  I don&#x27;t know how or why but the effect is calming on the skin.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this cream on my face to help with my mild seborrheic dermatitis. It soothes and hydrates my skin perfectly and makes my skin condition tolerable. It&#x27;s the only moisturiser I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t irritate and aggravate my poor skin. I just wish Eucerin will also make a version of this creme with skin repairing ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, etc. If that happens, I will be a customer for life. Thanks Eucerin!</li>
    <li> I have nummular eczema and this is the only cream that helps.</li>
    <li> It‘s a kind of good moisturizer for sensitive skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and an excellent value.</li>
    <li> No fault of manufacturer - turns out I was very allergic to this cream.  Watery blisters all over arms and legs.  Recommended by dermatologist who hadn&#x27;t seen such a reaction but I did find others online with same reaction.  Contacted manufacturer and they sent packaging for me to return to them and will give me a complete refund of cost paid to Amazon.  Ordered Cerave, per doctor, and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion and tried on the advice of my dermatologist. I know there is a reason for it, but I sure do miss a fragrance!</li>
    <li> have used for years.  Doctor recommended</li>
    <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
    <li> Really moisturizer and very good price, buy it again!</li>
    <li> i have dry skin, especially my hands. I&#x27;ve been using aveeno lotion for the past few years and then i got this because it was on sale. i absolutely love it! it&#x27;s not oily but so smooth and creamy. as soon as it goes on your skin, you don&#x27;t feel it anymore but it keeps your skin from drying out. I have hands that dry out and crack from doing your average house chores and i&#x27;ve noticed when i put these on, they are drastically better and i rarely have to do the whole vasaline+sock thing when i go to sleep now. i&#x27;ve ordered more for my 3 year old because she was getting dry patches and aveeno baby eczema was getting expensive for her everyday use. this lotion works well and is gentle enough for her.</li>
    <li> Use with Eucerin body wash for nice soft skin every day.  Long underwear makes my skin dry and itchy and this creme takes care of that.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  Not much will help my hands in the middle of a Midwestern winter -- especially since I have to wash them so many times a day -- but this Eucerin &amp;#34;Calming Creme&amp;#34; does the trick.  And it is not greasy like so many other hand creams are.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought the 3-pack, as one is in my car, one in my kitchen, and one at my office.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for dry reddened skin. A very small amount seems to protect well and I have found it to be wonderful on my aging skin</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have sensitive skin (different issues, including acne &amp; dry skin), and we finally found a lotion we can both use!! We use this daily for our face and body, and no reactions!! I&#x27;m so glad I got three giant bottles, and I will be reordering when we run out.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this hard to pronounce produce. It feels good, smells good, and keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  Never had a better body lotion.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer and shine</li>
    <li> as described, no surprises</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product on my baby since she was born..She&#x27;s now 18 months and i still use it. I love It</li>
    <li> totally saved my broken skin！love it！</li>
    <li> I  have extremely itchy,  dry hands and I  have tried everything from steroid creams to basics and hydrocortisone  with cotton gloves.  This is the only creme that  comes close to calming my itch and relieving the dryness. I  have a tube in envy room of my house including my purse and car.  it&#x27;s GOOD!</li>
    <li> very nice , its work. calming my skin</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have extremely dry, itchy skin and after using this my skin is hydrated and smoother. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Feels good just doesn&#x27;t seem to improve overall dryness.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I overdo the retinol-based products and need something to moisturize without adding more irritation.  No matter what is going on, from an accidental sunburn to over-exfoliating, this moisturizer helps calm things down and moisturizes well.  It&#x27;s probably on the heavy side for people who don&#x27;t have very dry skin, but it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I use on my legs and feet and it is to die for. It is fantastic for sensitive skin since it is fragrance free. I love it! Eucerin is terrific.</li>
    <li> I love this creme, it keeps my skin really smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very itchy skin and have tried everything.  Eucerin products really seem to help me.  This one is good as long I as don&#x27;t sweat because then it gets sticky and causes different problems.  However, Eucerin is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Our whole family love this product. Non greasy. Keeps moisture in the skin for the dry winter months. Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Very good product for healing dry and cracked feet and hands.  I bought a tube for my sister-in-law who has diabetes.</li>
    <li> Got a better deal on a 3-pack of 8 oz tubes than I could find at grocery or drug store. i use the stuff every day. Even better when my BF puts it on my feet LOL!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and does not come thick or heavy when applied! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for dry spots like hands, elbows, and legs, because it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling too oily. However, I stopped using it on my face because I was getting an occasional bump which is not normal for me. As long as I am using this on my body and not my face, it is excellent.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves, loves, loves this hand cream. Especially in the winter when his knuckles start drying out and cracking.  He&#x27;s about to run out of his first tube, so I got him this multi-pack.  I compared prices with multiple other retailers before purchasing this, and this was definitely a better deal.  And this way, ha can take a bottle to work, keep one in his overnight bag, and have one to use at home!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! Works wonders on my dry red patches on my face. I also used it on my healing tattoo when it was itchy. Fragrance free &amp; made by same company that makes Aquaphor (product my artist recommended) that I used for the first 2 days. It is thick but not greasy at all. Amazing results. I recommend it to everyone. Bundle pack is well worth the savings!</li>
    <li> This stuff work miracles on my very dry 60 year old skin.  I have tried quite a few different cremes to help with my skin and finally found this. I will never use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle of this in the kitchen and one one the bedside table.  Nice product and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except I&#x27;m trying to move away from products with so many chemicals in them and I&#x27;m going to start making my own hand cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I am getting into the habit of putting it on arms and legs after a shower and in the weeks I&#x27;ve used it I have noticed a real improvement in smoothness of my skin. It was recommended by my dermatologist and it has been very helpful for my dry skin. Very soothing and not greasy, but stays on. Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve tried so many products for both myself and my one year old son. He has eczema and I have extremely sensitive skin. This lotion is thick enough to provide coverage, but not oily, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin mad. I put it on my son after baths and his skin feels great. In my opinion it even works better than the Eucerin Eczema cream.</li>
    <li> This cream does what it says, but what I liked best was first tube I bought at pharmacy and thru Amazon got it for a lot better price. The cream rubes in well and relieves my dry calves.  And of cores received it right away. And love that free return. Sure makes you more willing to buy.</li>
    <li> Beiersdorf does excellent science on their entire Eucerin line, but this one in particular seems the best compromise between effectiveness and not leaving my hands feeling greasy.  Also, when my hands are extra dry, some lotions burn a bit due to alcohol content. This one never does.</li>
    <li> If you suffer with dry skin and can&#x27;t stand the itching, and skin dandruff that goes along with it try this. I know everyone tries what their DR. tells them but that stuff, smells bad, just give it a shot, it was recommended on a doctor tv show. And it works.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I have been using it and other Eucerin products for more than a year.  My dermatologist recommended it for a medical condition I have on my legs.</li>
    <li> The cream is really good and a great moisturizer. It came packaged perfectly. The size is pretty goo and should last few months</li>
    <li> Work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Using it on arms and legs.  Skin looks and feels better than fever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few anti-itch cream for my mother and nothing seemed to work.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and it seems to be working so far.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I started using this in September of 2012 because I am pregnant and my skin had dried out severely. I had actually gotten a sample size that came with the Calming Lotion. I use this cream on my face instead of a regular face lotion and this works so much better. In 2 days my skin was no longer dry and so soft. I have acne prone and very sensitive skin also. This does not make your skin all oily and absorbs into the skin where as others just sit on top and leave a residue almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best cream/lotion that I have every used and for the price it&#x27;s even better. I have spent top dollar on high end face lotions and creams and they do not compare to this. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product.  It does indeed calm the itchy feeling and allows one to rest more comfortably.  In addition, the price at Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best creams on the market for sensitive, dry skin. Not heavy and no sticky feeling after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Best after shower or bath. Unscented, so it does not compete with your perfume etc.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
