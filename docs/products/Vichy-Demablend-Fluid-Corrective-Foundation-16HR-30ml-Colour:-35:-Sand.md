      <li>Be safe and order lighter than what you need.</li>
      <li>i have eczema and this product does not irritate my skin, which i like the most.</li>
      <li>She has had problems with her skin breaking out with many foundations and as a result, cannot use the cheaper products that you buy at the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good product</li>
      <li>The color blends smooth but dries quickly and seems like if you have medicine on your face more than a foundation.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, but it is effective.  </li>
      <li>Great facial coverage.</li>
      <li>n&#x27;t because other than that I loed the product, very good coverage.</li>
      <li>:) i&#x27;m happy and is a really good foundation that covers a lot, it last also long.</li>

      <li>Color is rich and texture is creamy.</li>

      <li>, this is the only make up that completely eliminates any discoloration and gives me a flawless coverage.  </li>

      <li>Luckily the product was intact.</li>
      <li>pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the best cover foundation without feeling your skin tired.  </li>
      <li>just right for my wife</li>
      <li>My wife struggled for years with finding the right foundation.  </li>
      <li>It was all I expected, and more!</li>
      <li>Even though the tint is a bit darker than I expected, it still covers imperfections nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.</li>
      <li>It arrived pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I have also used this product successfully in conjunction with other (also European) foundations ...</li>
      <li>I was a bit surprised when I received the product that it was shipped from Portugal, but no matter, I have great respect for the European Cosmetics and find them to be purer and more humane that most anything (unfortunately) made only for the U.S. market.  </li>
      <li>Originally I bought this  for my entire face.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable compared with high end products (like Dior or Chanel).</li>
      <li>so I might put this on selected areas first, then apply another foundation over the whole of my facial skin; or, use another product and then touch up with this one.</li>
      <li>caused me to break out in acne but my skin is very sensitive and</li>
      <li>I am 66 years old and had been trying to find a cover that would last all day and not make me look older than I already do.  </li>
      <li>I normally wear the sand shades and I would say this is a deep beige.</li>
      <li>This product covers completely, I have adult acne prone skin and occasionally have scars</li>

    <li> Best foundation ever! Just beautiful coverage!</li>
    <li> My wife struggled for years with finding the right foundation.  She tried everything.  She has had problems with her skin breaking out with many foundations and as a result, cannot use the cheaper products that you buy at the drugstore.  She found Vichy a few years back when she was looking for a sunblock that would not cause her skin to breakout.  She bought the \\&quot;bronze\\&quot; color of the Vichy dermablend and loved it.  She now buys \\&quot;sand\\&quot; as a regular base.  It does not cake, blends well and you cannot see any line at her neck (where often you can tell where the face makeup stops at the neck).  The price is reasonable compared with high end products (like Dior or Chanel).</li>
    <li> I have always loved Dermablend products and this is no exception!</li>
    <li> i love this product! goes on smooth and has full coverage which i need for my acne scars.. pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> The color blends smooth but dries quickly and seems like if you have medicine on your face more than a foundation. Its not oily and coverage is medium to full. Can last aceptable couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This product covers completely, I have adult acne prone skin and occasionally have scars, this is the only make up that completely eliminates any discoloration and gives me a flawless coverage.  In short it&#x27;s amazing!  Doesn&#x27;t cause break outs and last all day.</li>
    <li> caused me to break out in acne but my skin is very sensitive and many things cause me to break out. I wish it didn&#x27;t because other than that I loed the product, very good coverage. The photos show what it looks like after blending on my hand. This is &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and had been trying to find a cover that would last all day and not make me look older than I already do.  Well, Vichy is the one.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s creamy and lasts all day.  JUST LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Even though the tint is a bit darker than I expected, it still covers imperfections nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and when my local CVS stopped carrying it, I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.

    <li> Originally I bought this  for my entire face. However, it would cake and did not look good on me. I tried to apply it all kinds of ways..but ,alas, it would not look right. BUT I started to use it as undereye concealer and also under nose and on chin, and sometimes on cheeks for face contour. It is amazing!! You never feel it running or no need to retouch it. I still have the same tube 3 years later. It is so pigmented! I I feel it is about to run out...and when it does, I will be back!</li>
    <li> Conratulations, excellent supplier again for a good business with him, poi everything reported was correct and this is very good</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am charmed with it cover every blemish in my face, have a very soft texture</li>
    <li> The product came wrapped in a piece of cardboard leftover, which then was wrapped with a plastic covering. Luckily the product was intact. It was all I expected, and more! It even came with a few extra samples!</li>
    <li> I like this coverup a lot.  You don&#x27;t need to use much, but it is effective.  Lasts a long time?</li>
    <li> the color is a little bit darker than expected. the shade i got is 35 sand. a little too yellow for me. maybe i will mix it with other foundation. i have eczema and this product does not irritate my skin, which i like the most. it leaves a radiant finish, not matte and it covers little imperfections, like pores and acne scars. it wont dry my skin. price is fair. it took about two weeks to get it. a good try!</li>
    <li> Great facial coverage. Use it sparingly.  A little goes a long ways. Color is rich and texture is creamy. It arrived pretty fast.</li>
    <li> just right for my wife</li>
    <li> A little goes a loooong way!  I like to mix w/ smashbox green base (to take red tones down) and it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
