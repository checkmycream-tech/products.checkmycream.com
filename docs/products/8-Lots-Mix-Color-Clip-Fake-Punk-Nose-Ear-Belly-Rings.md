      <li>And it fit pretty good</li>
      <li>I was happy that there were many different sizes.</li>

      <li>Everything  was fine.</li>
      <li>Super satisfied.</li>
      <li>The sizes and colors were as shown in the picture and they&#x27;re comfortable too.</li>
      <li>I got these to test out a piercing before I actually got it done, and they are great for that.</li>
      <li>Rings were not the same colors as ones on display picture, but they were still great colors.</li>
      <li>Make sure you clean them first before use!</li>
      <li>careful bend to much/many they can break look good!</li>
      <li>came earlier than it said, but it&#x27;s still a good buy if you&#x27;re thinking about getting a piercing with a hoop</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
      <li>If I could give it zero stars, I would, because it really isn&#x27;t worthy of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product looks real fits nice hurts slightly</li>
      <li>cute fun better then actually piercing yourself no one would know the difference!</li>
      <li>For the price of say it&#x27;s worth it though, for pictures and stuff...</li>
      <li>but theyre fun and realistice looking.</li>
      <li>It took about a month to get here from China, but it was worth the wait for me.</li>
      <li>daughter bought these just for fun, and to try out some piercings.</li>
      <li>I love how they come in different sizes</li>
      <li>When First Put On .</li>
      <li>They are larger than I anticipated, but still cute.</li>
      <li>the colors and sizes arent exactly as they appear.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a smaller size for the nose but other than that I&#x27;m happy</li>
      <li>The tiny ones can fit on your nose and they&#x27;re the only ones that really look believable on your nose.</li>
      <li>The large hoops I guess could go as like a Cartlidge piercing and it hurts again after a while</li>
      <li>I also got a large gold one.</li>
      <li>Better than expected...</li>
      <li>and they looks so real.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Made a whole in my nose and broke my skin</li>
      <li>Shipping time on this item was fast.</li>
      <li>do not buy these nose rings very dissapointed</li>
      <li>, they look like I have a real piercing.</li>
      <li>I like them, but they will not stay straight.</li>
      <li>(I wish there were more black ones)</li>
      <li>One of the main problems was the jewerly getting stuck.</li>
      <li>The colors of the rings are not the same as the ones in the picture but they are still cute and some of the ring sizes are smaller than others</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re really kind of hard to get off and they hurt because you&#x27;ll have to pull them off.</li>
      <li>I wear them as a faux septum piercing, as that is the only place to wear them that it looks pretty real.</li>
      <li>She had put one on her ear, and when she removed it, it left a huge red dot and was throbbing.</li>
      <li>They came on time, and look so real as a nose ring which is the only thing I plan on using them as.</li>
      <li>Came early.</li>
      <li>They are not bad, one end pinches a little</li>
      <li>It looks real OMg, and hurts when it&#x27;s on for too long...</li>
      <li>One side is always higher than the other.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t get the exact same colors in the picture, I got a few doubles and was missing colors, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only worn it once so far</li>
      <li>I liked it, there was nothing wrong with it.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, I expected them to arrive on the later end of the estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>they hurt a little when you first try them</li>
      <li>I got 2 smaller ones a metallic neon pink and a light green one.</li>
      <li>The springs fell out just not worth buying get the real thing</li>
      <li>I got black light green metallic neon blue neon orange and gold.</li>
      <li>These were really good but also really bad</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re wanting to wear these regularly because you don&#x27;t want to commit to an actual piercing, I&#x27;f say you&#x27;d get quite a few uses out of these if you&#x27;re careful.</li>

<li> They look so fake but at the same time funny.</li>
<li> The funky colors aren&#x27;t usually used, and it only adds to the fake appearance of these cheap rings.</li>
<li> but I expected that.</li>
<li> I would never use green or blue piercings</li>
<li> The ring left the only dark imprint on the side of my nose!!!!</li>
<li> The rings, themselves, can be a bit cumbersome due to the mechanism inside them.</li>
<li> The paint chipped off the other ones after 3 days of wearing them.</li>
<li> The sizes weren&#x27;t varied at all, but they weren&#x27;t too big or small.</li>
<li> Lastly, they didn&#x27;t even look slighty realistic, because the actual jewerly is so thick, that it looks totally fake.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> They do pinch and hurt a little and one of them wouldn&#x27;t have the clasp thing go down all the way.</li>
<li> Fits Tight .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are cute. They come in different sizes and colors. I just wish you could pick the colors. I would never use green or blue piercings haha</li>
    <li> Kinda some weird sizes and colors. They are not the ones in the picture. You don&#x27;t get one of each. You&#x27;ll get like some tiny ones, medium ones and some larger ones. The medium ones fit perfectly on your lip and look real. Everyone in all my classes believe it and love it. It leaves a mark on your lip after a while and can be kinda painful. The tiny ones can fit on your nose and they&#x27;re the only ones that really look believable on your nose. But they&#x27;re really kind of hard to get off and they hurt because you&#x27;ll have to pull them off. The large hoops I guess could go as like a Cartlidge piercing and it hurts again after a while but they all do. Overall it&#x27;s a really good product and I do recommend it, but just know that it&#x27;s a little painful and the colors and sizes arent exactly as they appear.</li>
    <li> love them so mush really cool.</li>
    <li> Work great, husband even wears one or two from time to time. They can be adjusted some be careful bend to much/many they can break look good!</li>
    <li> it heared my nose  it made me get red nose and apipple  a whight pipple on it and it heard</li>
    <li> I received 9, in various colors but all are about the same size. They do pinch and hurt a little and one of them wouldn&#x27;t have the clasp thing go down all the way.</li>
    <li> Everything  was fine.</li>
    <li> I got mine today  got one of each color as shown in the pic... its a type of plastic doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Works great for the lip.  Wish there was a smaller size for the nose but other than that I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> They are larger than I anticipated, but still cute.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, I expected them to arrive on the later end of the estimated delivery date. I got 2 smaller ones a metallic neon pink and a light green one. Middle sized I got black light green metallic neon blue neon orange and gold. I also got a large gold one. Would have liked to get more smaller ones as they fit my lip best but so far I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> they are very painful to even wear</li>
    <li> 8 different colors and theyre metallic. Im very pleased</li>
    <li> Made a whole in my nose and broke my skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone means, all mine were the same size, and I got the same colors as the picture. They came on time, and look so real as a nose ring which is the only thing I plan on using them as.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only worn it once so far but it&#x27;s great. The sizes and colors were as shown in the picture and they&#x27;re comfortable too. (I wish there were more black ones)</li>
    <li> One of them was broken. :(</li>
    <li> Love it! Little hurt but that&#x27;s totally ok tho :)</li>
    <li> came earlier than it said, but it&#x27;s still a good buy if you&#x27;re thinking about getting a piercing with a hoop</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d be nice if it came in more neutral colors.</li>
    <li> The springs fell out just not worth buying get the real thing</li>
    <li> My daughter love them !</li>
    <li> I love my nose rings 😍😍</li>
    <li> Super satisfied. I got these to test out a piercing before I actually got it done, and they are great for that. If you&#x27;re wanting to wear these regularly because you don&#x27;t want to commit to an actual piercing, I&#x27;f say you&#x27;d get quite a few uses out of these if you&#x27;re careful. You won&#x27;t get the exact same colors in the picture, I got a few doubles and was missing colors, but that&#x27;s fine. Also, all of mine were one size. It took about a month to get here from China, but it was worth the wait for me.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, and I must say that I am beyond dissapointed. If I could give it zero stars, I would, because it really isn&#x27;t worthy of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter bought these just for fun, and to try out some piercings. One of the main problems was the jewerly getting stuck. I would not reccomend using this in your septum, or your nose. Believe me, it took over ten minutes to get it out. Another issue my daughter had was pain. According to her, these were VERY painful. She had put one on her ear, and when she removed it, it left a huge red dot and was throbbing. Lastly, they didn&#x27;t even look slighty realistic, because the actual jewerly is so thick, that it looks totally fake. The funky colors aren&#x27;t usually used, and it only adds to the fake appearance of these cheap rings. When on, they look nothing like the picture shown, so don&#x27;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT reccomend these to anyone. Not only are they very fake looking and painful, but a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> cute fun better then actually piercing yourself no one would know the difference!</li>
    <li> It looks real OMg, and hurts when it&#x27;s on for too long... but it&#x27;s nice i just wish it included really big ones and extra tiny ones.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE MOST UGLIEST COLORS EVER. I THOUGHT YOU GET ONE OF EACH COLOR. BUT I GUESSED WRONG.... ALL UGLY GREEN AND ORANGES ONE.  do not buy these nose rings very dissapointed</li>
    <li> Great. Fits Tight . Hurts A Lil When First Put On . But In All Its Great</li>
    <li> they well not stay on</li>
    <li> I love them! False advertising though.it came with two medium blue,pink,and orange ones. Then it came with one lime green small one and on large gold one. The paint does chip and they&#x27;ll pinch after a while but theyre fun and realistice looking. I say go for it</li>
    <li> Came early. Got all colors in picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality, I really liked the colors, comfortable to wear!</li>
    <li> I wear them as a faux septum piercing, as that is the only place to wear them that it looks pretty real. I like them, but they will not stay straight. One side is always higher than the other. For the price of say it&#x27;s worth it though, for pictures and stuff...</li>
    <li> Daughter not using and it&#x27;s not that cute once it is on. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love how they come in different sizes but i wish they came in the colors as shown. I got ugly pinks greens and oranges and 3 black i had to throw the rest away because they were useless and ugly. The paint chipped off the other ones after 3 days of wearing them. These were really good but also really bad</li>
    <li> Good product looks real fits nice hurts slightly</li>
    <li> Got one colored one the rest gold. Shopping took forever. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked it, there was nothing wrong with it. And it fit pretty good, I&#x27;d buy it again, but nah. It didnt hurt when i took it off, and i put it on my nose, it was great.</li>
    <li> Better than expected...my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! Im a person of a darker skin tone. I wore one of the rings for about 1 hour or 2 in my nose. The ring left the only dark imprint on the side of my nose!!!! its cheap!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Look fine an came on time</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved this set of rings. The colors are varied and not too bright. The rings, themselves, can be a bit cumbersome due to the mechanism inside them. However, they aren&#x27;t large enough to look fake; plenty of people thought they were real. They hurt a bit after being worn a while, and leave small temporary imprints on the lip and nose. The sizes weren&#x27;t varied at all, but they weren&#x27;t too big or small.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them @ all they was too little👎👎👎</li>
    <li> Looks completely fake.  Good if you&#x27;re going for that vibe, I guess.</li>
    <li> Great I love them , ppl really believe my nose is pierced and very fashionable.</li>
    <li> Rings were not the same colors as ones on display picture, but they were still great colors. The only thing I didnt like was the rings weren&#x27;t the same size. Shipping time on this item was fast. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I was happy that there were many different sizes. Would have preferred there would be a silver ring instead of some of the crazier colors. For the people claiming they hurt. they will only hurt if you have a very low pain tolerance along with not putting them on properly. Make sure you clean them first before use!</li>
    <li> They are not bad, one end pinches a little but I expected that. Overall I like them, they look like I have a real piercing.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a piercing so bad (14) and I refused to let her get one. She was so mad at me  so I got her these, now she&#x27;s not as mad at me. We will see how long that lasts.</li>
    <li> These nose ring are awesome they hurt a little when you first try them but the pain goes away and they looks so real. The colors of the rings are not the same as the ones in the picture but they are still cute and some of the ring sizes are smaller than others</li>
    <li> I bought this as per my daughter&#x27;s request for her bohemian-themed slumber party. They look so fake but at the same time funny.</li>
