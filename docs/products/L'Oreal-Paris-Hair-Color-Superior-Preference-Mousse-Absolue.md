      <li>---I am HERE to get MORE!  </li>
      <li>Very easy to apply</li>
      <li>knew it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Target, should&#x27;ve known better to get it before I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>I love the mousse hair color for ease of application.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
      <li>-I got it in a store and paid a LOT more for it</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>And now I have to buy more color to touch up the grays when my hair grows out.</li>
      <li>I have to spend more money on another dye.</li>
      <li>and I love the color I used the auburn 654</li>
      <li>More of a black-cherry color.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why so many folks are having a problem with this hair color.  </li>
      <li>It also takes longer than most products to develop.</li>
      <li>Great vibrant color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best color from a box I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
      <li>I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference Mousse.  </li>
      <li>the plus side, application was easy.</li>
      <li>so my hair will take almost any color easily.  </li>
      <li>It was extremely easy to apply</li>
      <li>So, if you want a hair-color that is easy to apply, but looks like something even a truck-stop stripper would find tacky, this is your product.</li>
      <li>I do have to warn you that the odor is extremely strong.</li>
      <li>This product did absolute nothing to my hair, there was no change in color, except it seemed to strip my roots making my greys more noticeable!</li>
      <li>I bought the light auburn color because that is what I have been dying my hair, as you see in the photo.</li>
      <li>I used the Light Auburn Brown&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>The color choices I don&#x27;t love so much, but they are OK.</li>
      <li>Or, I should say, none of the many colors on my head right now are close to auburn.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s drab, and it&#x27;s nothing like the tempting color on the box, in any of the original hair color ranges shown.</li>
      <li>But today I got the Light Golden Brown</li>
      <li>My hair grows quickly and I need a touch-up in three weeks no matter what type of OTC color</li>
      <li>I have used several of the Mousse Absolue colors and liked them all except one.  </li>
      <li>product, when used right, is about 90% as good as the older-style colors at handling dark roots and grays.</li>
      <li>You really do need to take the full 30 minutes after application - no shortcuts.</li>
      <li>It is cool you don&#x27;t have to use the whole thing at once.</li>
      <li>I get exceptional results from other L&#x27;Oreal product lines.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ever so easy to apply (no drips, no mess)</li>
      <li>more could you possibly ask of a product?</li>
      <li>I have used many different brands and many different types of hair color.  </li>
      <li>It takes 4–6 washes for the red to come out more</li>
      <li>The color is so rich and natural!</li>
      <li>and I love the no mix and the fact that I now have enough leftover to touch up the roots around my face.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I love that I&#x27;m not wasting all that dye when I&#x27;m only doing my roots  </li>
      <li>Not Fake red like so many others.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get why everyone hates this product so much!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a hair color that works just right with one of their colors, and you love having a reusable can for frequent touch-ups, then go for it.</li>
      <li>You have to shake extensively throughout the process (I did 20 seconds with 4 shakes per second initially, and 5 seconds at that pace every 1-2 sections) to keep up excellent foam, and you absolutely can not tilt the can over.</li>
      <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and they are good, but this product is more expensive and doesn&#x27;t cover gray.  </li>
      <li>My grey turned a vivid shade of purple, which isn&#x27;t a good look on a 45 year old.</li>
      <li>I have been using clairol age defy medium auburn and liked those results but was looking for something a little lighter for summer.</li>
      <li>I used the whole application</li>
      <li>and then I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this hair dye since it doesn&#x27;t cover gray and the color is much lighter than I anticipated with a medium brown.</li>
      <li>I just bought my 5th box and redeemed my FREE next box coupon.  </li>
      <li>It covered my gray at my temples and really gave my hair shine.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty red!</li>
      <li>If you want really pretty color and don&#x27;t want to work so hard to make your hair look great, go with a conventional non-mousse product instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did not read all the negative reviews before trying this product when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Left my hair so soft and full of shine .</li>
      <li>I only tried this product because I was curious, and hopeful that the multi-use can would make lots of touch-ups easy, versus having to buy a new box every time - and I knew I was going to have to re-color my hair anyway in 2 weeks before a trip, so I wasn&#x27;t taking much of a risk.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When i first tried it (in the rollout phase) it seemed ok - definitely NOT as good as &amp;#34;healthy look&amp;#34; but that was discontinued to push this high-priced replacement.  </li>
      <li>My hair color is the exact same.</li>
      <li>I usually do some shade of red or light golden brown.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I can say is that it does cost a little more than the excellence or preference lines.</li>
      <li>This product turned my hair a very dark brown/burgundy color even though it was supposed to be light auburn.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s all gone sticky and takes half a bottle of shampoo to get clean.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a natural redhead.</li>
      <li>I did not experience any sliminess - just soft, silky, manageable hair.  </li>
      <li>and it still hasn&#x27;t done near the job</li>
      <li>Most of the problems people encounter when using this product seem to come from following the pictures, not the written instructions (the photos are gorgeous, but I&#x27;d hate to see the results if they tried to emulate them).</li>
      <li>; - they&#x27;re actually tricker to get just right than regular hair color unless you have lightish hair with no gray.</li>
      <li>They both are initially quite dark and feel more brown than red.</li>
      <li>Easy application for long thick hair and directions were pretty clear.</li>
      <li>But the first major problem had nothing to do with that: despite getting good results that avoided the horror story pitfalls, the color is UGLY.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference between this light auburn and the medium auburn I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>The negative reviewers talk about a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair soft and shiny&lt;</li>

<li> I usually have good results with L&#x27;Oreal products but this was so disappointing.</li>
<li> My hair is thick and long so it took 2 bottles which is normal.</li>
<li> This is I believe the first negative review I&#x27;ve written on Amazon so to me this product was less than even one star.  </li>
<li> 30 mins later, still have dark roots.</li>
<li> I have dark hair with a couple patches of resistant white.</li>
<li> Last week I tried the Medium mahogany and it is too dark for me.  </li>
<li> This seems to be one of the few mousse products left on the market.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a few times in the last 2 months and will now NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  </li>
<li> I have naturally curly medium brown thick hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not purchase this thru Amazon (I forgot to look!) -I got it in a store and paid a LOT more for it---I am HERE to get MORE!  I truly do NOT understand the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1. the product performed as described...I used the Light Auburn Brown&lt;br /&gt;2. It covered my gray COMPLETELY&lt;br /&gt;3. It left my hair soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;4. It was extremely easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;5. I had enough left to touch up roots after a haircut&lt;br /&gt;6. It was NOT sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you possibly ask of a product?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why everyone hates this product so much! I&#x27;m almost 40 and I&#x27;m a natural redhead. I have been using Loreal Excellence Red Penny to cover gray and give my hair a boost for about 2 years. I decided to try this in #654 and I LOVE it! The color is so rich and natural! Not Fake red like so many others. It covered my gray at my temples and really gave my hair shine. It is cool you don&#x27;t have to use the whole thing at once. The only thing I can say is that it does cost a little more than the excellence or preference lines. It is a good price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the mousse hair color for ease of application. This seems to be one of the few mousse products left on the market. The color choices I don&#x27;t love so much, but they are OK. I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference between this light auburn and the medium auburn I have used in the past. They both are initially quite dark and feel more brown than red. It takes 4–6 washes for the red to come out more and then I really like it.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. Easy application for long thick hair and directions were pretty clear. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> While this product is not as awful as some reviews published on Amazon and in other places make it out to be, it is only good in very limited circumstances. Like other mousse products, it should not be sold as &amp;#34;easier to use&amp;#34; - they&#x27;re actually tricker to get just right than regular hair color unless you have lightish hair with no gray. I only tried this product because I was curious, and hopeful that the multi-use can would make lots of touch-ups easy, versus having to buy a new box every time - and I knew I was going to have to re-color my hair anyway in 2 weeks before a trip, so I wasn&#x27;t taking much of a risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you my background, I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 20+ years and am very good at it. I have dark hair with a couple patches of resistant white. I get exceptional results from other L&#x27;Oreal product lines. I read the angry reviews about this product and figured out where the users went wrong before I ever started. But the first major problem had nothing to do with that: despite getting good results that avoided the horror story pitfalls, the color is UGLY. Yes, it&#x27;s drab, and it&#x27;s nothing like the tempting color on the box, in any of the original hair color ranges shown. It&#x27;s dull, boring, medium brown. Reddish tints? None. Boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, when used right, is about 90% as good as the older-style colors at handling dark roots and grays. This isn&#x27;t the fault of this product - I&#x27;ve tested several other mousses, and had that same experience. Most of the problems people encounter when using this product seem to come from following the pictures, not the written instructions (the photos are gorgeous, but I&#x27;d hate to see the results if they tried to emulate them). You have to shake extensively throughout the process (I did 20 seconds with 4 shakes per second initially, and 5 seconds at that pace every 1-2 sections) to keep up excellent foam, and you absolutely can not tilt the can over. Another reason for bad experiences isusing too little product or not massaging it in like mad. It also takes longer than most products to develop. You really do need to take the full 30 minutes after application - no shortcuts. I had to work a lot harder to get almost the same quality of results I could&#x27;ve gotten with my usual hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a hair color that works just right with one of their colors, and you love having a reusable can for frequent touch-ups, then go for it. If you want really pretty color and don&#x27;t want to work so hard to make your hair look great, go with a conventional non-mousse product instead.</li>
    <li> I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference Mousse.  Great vibrant color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did not read all the negative reviews before trying this product when it first came out.  I can&#x27;t imagine why so many folks are having a problem with this hair color.  I&#x27;m 68.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 30 years - not because I was gray back then but because I like to have different hair color from time to time.  I have used many different brands and many different types of hair color.  This is the BEST color and EASIEST application ever.  I have naturally curly medium brown thick hair so my hair will take almost any color easily.  I usually do some shade of red or light golden brown.  I have used several of the Mousse Absolue colors and liked them all except one.  Last week I tried the Medium mahogany and it is too dark for me.  But today I got the Light Golden Brown and I when I put this on it lightened the color to my liking.  The negative reviewers talk about a strong smell.  I have very bad asthma and can&#x27;t stand the smell of many things.  I did not notice a smell with this product.  None.  I don&#x27;t open a window when I put it on.  My bathroom is tiny.  So - I don&#x27;t get the smell complaints.  It&#x27;s ever so easy to apply (no drips, no mess) and I love the no mix and the fact that I now have enough leftover to touch up the roots around my face.  My hair grows quickly and I need a touch-up in three weeks no matter what type of OTC color I use or if I have it done at a salon.  I just bought my 5th box and redeemed my FREE next box coupon.  Yes - at $14 is expensive. But I always have a coupon for $4 off.  So $10 - which is about the price of other OTC color.  And now I have to buy more color to touch up the grays when my hair grows out. I did not experience any sliminess - just soft, silky, manageable hair.  I hope L&#x27;Oreal does not discontinue this product because of negative reviews.  I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> NO STARS.  There should be a poison warning on this product.  Something has gone dangerously wrong.  When i first tried it (in the rollout phase) it seemed ok - definitely NOT as good as &amp;#34;healthy look&amp;#34; but that was discontinued to push this high-priced replacement.  It is definitely not re-usable (the color gets too dark in the bottle, your second try will come out like shoe polish).  but something has gone wrong lately.  I&#x27;ve tried a few times in the last 2 months and will now NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  First there&#x27;s something wrong in the mix - no color comes out.  You don&#x27;t know that until you&#x27;ve foamed up your head.  But the vapors are EYE BURNING, almost BLINDING.  Then the developer starts running.  When you try to rinse it out you feel as though your hair might break off - it&#x27;s all gone sticky and takes half a bottle of shampoo to get clean.  Meanwhile you&#x27;ve had the junk on your head long enough but there is absolutely NO COLOR, in fact it seems to be bleaching my hair lighter instead of darker.  THIS IS A SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS PRODUCT.  DO NOT USE.</li>
    <li> Loooooved this color!  My hair is thick and long so it took 2 bottles which is normal. Very easy to apply and I loved the no mixing!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The (657) auburn color is perfect. I used the whole application and I got another for the impending touch ups and roots.  You must shake it constantly, so my arm was tired!! It&#x27;s the best color from a box I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for yrs!&amp; I love that I&#x27;m not wasting all that dye when I&#x27;m only doing my roots  I&#x27;ve gotten 3 times out of this and I love the color I used the auburn 654 it&#x27;s a very pretty red!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target, should&#x27;ve known better to get it before I read the reviews. I bought the light auburn color because that is what I have been dying my hair, as you see in the photo. I put a ton of this on my roots and then over my entire head, following the directions to shake and whatnot... 30 mins later, still have dark roots. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Turned me into a calico. I had patches of dark brown, patches of a maroonish purple, some dark red and my usual dark blonde. My grey turned a vivid shade of purple, which isn&#x27;t a good look on a 45 year old. Went over like a lead balloon at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse is so thin that it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you have enough on and if it&#x27;s even. I used the entire package on my medium hair, then combed it through and still have patches where it didn&#x27;t seem to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color isn&#x27;t even close to auburn. Or, I should say, none of the many colors on my head right now are close to auburn. More of a black-cherry color. NOT what I wanted. Waste of money. Very poor product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, application was easy. So, if you want a hair-color that is easy to apply, but looks like something even a truck-stop stripper would find tacky, this is your product.</li>
    <li> Brilliant beautiful Color !  Very easy to use and very happy with my haircolor .  Left my hair so soft and full of shine .</li>
    <li> This is I believe the first negative review I&#x27;ve written on Amazon so to me this product was less than even one star.  I have used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and they are good, but this product is more expensive and doesn&#x27;t cover gray.  I&#x27;ve applied it twice now and it still hasn&#x27;t done near the job other hair dyes I&#x27;ve used done in one application.  I&#x27;ve written L&#x27;Oreal so I am hoping to hear back from them and would like to see what they say.  I would not recommend this hair dye since it doesn&#x27;t cover gray and the color is much lighter than I anticipated with a medium brown.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you can do touch ups with out have to throw the unused portion out.  I do have to warn you that the odor is extremely strong. Good coverage.</li>
    <li> This product turned my hair a very dark brown/burgundy color even though it was supposed to be light auburn. I have been using clairol age defy medium auburn and liked those results but was looking for something a little lighter for summer. This color was very dark, ugly, and very artificial looking.  I actually used hair dye remover to get it out and then had the re-dye my hair. So I ended up damaging my hair and wasting alot of money because of this product. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Do Not Buy this product!!! I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I just had to warn people about this one. This product did absolute nothing to my hair, there was no change in color, except it seemed to strip my roots making my greys more noticeable! I usually have good results with L&#x27;Oreal products but this was so disappointing. I have to spend more money on another dye. I would give this no stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Still have grays &amp; roots look awful. My hair color is the exact same. It did leave my hair with a nasty residue though, so thanks for that and wasting my time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, it does nothing and smells awful.</li>
