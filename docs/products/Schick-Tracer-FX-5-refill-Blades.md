      <li>These are good blades.  </li>
      <li>and they are really good.  </li>
      <li>This shaver was good in it&#x27;s time and for the people who still have the Tracer razors and continue to use it buy buying the blades &gt;</li>
      <li>I loved these blades.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the service and the product that was received at my home.  </li>
      <li>I have used these razor blades for many years and was happy to find them online.</li>

      <li>&gt; the close shave is amazing.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the kind of product that ages</li>
      <li>Good thing I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Gives you a nice clean shave and very smooth skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them on here</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to order them through e-bay when his drug store quit selling them.</li>
      <li>This is still my favorite razor.</li>
      <li>I am so satisfied.  </li>
      <li>and it was time to buy more, so I checked out Amazon, and there it was.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to get refills through amazon.com.</li>
      <li>and I love my Tracer FX razor.</li>
      <li>my favorite, face-saving razor.</li>
      <li>Found these in an online search and bought as many as I could at the time.</li>
      <li>I am glad  the &amp;#34;shaving futurists&amp;#34; bought them for resale and I will continue to search for them.</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to find it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with shopping with amazon.</li>
      <li>Thought would be getting a better shave but am using another product for closer shave</li>
      <li>Wish you had more of this product  to sell.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon.com,he is a happy camper.</li>
      <li>Good for men &amp; women too!  :O)</li>
      <li>Try trimming a precise line with the three or more bladed razors.  </li>
      <li>fast good product  </li>
      <li>The FX fixed bending blades give  excellent control and pressure for a very close shave around my neck and face.</li>
      <li>These blades fit a razor I bought years ago</li>
      <li>They are a great product, last me for weeks and avoid irritation.</li>
      <li>I use this product because it gives me a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again!!!</li>
      <li>As usual, these are the original style blades for the Schick Tracer razor that are no longer available in stores, to the best of my knowledge.  </li>
      <li>Why do companies like Schick constantly change a good thing?  </li>
      <li>The megablades must have a rotating head to work and you can not correctly apply pressure to get a true close shave.</li>
      <li>Awesome blades very hard to find.</li>
      <li>These razor blades are perfectly fine and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Despite those flaws the Diamond version of this was by far my favorite razor of all time.</li>
      <li>Have no need for more blades on a shaver, tried some of the newer stuff, really no improvement, just more costly junk out there.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t sell these locally anymore, not even at the walmart that walmarts own website says they have them.</li>
      <li>We have had extremely good luck with ALL previous orders placed through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>He has been unable to find these razors in any stores any longer and this is what he has found works best for his shaving needs.</li>
      <li>spell out what&#x27;s really included !</li>
      <li>This razor blade has been around a long time, but it is still my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have been buying those blades for years and have never paid more than 7 0r 8 dollars for a single pack.</li>
      <li>THANKS amazon,Jeannie</li>
      <li>I was very displeased with the way the item was advertised.</li>
      <li>Just as described thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like the Schick Tracer FX razor.  </li>
      <li>He likes them because he gets a really close shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks for the service</li>
      <li>Everything went better than expected.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for helping us get them for him.</li>
      <li>Like I said it was very decptive the way it was advertised.</li>
      <li>The blade is sharp and gives a very smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Tried other razors,don&#x27;t care how many blades they want to add to them</li>
      <li>and I will continue buy them through Amazon as long as they are available.  </li>
      <li>2 blades is all anyone needs, and love this razor because its nice and thin, I can actually see my face when shaving</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a profit grab; charging much higher prices for megablade razors that cost very little more than the FX to produce.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find good quality two-bladed razors</li>
      <li>I have a very neat and trimmed beard, and only a razor with a two blade maximum can give the precise control necessary to sculpt it.</li>
      <li>I guess I will have to switch to an old school straight razor whenever they stop selling these.</li>
      <li>we love these razors and can only get the refills online, but the shipment from this dealer took way way too long</li>
      <li>They even through in a new razor in addition to the refill cartridges.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need a new razor</li>
      <li>I have tried many other womens razors and keep coming back to this because it gets a closer shave.  </li>
      <li>I would like to personally shave them with an old rusty straight blade.</li>
      <li>Guess it will be back to a straight razor then.</li>
      <li>But nearly $10 a blade?  </li>
      <li>My handle just gave up the ghost after nearly 14 years.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll likely be buying a few more packs in a couple weeks in case these disappear too.</li>
      <li>The idiots at Schick have decided to stop making and selling the best razor to be ever made.</li>
      <li>Like the old razor and will be broken hearted when I have to give it up for these new fangled 10 blade super razors that are overpriced and hard to get a good shave with.</li>
      <li>My facial skin is sensitive and the Tracer avoids the razor burn</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and apparently they do not make just the replacement parts any longer.  </li>
      <li>Like all multiple blade setups the blade clogs frequently, and the flexing of the blade lets it pop off the handle on occasion.</li>
      <li>These blades are so hard to find that I paid their high price just to have a few more weeks&lt;</li>

    <li> My boyfriend can&#x27;t seem to find these blades at the local pharmacies. He likes them because he gets a really close shave. Good thing I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These blades fit a razor I bought years ago and it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I don&#x27;t know why they no longer sell it in stores. The flexible blades do a great job and almost never knick or cut you.  Great product!</li>
    <li> These Tracer blades and shaver are not sold anymore.  But one can still buy the razor blades.  This shaver was good in it&#x27;s time and for the people who still have the Tracer razors and continue to use it buy buying the blades &gt;&gt; the close shave is amazing.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors but can no longer find them on the shelves in any stores around.Thanks to amazon.com,he is a happy camper.We will be ordering the Shick TRACER/FX again. THANKS amazon,Jeannie</li>
    <li> My husband finds the Tracer FX blades to be the best for trimming his beard/mustache.  No local store has them in stock any longer.  Thanks Amazon for helping us get them for him.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find the Tracer FX blades locally and ordered online.  They arrived qickly and I would buy them online again.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to find and my son loves them.  Plus, if we were able to find them, they&#x27;re cheaper through Amazon!</li>
    <li> As usual, these are the original style blades for the Schick Tracer razor that are no longer available in stores, to the best of my knowledge.  They do a beautiful job and I will continue buy them through Amazon as long as they are available.  Why do companies like Schick constantly change a good thing?  It&#x27;s all about marketing I guess!</li>
    <li> These razor blades are perfectly fine and reasonably priced.  Good to know I can still get them and not be forced by the industry to buy the overpriced 5-blade refills when two blades shaves excellently.[[ASIN:B0006M56BA Schick Tracer FX Refill Cartridges , 5 refill Cartridges]]</li>
    <li> I have used the Tracer FX for years. My facial skin is sensitive and the Tracer avoids the razor burn I get with all the other multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve tried and then thrown away. The Tracer/Edge gel combo is the only thing that works. I have also found and purchased these at WalMart recently. Inside is a coupon that states, \\&quot;Refills will soon be discontinued. Thank you for your loyalty.\\&quot; It offers $4 off other Schick razors.    What a shame. They are a great product, last me for weeks and avoid irritation. I had written the company when I heard they had been discontinued. What knucklehead at Schick made this decision? I would like to personally shave them with an old rusty straight blade. Grrrr............</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the service and the product that was received at my home.  I will reorder when my supplies need to be replenished.  I would recommend this service to my associates. I am pleased with shopping with amazon.</li>
    <li> blades not shave as close as would like. Thought would be getting a better shave but am using another product for closer shave</li>
    <li> Thank you for stocking this product.  I have searched long and hard for them.</li>
    <li> The blades arrived a day before they were scheduled to in good shape just what I ordered. Will buy again.  They don&#x27;t sell these locally anymore, not even at the walmart that walmarts own website says they have them. I can&#x27;t find them anywhere anymore, and schick&#x27;s site doesn&#x27;t even list them. I&#x27;m glad I found them on here, I&#x27;ll likely be buying a few more packs in a couple weeks in case these disappear too.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have ordered this product through Amazon.com for my son. He has been unable to find these razors in any stores any longer and this is what he has found works best for his shaving needs. We have had extremely good luck with ALL previous orders placed through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> we love these razors and can only get the refills online, but the shipment from this dealer took way way too long</li>
    <li> The blades on these cartridges were very good in their day.  These cartridge blades aren&#x27;t nearly as sharp as they should be.  I suspect they were manufactured long ago and have dulled over time. They are still usable.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the kind of product that ages well.  Or maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> $60 for 5 blades?  This is a classic rip-off.</li>
    <li> I shaved my dog&#x27;s behind and then taught him to walk backwards!  After that In knew these were the blades for me.</li>
    <li> Found this razor handle in my draw and decided to try it rather than my Gillette.  The blade is sharp and gives a very smooth shave.  you can use the blade only three to four times then you must change the blade.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest blades I used during my time in the service. My handle just gave up the ghost after nearly 14 years. I have decided to switch to Dollar Shave Club, now that I cannot use my Tracer FX any longer</li>
    <li> I loved these blades.  But nearly $10 a blade?  I don&#x27;t care if they are no longer made.  That&#x27;s a sin.  I have a few left, and when they are gone, I&#x27;ll switch to another razor.  Not paying this price.  Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Found these in an online search and bought as many as I could at the time. Like the old razor and will be broken hearted when I have to give it up for these new fangled 10 blade super razors that are overpriced and hard to get a good shave with. Guess it will be back to a straight razor then.</li>
    <li> These are good blades.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find good quality two-bladed razors so I keep finding these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades very hard to find. Amazon has had them</li>
    <li> The idiots at Schick have decided to stop making and selling the best razor to be ever made. I have a very neat and trimmed beard, and only a razor with a two blade maximum can give the precise control necessary to sculpt it. Try trimming a precise line with the three or more bladed razors.  The extra blades are always cutting off more than I want ( under nose, ect. ). The megablades must have a rotating head to work and you can not correctly apply pressure to get a true close shave. The FX fixed bending blades give  excellent control and pressure for a very close shave around my neck and face. There&#x27;s no control with the megablade razors. It&#x27;s just a profit grab; charging much higher prices for megablade razors that cost very little more than the FX to produce.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to get refills through amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This razor blade has been around a long time, but it is still my favorite.  As long as I can find it, I will use it.</li>
    <li> Wish you had more of this product  to sell.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere else.  Maybe I need a new razor</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Glad I was able to find it at Amazon.  I usually have gotten it at Walmart, but I hadn&#x27;t seen it in a while and it was time to buy more, so I checked out Amazon, and there it was.   Thanks again!!!</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other razor.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to order them through e-bay when his drug store quit selling them.</li>
    <li> Everything went better than expected. I am so satisfied.  They even through in a new razor in addition to the refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> its a good razor not all the stupid tilting and not a tri blade or quad blade just a double blade simple razor</li>
    <li> Will it was what I wanted but thought I was getting blades only got handles two so now I got three extra handles</li>
    <li> I could not find these anywhere and I love my Tracer FX razor. Why do companies have to keep &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; products when I like what they have?</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite razor. I prefer a narrow shaving head for beard trimming, and these blades had that little bit of flex in the middle that allowed me to shave close. Like all multiple blade setups the blade clogs frequently, and the flexing of the blade lets it pop off the handle on occasion. Despite those flaws the Diamond version of this was by far my favorite razor of all time. Worked like these and lasted a long time. I guess I will have to switch to an old school straight razor whenever they stop selling these.</li>
    <li> 5 refill cartridges- and I got 5 refill BLADES----you are missrepresenting this product. I believed that I was purchasing 5 replacement CARTRIDGES- like your add says. Liars.</li>
    <li> I received the blades packaged with razors - which I don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;ll try to find some place to donate them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves this. He keeps asking me to keep ordering this brand so he never runs out.</li>
    <li> 2 blades is all anyone needs, and love this razor because its nice and thin, I can actually see my face when shaving</li>
    <li> These are great blades!  Gives you a nice clean shave and very smooth skin! Good for men &amp; women too!  :O)</li>
    <li> Been looking everywhere for these.Tried other razors,don&#x27;t care how many blades they want to add to them they  just don&#x27;t give you the same shave as these blades do.Best shave I&#x27;ve had in along while.Will buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. And now Schick has stopped seliing the item. I am glad  the &amp;#34;shaving futurists&amp;#34; bought them for resale and I will continue to search for them.</li>
    <li> Just as described thanks.</li>
    <li> i was shipped the wrong product warehouse was out of what i ordered so someone inthe warehouse shipped me what they thought would work  i dont think so returned product and would like a refuns ASAP if not sooner when i receive my refund i will change my review</li>
    <li> fast good product  I can&#x27;t find these refill cartridges in the store  and they are really good.  Thanks for the service</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and apparently they do not make just the replacement parts any longer.  The provider tried to bait and switch me on the product for a ridiculous price.  I will not use that provider again.  If anyone knows how I can just get the blades let me know.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these cartridges and we have for years.  I have tried many other womens razors and keep coming back to this because it gets a closer shave.  I just wish the company would continue to make this product.  I gave it 4 stars due to the price I had to pay.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however the description is decieving. It says Schick Tracer FX Refill Cartridges, 5 refill Cartridges. The picture shows one cartridge with 5 blades per cartridge, so you would assume that you are getting 25 blades...(5 refill cartridges with 5 blades per cartridge) but that is not the case..........what you actually get is one cartridge with 5 blades.</li>
    <li> Have been using these blades for over 15 years, they are getting hard to find. Have no need for more blades on a shaver, tried some of the newer stuff, really no improvement, just more costly junk out there. Will order again soon and stock up.</li>
    <li> This is a ripoff!  5 blades for over $37!</li>
    <li> I really like the Schick Tracer FX razor.  Too bad it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as I can get blades for it.  Thanks Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Too bad I like the shave I&#x27;m used too. These blades are so hard to find that I paid their high price just to have a few more weeks&lt;br /&gt;with my favorite, face-saving razor. The product is excellent. The cost is almost unreasonable.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY &#x27;EM  description not clear 2 blade cartridges and 3 schick holders is not 5 cartridges...spell out what&#x27;s really included !</li>
    <li> Shaving with this two blade razor shaves close and helps cure my ingrown hair problem. Schick should rethink their drive of multiple blades.</li>
    <li> I have used these razor blades for many years and was happy to find them online. They are no longer avaialble where i used to purchase them.</li>
    <li> From the picture and wording &amp;#34;5 cartridges&amp;#34; I ordered 3 refill cartridges - I received 3 razors with 3 cartridge refils of two each.  I suppose the three razors were for &#x27;my three hands&#x27;.  It was not what I ordered so - NO MORE ORDERS will be coming from me.  I am tired of ordering and there being no way to talk to anyone to get the order correct nor SERVICE. Seems whatever you want to send is o.k. with you because you are overstocked.  Blah!

    <li> I use this product because it gives me a smooth shave.  I don&#x27;t need a cartridge with five blades if one with two blades does a good job, and this one does a good job.</li>
    <li> I was very displeased with the way the item was advertised. It appered to be 5 packages of blades not one. The price was way out of line. I have been buying those blades for years and have never paid more than 7 0r 8 dollars for a single pack. That one was almost 60 dollars. Like I said it was very decptive the way it was advertised. I sent it back.</li>
