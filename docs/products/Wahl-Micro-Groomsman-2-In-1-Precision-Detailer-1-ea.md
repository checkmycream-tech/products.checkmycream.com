<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product thou has a little trouble with thick and or coarse hair, incredible price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Work nice,however the batterys only last a handful of uses.</li>
    <li> I use it as a woman and find that the blade is a lot sharper than most women&#x27;s shavers. I am extremely please with this product for the price especially. It is great for trimming nose hair, arm hair, bikini etc. I use it all the time and all over!! Have never been happier with a trimmer before. These are also extremely useful for traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any male and FEMALE.</li>
    <li> To darn loud in my ears, want buy it again. I would have given it 1 star but it does work and that is why it gets 2 stars.</li>
    <li> NEVER buy this trimmer!...It is way under-powered with only a AAA battery.  IT failed to live up to it&#x27;s no-pull guarantee.  I returned it and bought the Norelco AA battery NT9110 trimmer, and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product was nice but does not work very well</li>
    <li> this is good for trimming my coarse nose and ear hair without drawing blood.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment of quality product.</li>
    <li> This the second personal trimmer we have purchased from Wahl. We had the first one for 4 years before it started to get worn out. For the price we are very pleased with the amount of time we got out of it. I have predominantly used it with the nose trimming attachments. It never pulls and it gets all of the hard to reach spots. I have occasionally used it for eyebrow trimming as well. It works fine but it doesn&#x27;t have a guard or anything. You just have to be careful not to shave off too much otherwise you could end up with a bald spot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice little trimmer. Got it for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s still using it well.</li>
    <li> I am on my second one of these thinking the first one breaking was a fluke.  It is very touchy. sometimes it does not work.  It is hard to find the new heads to buy too.</li>
    <li> Works well but quality is not great, it is plastic that is not as sturdy as ones I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> This little groomer - had it kept working properly - was a 4+ all day, but I&#x27;m quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was purchased for me elsewhere as a Christmas gift because I&#x27;d been eying it for quite some time.  I liked that it came with two different types of heads and how small it was.  After a few uses it didn&#x27;t turn on.  I figured that maybe the battery died, which I found a bit odd since it was a lithium battery and didn&#x27;t even own it for a month.  I replaced the battery and still nothing.  I pulled the unit out of the case and as I was doing that it kept shutting on and off.  Now it barely works, even when I play with the battery and even then it isn&#x27;t spinning at full power.  I get a burst of full power for maybe 1-2 seconds before it goes back to sounding like it&#x27;s going to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have gotten a lemon.  It was a great trimmer when it worked properly.</li>
    <li> Very cheap design. Broke in a month.</li>
    <li> eyebrow and ear trimmer work well but nose trimmer seizes when cutting nose hairs, must turn it off and clean out hairs</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with all attachments.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice compact grooming tool.  My old tool died after about 6 years of use and I found this on a whim while looking for a replacement.  The build quality is ok with the outside being all metal.  The detailer head is great and works to get fine hairs.  I wish the nose hair trimmer was as good as my old Norelco but with some work it does a fine job.  Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> great for unwanted hair on my old man ears</li>
    <li> Cheap product broke within a month.</li>
    <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
    <li> I have bought other brands, and the ones with the light on them, and they were ok, but died fast, battery wise and sharpness dulled. I find this one alot nicer, keeps battery life long and remaining sharp. So it&#x27;s worth the no light trade off, but I do like the lights. The hubby also likes it.</li>
    <li> Really good on the ears</li>
    <li> Perfect razor for the bikini area.  Wish I had found it years ago.  Small, durable and easy to use.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Reallly great trimmers. I bought two and am glad it did. With the two different heads you can easily trim all you facial hair.</li>
    <li> I do not know where these 5 star reviews are coming from. The trimmer worked one time with decent performance. Next time it was week. I thought it might need a new battery although total run time was only 10 minutes. After replacing the battery it ran for 2 minutes and then died. It is now totally useless. Save you money this is a terrible product.    The company has sent me a replacement at no charge. It really was a hassle free replacement. The new unit is working. I think they are a little underpowered but not bad for the price. I am upgrading from a 1 to a 4.</li>
    <li> Much better than a lot of then i have seen in stores.  Does a great job on a replaceable battery</li>
    <li> bought this for my dad so that my mom could cut the hair in his ears. My mom said that it is great and does and super good job. My dad did say it was a bit loud then again sticking anything that makes a noise in your ear will be loud. They were are very pleased and happy with it.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Panasonic ER-GN30-K for the nose but since I don&#x27;t care much for shoving something up my nose and then in my ear I chose this to trim the ear area. I like the flat trimmer to go around the ear flaps and the back of the neck then use the rotary blade to lightly hit the ear canal entrance. Works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Strong item with hi quality components, for the price i am satisfied. I used to use the Turbo pen or whatever it as called and this works much better. Only used twice so far so hopefully no longevity issues</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer combo.  Says wet/dry but became intermittent as soon as it got near H20.  Dried it out and came roaring back.  So I will stick to brush cleaning, no biggie.  But otherwise nice metal housing and feels solid compared to most of the throw away competition.</li>
    <li> not bad. hard to find a really good one</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  Worked less than 10 days.</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast shipping, all was great!!!!!!!  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Every time I take the cap off this thing, the cutting blades come off. The blades are not secured so if you take the cap off or use the guard, the blades come off. The remington I had locked the blades on. Should have went to CVS and paid $10 for the remington. Also some random guy in a unmarked pickup truck delivered it.</li>
    <li> Well first thing out of the box... its cheap feeling, its plasticy, I thought I was buying a better product then the other that go for $10 at the drugstore... well I&#x27;ll be stickign with my remington, even tho I keep buying them over and over cuz they go bad after 6 months... but at teh very least IT WORKS. The blade just kept stopping... no it didnt pull... but it was impossible to trim my unruly bikini area with it... yeah I went there... anyways went to the drugstore got my remington whcih was on sale for $8, and it did the job it was suppose to... cut the hair!!!</li>
    <li> A good price for a trimmer that provides both a rotary and straight cutting option, along with a cap, and and an eyebrow trimmer attachment with two length settings.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, and it seems to do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> Solid and does the job.</li>
    <li> works great. It does a very good job at what it is designed to do.. And setting a minimum limit on the number of words in these ratings. really sucks!  I almost for got why I don&#x27;t like to give ratings.</li>
    <li> WAAAAAAAY too loud to use in the ears.  I bought 2 and they are both going back.  Buy one with a thicker housing that gets less noise.  Seriously way louder than the other 2 we have in the house.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to change my remington trimmer, works way better. Has more power.</li>
    <li> Fantastic size and when it works its does. However within 6 months it died completely - nothing broken - no battery leaks.&lt;br /&gt;last use it reluctantly started  - now its dead. Reliability is very low.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery and a well functioning product</li>
    <li> Great razor at a great price !</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;groomsman&amp;#34; has a nice look.  The first problem I encountered was the &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; blade has stopped working. Unfortunately this is the blade I use the most. This product arrived with no brush so I&#x27;m unsure how to get that blade working again. Attempted to disassemble the blade to clean. Mistake, small parts are difficult reassemble.  Probably end up tossing the blade I need most.</li>
    <li> Small, easy to use.  Love the case, can carry in my purse or make up bag.  My husband has one also and he likes it because it is small enough to fit in our tooth brush holder.  Works great does not pull or hurt!!</li>
    <li> Most of the electric trimmers I&#x27;ve used over the past 10 years or so have been inconsistent, easily jammed with hair, and pretty much a pain in the drain because of their weak motors.  Such is not the case with the Wahl.  It powers up first time, every time and right from the start you can hear and feel the increased RPMs of it small engine which is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No jamming here as the whirring sound it makes provides confidence to the user.  I&#x27;d estimate its speed as at least TWICE the power of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Result?  It cuts quickly, gets the job done with far more efficiency and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it jamming up.  Excellent unit.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item and after minimal use within 2 months (same batteries) the internal battery prong broke off. Now the battery does not make contact with the points and it will not work.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who has no patience for all the gadgets on the others that were offered.  Works well, no complaints from him - easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> It seemed well designed at first.  However it is not a wet/dry trimmer as moisture got in and corroded the motor and contacts within a couple of weeks.  It has a warranty but I don&#x27;t know if I can expect the replacement to last either.  I&#x27;ll probably just switch brands or designs.</li>
    <li> works well. hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  Upon first inspection it looks very sleek and elegant but, as they say, beauty is only skin deep.  The rotary attachment attachment functions normally and adequately but the Clipper Attachment may as well not have been included as it literally fell apart....disintegrated first time I used it.  If all you need is the rotary trimmer I suppose it&#x27;s about as good as most of the rest.</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments, batteries don&#x27;t last long, probably a good deal for the money</li>
    <li> works perfect,  I bought an extra one as a gift, but thinking about keeping it as a back up. :)</li>
    <li> I used it a few times and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. The products build quality seems very poor and apparently reliability is not any better.</li>
    <li> This is a very good personal trimmer. It is portable enough for travel and has enough power to use everyday.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older I have less hair on the top of my head and more hair in my ears and nose.  This trimmer is the perfect size to groom those areas.</li>
    <li> I have purchased WAHL products in the past and they have held up well. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked twice then stopped. I changed the batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work. Even my cheap old micro touch lasted a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Mine works OK, but when I go to use it, I have to fidget with it to get it to start up, quite annoying but I have learned to deal with it. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This just confirms that Wahl makes the best grooming products.  I previously owned a similar product by another company and it had far less power and durability.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this trimmer, not off of amazon...but at a big box store. The reason I am writting this on Amazon is because my family and I use amazon a lot, and we feel this product needs some advertising! Simply put, this product is great! We have been hunting for a trimmer for around about a year now, and have bought more then a few trimmers in hopes that they would actually work. They haven&#x27;t, and I have thrown them all away after 1 use! The problem seems to be that most just aren&#x27;t powerful enough for men who grow vigorous nose hair. This little unit does wonders, amazing for such a small unit. We were skeptical, being that this is so slim with just one battery. We have always used wahl products and will continue to only use them for hair cutting products. This fits right in with their professional grade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this product. Lightweight, and supper powerful. More then pleasently suprised.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a lot of tough jobs much better than some of the other trimmers I tried.  I especially like the &amp;#34;nose hair&amp;#34; trimmer part.  I was not as happy with the eye brown trimmer as it did not trim the bushy hair too well.  Overall, very good!</li>
    <li> I have owned a pair of hair clipper by Wahl for over 25 years and they still work great.  So I purchased this item hoping the Wahl brand would deliver the quality I expect.  I am very disappointed in this item.  It is not powerful enough to get the job done.  Changed batteries and the result is the same.  I will be purchasing a different personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> This device works very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at what it does, although I don&#x27;t use the nose hair attachment.  The guides are just right for me and the battery is easier to change than the last on I purchased.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the trimmers that they sell on TV.  Those are total garbage compared to this one from Wahl.  I knew as soon as I turned this one on that it was a much higher quality.  The only possible downside to this item is that it does not ship with a battery, so have some AAA&#x27;s on hand.  :-)</li>
    <li> Good for those little grooming fixes</li>
    <li> Well, you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews and this thing seemed Ok.  So, what the hell.  Out of the box is seemed very cheap.  Anyway, I guess my nasal hair is tougher than the average guy because this thing is more of a &amp;#34;nasal hair ripper outer&amp;#34; than a trimmer.  I was nearly instantly brought to my knees by the pain of pulling about a dozen hairs out of my nose at the same time.  Then or course, it stopped, stuck to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this piece of junk to the manufacturer.  I will be sure to address it to the Marquis de Sade.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when an ancient nose trimmer I got from my Dad&#x27;s estate broke. I was amazed at what this tool, not much bigger than a fat pen, can do. It has three attachments. One replaces the nose hair trimmer. Another does touch ups on my beard close enough that I packed my electric razor, and a third fits on that attachment to trim my beard to a good length. Very useful, works as advertised, and I like the fact that it runs on a single battery. I have enough kids and remotes in the house that I always have those.</li>
    <li> works so so but is very loud.</li>
    <li> Works great glade I got this.</li>
    <li> It met and exceeded my expectations.  It was a fair price.</li>
    <li> The design of this is great. You can get a very close shave, which is not the case with most other clippers. Unfortunately this thing is very poorly constructed (as other reviewers have stated). It usually stops working within a week, but you can bang it on the side of the sink repeatedly, and it will usually start up again. At some point, the case at the top will come off, and trying to put it back together is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because of the design. I wish someone would make this design, but with good build quality. Very surprising that Wahl made such a poor-quality product. Very damaging to their brand name.</li>
    <li> I have used this item two times.  It worked great both times I used it.  You can tell the item is cheaply made but i was expecting it to last longer.  I&#x27;m hoping amazon can do something to make this right.</li>
    <li> worked for a bit.. the other day tried to use it.  i thougtht the battery was dead.  changed battery. not working.. its junk</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Seems well enough built, with as much power as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an essential tool for, say, trimming the line of a mustache over the lip.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.</li>
    <li> Junk....this thing constantly gets caught on body hair causing a painful reaction from me.  Blades seem slow.  After just 40 days the thing stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
    <li> do not buy this I received it and the gears slip .made really cheap I would not have thought wahl  would have made a much better product!</li>
    <li> A big P O S in a small package, It ran good the first time I used it, after that if it starts at all, it runs for 5-6 seconds then stops.</li>
    <li> Worked for one day, now when I turn it on nothing happens.</li>
    <li> I actually shaved my whole beard with it trying it out for the first time, it did a very decent job. It is slightly noisy but very powerful little unit, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My last trimmer broke on me... this does everything I wanted for the price. Definitely worth your time and consideration.</li>
    <li> BUY ANY OTHER GROOMER EXCEPT THIS ONE. TRIED TWO OF THEM AND THEY ARE POOR QUALITY AND WILL NOT CUT HAIR</li>
    <li> Motor weak. Even after oiling, it struggles to start with the trimmer attachment. When it does, it doesnt run fast. Struggles the whole time. Nose hair attachment works great though.</li>
    <li> It is simply not powerful enough to trim eybrows.</li>
    <li> Just received this trimmer and have only used it twice but it is great. Cleans up the neck line well and trims body hair easily. I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut. So awful. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my ears. The small head really lets me get into the curves.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to any one!</li>
    <li> My husband stole it from me, as he loved is so much, will have to send away for one for myself.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes a well groomed monkey.  I suggested this product to her and well, I think you can see the results on the attached photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hear it works well on beavers but my Mom is currently out of town so we can not try it out on hers.  I attached a photo of her beaver before it has been trimmed just in case I can get an after photo and update this review later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old. I have hair growing in places that I didn&#x27;t have hair when I was younger. This little groomer allows me to visit with my grandchildren and not have them go &amp;#34;Gross, Grandpa&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It just stopped working after 3 weeks, though I took care of it as instructed.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is similar to prior Wahl products.  Economical, it works well and I am concerned about battery life being short.</li>
    <li> had this product for just over a year. heads began giving me problems at 9 months. Finally two of the heads just quit working. Don&#x27;t plan to have this long.</li>
    <li> This is well built and works exactly like I expected it to. I had a Remington that looked the same, but it was flimsy and rarely worked right if it worked at all. I had to constantly replace the battery and even that didn&#x27;t always make the unit run better.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another and I recommend it to anyone looking for a nose and ear trimmer.</li>
    <li> The item showed earlier than they said it would and it just what I was wanting.</li>
    <li> Avoid the cheap flimsy trimmers offered in the market. With this Wahl trimmer you can expect a quality product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son last Christmas and am just getting around to reviewing it.  He used it for several months.  He did have a problem while using one of the combs on his eyebrows and it nearly took them all off!  I don&#x27;t remember paying a lot for this; I&#x27;d recommend paying more if you want a real good one that will last a long time but it was ok for a stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> It keeps you looking good.  My husband loves it!  It does not take long and neatens up the face.&lt;br /&gt;Before it was more tedious without it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job everywhere you may want small unit small price - perfect Buy take my word for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks, J.P.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart during work because I was going to visit with the girlfriend&#x27;s parents for Mother&#x27;s Day after work, and I forgot to shave. I figured for the 10 bucks i spent, I would be satisfied if I only got one good shave out of it. The box even says &amp;#34;NO NICKS, NO PULLS&amp;#34; well that is FALSE. While it didn&#x27;t cut me, this thing kept catching and pulling hairs on my face and neck, it was very painful. The speed would also change depending on the pressure I applied to the switch. I barely got a half decent shave, I will be returning it tomorrow morning after wondering all night if everyone is laughing at my crappy shave job. Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> Broke about two weeks after purchased.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Previously I had said \\&quot;Cheap. Broke on first use. \\&quot; That was the review I first wrote and gave it one star. Wahl contacted me through Amazon and gave me a free replacement. So based on their customer service alone and standing by their product I give them 4 stars. With the same type that I said they did me wrong, I now say they did me right. I respect this company now.</li>
    <li> I started to use the nose hair trimmer and no sooner than I put it in there it jammed. Took it off and the motor/battery section worked. I then attached the regular trimmer and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great! Replaces a similar product made by a different company. Would buy again. Was told it made a great present.</li>
    <li> took it to my chest hair and was impressed, so I finished it all off.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Mine was DOA.  Won&#x27;t purchase another at this point.  Have been using a micro touch for years and wanted a second one so tried this but very disappointed.</li>
    <li> really cheap materials and workmanship</li>
    <li> Works very well for the money but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  For now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but had a lot of difficulty top off to insert battery.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time to trim my eyebrows. Who needs a salon? It also works for nose hair, facial hair, etc. Powerful for its size!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his groomer.</li>
    <li> I use mine mostly for trimming eyebrows, and it does an excellent job and according to my husband it does a good job on ear and nose hair, unlike the last trimmer that we tried which mostly just pulled instead of trimming the hair.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst piece of crap I have ever ordered off Amazon. It does nothing but pull your hair the most uncomfortable thing I&#x27;ve ever used!I tried different batteries to make sure that wasn&#x27;t the cause each time the motor was very weak and would not cut it just got caught on every hair! Forgive me but I cannot help but say it is a piece of s*** !</li>
    <li> kudos this little thing. This can shave the hairs of your chest also. It works great. I also bought the Panasonic ER-GN 30 but I never use it. I always go back to my Wahi and I have no regrets. Also this come with two attachments vs one from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> inexpensive and light-weight. jammed repeatedly during first use with nose hair attachment. works well enough</li>
    <li> Got as a replacement to an older model. More power and sharper blades!</li>
    <li> I tell you what fellas, this thing is magic. It&#x27;s def not for the un-mowed field (I use my beard trimmer for that) but great for keeping the delicate items trimmed up. No pulling or nicking of sensitive skin. Sometimes a bit of razor burn if you press to hard but I have yet to pinch, nick or draw blood.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it NO stars!!! Please do not waste your money. I bought this for the nose clipper only, well it clipped a few before it stopped working. It would run until you put it in your nose then it stopped. Changed the battery, still the same thing. Found out it is in the switch; very poor quality for Wahl if indeed it is a Wahl and not a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> Good Product. Bought this for my Husband. He says it works well on his Nose Hair.  I tried to rim his Eye Brows with the Special Head. Worked fairly well. Need to read up on it more, maybe try the other attachment.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this 2 stars because I had problems with the round trimmer head (the traditional nose/ear hair style). It jams, slows down, and pulls hairs, just like all others I&#x27;ve tried. But I felt I should amend my review because for quite some time now I&#x27;ve used the other long straight head to do all kinds of trimming, and it works flawlessly. Great for eyebrows with the comb attachment. Also works well for nose/ear trimming without the comb attached. This also a nice compact trimmer that feels solid in your hand. Overall I&#x27;m quite please with it after giving it a chance.</li>
    <li> Was great until it totally stopped working in about 10 weeks. I guess the price WAS too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Basically, I don&#x27;t like this design, because the cutting surface is impeded by plastic on either side of it.  IT makes it very hard to cut a detailed line.  If all you want it for is nose or ear hair ... its fine.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Works great.</li>
    <li> Pros: small, form factor, blows annoying nose hair away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: vibration from the unit can itch the inside of your nose!</li>
    <li> Worked great for 2 uses, then I thought the batteries went dead. Changed batteries to brand new and it worked again. After 3rd use, would not come on again. Highly disappointed, but too late to return..</li>
    <li> Wish I could find something that actually has more power; these are OK for eyebrows and ears, but detail trimming on the beard...lacks the power necessary.  Nose trimmer thing actually has never worked since I received the item, but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> Powerful little guy that does the job.  I used some better lithium energizer batteries so I expect it to be powerful for a long time.  Blade is sharp and hasnt given me any trouble, it just works.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wahl 5060-600 Micro personal groomer for a while. So far it has performed very well. It was well worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Changed batteries twice and still only works for about 5sec before stopping</li>
    <li> Biggest piece of you know what. Went right from package to trash can. Never worked.</li>
    <li> Every man should have one for personal grooming.  It&#x27;s the best product for personal grooming I have owned yet.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of trimmer made by several other companies over the years and this is by far the noisiest and loudest I&#x27;ve ever used. Works well enough other than that. They need to put a muffler on it or something.</li>
    <li> Nice, you get what you see...</li>
    <li> I have used it on my ears and nose. it also does a great job on side burns. I wished I knew about it before.</li>
    <li> It came in perfect condition and it works exactly as promoted. It&#x27;s been a year and the item is still in great condition!</li>
    <li> If you plan on trimming anything other than ear hair get a different trimmer. The trimmer blades were dull at best....</li>
    <li> Works great and trims all the advertised areas - but eventually the blade will get dull - anyone know where a replacement blade is available??</li>
    <li> This works fine.  It is economically priced, and the materials are fine considering the price.  Nothing fancy, works fine, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very inconsistent operation with attachments.</li>
    <li> Motors to weak, jams instantly</li>
    <li> They work great and cost next to nothing.</li>
    <li> Product works well, and doesn&#x27;t feel particularly cheap or anything. The attachments twist on and off easily. Seems to run though batteries rather quickly, but otherwise I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, great price</li>
    <li> I had one of the Remingington ones before it broke so i decided to buy this one as a replacement. It works great and the attachments are really useful. The motor is powerful (and loud) and gets the job done so that I can keep looking fly.</li>
    <li> He finds it handy. Arrived quickly in very secure packaging, which is a relief because it is small and has component pieces</li>
    <li> total junk...just move on....</li>
    <li> Waterproof, works well.  Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer is too thick for my finer nose hairs, but for him and his eyebrows this works great!! This is truly a guy&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
    <li> Only takes 1 AA battery &amp; does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I thought Wahl had a good reputation for haircutting products.  They don&#x27;t deserve that reputation.&lt;br /&gt;This simply does not cut hair.  Utterly useless</li>
    <li> This personal trimmer fell apart after the second use.  Actually, when I removed the cap, the razor section just fell apart. I called Wahl and they said I could send it back to them.  I never got the chance to use the accessories.  Very disappointed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My second attempt to replace the &amp;#34;as seen on tv trimmer&amp;#34; that worked fine for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;toilet tree professional&amp;#34; one fell over and stopped working after 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;This one is even more cheaply made and does not cut anything, but pulls instead.&lt;br /&gt;The search for the grail continues...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work right, destroyed the package trying to get it out, so didn&#x27;t bother sending it back, but I definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The price is right and it works well. The issue I have is that it&#x27;s very loud. That really doesn&#x27;t matter much unless you are using it around your ears.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TRIMMER BECAUSE I HAD TO REPLACE MY BEARD TRIMMER, AND THE NEW BEARD TRIMMER DOES NOT COME WITH A NOSE AND EAR TRIMMING ATTACHMENT.  I RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY FASHION AND IT WAS PACKAGED NICELY, SO I OPENED IT AND INSTALLED THE BATTERY AND TRIED TO USE IT, AS SOON AS I STUCK IT IN MY NOSE IT STOPPED RUNNING AND WAS JAMMED WITH A PIECE OF HAIR, I TURNED IT OFF AND TOOK OF THE FRONT TRIMMING PIECE AND BLEW IT OUT AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER, AND IT TURNED BACK ON, AND IT RAN AGAIN AND THIS TIME I SLOWLY INSERTED IT IN MY NOSE, AND IT DID CUT SOME HAIR BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS IT WAS JAMMED AGAIN WITH A PIECE OF HAIR.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE THIS IS A &amp;#34;PIECE OF JUNK&amp;#34; MY PREVIOUS NOSE TRIMMER WAS A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT TO THE BEARD TRIMMER AND NEVER, I MEAN NEVER LET ME DOWN, ALWAYS WORKED FINE.</li>
    <li> I use this for nose hair primarily. The nose hair trimmer does not work well. Instead I use the regular hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;In this way it works Ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit and it worked ok for about 2 weeks. They took it back and gave me a replacement that worked for a couple of weeks. I have had nose trimmers that lasted a decade. This is not that. This is a cheap unit that does not work well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This item is extremely poorly made and did not function for even the first use. I have no idea where the descriptors that other reviewers have left of this item being &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;, but it did not even work the first time I used it, grinding to a halt on even medium-fine hairs. This item was an immediate return - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I only can say this trimmer is a piece of c...!! I bought it at Fred Meyer and it doesn&#x27;t stay together well and doesn&#x27;t cut good. I only use it for my husband&#x27;s nose hair and ear hair. I can&#x27;t even give it a star.</li>
    <li> nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work! the blade spins around as it&#x27;s supposed to do, so it&#x27;s not inoperable, but it does not consistently cut the hair, and when it does cut a hair here and there it does not cut it closely. it is functionally worthless as a nose hair trimmer. the eyebrow trimmer attachment works slightly better, but still not acceptable. wish i had read other&#x27;s reviews before purchasing. i did return and received the normal hassle-free refund from Amazon. I love Amazon.  If I were rating them they&#x27;d receive 6 stars from me!</li>
    <li> This is a real piece of junk. The blade that comes with it has too much natural friction for the motor to actually move it. That and the blade head fell apart as soon as I took it out of the package. I ended up just throwing it away instead of dealing with the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. My beard is always neat and trim. I can even clean up my neck line between hair cuts</li>
    <li> Love it.  Very powerfull and gets into tight spots.  A little expensive then my first one, but worth it.  I paid $4 for my original about 4 years ago and this one was $10.  Good product.</li>
    <li> well built unit, I like the small size.uses a single AAA battery, great price and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was a waste of $10. I have always liked Wahl products. This trimmer does not work. Right from box to the garbage!!!</li>
    <li> Trimmer has a stronger motor than others of this type.  The mustache attachment has two settings that was hard to figure out at first until I read the directions.  Saves having two attachments for different lengths.  No pinching or pulling of nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This makes a very loud noise, so my roommates are always wondering what the sound is and I can&#x27;t explain because I&#x27;ll be in an awkward position...but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve inly used it once...but the little thing is awesome. I don&#x27;t use the nose attachment for my nose hairs, I use the little clipper. The trimmer plowed through them. Did the little bit of hair on my ears...perfect. Then trimmed my eyebrows with the comb attachment added.  Again, perfect. For $10-$12 it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item twice. First one stopped working after using the first week (only used it once).  Figured no big deal it wasn&#x27;t that costly so decided to purchase another. The second one, i had for a full 3 weeks before it stopped working! A terrible product.  Purchased a different brand and it works great, seems to be more powerful, and feels like new after 2 months. Avoid this item.</li>
    <li> great for travel but weak motor</li>
    <li> The first time I used it there wasen&#x27;t much power, by the third time there was no power. I changed the battery and it still didn&#x27;t have enough power to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is about as big around as a dime so the motor must be really small and useless. This trimmer is really neet I wish mine would work.</li>
    <li> My husband kept stealing my personal trimmer ... and I kept hiding it.  Very annoying.  Next thing I knew this arrived on my door step.  Burst out laughing when I opened the package!  When he got home that night you would have thought the Hope Diamond had been delivered.  He must have played with it for half an hour, testing out all the attachments :-)  Anyway, he&#x27;s very happy with how sturdy it is ... brags that it&#x27;s \\&quot;much better\\&quot; than my personal trimmer ... and I can&#x27;t use it!  Too funny for words!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product is not 5 stars.  I have literally bought every personal trimmer on the planet and every one of them has disappointed me.  I am a little unique in that the primary reason I am using it for it to just give my sideburns a quick buzz so I don&#x27;t have to get a haircut every week.  I don&#x27;t like my greys so I like to keep the sideburns tight without fluffy greys.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for my ear hairs, unibrow :), and nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This one has the power and strength to do it all where most of the trimmers I have purchase just feel and sound weak.&lt;br /&gt;Not this one! Even the sound of it instill confidence that I know I have a strong trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the other ones get stuck in my sideburns which just tells me that they are very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Wahl for ending my month long journey to find the best hair trimmer for me!&lt;br /&gt;This is a winner!</li>
    <li> THIS PERSONAL TRIMMER WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  IT HAS MANY MULTIPLE PURPOSES.  I PERSONALLY USE THIS FOR A NOSE HAIR TRIMMER.  IT DOES A FABULOUS JOB.  GREAT PRICE TOO!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent personal trimmer; my husband and I have both used it and are very satisfied with it.  Recommend to others and we&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!!!!! KINDA LOUD THOUGH BUT WHO CARES!!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for...this is dinky but I guess its worth what you pay for it. Go fer it!</li>
    <li> The best Micro groomer I have ever owned very well made.</li>
    <li> Total junk, broke after a try and got stuck in my nose hair. Big nutt punch to my self esteem</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what I need, in that it doesn&#x27;t cut hair. It will, however, pull hair out. Not at all usefull.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact item from TJ Max for 9.99. The first one was broken when it was purchased and immediately retuned. The second one works well. Beats the hell out of using tweezers for those nose hairs. No pulling or pinching. I&#x27;m not sure how helpful the other attachments are unless maybe you&#x27;ll be using it to trim ears or eyebrows. I&#x27;m not that hairy...yet.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many trimmers and likes this one the best. It has different pieces for his nose hairs, eye brows, etc.</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this little unit and I love the way he looks!  The first one we bought didn&#x27;t last very long so we purchased two more - its that good.  That said, if this one breaks as easily we may need to search further.</li>
    <li> What more can I say.  The value was exactly what I expected and the trimmer worked as I expected. Great</li>
    <li> OK, to be honest, I bought this for show-pet grooming. (The insides of their ears have to be trimmed for competition.) It&#x27;s very noisy and scares the animal, so it&#x27;s absolutely no good for that. But if you just need a travel-size nose hair or eyebrow trimmer, it would probably be all right.</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers over the year and this one is the best for me. It has excellent power and cuts without pinching.</li>
    <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t bother. Save your money.</li>
    <li> When I opened this and upon first use the trimmer blades would not rotate in the head. You could hear the motor going but nothing was happening to the blades. I tapped the device on the sink counter then the blades started to rotate and when I went to trim my nose hair the blades literally ripped my nose hair out and did not trim the hair like it is supposed to. Upon using it a second time the same thing happened and I thought I&#x27;ld be better off with nose scissors for grooming.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. It does the job. I suspect trimming technique is as important as the tool. My only concern is that there is no easy way to store the (exchangeable) parts. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied for the estimated $9.00 purchase price.</li>
    <li> ON TIME AND AS ADVERTISED</li>
    <li> fast delivery.....works great!!</li>
    <li> I have bought many trimmers. This trimmer works the best but I end up replacing it about every six months because it breaks.</li>
    <li> When first using this it worked great and did what I needed it to do.  However, after using only one time in the shower it broke and did not work after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did work in the shower the water got inside the device and ended up corroding the inside of the battery compartment after just that once use.  The description says it can be used wet or dry but I don&#x27;t fully believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on using this dry only then this might be for you, otherwise I would avoid.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, great product!</li>
    <li> The unit only worked one time.  I ran the cutting tool under the faucet to clean it out and it never ran again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> works well .  Does not irritate intimate areas</li>
    <li> Cheap! Heads broke upon me trying to switch from one to another. Looking for other brand. I like Wahl produts, but this one is awful.</li>
    <li> Does the job it was purchased to do, just as described. I would recommend this product to anyone however I wish that it would have been just a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> Great tool, serves every trimming need I have.</li>
    <li> I did not by this on Amazon but like it so much I felt I need to review it. I was surprised that it did not have better reviews. It does a great job. I especially like it for the back of the neck. I read the question of will it cut pubs. Sure maybe.... I want to point out. This is not a body groomer. It is not made for that task. You wouldn&#x27;t try to cut a tree with a butter knife would you?</li>
    <li> This works great. Very handy. I am a little worried about the battery life, but so far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
    <li> Having owned a Wahl cordless beard etc trimmer for 20+ years and only replaced one battery, it seemed this eould be a logical successor. Wrong. It was. Like a toy, and the price should have alerted me to that fact. One has to guess at hthe usage of each of 3 different trimheads.&lt;br /&gt;I have parked it for good after one session because the lack of useful information coupled with its flimsy construction&lt;br /&gt;left me no choice unless i was willing to risk chopping up my eyebrows by use of the wrong head.</li>
    <li> I just got it and put a AAA battery and when I tried using it it did not work. Is there anyway I can get a refund or replacement?</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy and good-looking trimmer. The steel case (which slips off the plastic innards to replace the batter) seem sturdy and looks nice. It&#x27;s a very masculine, sleek trimmer. The swappable heads and the two-sides / two-lenth trimmer guard give you alot of versitility, and it seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ding is it needs a small case to hold everything, there is no &amp;#34;AAA&amp;#34; battery inclosed in the packaging (how cheap is THAT?!) and it would be nice to have  a brush to clean it (though it says you can run the heads under water - but not submerse them).</li>
    <li> I guess this is one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; items. I really don&#x27;t have much else to say about this product, but I guess I need more words before I can hit submit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews of others, but after using for sometime now, l can say for me, this is a very beautiful and functional product that does what it is suppose to do, l gave it five star because l don&#x27;t any complaint about for now.</li>
    <li> Nice, simple, easy personal groomer that is small in size, use standard battery and can trim sides and neck as well as nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> The round nose trimmer jams and won&#x27;t spin.  This happened just a few times I used it.  The comb style still works and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using and I DO clean it during and after each use.</li>
    <li> Just picked one up at Rite Aid.  It may not last forever, but it had my nose hair cleaned up in minutes -- and was only $10.</li>
    <li> It does the job to an extent but works when it wants to work not necessarily every time I would like for it to. You push up on the start switch and nothing happens even when I have a brand new battery on board. A different brand does the same thing so guessing it is a trait of this type of trimmer.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT ON HAIR BUT JAMS WHEN CUTTING EYEBROWS</li>
    <li> Works great.  Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great product to trim eye brows and nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Cheap junk with a wahl name on it. Broke after 4 months.</li>
    <li> just used it again 2 hrs ago . if it stops after leaving in cabinet remove top and let it run,if it doesn&#x27;t run change battery. after it runs, reinstall top. clean top comb with a small brush, old tooth brush will due, rinse. mine works great. ps after a year still works treat as prior and run under water to clean it, it&#x27;s a  water proof tip. captez</li>
