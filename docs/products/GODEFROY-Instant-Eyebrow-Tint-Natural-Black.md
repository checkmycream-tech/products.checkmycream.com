      <li>The natural quality of this dye is awesome and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything else that I like.  </li>
      <li>so my eyebrows look too light.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally a light brown</li>
      <li>Godefroy did not look near as good as the Roux.</li>
      <li>have tried plucking them out and discovered that the more I plucked the more they multiplied - you can but pluck out so much hair in your brow before you end up with nothing!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Comes with 4 applications times so definitely worth every penny !</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time, Works great, and lasts long!  </li>
      <li>The end result was very nice, however, the first time doing it he had a lot left on his skin making him look like a clown.</li>
      <li>I called the vendor and they suggested he use dish soap as a mild abrasive so that it would come off like an exfoliator.</li>
      <li>It goes away quickly once you move away from your eye.  </li>
      <li>so the Natural black looks awesome.</li>
      <li>I have light gray eyes and a darker complexion, so when my brows are tinted my eyes contrast and really stand out.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t remove it right away.</li>
      <li>And the result was really good - the colour was black.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product, it says it lasts 4-6 weeks, for me it seemed to last 2 months</li>
      <li>it looks natural, and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This product is quick and easy to use, and the effects last for about a month.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to colour the eyebrows - it only took up to 10 minutes on the whole.</li>
      <li>use 1/2 a capsule the first application, and I reapply using  between 1/2-1/3 of the capsule for touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Just make sure you are a patient blonde.</li>
      <li>The product is good, but messy applying</li>
      <li>I bought this for the first time and I really thought it would last more than two weeks</li>
      <li>However, it would become less effective with each use.  </li>
      <li>I bought disposable mascara wands and they&#x27;re a bit too large.</li>
      <li>Also, the product came fast.</li>
      <li>Now I am happy and  no one knows my secret.</li>
      <li>This stuff really tints.</li>
      <li>This costs so much to get done at a salon.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and it really work, all the gray hairs are gone,</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the difference the dark brows make in my appearance.  </li>
      <li>My hair salon has a new policy of not tinting my eyebrows anymore, and I really wanted them colored each time I have my hair done.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like this eyebrow tint.</li>
      <li>My tint gradually fades after day 2, and it distinctly noticeable to myself and others around day 4/5; from that time on I reapply to only sparse areas.</li>
      <li>I tend to goop it on pretty thick to make sure each hair is covered.  </li>
      <li>The next time around we were more careful</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m purchasing a second one, because I ran out of my first one.</li>
      <li>(just wipe away quickly with a wet paper towel).  </li>
      <li>I do have to say for me, it only lasted two weeks, and maybe that&#x27;s because when you are washing your face, the soap and water is also touching the eyebrows, so it does not last as long, but still, it is worth not seeing grey eyebrows for two weeks.  </li>
      <li>I definitely prefer the dark brwn in comparison, its gives me a more natural look, I can also multitask during the process.</li>
      <li>really like the Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint line!</li>
      <li>no allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like how it gives my eyebrows a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it does exactly what it says but doesn&#x27;t stay as long as promised.</li>
      <li>You may want to use this at least a day or more before any special occasion in case of slight skin staining.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last too long on me, fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I am diligent about my keeping my brows neat and dark and this tint delivers color as deep or as light as you&#x27;d like it to depending on the length of time you leave it on.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s simple to use, it tints the grey out of my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s economical.</li>
      <li>It usually takes a better part of an hour for me for several reasons.</li>
      <li>i have dark asian hair with light eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I found this product at Amazon, and tried it, and I must say, it works really well for grey eyelashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!! It is easy to use, not too expensive, and saves time &amp; money by doing this at home versus going to the salon or spa.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time and I really thought it would last more than two weeks but it doesint so if your looking to have to redye your brows every two weeks than This is For You :).:P. chea NOT. On the upside at least this doesint cause my eye brows to fall out? like Hair dye did Dont ever EVER dye ur brows with hair dye unless u want NO brows take it from me ;-) and i mean no brows .</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, and have no complaints. it&#x27;s simple to use, it tints the grey out of my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s economical.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were turning grayer than my hair.  I used this tint to cover the gray and it worked.  You have to be careful not to get it on your skin (just wipe away quickly with a wet paper towel).  I bought disposable mascara brushes instead of using the included sticks to get a more even coverage.  So far it has been 2 weeks and the color still looks great!</li>
    <li> I was looking for tint for eyebrows for some time. I was glad when i found this product on Amazon. I have read review and was looking forward to use it. It worked very good and i am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the difference the dark brows make in my appearance.  I have always had dark brows, but now I have gray hair.  I don&#x27;t mind the hair, but I don&#x27;t want the gray brows!  This product is quick and easy to use, and the effects last for about a month.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I love not having to worry about my eyebrows rubbing off when I sweat. This product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I bought the natural black color it looks natural, and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I am african american with brown hair so my eyebrows basically look non existant against my skin. The natural black worked well for me, I recommend this eyebrow dye.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but messy applying and you really need a delicate hand (especially if you have the mixture for dark hair)it will stain your skin. My husband has jet black hair so I went with the second darkest shade. His eyebrows had become grey (silver, almost white)so we tried this product and shade as advised by other reviews. The end result was very nice, however, the first time doing it he had a lot left on his skin making him look like a clown. I called the vendor and they suggested he use dish soap as a mild abrasive so that it would come off like an exfoliator. It took a couple days but it worked and his eyebrows look great. The next time around we were more careful and I used a different applicator - not one they supplied (I used an eyelash brush) This way I was able to focus on just getting the hair and avoid the skin. The results were much better. The manufaturer of this product should consider having different applicators - theirs stink.</li>
    <li> this product is easy to use and my father loved it. it was a good deal and i was so happy when I found it and gave it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Does not do the job it suppose to do. The color would not adhere to the brow.  Product is not recommended.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have Jet black hair so the Natural black looks awesome. I have eyebrows just not a lot so decided to tint them. Glad I did ! This product is awesome. I can wash my face, swim do everything i do normally everyday without having to worry that my eyebrows I colored in are going to come off. This costs so much to get done at a salon. save yourself a lot of money. Comes with 4 applications times so definitely worth every penny !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Roux Lash &amp; Brow Tint for years and it worked great.  However, it would become less effective with each use.  So I would have to replace it before using all of the product.  So I thought I would try Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint.  Bad choice.  Godefroy did not look near as good as the Roux. I&#x27;m going back to Roux.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used eyebrow tinting before.  Acutally just discovered eyebrow and eyelash tinting.  My hair is naturally a light brown but I dye my hair a blue black so my eyebrows look too light.  I normally use mascara or pencil them to make them darker, but this is kind of annoying for everyday wear.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work, but it&#x27;s amazing.  Now I don&#x27;t pencil in my eyebrows unless I want really dramatic makeup on my nights out.  I love waking up and when I want to just put some powder foundation on and mascara and go, I can.  It&#x27;s one less step I have to worry about.  I used the natural black so it&#x27;s not too black.  I tend to over pluck my brows so this helps with that too, making them look fuller.  It does stain the skin a little depending on how long you need to leave it on.  I tend to goop it on pretty thick to make sure each hair is covered.  Using something like vasoline around your brows where you don&#x27;t want the tint to go on does help.  Very easy instructions and easy to apply.  If you have sensative eyes you may want to be in a room where air is moving around a little.  If it gets close to your eye, like when I was applying the inner parts of my brows since they are closer to my eye, there is a slight burning sensation, cutting an onion causes worse burning.  It goes away quickly once you move away from your eye.  Once applied it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all during the waiting period.  It does say not to tint your lashes with this, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s because it may burn them.  Also follow the timing, if the minimal time isn&#x27;t enough, you can always go back and apply again for additional time.  Not sure if over tinting could damage your brow hairs.  Overall a great product, it says it lasts 4-6 weeks, for me it seemed to last 2 months and then I need touch ups.  You may want to use this at least a day or more before any special occasion in case of slight skin staining.</li>
    <li> My order shows that I picked Natural Black but I received Dark Brown in the mail so this is pretty much useless to me.</li>
    <li> My hair salon has a new policy of not tinting my eyebrows anymore, and I really wanted them colored each time I have my hair done.  Enter the Gofefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint!  It is SO easy to use, works very fast, and perfectly covers my grey eyebrows.  Also, it lasts until I need my next hair color treatment (about 8 weeks!), since I use this tint when I get home from the salon each time.  What a GREAT product, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows was getting shades of gray and I did not like the look.  I purchased this product and it really work, all the gray hairs are gone, gone for at least six weeks.I had problems finding a workable product in the stores, so I purchased this on line. Now I am happy and  no one knows my secret.</li>
    <li> I found this product at Amazon, and tried it, and I must say, it works really well for grey eyelashes.  I do have to say for me, it only lasted two weeks, and maybe that&#x27;s because when you are washing your face, the soap and water is also touching the eyebrows, so it does not last as long, but still, it is worth not seeing grey eyebrows for two weeks.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I particularly like this eyebrow tint. I&#x27;m purchasing a second one, because I ran out of my first one. It lasted for a year. The price is affordable. I like how it gives my eyebrows a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it on my eyebrows for a minute and than wash it off with a cotton pad and water. Really easy.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  My eyebrows grow out half way and they are thin; so I didn&#x27;t like the way half of my eyebrow was dark and the other half was just a shining dye to my skin.  I know some people apply cosmetic afterward  to tone down the shine, but I don&#x27;t wear hardly any cosmetic during the summer, only the fall and winter months because of my oily skin. So for those that have thin eyebrows or eyebrows that grow half way this product may work for you especially if you don&#x27;t mind wearing cosmetic.</li>
    <li> I am almost 50 and honestly don’t mind my graying hair on my body HOWEVER I totally despise, hate seeing my brow turn grey or white!!!  Totally unacceptable&lt;br /&gt;I have tried plucking them out and discovered that the more I plucked the more they multiplied - you can but pluck out so much hair in your brow before you end up with nothing!&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me that you tint your brow and I looked on Amazon (my one stop find all) and came across this product Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint, Natural Black&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful for this product.  It did just what it said it would do and I no longer have to pluck or even use a black eyeliner –&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that I actually did not need a lot to get the job done.  Next time – I plan to use half a capsule.  There are 4 tinting capsules in the package.  Eternally grateful for this production :)</li>
    <li> I have naturally brown hair and almost invisibly blonde eyebrows. I dye my hair black so I always use Lancomes eyebrow gel. I finally found this product and could not be happier. It works well. Just be sure not to rub it into your skin or you&#x27;ll look like a clown. I now only use my Lancome eyebrow gel when this starts to fade.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, Works great, and lasts long!  Also very easy to use, easy to follow instructions. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good product. Doesn&#x27;t last too long on me, fades quickly.</li>
    <li> this is a good product. it does exactly what it says but doesn&#x27;t stay as long as promised. i have dark asian hair with light eyebrows. i use this because i want to darken the tint a little. it does what it says, nothing more. no allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i look for quality of color and its staying power. i took off two stars because the staying power is lacking, but the quality of color is good. i find this product satisfactory. i will probably repurchase it, but not in a hurry.</li>
    <li> The color lasts 3-4 weeks. Wish they supplied an applicator as the orange sticks are useless. I bought disposable mascara wands and they&#x27;re a bit too large. Good product but can be messy if it gets on the skin and you don&#x27;t remove it right away.</li>
    <li> If you exercise care this is a wonderful product. It delivers the 6 weeks of color as expected. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have bought lots of brow dyes over the years and this is my very favorite. I open the capsules, pour the powder in a small container and use just what I need. Great product - Great seller!</li>
    <li> At the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure, which colour to choose (between brown and black), since a lot of reviews said that even brown looks too dark (almost black, according to them). However, I still decided to go with the natural black. And the result was really good - the colour was black. But I personally would prefer a darker black, so next time I am going to try the jet black (I am light skin, dark hair, blue eyes). It was very easy to colour the eyebrows - it only took up to 10 minutes on the whole. Also, the product came fast. The price is ok. The thing I liked about it the least is that the colour doesn&#x27;t last long enough - I need to recolour after about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the corny headline, hehe!  This tint works well on brows. I have light gray eyes and a darker complexion, so when my brows are tinted my eyes contrast and really stand out. I am diligent about my keeping my brows neat and dark and this tint delivers color as deep or as light as you&#x27;d like it to depending on the length of time you leave it on. It also saves money in that you don&#x27;t have to make appointments with your salon. It last about 5 days without the need of a touch-up. I do mine every three days when I need my brows to look sharp. It isn&#x27;t obvious that your brows have been tinted. You won&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;Uncle Leo&amp;#34; from Seinfeld, or look like you belong on an episode of Jerry Springer.  The natural quality of this dye is awesome and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything else that I like.  I do wish that it lasted a bit longer, so that&#x27;s the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to do a touch-up; it generally takes me about 5 minutes. I also don&#x27;t use the entire dye/pigment pill. I just use what I need and each box will last several months so I think it&#x27;s fair to say that the pigment is fairly strong.  If you&#x27;re looking for a brow dye to cover grays, or to give your brows a fuller, more striking appearance this Godfrey kit works great.</li>
    <li> It works great on my skin tone. I&#x27;m filipino and my hair is very fine that I have to put eyebrows every morning. Glad I found this! Now I can go to work or out not having to draw and shape my eyebrows. It last for about two weeks. I had to keep a longer application time to make it darker and Coz my skin is oily that it fades too fast.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get the jet black next time. I love this product and would recommend!</li>
    <li> I am starting an eyebrow tinting business. This stuff really tints. I let mine sit too long the first time and had really dark brows yikes!! Good stuff</li>
    <li> My kit arrived with bits of other product and the wrong instruction manual so I didn&#x27;t get to use it.  It looked like it would be a great product if it were the product that was presented on the box.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to mix it or apply it.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Updated review of product line:&lt;br /&gt;The intensity of the tint gradually fades depending on your skin, and how often you wash you face. I have naturally thin eyebrows, my skin is oily, and I wash my face twice a day. I also exercise (i.e. jogging, power-walking, and occasionally lifting weights) 4-5 days a week, therefore I&#x27;m sweating also. My tint gradually fades after day 2, and it distinctly noticeable to myself and others around day 4/5; from that time on I reapply to only sparse areas. One capsule does not last the advertised 6 weeks on me; but a box will last an average of 1.5 - 2 months, sometimes longer if I slack on my touch-ups. How long a box last will depend on how often I reapply and my preferred intensity of the tint.&lt;br /&gt;I use 1/2 a capsule the first application, and I reapply using  between 1/2-1/3 of the capsule for touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;The application process is fast, and I suggest using a small pointed paint brush rather then the provided sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process time also depends on the above. I usually leave the Godefroy dark brwn on from a few minutes to a couple of hours (i.e. hair/cleaning/napping); but for the natural blk,1-2 minutes seems to be sufficient. I definitely prefer the dark brwn in comparison, its gives me a more natural look, I can also multitask during the process. But I will DEFINITELY run to the natural blk, before I&#x27;d pick up my brow pencils, powders, and gel every day. The natural blk also seems to last longer, I guess, because its so dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint line! It saves on time, and I don&#x27;t have to wake up wondering where my eyebrows disappeared too. Also, I cant discount the happiness of one less thing I have to do in the morning (no more filling in everyday, yea!!!). Thank you ah&#x27; bunches!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....Just wished the brown would it last longer.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but it is rather hard to use and it takes patience. I found that it is very necessary to take time and go slow. It usually takes a better part of an hour for me for several reasons. 1) my eyelashes look almost nonexistent because they are so blonde. 2) if it gets in the eyes it stings badly, and it is extremely hard not to get into eyes. 3) if it gets on your hands at all it will stain. It never seems to stain by my eyes but my nails and hands it takes forever to come off, and I find it hard to use gloves with this product because it takes alot of precision in order to not get it in the eyes. I have tried using vaseline under eyes but it gets in the lashes and then they won&#x27;t dye. Once I finish (after several coats) I love LOVE my eyelashes and I am thrilled I don&#x27;t need to wear eye makeup. So for that a great product. I would recommend it for us blondes. Just make sure you are a patient blonde.</li>
