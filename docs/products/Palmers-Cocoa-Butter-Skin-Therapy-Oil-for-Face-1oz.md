      <li>The next morning I awoke to very pleasant surprise.  </li>
      <li>I had to buy the full size product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not fond of putting anything on my face that has fragrance to it, and this is a very mild rosehip scent.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good on sensitive skin</li>
      <li>mother is in her 50s and has beautiful skin, but it is getting dry and she can start to see fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I love them all, but my very favorite is Palmer Skin Therapy Oil a unique blend of several, and it was my first love and introduction skincare oils.  </li>
      <li>Palmers Skin Therapy Oil was My First Love and my Introduction to Skin Oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I started with a professional CO2 treatment to remove those light brown ‘sunspots’ that have become more prominent.  </li>
      <li>i use it at night and morning letting it soak in for a while then gentaly wipe off the excess with a clean towel and then put on whatever for the day.</li>
      <li>I consider it my ‘liquid gold’, and it has a very special place in a pretty glass atomizer on my skincare collection tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also helps tighten my pores, which are pretty fine already.  </li>
      <li>I was able to apply more pressure, and increase my time to 10 minutes, then 12, and I am currently at 15 minute sessions.  </li>
      <li>The smell is mild, and not at all like cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>In the beginning, derma-rolling hurts, as it irritates and destroys the top layer of skin, encouraging new collagen growth as the skin repairs itself.  </li>
      <li>Every person&#x27;s skin type is different and there are so many factors that affect our skin so this may not be for everyone but for me, it works!</li>
      <li>and I love the slight rose smell.</li>
      <li>Great for harsh winter skin.</li>
      <li>In the morning you&#x27;ll be fresh</li>
      <li>I have been most pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The combination of ingredients is just right</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your face soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>So far so good, as my skin is finally supple again, and even my make up looks</li>
      <li>This combination of oils and cocoa butter is very gentle and leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>have since become an avid oil user for both skin and hair care products.  </li>
      <li>(Make sure you use a daily sunscreen or the spots and wrinkles</li>
      <li>For most of my life, I had been warned against using any oil product for facial skincare.  </li>
      <li>its very well worth it.</li>
      <li>At first, I did not like how it felt because it is literally oil on my face.</li>
      <li>The skin texture of my face was very smooth, unlike the sandy dry texture that I attaining after my derma-roller session.  </li>
      <li>I cannot really tell a huge different as far as fine lines go, but I&#x27;m hoping with continued use I might see some results.</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and certain products make me break out, but not this one.</li>
      <li>My next step was investing in a derma roller to fight those fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>She uses it morning and night, and after only a week you can see a difference in her fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, some people at work has notice how my face looks lighter, and even I can feel how much softer my face feels.  </li>
      <li>Really remove scars.</li>
      <li>My skin is so much softer.</li>
      <li>2-3 drops is all I need for my whole face and the oily feeling goes away soon after.  </li>
      <li>I had gotten a sample of it in a magazine, and I was really blown away.</li>
      <li>The Palmers skin therapy works very well.</li>
      <li>Will try the whole line</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is so much softer. My daughter came for a visit used it and loved it also. I intend to keep using it. Will try the whole line</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week and so far, I really like it.  I was afraid there might be break outs but so far, none. It makes my skin feel nice and smooth and my make up glides over it so smoothly.  I&#x27;m sure this product works just as well, as some of the very expensive &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; does. I was starting to get some &amp;#34;cheek&amp;#34; lines but they are softening already.  Good product.</li>
    <li> My wife says it is good, so it is good ....</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me off of Amazon. This is a great product if you have normal/dry skin, great for winter skin. I have been using for about a month now and I love the way it hydrates my skin at night (I do not use it for the day). It leaves my skin soft in the morning. I cannot really tell a huge different as far as fine lines go, but I&#x27;m hoping with continued use I might see some results. Contains Retinol so if you are sensitive to that steer clear.</li>
    <li> This is very good since it makes the wrinkles a little softer and makeup is smooth and looks better.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have horrible cystic acne scars from years ago; two weeks later I have faint cystic acne scars.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. It actually has reduced my pores significantly. I have psoriasis and certain products make me break out, but not this one. I strongly recommend this product, especially if you live somewhere that gets cold.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and the scent of this cocoa butter skin therapy for my face!</li>
    <li> Very light oil. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and I love the slight rose smell.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be more cocoa butt,re in it.</li>
    <li> This is so inexpensive compared to the many other products I&#x27;ve tried on my face that I held out little hope for any results. I have been most pleasantly surprised. My skin tone is more even and the texture has improved. I use it before bed and although my face is normally oily, I&#x27;ve found that using the Palmers Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Oil seems to make my skin feel less oily in the morning. Every person&#x27;s skin type is different and there are so many factors that affect our skin so this may not be for everyone but for me, it works!</li>
    <li> The thought of adding oil as a part of skincare routine just doesn&#x27;t make sense when you have pimple breakouts. Well, read this, cause I was just like you! When my skin wasn&#x27;t flaring up (due to hormonal cystic acne), it seemed dull and not soft. Also, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and starting to get tiny wrinkles (gasp!) here and there. I started to use jojoba oil mixed with tea tree oil after reading about the benefits of jojoba oil. While my skin softened, without exasperating my acne, I realized I needed something extra for the wrinkles and overall skin health:  Enter Palmer&#x27;s Skin Oil. I had gotten a sample of it in a magazine, and I was really blown away. I used it after washing my face at night, massaging it in my skin (and lips too). My skin just drank it up! It was like I finally found what my skin was asking for. The combination of ingredients is just right so I can actually skip using some of the serums I use at night! These ingredients include vitamin C, argan oil, coconut oil, and retinol, all beneficial to addressing my concerns. I had to buy the full size product! So far so good, as my skin is finally supple again, and even my make up looks better!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone at the age where they are concerned about wrinkles or want to prevent them, who has dry or combination skin, or is tired of using separate lotions and serums each night. If you have oily skin, just dab it on a little and rub it in. It seems contradictory to apply more oil, but this is the good oil to condition your skin. Dry skin, apply a whole bunch and just start massaging. In the morning you&#x27;ll be fresh faced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDAte: My skin looks amazing! I use it at night and sometimes in the morning, and the difference is huge. My skin is so soft, my pores are smaller. Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> My face is happy. Soothes my skin and wrinkles look a bit better. Not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s easy to use and makes your skin smooth and looking fresh ! Great smell!</li>
    <li> i got a sample in alure mag. was wary of trying it coz oils make me breakout. finally i used it...what a difference. noticed better skin after one night. i have rosacea and hormone breakouts. my skin looked ugly and raw. after a few nights of use, my skin looked healthy and smooth, i was so happy! got on amazon and ordered some. i use it at night and morning letting it soak in for a while then gentaly wipe off the excess with a clean towel and then put on whatever for the day. it has helped my rosacea, didn&#x27;t get rid of it but definately helped.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried other vitamin C serums and all kinds of stuff, i was ready to give up hope. used regiments of reasonalbly priced and outrageously priced products, but none gave me these results. i also have oily skin, thought i should tell you that. i know everyones skin is different, but for the price you got to try it. if you don&#x27;t like it for your face, it also made my hands nice. go ahead, try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It makes your skin so smooth</li>
    <li> Feels and smells fabulous. Doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin break out. Makes my skin glow. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this products.  It&#x27;s my new face oil.  Not going back to the other product I was using.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really remove scars.</li>
    <li> i have only used a third of the bottle and my sun spots are more than half gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;absolutely no irritation using this product.. love it</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re over 30, can you please just go get some of this?  You can thank me later.  I mix 2 or 3 drops in the palm of my hand with my regular facial moisturizer and voila.  (Make sure you use a daily sunscreen or the spots and wrinkles will just return!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, go pick some up, and we&#x27;ll all just be 28 forever, ok?</li>
    <li> Great oil, leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not fond of putting anything on my face that has fragrance to it, and this is a very mild rosehip scent.  Although my mother loves it, I wish Palmer&#x27;s would come out with an unscented version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this oil is incredible!  I am in my 20s and have extremely oily skin.  I have had adult acne since I was 21, and my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and allergens.  Using this oil in place of my nighttime moisturizer has STOPPED the oil production in my face!!  My face is smoother, I have noticeably less acne, drastically less oil, and my skin looks vibrant and healthy!  I&#x27;ll never go a night without this oil for my face!  I can&#x27;t believe I now have makeup-optional skin because of an oil!&lt;br /&gt;My mother is in her 50s and has beautiful skin, but it is getting dry and she can start to see fine lines and wrinkles.  She tried this oil after I begged her to, and she loves it!  It works great for moisturizing her skin, and her skin tone has become more vibrant and healthy as well.  She uses it morning and night, and after only a week you can see a difference in her fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to EVERYONE - it&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Palmers skin therapy works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now.  Once in the morning and in the evening.  At first, I did not like how it felt because it is literally oil on my face. However, some people at work has notice how my face looks lighter, and even I can feel how much softer my face feels.  I also had this fear about it causing acne/pimples because once again it is oil on my face but surprisingly, nothing has popped up.  If you are looking for something that moisturizes and softens your face then you should give this a shot.  Additionally, my co-workers have mentioned that my face seems lighter or more cleared up.</li>
    <li> It turned my dry skin  into soft supple skin., I find that now I only need to use it a couple times a week for maintenance . I think this product will be very good for winter use. I always liked palmers cocoa butter, but I never liked the smell. This has a light pleasant scent</li>
    <li> if you have dry skin, i recommend trying this. so hard to find anything really moisturizing so was happy to discover this. i use it under my makeup and on top of another moisturizer</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Got it as a sample packet and when I bought the skin therapy oil and now I can&#x27;t do without it. its a part of my skin care regimen day and night.</li>
    <li> did not work for me. made my face look darker . red patches.</li>
    <li> This combination of oils and cocoa butter is very gentle and leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I have had whiteheads on my nose and underneath my bottom lip almost all of my life.  This is the first product that has helped long term with the whiteheads and occasional pimples.  It also helps tighten my pores, which are pretty fine already.  I use a foaming face wash and an exfoliating wash cloth and follow up with Palmers Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Oil mainly just in my problem areas. I have also added a few drops of Emu oil as well.  I have been getting so many compliments on my skin since using this product.  The improvements will not be overnight so keep with it...its very well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I only apply it at night because it feels a little oily at first.  2-3 drops is all I need for my whole face and the oily feeling goes away soon after.  I feel that my face has gotten a lot softer from using this product.</li>
    <li> Palmers Skin Therapy Oil was My First Love and my Introduction to Skin Oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally bought this oil as a mistake; I had been looking for bath oil because I had a dry patch on my back that I was not able reach with my moisturizer.  I did not notice my mistake until I was home, so this facial oil just stayed on my bathroom counter, in the box, unopened, and untouched for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background information:  I am in my sixties, I have very dry skin, and I now reside in the Southwest Desert where the climate is dry and acrid.  For most of my life, I had been warned against using any oil product for facial skincare.  That was the misconception for almost my entire adult life.  The ‘best’ creams, lotions, cosmetics, and skin care lines were toted to be the ‘best’, because they were ‘oil free’…if you can believe that!  Please keep in mind, back in my day, there were not home computers, nor was there any internet, so what we read in magazines was really all the information that we had.  A lifelong believed myth is hard to dismiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Present Condition:  Over the past 5 years, fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, due to the loss of collagen and elasticity, have finally started to ruin my once pretty face, and this year I chose to start fighting this aging process.  I started with a professional CO2 treatment to remove those light brown ‘sunspots’ that have become more prominent.  My next step was investing in a derma roller to fight those fine lines and wrinkles.  In the beginning, derma-rolling hurts, as it irritates and destroys the top layer of skin, encouraging new collagen growth as the skin repairs itself.  My issue was that I was only able to ‘roll’ for 5 minutes due to the irritation, and then there was the burn, and the very hot sting, the after effects of this painful procedure.  My face was red, raw, and sensitive, as if I had been scraping it with rough gravel.  Just about every serum, lotion, and moisturizer that I applied stung very badly.  Nothing would soothe this painful irritation, not even cold water.  One evening, out of desperation, I ripped open the box and very gingerly applied some of this oil to my burning, stinging face. I was surprised, relieved, and shocked at the immediate soothing effect of this oil.  My thirsty skin just drank this in, the bright red irritation calmed down and it did NOT sting!  The next morning I awoke to very pleasant surprise.  The skin texture of my face was very smooth, unlike the sandy dry texture that I attaining after my derma-roller session.  A couple of weeks later I started to use a very small amount of this oil as a lubricant before derma rolling.  There was an instantaneous improvement.  As a lubricant my skin was not as dry, scratched up, or irritated.  I was able to apply more pressure, and increase my time to 10 minutes, then 12, and I am currently at 15 minute sessions.  This has resulted in better improvements at a faster rate, without the sting, without the burn, and my skin heals overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since become an avid oil user for both skin and hair care products.  I have bought and tried sesame, argon, castor, olive, and avocado oils.  I love them all, but my very favorite is Palmer Skin Therapy Oil a unique blend of several, and it was my first love and introduction skincare oils.  I consider it my ‘liquid gold’, and it has a very special place in a pretty glass atomizer on my skincare collection tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a doctor or dermatologist or even an aesthetician, however if you suffer with dry skin irritation during a derma roll session, you might want to try a minable amount (2 or 3) drops of skin therapy oil to lubricate the skin and minimize that dry irritation burning sting that results during a derma rolling session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review, and I hoped this has been helpful for a unique situation that has not been previously discussed in any ofthe other reviews.the other reviews.</li>

    <li> Oily when you apply and 10 minutes later your skin absorbs ! Works great on pimples , and wrinkles ! Happy camper!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. I have been using it for a little over a month and it has made a huge difference in my skin! I can already notice that some of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have diminished and my skin is so smooth. I am really enjoying the compliments that I have been receiving also - I&#x27;ve been told by several people that my skin looks &amp;#34;amazing!&amp;#34; That is something I&#x27;m definitely not used to hearing! I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my skin.  I have a lot of discoloration from acne scars and some ruddiness due to pregnancy hormones and most of it is gone since I started using this.  My skin has the most amazing glow.  I hope this product is never discontinued; it&#x27;s the one beauty product I can&#x27;t live without.  I am not using it in conjunction with anything else.  The smell is mild, and not at all like cocoa butter.  It&#x27;s a bit rosy, but nothing overpowering.  Of course, scents are objective so this is just my take on things.  Try this product.  If you have realistic expectations you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for harsh winter skin. Has made my face baby soft. A drop goes a long way. Also it smells fabulous like a bed of roses. I plan on continuing to use this for all seasons.</li>
    <li> My pores r getting smaller on nose.  I have redness on my checks I noticed it&#x27;s going away.  It&#x27;s good on sensitive skin cuz I break out w everything. .But this stuff is Perfect!!! I will buy again. .</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for you face.  It absorbs quickly and leaves your face soft and smooth.  I havenot used it long enough to see if I get a reduction in age spots and wrinkles, but will keep using it.</li>
