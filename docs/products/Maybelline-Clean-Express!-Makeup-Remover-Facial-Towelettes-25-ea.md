### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Anyhow, try them again, they&#x27;re awesome!!</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>These makeup removing towelettes are awesome!</li>
      <li>It is a gel and it works magnificently.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re awesome!</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>I find them to be very good at that.  </li>
      <li>these are the best and for a great price</li>
      <li>This makeup remover works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, and these work great.</li>
      <li>I love these wipes!  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite makeup wipes on the market at the moment (and believe, I&#x27;ve tried quite a number of wipes!).</li>
      <li>(I do manage to remove some foundation just when they touch my skin, so I imagine they would be effective in removing that, as well.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I love this product I signed up for it to be delivered once a month.</li>
      <li>mostly use these to remove eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>These are my favorite wipes.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love these wipes.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>They smell great - not too strong, light, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Works great, but purchase with caution if you have extremely sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
      <li>, in conclusion, I love the large surface area and I find these to be effective and non-irritating to the eyes.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like some cleansers do.</li>
      <li>Great for swatches or removing makeup mid way through appilcation.</li>
      <li>The wipes themselves are kind of scratchy on my skin and the remover seems very drying and takes a while to get the makeup off.</li>
      <li>They remove all my makeup and even some of my eye makeup, but for that I use the Maybelline Clean Express Eye Makeup Remover Waterproof.</li>
      <li>and as it says on the product, it doesn&#x27;t really clean off my mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, I love the large surface area of these.  </li>
      <li>Soft, nice fragrance, and even takes off waterproof make up as well.</li>
      <li>Was a great present thanks barb</li>
      <li>It completely removes my makeup quickly and easily and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn.</li>
      <li>They are also nice and moist and don&#x27;t seem to dry out.</li>
      <li>My face is left feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
      <li>It is an ample size to take care of your whole face as well as your eyes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell with these.  </li>
      <li>nightly routine now includes removing my eye makeup with the gel, my face makeup with one or two of these towlettes, then washing my face with gentle face soap, followed by a liberal amount of moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t one, but if I don&#x27;t even remember it when I&#x27;m writing this review, it must not bother me very much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it worked really well with what i wear</li>
      <li>Every pkg I have ever purchased has been very moist.</li>
      <li>I always follow up with a gentle face soap and</li>
      <li>I said, it doesn&#x27;t really work on breaking up mascara and eyeliner</li>
      <li>I really like these towelettes.</li>
      <li>I wear full coverage makeup daily.</li>
      <li>I was able to use a few, but then started having a reaction and had to stop.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now tried several different cloths and so far this one wins out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing I like about these is that they don&#x27;t sting when used near the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Clears a full face of makeup in less then a minute (even waterproof mascara) and leaves face refreshed.</li>
      <li>Once your makeup has set this won&#x27;t take much of it off as it is not wet enough.</li>
      <li>The cloths are big enough that I can really go over each eye several times, moving to a new spot each time.  </li>
      <li>Normally I have to apply lotion after I wash my face which tends to make my face extremely oily while I sleep but not with these.</li>
      <li>but I noticed the selling jumped the price to $11 (a little too much for one pack)</li>

<li> While I usually just use soap and water to remove the bulk of my foundation and blush, these are big enough -- and two-sided -- that they could be used over your whole face.  </li>
<li> I have fairly sensitive eyes and am often bothered by alcoholic or astringent products used near my eyes.  </li>
<li> They work very well and you can cut them in half and only use half a sheet as well.</li>
<li> They wipes are soft and get my makeup taken off in a few swipes.</li>
<li> /&gt;Finally, the package is resealable so they don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> To the people who said the wipes are dry, you guys just got a freak purchase.</li>
<li> had a nasty smell buy cheap get cheap stick with my ponds towelettes</li>
<li> This stuff gets every trace of makeup off my face and eyes, including particularly stubborn concealer and black eyeliner, with very little time and effort!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave face dry and tight like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t sting my eyes when I&#x27;m removing mascara like some other brands do.</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t take off half the makeup plus the smell of these towelettes</li>
<li> These were a random drugstore purchase (I have a lot of those, because I like to try new -- inexpensive -- beauty products).  </li>
<li> Your pkg should feel heavy.</li>
<li> However I took off one star since it seemed like I had to wipe a few times to remove mascara</li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t harsh at all</li>
<li> Other wipes hurt the delicate skin around my eyes, but this does not.</li>
<li> I thought hey let&#x27;s try something different and for that price u can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> BUT it absolutely smells HORRIBLE</li>
<li> Although this doesn&#x27;t work well on breaking up tough eye makeup, it takes up layers of foundation, concealer, and powder so well!</li>
<li> but I never see them in stores anymore :(</li>
<li> I definetely recommend the Neutrogen makeup remover than this piece of crap.</li>

    <li> Great for swatches or removing makeup mid way through appilcation.Once your makeup has set this won&#x27;t take much of it off as it is not wet enough.It did not get my makeup off even with 2 sheets.I&#x27;ll stick to my elf or neutrogena ones</li>
    <li> I love these but I never see them in stores anymore :( these are the best and for a great price</li>
    <li> This makeup remover works great. I only wear lipstick, eyeshadow,eyeliner and mascara so i can&#x27;t comment on how well it works on foundation but it worked really well with what i wear, it took everything off even my mascara in just a couple wipes. I have sensitive skin and it wasn&#x27;t harsh at all and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like some cleansers do. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove all my face makeup. I wear full coverage makeup daily. Although this doesn&#x27;t work well on breaking up tough eye makeup, it takes up layers of foundation, concealer, and powder so well! My face is left feeling very fresh and clean. I always follow up with a gentle face soap and some moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t really work on breaking up mascara and eyeliner, however Maybelline has a product in the same line that comes in a bottle. It is waterproof eye makeup remover. It is a gel and it works magnificently. I would recommend using these two products side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nightly routine now includes removing my eye makeup with the gel, my face makeup with one or two of these towlettes, then washing my face with gentle face soap, followed by a liberal amount of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> These makeup removing towelettes are awesome! They remove all my makeup and even some of my eye makeup, but for that I use the Maybelline Clean Express Eye Makeup Remover Waterproof. I have sensitive skin so these didn&#x27;t sting or burn or anything and they did not have any smell to me. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I thought hey let&#x27;s try something different and for that price u can&#x27;t go wrong but it didn&#x27;t take off half the makeup plus the smell of these towelettes had a nasty smell buy cheap get cheap stick with my ponds towelettes</li>

    <li> Love them. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> These are my favorite makeup wipes on the market at the moment (and believe, I&#x27;ve tried quite a number of wipes!). I discovered them while browsing for wipes that wouldn&#x27;t sting my eyes a couple of weeks ago and I love them. I was going to purchase them again a week ago but I noticed the selling jumped the price to $11 (a little too much for one pack) so I held out until I saw a drop in the price. Besides that, I do recommend these wipes to those who can&#x27;t stand stinging when removing their eye makeup.</li>
    <li> These are alright makeup remover wipes. The wipes themselves are kind of scratchy on my skin and the remover seems very drying and takes a while to get the makeup off. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase these ones again.</li>
    <li> I really like these towelettes. It completely removes my makeup quickly and easily and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn. It is an ample size to take care of your whole face as well as your eyes.</li>

    <li> Works great, but purchase with caution if you have extremely sensitive skin like I do.  I was able to use a few, but then started having a reaction and had to stop.</li>
    <li> Yes, this makeup remover cleans away my makeup BUT it absolutely smells HORRIBLE and as it says on the product, it doesn&#x27;t really clean off my mascara. I definetely recommend the Neutrogen makeup remover than this piece of crap.</li>

    <li> Absolutely love these wipes. I don&#x27;t write reviews often but found I was bound to after reading the few negative comments :)  To the people who said the wipes are dry, you guys just got a freak purchase. Every pkg I have ever purchased has been very moist. You could ring them out if you wanted too, just moist enough to not drip. Your pkg should feel heavy. Anyhow, try them again, they&#x27;re awesome!!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried them all, and these work great. Soft, nice fragrance, and even takes off waterproof make up as well. I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> Clears a full face of makeup in less then a minute (even waterproof mascara) and leaves face refreshed. Doesn&#x27;t leave face dry and tight like others I&#x27;ve used.
