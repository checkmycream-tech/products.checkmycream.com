<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these jars since I started making body butters. They seem to work great for a nice cheap basic jar. To start off with, go with these. I plan to order more in the future since the price is perfect!</li>
    <li> Containers are nice and clean. Count your batch when they arrive. Mine was short.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted for storing ceramic glaze in 4 oz. quantities.  The inner cap keeps things nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> The product was received as described and the shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> This jar is exactly as listed and was excellent for my purposes which was to split up a big batch of homemade body lotion.  The company (Levine) was also great and the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I needed. I just wish that I had ordered more!</li>
    <li> I make my own body scrub and I&#x27;ve looked all over for the perfect container so I can give them as gifts. These gems fit the bill to perfection. Just the right size, seal well so no worries of leaking, and easy to open. I will definitely purchase more for my salt scrub goodies.</li>
    <li> Love these jars for personal use!  I use glass jars for business &amp; these for home use.  It&#x27;s definitely a need for people with kids in the house or for those who are prone to dropping things!  They are very durable; I can attest to this, as my daughter has dropped them on numerous occasions.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed-good quality</li>
    <li> These are nice. I mix up that homemade lotion and these are perfect containers for it.</li>
    <li> Everything you would expect from a jar. I bought these to make some lotion and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!  Work great for EO creams and rubs.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Gave as gifts for sugar and salt scrubs.</li>
    <li> Each and everyone leaked. Never again.</li>
    <li> I love them, just what I&#x27;m looking for. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> these were perfect for Christmas gifts I made of homemade body butter, great price, great product and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> These jars are as expected. The lids fit well and are easy to get on and off. I used these to put my homemade body butter in and they have worked well for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> I am using these jars for my line of skin care products. They are the perfect size, and they are great quality. I will definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> Like other people warned, they do leak a little.</li>
    <li> I loved these jars! They withstood the heat of the body butters I make and the burn salve. They are nice and thick. I have just ordered more!</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I was needing.. great product fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using for home made body cream. They are perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick service, and just as described.  Would do service with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Jars nice size, just what I wanted. Only thing was I couldn&#x27;t open 4 jars , would suggest shipping without lids on.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for making gift bath salto or salt scrubs.  Small enough to keep use and keep in the shower.</li>
    <li> This jar is simple elegance at it&#x27;s best. I make my own line of skin care products and this allows my efforts to be displayed in a professional setting.</li>
    <li> Bought these jars to put my whipped shea butter in, just the right size, have given to friends and they love it, told them to save the jars if they want more.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my lotion making friend. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used these for homemade playdoh containers. They seem to seal well and are a great size!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  I needed small jars for homemade body butter variations.  The lids seal perfect, tight seal.  The glass ones were more expensive and I was afraid they would break.  Plus, I don&#x27;t plan on storing homemade body butter for any length of time that justifies using glass.  Plastic is fine for what I&#x27;m doing.  Great purchase.  They come in a sealed plastic bag, lids off.  I will probably clean each one out with alcohol before putting product in it, but they are fine the way they are.</li>
    <li> I should have purchased small, which I did, but I will keep these for larger quantities of salves.  All jar caps fit and mate well.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are perfect to hand samples in. They work great for my essential oil blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.H. Prichard, author of &amp;#34;A Walk in Darkness&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great jars, no complaints. Not thin, not thick, just right!</li>
    <li> They were exactly as expected when I ordered them.  Just the right size, easy to open and had an inner lid to place over the contents.</li>
    <li> Nice product, great quality. I&#x27;ve used it to store the homemade body butters I make to sell.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my purchase of plastic jars. The price was awesome, shipping was fast and packed safely. I make and sell my own natural hair products and the 12-4 oz. jars are perfect for my customers. I will be ordering form this seller again very soon and definitely recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> These are nice containers.  I bought the set for my homemade skin care items.  They look professional.  Good value!</li>
    <li> I have used these jars for my homemade rubbing lotion and they are the right size and work great. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are great for making natural shea butters. They&#x27;re a bit small, but very handy and a great product.</li>
    <li> Does not seal!  Bought to sell my homemade body scrub in, leaked like crazy, works for body butter but NOT anything liquid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these jars.  They&#x27;re the perfect size to put homemade lotions and scrubs in and are quite durable.</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking and feeling, thought that they would be the same quality as the 2 OZ plastic jars I purchased, but they were not.</li>
    <li> These work great for lotions and body butters that I make but also for storage of  small items that I dont want to spill out. They are fun to decorate too.</li>
    <li> I purchased these containers because I make and sell whipped shea butter and wanted something professional looking to present to my customers. The lids fit well, not problems closing or opening. The jars are leveled, not tilting when placed on a flat surface. I will probably purchase these again.</li>
    <li> The jars are perfect for projects such as homemade hand cream gifts.  I recommend this product and would  purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my essential oils, coconut butter and other recipes.  Perfect to add a tag with twne or ribbon with list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> Made our DIY body butter so much easier to put into containers</li>
    <li> Love the jars. Service was great!</li>
    <li> These jars were perfect for my whipped coffee butter!  I just like the look of domed lids, I wish they had the jars in a clear plastic.</li>
    <li> This are awesome for products that I make at home</li>
    <li> As expected . I&#x27;m a repeat happy customer.</li>
    <li> These jars work perfectly for my whipped body butter and salves. Great price and product!</li>
    <li> much small than 4 ounces. they quickly refunded us once we proved it. they are sturdy and nice looking.</li>
    <li> Nice for their purpose,  wish they were a little better quality.</li>
    <li> Ordered to make sugar scrub for Christmas gifts.  Was perfect in size with a secure lid.  Looked professional coming from a novice.</li>
    <li> These jars are smooth, hold well, and they are a decent price. The reason I took away a star is because the lids get loose easily and I have to keep tightening it.</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold guitar picks and put one in each instrument case. Now I don&#x27;t have to fish around to find picks buried in the plush linings.</li>
    <li> Good quality containers for self-made lotion etc. products.  Looks just like products I&#x27;ve bought in stores from cosmetic companies.  Would purchase these again!</li>
    <li> These are small plastic jars with nice fitting lids.  I bought them before and the quality is still good.  I use it for home made lotions and they seal well.  They are a good price, but ship from China.  I don&#x27;t usually like things shipped from China, but didn&#x27;t realize that before ordering.  They are a  small size and good for fitting in a purse or cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for my purpose</li>
    <li> Nice wide mouth opening for ease of scooping out substances with your hands. Shape easy and feels natural in your hands. Securely closes without leaks.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect size I was looking for! Use for holding my creations and giving them to friends as a gift. Highly recommended. Thank you ♥</li>
    <li> These containers only hold 2oz, not 4oz as advertised both on Amazon and on the packaging. Otherwise they are very nice containers.</li>
    <li> I needed a smaller container for home made night time facial moisterizer &amp; this was perfect; just the right size &amp; no leaks.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Jars good quality but lids not so good. They don&#x27;t all screw on right.</li>
    <li> Perfect size..Love them!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, and the package arrived in god condition.  I love the size and price, since I make my own products.  The biggest issues, and show stoppers are the lids do not fit properly.  Now, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with 12 leaky jars.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these jars to anyone.</li>
    <li> these are great little jars for incense. lids are tight and no leaking. i will order more of these when i need them</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I expected them to be. Perfect for what I planned to use them for.</li>
    <li> Cute, professional-looking and plastic (wary of shattered glass). Got these for my homemade moisturizer to give as gifts for Mother&#x27;s Day. They&#x27;re easy to open, get sealed tight, don&#x27;t crack when you drop them (whoops!) and keep the smell of whatever is IN the container...well, IN the container :)</li>
    <li> I make my own face and body cream and finding jars that were light for shipping was such a problem.  With these super light but sturdy jars problem solved.</li>
    <li> I love this jar, the size is perfect for creams and loations.  Great gift size.</li>
    <li> This is a good all purpose little jar.  The 4oz size works well for small containers of body butter or salve.  The lids fit well and its  easy to label each jar with the contents.  I have purchased this is in a larger size as well.  They are nothing fancy but very practical and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a good size and they came quickly. What I DON&#x27;T like is that they leak pretty easily. It&#x27;s quite annoying. These should come with liners, or liners should be suggested when buying it (I didn&#x27;t see anything suggested, but that may have changed). It works for storage, but if you have something that contains oil or that can melt, be prepared for them to leak everywhere. It&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
    <li> These jars would be great, except they do not seal completely, so they are not a good choice for paint, which is what I wanted to store in them.</li>
    <li> These jars were perfect for my homemade cream and the price was very reasonable.  I would purchase them again.  Thanks!  8-29-15 1 I tried to do a reorder for 12 more jars but Amazon won&#x27;t  let me order because they are now subject to Add-On. I don&#x27;t like being forced to purchase more items l don&#x27;t  want just to make a $25 quota to get my $10 product! I have changed my review to 3 because of this. Otherwise it would be 5.</li>
    <li> Great jar for homemade creams.  The lid has a great fit.  The product arrived on time, I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Hi it&#x27;s great but my labels don&#x27;t for would you have 6 ounces</li>
    <li> they arrived on time but the pastic lid didnt fit tightly and left a gap but nothing seems to be spilling out.</li>
    <li> Great but get&#x27;s dirty too quickly...</li>
    <li> Perfect size containers to store my personal mixture of shea butters and coconut oils.</li>
    <li> jars arrived on time. Packaging was accurate, all jars have lids but those were purchased separately.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for my homemade body butters and are perfect size for gifts. I will definitely order more when I run out!</li>
    <li> good quality. good seal</li>
    <li> These are a perfect size for my homemade lotions and potions. They were a great price and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I bought these jars for my home made salves and they are the perfect size. No leaks and the lids fit nice and tight. I love that they are not glass so if I do drop it doesn&#x27;t break. They are just the right size so that you can dip your fingers in and reach to the bottom with out any problems. Definitely would order again.</li>
    <li> I read all of the questions, answers and a lot of the comments and am pleased that I got exactly what was expected. Mine did not leak at all and I would most definelty purchase this product again. Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> The jars are very nice and the right size for making sugar scrub or other health potions.  Because they may be used around water or with wet hands, the rounded top is excellent for that purpose.  They&#x27;re easy to open and close.  They are what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my homemade hair pomade.  They are durable and the perfect size. I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and easy to open and close</li>
    <li> makes my project look professional</li>
    <li> Nice tight fitting screw lids and the plastic is a good grade.  I have been looking around and saw some nice containers at IKEA</li>
    <li> Just as described, just as I ordered.  A more convenient size.  I use this for homemade creams.  Jar is reusable.</li>
    <li> I had ordered these jars based on the photo, the product description and reviews on this site.  Unfortunately, after a month of ordering, the products finally arrived from China with every lid having decorative silver line on the rim, which did not work for my intended use.  I find out now that I am about to return them, that I need to ship them back to china, which apparently takes 25-30 days for return, at my own cost.  Not at all what I expect from convenient online shopping today, especially from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Half of them had the top piece of plastic shoved into the bottom of them</li>
    <li> I love these. I make my own body butters from organic oils and natural butters. I melt it and whip it and then package it in these jars. They give my homemade products a professional classy look and feel. Great buy.</li>
    <li> These jars are perfect for my whipped body butters. They look more professional than the ones I had. I will be ordering more. Hopefully you&#x27;ll have them in a 8oz as well.</li>
