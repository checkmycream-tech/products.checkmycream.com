      <li>Absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>A Great hat will order again</li>
      <li>Nice fabric, needs lint rolled but very nice quality!</li>
      <li>the hat is perfect except for the packaging makes it have creases which I&#x27;m sure will come out.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a friend and was worried that it&#x27;d be too over the top, but it was the perfect size!</li>
      <li>Took around 2 weeks to arrive, which was surprising.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Love this hat!</li>
      <li>I love the hat!</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>Love this hat!</li>
      <li>IT IS AMAZING AND VERY STYLISH.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that because the hat was not boxed and came in a flimsy package that the felt would be creased, but amazingly it was not.</li>
      <li>FOR THE PRICE IT IS AMAZING</li>
      <li>The hat itself does not sit as the one in the photo, no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to steam it.</li>
      <li>ANYWAYS I love my hat.</li>
      <li>Thank you and i am glad i ordered it from you &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>But I still love it.  </li>
      <li>I shopped for many hats like this online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this hat &amp; will wear it often.</li>
      <li>It can be dressed up or down and will hide my fair skin from the sun while looking stylish, so pleased!</li>
      <li>The original shape of the hat is intact.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the hat as it is cheaply made and most certainly advise that you do not buy from this seller.</li>
      <li>Great fit, not too floppy, not too firm.  </li>
      <li>Stays put pretty well!</li>
      <li>While it did take forever to receive, it was worth the wait for the price.</li>
      <li>It came in only a week when it was supposed to come in a month or more which</li>
      <li>I would buy this in multiple colors! :-)</li>
      <li>It looks exactly the way it does in the picture and wasn&#x27;t even flattened/creased when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as it appears in the pic.</li>
      <li>The hat has the potential to be cute but there are some real issues.</li>
      <li>had to round it out with some heat myself but other than that it was a fantastic buy!!!!</li>
      <li>Looks great on me wool gets too dusty though.</li>
      <li>I will admit, I was very hesitant to purchase a hat online, but the reviews helped me decide to go ahead and order it.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say, once I do that I won&#x27;t be taking the hat off in public thanks to hat hair.</li>
      <li>Made of felt it was banged up and can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
      <li>So there were no harsh creases or folds that would make this unattractive to wear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wide enough to make a cool, kind of witchy statement but not so much that you feel silly wearing it.</li>
      <li>the hat is a little small on my head, but for the price, the style is good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little loose fitting which I prefer</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say get this if it&#x27;s for a child, but don&#x27;t if you want it as an actual fashion piece for an adult.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the snug fit is much needed during the windy or cold weathers.</li>

<li> If you wear weaves you definitely don&#x27;t want this as it is too tight it will pull on your hair</li>
<li> Many with bad reviews.</li>
<li> Got here faster then expected.</li>

<li> It fits a little snug but I can still pull it down over my big head.</li>
<li> Crudely jammed in to a small box that arrived absolutely crushed.</li>
<li> The packaging is a joke as my hat was all bent because the padded envelope is half the size of the hat.</li>
<li> BUT THE HAT TOOK LITTLE EFFORT TO CORRECT.</li>
<li> Came in a little over a week.</li>
<li> Wish I could wear everyday!</li>
<li> Made of heavy felt, at least it steams well.</li>
<li> The hat is made with felt, and is almost impossible to reshape without going to a professional.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s hard to to get off</li>
<li> Sadly, this product was shipped poorly and was delivered in a format that ruined the hat.  </li>
<li> the ribbon fell off as soon as i got it :(</li>
<li> The onle reason I gave it four stars was because of the packaging &#x3D;(  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> THE SHIPPING METHOD WAS HORRIBLE</li>

    <li> the hat is a little small on my head, but for the price, the style is good.</li>
    <li> I love the hat! It can be dressed up or down and will hide my fair skin from the sun while looking stylish, so pleased!</li>
    <li> If you wear weaves you definitely don&#x27;t want this as it is too tight it will pull on your hair and you&#x27;ll look like a porcupine when you take the hat off once you are inside a building. HOWEVER, the snug fit is much needed during the windy or cold weathers. ANYWAYS I love my hat. Thank you and i am glad i ordered it from you &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The hat has the potential to be cute but there are some real issues. For example, in buying it does not say that it is coming from China and will take almost a month to receive. The packaging is a joke as my hat was all bent because the padded envelope is half the size of the hat. When I contacted the seller, they told me that it is just something that in international shipping and offered me $2. I filed a compliant with Amazon and received a refund. However, I don&#x27;t have what I wanted and it was time consuming. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the hat as it is cheaply made and most certainly advise that you do not buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> While it did take forever to receive, it was worth the wait for the price. It looks exactly as it appears in the pic. I was concerned that because the hat was not boxed and came in a flimsy package that the felt would be creased, but amazingly it was not. It fits a little snug but I can still pull it down over my big head. Let&#x27;s just say, once I do that I won&#x27;t be taking the hat off in public thanks to hat hair.</li>
    <li> This hat was not what it said it would be. Made of felt it was banged up and can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and was worried that it&#x27;d be too over the top, but it was the perfect size! It&#x27;s wide enough to make a cool, kind of witchy statement but not so much that you feel silly wearing it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this hat to anyone.  I was very disappointed with this product.  I had waited 3 weeks for the hat to arrived.  I needed it for a photo shoot.  It does not say that the dealer is Hong Kong when you look at the &amp;#34;About the company&amp;#34; section on Amazon.  Sadly, this product was shipped poorly and was delivered in a format that ruined the hat.  The item arrived in a bubble wrap envelope which destroyed the shape of the hat.  The hat is made with felt, and is almost impossible to reshape without going to a professional.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I was very hesitant to purchase a hat online, but the reviews helped me decide to go ahead and order it. I shopped for many hats like this online. Many with bad reviews. The hat arrived two weeks earlier than expected (from China) and it was only very slightly bent.. It arrived folded carefully and loosely packaged. So there were no harsh creases or folds that would make this unattractive to wear. The original shape of the hat is intact. Nothing that some steam treatment and laying flat can&#x27;t fix. Although it&#x27;s a floppy hat, the rim is adjustable. Stays put pretty well! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> the hat is perfect except for the packaging makes it have creases which I&#x27;m sure will come out. It came in only a week when it was supposed to come in a month or more which I&#x27;m very happy about, great buy!</li>
    <li> Love this hat! Got here faster then expected. Came in a bag and it didn&#x27;t damage my hat at all. It&#x27;s a little loose fitting which I prefer so it doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair. I would buy this in multiple colors! :-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Great quality! Glad I bought it! I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this hat &amp; will wear it often.</li>
    <li> The onle reason I gave it four stars was because of the packaging &#x3D;(  had to round it out with some heat myself but other than that it was a fantastic buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Looks great on me wool gets too dusty though. But I still love it.  Wish I could wear everyday! Tuh!</li>
    <li> It catches a lot of dust/lint  that&#x27;s hard to to get off</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. Brim is not as wide, or as &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34;. The photo use must be on a child size foam head. Made of heavy felt, at least it steams well.</li>
    <li> This hat is great! It looks exactly the way it does in the picture and wasn&#x27;t even flattened/creased when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend getting this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m livid about how it was packaged! Crudely jammed in to a small box that arrived absolutely crushed. The hat itself does not sit as the one in the photo, no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to steam it. Took around 2 weeks to arrive, which was surprising. Overall, I&#x27;d say get this if it&#x27;s for a child, but don&#x27;t if you want it as an actual fashion piece for an adult.</li>
    <li> THE SHIPPING METHOD WAS HORRIBLE BUT THE HAT TOOK LITTLE EFFORT TO CORRECT. IT IS AMAZING AND VERY STYLISH. I HAVE GOTTEN LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT! WOULD BUY AGAIN. FOR THE PRICE IT IS AMAZING</li>
    <li> A Great hat will order again</li>
    <li> the ribbon fell off as soon as i got it :(</li>
    <li> Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t fit my head. It&#x27;s an alright hat for the price. Packaged in a box and bag. Came in a little over a week.</li>
    <li> Love this hat! Great fit, not too floppy, not too firm.  Nice fabric, needs lint rolled but very nice quality!</li>
