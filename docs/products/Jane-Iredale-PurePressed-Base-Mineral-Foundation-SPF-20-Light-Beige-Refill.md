<li> One thing is that the color I normally choose for the over the counter brands did not match what I was given or told to use - so before I was actually not looking natural as I had the wrong color.</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and is much less messy than loose mineral makeup.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that the item was that large as I thought it was a refill for my small compact</li>
<li> This is definitely the least expensive place to purchase.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> I love all Jane Iredale products but when this foundation arrived it was too dark for my skin color so I sent it back over 2 weeks ago.  Haven&#x27;t heard anything from the seller as to whether or not they received it and there has been not credit to my account.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> A great way to save some money on a decent product. Came quickly and in perfect shape. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and acne. This product is the only thing I have found that works and does not rub off like Bare Minerals. I have tried many brands and custom blend makeup. Most plastic surgeons or high end spas carry this product. One thing is that the color I normally choose for the over the counter brands did not match what I was given or told to use - so before I was actually not looking natural as I had the wrong color. If you have problems with this makeup I would make sure you have the correct blend. I have been using this product for 5 years. I am so happy on Amazon finally.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and is much less messy than loose mineral makeup.</li>

    <li> Love this make up. I didnt think I would like a pressed powder but i was happily surprised great price and as always fast delivery from amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation. The coverage is so much better than bare minerals, and I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much.

    <li> Great product. Just don&#x27;t drop it like I did.</li>
    <li> The Best make-up powder compact!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder foundation.  It has wonderful coverage and is easy to use.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price.  Every time I buy it, I have a hard time spending so much.</li>

    <li> This mineral foundation is one of the best coverages for acne and other skin problems. It does not feel cakey and it lets your skin breathe. You will feel great wear this product.
