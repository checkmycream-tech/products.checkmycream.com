<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very happy with this product...Am a Philosophy woman anyway and like Purity but I prefer this one. Moisturizes and noticed the difference witnin a short time. Will not be without this from now on..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and like it a lot so far.  It is creamy and feels gentle on the skin but my skin glows after using this.  I use it with my clarisonic most of the time and then once a week have been using it as a mask.  I have been getting compliments on my glowing skin since switching to this cleanser.  I will be buying this product again, but in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this product.  Don&#x27;t like the consistency or smell.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say, but &amp;#34;Love It!&amp;#34; Feels good on my skin, and it does well when followed by the Miraculous Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I&#x27;ve gone 2 1/2 weeks so far, and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine, not sure any of my wrinkles have gone away yet!  Smooth and creamy and does&lt;br /&gt;not feel abrasive at all.</li>
    <li> This cleaner does exactly what the seller says! I will buy this product again! And again! My skin is so clear now and I feel it has a glow to it! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews before I bought this and was going to buy at Sephora but they have been out of stock.  The nice thing is I saved money buying it thru Amazon and it is working my face looks brighter, the spots got a tad brighter at first then they began to fade and are continuing to do so.  I would recommend this cleanser and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product, wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
    <li> This truly is a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34;!  It cleanses my face gently, getting off all my makeup, doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup and keeps my face smooth - will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliating with AHAs, and this product certainly delivers. I find it to be gentle enough for using every day or so. It gently removes dead skincells. It stings a little, but I don&#x27;t get any long-lasting redness on my face, and I have fairly sensitive skin. I also love using it as a mask for a bit extra exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling soft and supple, no dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I alternate this product with the daily cleanser, it helps with dry skin and gives you softer and more radiant skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m throwing away this cleanser after reading the label and find that is contains petroleum jelly (petrolatum) and a number of other undesirable ingredients. Another cheap trick from this company.</li>
    <li> I usually use Purity cleanser by Philosophy but thought I&#x27;d give this a try... what a waste.  Maybe it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t wear makeup, but it takes some vigorous scrubbing and plenty of toner afterwards to get your makeup off.  I&#x27;ll stick with Purity.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference in my skin. Have to still use my daily cleanser as this does not remove mascara.  Will stick with the daily philosphy cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! It has a bit of lactic acid in the ingredients &amp; that is a good thing to help slough off old dead skin, without over drying.</li>
    <li> I dont feel like this did anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> I have not used Philosophy products before trying this cleanser.  It is mild enough to use every day and leaves the skin  soft and dewey.</li>
    <li> Like every woman at one time or another I&#x27;ve struggled to find skin care products that work with my aging skin. This cleanser seems to do the job. Not too oily, not too dry. Who knows if I&#x27;ll still be using it in a year, but I hope so!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. Had used another cleanser for about 8 yrs but needed something more age appropriate - I asked at Ulta and this was recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser my skin is definatley&lt;br /&gt;Clearer and looks better.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product. My skin feels clean, envigorated and soft to touch.</li>
    <li> Gentle, yet effective exfoliation that will not dry out your skin due to harsh detergents. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been a philosophy woman (54 and in menopause) for about 3 years.  I use the Miracle Worker line at night.  I live in upstate NY and being that it is winter time, it has been extremely cold.  This is a wonderful cleanser.  It is not drying.  When it is used as a mask, my gosh, step back and look at your face.  You will pleasantly surprised!!  This is a must have purchase.</li>
    <li> I use the Philosophy regular skin cleaner in the PM for getting the makeup off, then the Lactic Cleanser in the AM after the scrub.  It leaves my skin totally smooth and toned.  I really love this product so far.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products (Purity Made Simple is my holy grail facewash), but this one was just, meh. It seemed to not remove any of my makeup, which is really disappointing. Not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> best facial cleaner I have used and it goes a long way-bottle lasts for months and I use once a day at least-cleans but does not strip feels great and can double as a facial mask</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I don&#x27;t see a huge difference between this and the regular Philosophy face cleanser I buy.  I thought it would be more exfoliating.  Still nice and gentle but I would try a different product for exfoliation</li>
    <li> I use this every night with my Philosophy Purity cleanser.  Love it!  I also apply with my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Really helps even out skin tone. I will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I can see any results as of yet but I love the warmth it generates when you apply it and the fact that you can use it as a mask as well.  You have to really rinse well as it leaves a creamy residue (probably a good thing) on your face.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Not removing my makup at all.  Have to do several steps to get clean.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product. I use it as a mask and as a cleanser. I couldn&#x27;t go without it, great buy.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten excellent results with products from Philosophy and this product meets the same standards.  I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this cleanser.  I have noticed that my skin does look clearer and my pores seemed smaller.  I thought that this was a good price for a good product and that it was definitely worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> I have been a true Philosophy Girl for over 12 years now &amp; up until recently I used Purity at night to remove makeup and Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash in the mornings. I picked up a sample of this at my local mall (I was very interested it was both a lactic acid cleanser &amp; a mask!) I gave it a try once &amp; I was sold! I have combination skin, oily on parts &amp; dry on others. This balanced my skin perfectly! I use it at night after removing my makeup with a little Purity or a facial cleansing wipe, leave it on for 5 minutes three times a week, the other days I just use with my Clarisonic &amp; rinse. My skin looks &amp; feels so soft and my pores haven&#x27;t been so small in ages. Sometimes I use it in the morning too depending on my skin&#x27;s needs. I highly recommend this cleanser, the entire Miracle Worker line is amazing, but this cleanser is definitely a true Miracle Worker!!!</li>
    <li> Within 30 days I saw a real difference in my skin, less wrinkles and soft to the touch. I use every morning in the shower with my Clarisonic and have been very impressed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it isn&#x27;t as harsh on my skin as other Lactic Acid cleansers.  I am using it daily and can visibly feel the difference in the texture of my skin.  I am not sure if it is helping to ease the lines around my eyes but I am going to believe that it is!  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
