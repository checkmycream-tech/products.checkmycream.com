<li> or maybe I just haven&#x27;t been using it for as long a period of time as necessary.  </li>
<li> I even used a cellulite dry brush and massager for one month, applying twice daily.  </li>
<li> did have an issue with the seal not completely on, but that may have happened during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using it to long</li>
<li> a long way.and I saw on Dr.OZ that you should use a cellulite cream that contains retinol and caffeine,so that&#x27;s what I look for in any cellulite product I buy.</li>
<li> plan to purchase a dry brush as recommended to use in conjunction with this</li>
<li> I see a difference in my skin starting to tone out my less dimples</li>
<li> I am very curious to see how things will look when the container is spent.</li>
<li> fl oz vs 4 fl oz from other brands</li>
<li> They checked their supply and other customers and said that there were no problems with their seal.</li>
<li> but I can already see a slight change on my thighs and arms where I have been applying it.</li>
<li> The cream is heat activated, it goes on slightly tacky and then you feel the heat (might be the caffeine?)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
<li> and I see less cellulite.</li>
<li> With Caffeine, 0.4 % Retinol &amp; L-Carnitine you get the TRIPLE GRAND SLAM against cellulite that visibly reduces the appearance of ugly lumpy, bumpy, dimply cellulite skin!</li>
<li> omg once I took the seal off the smell was not at all what I expected it smelled heavenly!!!</li>
<li> i have used this product for a few weeks now</li>
<li> After I apply the cream I can feel a slightly cooling effect on my skin, which makes me believe it works!</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not completely sure.</li>
<li> Definitely not happy that I spent the money.  </li>
<li> , at least I  did.</li>
<li> I have not using it very long, and I have a very bad case of cellulite</li>
<li> I felt sticky afterward, but it didn&#x27;t smell too bad.  </li>
<li> When I twisted off the cap, there was a hole punched in the security seal!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a wonderfully silky smooth lotion with the slight scent of pink grapefruit. I used it on all the target areas: abdomen, thighs, buttocks &amp; hips. With Caffeine, 0.4 % Retinol &amp; L-Carnitine you get the TRIPLE GRAND SLAM against cellulite that visibly reduces the appearance of ugly lumpy, bumpy, dimply cellulite skin! I would have to say it is definitely a salon quality product!</li>
    <li> The smell of the cream is a little overpowering when you first begin using the cream. It smells a lot like  caffeine, and I do not like coffee... However, once it is a part of your daily routine you will become accustom to it., at least I  did. Once you apply it, your skin is kinda sticky, so I use it before I go to bed. Another step I like to do before apply it is exfoliate my skin. After I apply the cream I can feel a slightly cooling effect on my skin, which makes me believe it works! I can see improvement my skin is definitely looks more firm!</li>
    <li> Love this cellulite cream.it leaves my skin so soft and smooth,and a little goes a long way.and I saw on Dr.OZ that you should use a cellulite cream that contains retinol and caffeine,so that&#x27;s what I look for in any cellulite product I buy.I will DEFINATELY recommend this product,and order it again ,</li>
    <li> I love that this product does not have an oily feeling to it and has a great smell. I haven&#x27;t been using it to long but I can already see a slight change on my thighs and arms where I have been applying it. I am excited to see what it looks like after a month of using it.</li>
    <li> I have only used a few times, but I am impressed. I am very curious to see how things will look when the container is spent.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and a lovely scent. Skin drinks it right in. Have been using it on the back of my thigh area....skin feels tighter.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and when it came it was sealed with plastic and I barcode that said new... When I twisted off the cap, there was a hole punched in the security seal!!! Don&#x27;t trust the product that it wasn&#x27;t replaced with who knows what!!!</li>
    <li> The lotion appears to tighten the skin, however, It appears that its only temporary. I must admit that I haven&#x27;t used it continuously so I&#x27;m not completely sure.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research after watching a Dr Oz episode on cellulite creams.&lt;br /&gt;Things I was looking for in a cream: Caffeine and Retinol and this cream fit my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I love about this cellulite cream product:&lt;br /&gt;1) My order came super fast&lt;br /&gt;2) It has a fresh citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;3) The cream is heat activated, it goes on slightly tacky and then you feel the heat (might be the caffeine?)&lt;br /&gt;4) The bottle is an easy pour style, I won&#x27;t contaminate the cream by dipping my fingers into bottle.&lt;br /&gt;5) You get more bang for your buck.  6 fl oz vs 4 fl oz from other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue with the seal not completely on, but that may have happened during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I asked the owner about it and they offered to replace the bottle if I was concerned. They checked their supply and other customers and said that there were no problems with their seal. I&#x27;m ok with it and think it should be fine.  I do appreciate that they care about their customers and personally responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this with the status of my cellulite issues.&lt;br /&gt;I do understand that this has to be used on a consistent basis to see results.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase a dry brush as recommended to use in conjunction with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling very optimistic and loving it so far!!</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my skin.  I have not using it very long, and I have a very bad case of cellulite, I do not expect a miracle to happen over night.  I know and I feel positive about this because its easier to keep up with the product when you like he products.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far!! I got it much faster than expected, omg once I took the seal off the smell was not at all what I expected it smelled heavenly!!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days so I&#x27;ll give a later review. So far so good!!!</li>
    <li> No change.  I even used a cellulite dry brush and massager for one month, applying twice daily.  I felt sticky afterward, but it didn&#x27;t smell too bad.  Definitely not happy that I spent the money.  I&#x27;m hoping they stick by their claim and refund my money.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for a few weeks now and i can see a difference. easy to use, no greasy or sticky residue, i use it on my stomach and i can see a smoother and firmer stomach.</li>

    <li> This is a good enough lotion, but I haven&#x27;t really seen a reduction in my cellulite.  Maybe I&#x27;m too old for it to be effective or maybe I just haven&#x27;t been using it for as long a period of time as necessary.  In any case, I don&#x27;t find it worth the exorbitant cost.</li>
