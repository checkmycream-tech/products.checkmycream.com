    <li> BEST hairspray because it does not leave my hair feeling sticky afterwards!</li>
    <li> Light weight but holds wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Don&#x27;t need much at all for it to hold tight.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray I have found which does not build up on your hair.  It holds it but is flexible at the same time.  Now everybody in my family is using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered SCRUPLES hairspray for a couple years now, when I received this I was surprised it actually looked like the picture because it&#x27;s not the graphics that have come on the product since I started using it. I thought this might be just an older picture and the item I received would look \\&quot;normal\\&quot; updated. Wrong. But, I did try it once to see if it was the correct product. My hair acted as if it didn&#x27;t have any hairspray in it after about an hour. That convinced me this must not be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;. I called AMAZON and was refunded for the purchase. I had already ordered, from AMAZON, it&#x27;s replacement; the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have used several of this spray and I like it because it does not make your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> No build up. Can&#x27;t find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> The only hairspray I will use...love it. It holds without being sticky or flaking. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite Hairspray</li>
    <li> Can would not spray. Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray! Just enough hold, not sticky, and minimal fragrance. Love Scruples!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in Va. Great hair spray.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray of all time.  Never sticky, yet holds my hair in place despite the wind, humidity, or dampness.  Smells nice, too, without causing me to choke or gag when I use it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; accurate product</li>
    <li> Like this product works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and find it to be the best hairspray on the market.  It&#x27;s firm but doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel and holds my style without looking like it&#x27;s been sprayed.  I have thick but fine hair so I need a firm hold. It has a light scent -not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my perfume.</li>
    <li> my hair stylist uses this on my hair so that is how i got to know about it. it holds style all day</li>
    <li> Like how  this works but the nozzle gets plugged up so you have to clean it out.</li>
    <li> My favorite spray! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down yet has fantastic hold.  My salon sells it for $19 I found it here for $12.  Same exact product.  What a great deal!</li>
    <li> Holds the style of my fine hair. No fragrance which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> If you want hold this is the hair spray for you</li>
    <li> This holds my very fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Fast Shipping Right to Your Door...Highly Recommend.</li>
