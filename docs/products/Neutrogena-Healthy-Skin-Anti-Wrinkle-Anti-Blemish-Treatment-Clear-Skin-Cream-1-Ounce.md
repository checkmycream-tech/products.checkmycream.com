      <li>I used this and at first i thought it was great than</li>
      <li>Most others cause me to break out.  </li>
      <li>if i have sunblock on my face,i let it sit a couple more seconds,until the foam seems to be drying..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Just glad i didn&#x27;t scar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would expect better from Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years every morning and night, and I love the results.</li>

      <li>THIS IS WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND COULD NOT FIND IT ANY MORE.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t understand why Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t sell this anymore...except maybe to make more money.</li>
      <li>I have so many people ask me what I use on my skin.</li>
      <li>Great product gives me great ski ,less shine coming through make up</li>
      <li>and my skin looks and feels healthy as well as fine lines have reduced.</li>
      <li>First it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I have combo skin and this keeps my skin form getting acne and also helps with fine lines,</li>
      <li>It does go quick and you have to use more to feel covered</li>
      <li>Most face creams clog my pores &amp;/or leave my skin super shiny</li>
      <li>When used regularly, it makes your skin look and feel great.</li>
      <li>I smear a light coat of it over my face and neck every morning after my shower, let it soak in for a minute or two, then do my makeup.</li>
      <li>once a week i would scrub my face with olay regenerist micro-dermabrasion,i do it,so my skin would peel a bit,and these creams would be absorbed better..</li>
      <li>i followed it with celeteque acne solution,oil control toner,or the neutrogena alcohol free toner..</li>
      <li>so i look for some products that would free me from zit,and would keep the wrinkles at bay..</li>
      <li>it feels great on skin and really helps with break outs agent seen much anti aging</li>
      <li>Turmeric Face Wash. So far so good.</li>
      <li>and I love how it just absorbs so fast and easily in my skin without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t used too long yet but highly recommend its light but still moisturizing perfect for me in summer</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a month,and the first couple of days wasnt convincing</li>
      <li>Do not use if pregnant.</li>
      <li>This has cleared up my skin tremendously.</li>
      <li>I wish I found this sooner and prevented many of my new acne scars.</li>
      <li>even my mom said that my skin was pretty &amp; asked what I have been using!</li>
      <li>since I have acne-prone/sensitive skin, but now in my mid-40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m now also facing sun damage in the form of crows feet and fine lines around my eyes, so after much research, I decided to give this product a go.  </li>
      <li>, I thought I could go without the acne treatment), and, while my skin felt great, I still had a blemish pop up a few days after switching.  </li>
      <li>After using this my face, it is totally clear and more looks radiant than ever.  </li>
      <li>Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I do notice my skin is more sensitive to the sun.  </li>
      <li>id linger for a couple of seconds for the product to be absorbed by my skin..</li>
      <li>For that reason alone, this product is worth using.</li>
      <li>But research led me to the conclusion that retinol can be useful in the treatment of acne.</li>
      <li>its not like i cant smile anymore</li>
      <li>Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it right away.</li>
      <li>,lets say if i use a l&#x27;oreal BB max as my sunblock,then id get zits right away,so i know that i should stop that now..</li>
      <li>I had very large pimples form from using it.  </li>
      <li>My husband has noticed a huge difference in my skin (more even and radiant, smaller pores and much</li>
      <li>Relatively speaking this is a good product in that you dont have to buy 2 seperate lotions, which will increase the amount you pay, and also you dont have to go through the hassel of putting 2 lotions on, which will save you time in early morning rush.</li>
      <li>i love it as if i just had a spanish peel!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this before and after workouts and it really has helped a ton!</li>
      <li>i love this for now.. will edit my review if there&#x27;s a different story..</li>
      <li>I now use Simple day cream and seem ok with it.</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to address the \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; claim.</li>
      <li>expect miracles of having a completely acne free face, but it does help diminish the length of time when I do get an unruly pimple.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apply only once to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bother your skin</li>
      <li>really!</li>
      <li>I had some mild hyperpigmentation on my neck and chin from prior acne, and this product significantly faded it.  </li>
      <li>Thus, I am back to old faithful and still loving it.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, especially with all the rave reviews.</li>
      <li>The minor irration began to lessen with the more I used it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Never apply to dry skin, wait until the months where your skin is the most moisturized.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;i do this many time a day,and it doesnt dry my skin</li>
      <li>I still have large pores on my nose and chin and of course breakouts</li>
      <li>It still has some peeling around my eyelids but has largely healed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After going off the pill I developed adult acne. This s*** works! I use it under my moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores or anything else. It&#x27;s wonderful. I will keep using this. Before I used a wash in the shower and I&#x27;ve used retinal before but it really irritates my skin if I use regularly. This is awesome. No irritation or drying.</li>
    <li> I used this and at first i thought it was great than 2 days later my skin was literally coming off, my face wouldnt stop peeling. I stopped using it right away.</li>
    <li> good things about this product.  Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head but I&#x27;m pretty sure I see a difference in my fine lines within a few days of using this product, doesn&#x27;t really help with pore size and even though I still get some breakouts not with the same amount of frequency and usually gone within a day or two.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use on a nightly basis and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I became frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find this product at the local pharmacy. I finally found a product that helps with both my acne and aging and I can&#x27;t get it anymore.  I am thrilled that Amazon carries the exact same product and will deliver it to me on a regular schedule without delivery fees.  Please don&#x27;t stop carrying this item like the local pharmacies have!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND COULD NOT FIND IT ANY MORE.  KNOCKS THAT GREASE OFF MY FACE, PAL!  NOW I&#x27;M GETTING ANXIOUS THAT IT WILL BE GONE FROM AMAZON.  I BOUGHT THREE SO THAT WILL GIVE ME TIME TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE IF IT JUST GOES AWAY COMPLETELY.</li>
    <li> i stop using Pro active,because its drying my face,and since im 38yrs old.. my skin starts to wrinkle.. and i hate it! absolutely hate wrinkles! but i wont get those botox thing! so i look for some products that would free me from zit,and would keep the wrinkles at bay..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i went back using obagi.. but it doesnt work like it used to do..and i stumble on these! the name just covers my needs! ahhh! i thought maybe this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a month,and the first couple of days wasnt convincing,i still get alot of acne,get frustrated of course.. but i have been experimenting on different products on my face and see how one contradicts with the other,lets say if i use a l&#x27;oreal BB max as my sunblock,then id get zits right away,so i know that i should stop that now.. then i use the neutrogena anti wrinkle spf15 as my moisturizer and sunblock instead,i would still get small zits,which could be gone the next day because id sleep with this anti blemish anti wrinkle cream overnight..so i guess ill just settle with that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s my routine,wash face with the neutrogena anti wrinkle,Anti-blemish cleanser,for 60 seconds.. id repeat it,if i have sunblock on my face,i let it sit a couple more seconds,until the foam seems to be drying.. then i rinse it off..pat dry..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then i followed it with celeteque acne solution,oil control toner,or the neutrogena alcohol free toner.. either one of them works well with me.. i have a sensitive skin btw..once it dries.. id linger for a couple of seconds for the product to be absorbed by my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then i follow it with this..neutrogena anti wrinkle,anti blemish treatment cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do this many time a day,and it doesnt dry my skin,i guess maybe because of the place where i live add to the moisture i get,its just so humid here in my country (PH) i recognize that by doing it every 8 hrs or less when im awake.. made the zit go away.. now my face is clearing up.. id get a zit still but it seems that the cream is  controlling it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ordered lots of these already,because like i say,im here in the PH.. we dont have these types of neutrogena products being sold here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have not had a chance to visit my dermatologist yet,for other treatments that i used to have for my face.. like the vit.A peel,or spanish peel,or a derma roller treatment..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but my face now looks great with these.. pores are smaller.. my face is tighter! really! its very tight.. well dont get me wrong about the tight thing.. its not like i cant smile anymore hahah! but its tight.. and my face is shinny tight! i love it as if i just had a spanish peel! without the red effect like you just had a little bit of tan of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh also.. once a week i would scrub my face with olay regenerist micro-dermabrasion,i do it,so my skin would peel a bit,and these creams would be absorbed better..once a week too id put Ole henriksen truth serum collagen booster.. its vit.c for the face.. and every 3 weeks,i would use the derma roller on my face,followed by any cream i use for the night..so this time it would be this neutrogena cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway! i love this for now.. will edit my review if there&#x27;s a different story.. but for now.. this product is just great!</li>
    <li> just received it a few days ago, and I can tell definitely how this is a very powerful cream, I use it as several on here recommended with the neutrogena facewash against acne .  today however approx. day 4 of usage, I noticed my skin feeling a bit dryer and itchy. So I will use the cream only every other day as recommended.   But your skin will feel very good and I believe this is THE creme to use if you have middle age./adult acne  like myself. Tried several other products  will update in a few weeks, but so far definitely will recommend  Update :  All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting, only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me, be careful how much you apply, and how often you apply it, otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.  So make sure to follow the directions, do only apply to the effected area, stay away from anywhere from the eye area, about 1 inch at least, and try it out first and use it every other day or so.  Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon. Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I can still find this product on Amazon because I have a harder and harder time finding it in the stores and it is the Best! I have combo skin and this keeps my skin form getting acne and also helps with fine lines, etc. ;)</li>
    <li> I am almost 33 year old.  My body and hormones seem to be confused between puberty and peri menopause.  This product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I used this for a while until I discovered unrefined coconut oil which I use now exclusively with AWESOME results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reluctant to try retinol-based products for sometime now since I have acne-prone/sensitive skin, but now in my mid-40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m now also facing sun damage in the form of crows feet and fine lines around my eyes, so after much research, I decided to give this product a go.  After almost a week now, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is remarkably clearer and the fine lines are also somewhat diminished.  I&#x27;m careful not to overapply and only use it at night so as not to dilute the effects w/other moisturizers or makeup.  I&#x27;ve read there is an adjustment period during which your skin needs to adapt called the \\&quot;retinoid effect\\&quot;, so I&#x27;m being careful not to overapply and doing my a.m. exfoliation routine on alternate days to the pm retinoid application so as not to cause any irritation until my skin gets used to it - that regimen seems to be working for my skin so far.</li>
    <li> So sorry this product has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This just plain works. I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I have found that does not increase my frequency of breakouts !  I have used it for about a decade.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;For months, I wished for a cream that could combat my acne AND have retinol (my skin has always responded well with it)&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this in store, I was ecstatic! I love retinol and when I saw it had salicylic acid too, I was very pleased. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me SO much less oily throughout the day (even less oily than when I use a primer), reduces the fine lines on my face dramatically, and I&#x27;ve also noticed less and smaller acne breakouts. My skin is just so much clearer and smoother and I love how it just absorbs so fast and easily in my skin without feeling greasy. Definitely my favorite face cream I&#x27;ve EVER used!</li>
    <li> This product seems to have reduced my mind acne, I did experience slight redness during the first two weeks of using this.  The minor irration began to lessen with the more I used it.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to address the \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; claim. BUNK! I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and my wrinkles are all still there front and center. I&#x27;m 38.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I actually got this product for it&#x27;s anti-blemish claim. It contains 2% salisylic acid and helps keep my stupid acne at bay. I work out routinely and get pretty bad acne on my cleavage and my upper back. I&#x27;ve been using this before and after workouts and it really has helped a ton! For that reason alone, this product is worth using. I can&#x27;t use it on my face every single day, though, because it does tend to dry out my face a bit too much. Usually every other day works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles of having a completely acne free face, but it does help diminish the length of time when I do get an unruly pimple.</li>
    <li> After using this cream I had rashes on areas which I applied the cream.  After doing research online, here are some guidelines if you do choose this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply only once to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bother your skin&lt;br /&gt;If you decided to use this product apply only a dab for the entire face&lt;br /&gt;Start off slowly, once every three days until you believe this product is safe for your skin&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this in conjunction with other anti-aging creams or other creams containing Retinol&lt;br /&gt;Apply at night&lt;br /&gt;Never apply to dry skin, wait until the months where your skin is the most moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;If you go out during the sun, use sunscreen.  Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has a pleasant smell &amp; does it what it claims! I was depressed over how my skin was looking &amp; with this &amp; the Neutrogena, Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish Cleanser, I noticed a noticable difference the next day even my mom said that my skin was pretty &amp; asked what I have been using! I have sensitive skin so I only use a pearl sized dab all over my face once every other day after cleansing with said cleanser. Most face creams clog my pores &amp;/or leave my skin super shiny but this doesn&#x27;t! Being on a fixed income, I needed an affordable beauty product that combats wrinkles AND blemishes all in one &amp; that does what it claims to do! THIS is that product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. They want you to buy two separate products. I&#x27;ve used this for years every morning and night, and I love the results. Can&#x27;t understand why Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t sell this anymore...except maybe to make more money. I had to buy elsewhere the last time I bought this because Amazon price was a lot higher than in past. :-(</li>
    <li> Had no moisturizing and was just not a good product.  It was really greasy and gross.  I used it twice and have kept it in the drawer ever since.  I would throw it away if it would not be wasteful.  Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne prone skin and I have tried multiple products and this is the first product that seems to solve my acne problem. In the past I have used BP and AHA, but they were too irritating. I believe the main issue that causes my acne is excess oil and a need for exfoliation. Although the retinol is no where near as potent as retin-a, after about 2 weeks I noticed a significant improvement to my acne and acne scars with very little irritation. I wish I found this sooner and prevented many of my new acne scars.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me. seemed like it might have even made me breakout a lil bit. dunno.</li>
    <li> Have had a noticeable change in fine lines and wrinkles, and less acne! Doesn&#x27;t sting and is not drying. Would recommend to others, great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Helps my acne. I do notice my skin is more sensitive to the sun.  Sunblock required to use with this product.</li>
    <li> First it smells amazing. Makes my skin so soft. I have not had any break outs or skin issues. Can use morning or night and has not dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> Great product gives me great ski ,less shine coming through make up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pushing 30 and still have breakouts on my forehead and hairline.  I finally had to ditch the ol&#x27; 10% Benzoyl Peroxide I&#x27;d been using since my teens.  During the first week of using this, my face broke out worse than usual, but by the end of the 2nd week, it started to clear.  As long as I use this treatment at least once a day, it&#x27;s keeping the whiteheads on my forehead at bay.  A little goes a long way, as well.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, that is dry/oily combination. I have trouble finding the right products for my skin. I really had high hopes for this. I need something to fight the little acne and pimples I do get, mostly my jaw line and chin and nose area; but this is not the product.  The first day I used it I broke out bad, and I am still recovering from it. I had very large pimples form from using it.  I now use Simple day cream and seem ok with it. But finding the right moisturizer is agonizing for my troubled skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for adult acne without much success! After using this my face, it is totally clear and more looks radiant than ever.  I have so many people ask me what I use on my skin. **Please do not stop making this...EVER!!**</li>
    <li> I really like this product as as it helps with pesky &amp;#34;in-your-30&#x27;s issues&amp;#34; such as breakouts and tiny wrinkles fighting to form patterns on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Only warning product can be slightly drying so every few nights I skip an application.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month. I see it improved my skin, but it irritates my eyes whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 months, once a day, in the morning after I wash my face. I have searched forever to find a product that clears up my pimples and blackheads. The product I was using stopped working because as you age your skin changes. (I&#x27;m 31) This product has reduced my pores and I have not had a break out in over a month. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for keeping my skin clear.  It helps to keep my skin from breaking out and yet keeps it moisturized.  I am still prone to getting slight breakouts, yes even at 46 years old, and of course it is about the time start thinking about the little wrinkles.  I never thought I would have to think about acne AND wrinkles at the same time, go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments on my skin, (which is nothing short of amazing since I had SEVERE acne until my late 20&#x27;s.)  When I use this product my skin has better clarity and smoother appearance.</li>
    <li> this is an anti wrinkle cream with retinol that is the only proven method of helping to prevent wrinkles... other claims are more of a miracle, but I do feel as though retinol did help when I first starting seeing these lines under my eyes I immediatly bought retinol and it def stopped it from increasing and seemed to repair it. salyic acid works with retinol, unlike benzoyle peroxide that destroys the effects of retinol, Im 27, might as well start early in wrinkle prevention then start too late and keep my youthful face for as long as possible. This is totally non-greasy and feels the most natural compared to other lotion I havee tried from oil-free olay, and aveeno oil-free lotion as well... this just seems to work with the PH of your skin, so if its even muggy and humnid you dont feel... weighted down by lotion. I can also say that this product without the blemish treatment/night time is what helped with that wrinkle, so that is why I bought this one, seeing as I also have acne. Relatively speaking this is a good product in that you dont have to buy 2 seperate lotions, which will increase the amount you pay, and also you dont have to go through the hassel of putting 2 lotions on, which will save you time in early morning rush. It does go quick and you have to use more to feel covered then the night lotion of the similar line, but Im so happy with it, Im not going to stop buying it.</li>
    <li> This cream is gentle enough to use twice a day and definitely helps to keep skin clear.  The tube is small (much smaller than the packaging) but lasts about six weeks.  Additional moisturizer can be used if needed.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for over twelve years and this is the first solution I have found which has worked and is long term as I get older!&lt;br /&gt;Wish you would bring it to australia so I don&#x27;t have to import it!</li>
    <li> This product combine salycylic acid with retinols, making it perfect for my skin.  I&#x27;m 50 years old, but still having problems with occasional breakouts.  Normal acne products are usually too harsh for my skin, making it look dry and rough.  This stuff does the trick; not easy to find in stores, either!</li>
    <li> SO FAR IT SEEMS TO BE  WORKING SO FAR BUT REALLY TOO EARLY IN USAGE TO KNOW FOR SURE JUST WHAT TO RATE - I HAVEN&#x27;T BROKEN OUT OF HAD ANY SIDE EFFECTS...</li>
    <li> Than I found it at Target or K-Mart (almost half the price in some cases).  I&#x27;ve heard that the version of this without the benzyl peroxide is just as good because the pH level in this isn&#x27;t ideal, but I can&#x27;t vouch for that.</li>
    <li> When used regularly, it makes your skin look and feel great. It&#x27;s my daily go to moisturizer.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakout from fragrance and a lot of ingredients found in wrinkle creams or skin care for mature skin. This is the ONLY product i have found that is moisturizing and yet prevents breakouts on my skin around the nose, chin, and forehead. Way to go Neutrogena - Please keep making this!!! I cannot do without it.</li>
    <li> Was never much a fan of Neutrogena in the past until I bought this. This has cleared up my skin tremendously. I love how it&#x27;s anti-wrinkle as well. I used this as my nightly routine and love it. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have long trusted Neutrogena products to react well with it.  When i began looking for an Anti-wrinkle treatment I started with Neutrogena first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit. I did very little research on the product before hand. I saw a brand name i trusted and just bought it. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 36hrs of the first application, my skin was completely inflamed. Puffy, Raw, and peeling.  It remained this way for about 5 days.  It still has some peeling around my eyelids but has largely healed. I&#x27;m Just glad i didn&#x27;t scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this product again. Not necessarily because it&#x27;s a bad product but it certainly didn&#x27;t work with my skin type.</li>
    <li> i have better luck with my acne on my chin using oil tree foot balm on my face.. :( i had high hopes for this given the reviews but i havent seen a lick of difference.. back to the drawing board..</li>
    <li> Even thought I am 30, I still break out occasionally so this lotion is great. Been using it for awhile, works really well for my skin.</li>
    <li> Will buy again it feels great on skin and really helps with break outs agent seen much anti aging but I haven&#x27;t used too long yet but highly recommend its light but still moisturizing perfect for me in summer</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to face lotion for three years now.  When I was 24, I was diagnosed with an endocrine disorder that caused me to develop mild to moderate acne (in my mid 20&#x27;s!), and it was pretty horrifying, considering I had never had problems with it before.  I also have patches of dry skin that can develop into eczema in the winter time if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  I found that heavier moisturizers such as Dove gave me acne, but using acne medication alone dried out my skin and caused more eczema.  Enter Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti Wrinkle Anti Blemish lotion.  I wash off my makeup and put on this lotion every night before bed, and my skin stays clear.  It&#x27;s never greasy, and as long as I use it every day, I rarely get a blemish.  Another thing it helps is to fade dark spots.  I had some mild hyperpigmentation on my neck and chin from prior acne, and this product significantly faded it.  I tried switching to the other Neutrogena lotions (considering I am now 27, I thought I could go without the acne treatment), and, while my skin felt great, I still had a blemish pop up a few days after switching.  Thus, I am back to old faithful and still loving it.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.  Neutrogena, I love your products!</li>
    <li> I consider myself a skin care expert due to the fact that I have literally TRIED IT ALL!  I have had problems with acne ever since I was in middle school and now I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and still having breakouts.  I have noticed that I tend to have hormonal breakouts which has made it hard to find products that work and prevent the breakout.  A couple of years ago, I decided to try retinol and started with a much pricier version in a white tube that cost  about $45 at Sephora.  Although it did make a big difference, it was hard spending so much especially since it didn&#x27;t 100% fix the problem.  Well, I am so HAPPY I TRIED THIS!  For a fraction of the cost, I have 99% control of my acne!  My husband has noticed a huge difference in my skin (more even and radiant, smaller pores and much smoother)and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  My routine includes washing and exfoliating my face twice a day, I use this as a moisturizer during the day and at night I apply this and thin a layer of benzoyl peroxide 10% cream (such as clearacil or the neutrogena brand).  This has changed my life and I strongly suggest giving it a try! By the way, I just bought my third tube of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was nervous ordering this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I apply it before I go to sleep each night and I wake up with great skin.  It makes my skin plump and soft.  Also my pores are smaller and I don&#x27;t have breakouts plus wrinkles are less noticeable.  You can see the results in the first few days.  It&#x27;s great !!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, especially with all the rave reviews. I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s, so no wrinkles yet. But research led me to the conclusion that retinol can be useful in the treatment of acne. Unfortunately this cream gave me at least one new pimple every time I used it. My face cleared up almost immediately after I stopped using this. Also, the retinol % is not listed anywhere on the product so it is really likely that there is next to none in this cream. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this cream, but now I have to find someone to give it to as I hate to just throw products away. I&#x27;ll stick to my Yes To products instead!</li>
    <li> This product made my eyes swell up. I am not sure if I am allergic to retinol, but I looked like i got punched in the face when I woke up the next morning. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product until I actually read all of the ingredient list and found that it contains parabens. I would expect better from Neutrogena. I will no longer be using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin moisturizer with wrinkle reducer.  Most others cause me to break out.  At 60+ they&#x27;re called &amp;#34;stress blemishes&amp;#34;. Whatever they&#x27;re called it&#x27;s a downer for skin maintenance. Apparently, Neutrogena is no longer making it, so it is hard find. Once the sources have dried up I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life.  I have tried everything to get rid of it over the decades.  This works, it just plain works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unfortunate enough to be getting some wrinkles (faint ones) while I&#x27;m still having occasional breakouts, so it was hard to find something that would work for both issues, but this is it! It&#x27;s very lightweight, not greasy at all, and no strong smell. I smear a light coat of it over my face and neck every morning after my shower, let it soak in for a minute or two, then do my makeup. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product but the results are not showing. My skin is still the same with no difference.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll go to a spa and see what they have to offer. The over the counter stuff is not working out too well. But people have different reactions to products they use.</li>
    <li> For a women in her late 50&#x27;s I still have large pores on my nose and chin and of course breakouts so I need a combination cream and acne treatment.  I have tried alot of products through the years and this product works the best.  I was unable to buy it in the local drugstores.</li>
    <li> OHHHH so happy about this purchase!  Hard to find!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent future breakouts as said on the package (though it&#x27;s probably due to my stressful lifestyle and genetics overriding the product&#x27;s ability to suppress acne). However, since after 3 months of using this creme, the blemishes and dark spots on my temples and cheeks were noticeably reduced and lightened. There are fewer blackheads on my nose too, although I wish they would all disappear. In addition, I also use the Biore Acne Clearing Scrub and Clarisonic Brush. A few breakouts occur every now and then, but now I can just apply foundation to the few acne scars instead of nearly my entire face.</li>
    <li> everything came as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting old, and still have issues with break outs. Solves two problems in one tube! Price is ok considering retinol products are usually a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I have fairly bad break outs around the same time as my period, and this product has made a big difference in just a month. I did not notice the breakouts almost at all.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes.  The product feels quite nice on but did not deliver on either the anti-wrinkle or the anti blemish.</li>
    <li> It cleans well. Didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in lines. Kept my oily skin under control but didn&#x27;t really stop the zits.</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks you can start to see a difference with your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my skin looks and feels healthy as well as fine lines have reduced.</li>
    <li> Really good moisturizer.  Just a little bit of Retinol in it.  Doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.  Makes skin softer, clearer.  Do not use if pregnant.</li>
    <li> I use this together with HImalaya Herbal Neem supplement and Himalaya Neem &amp; Turmeric Face Wash. So far so good. Complexion is clear.  I still get the occasional pimple but it&#x27;s not as bad as before. I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s a bummer that this has fragrance in it but like I said, it works for me!</li>
