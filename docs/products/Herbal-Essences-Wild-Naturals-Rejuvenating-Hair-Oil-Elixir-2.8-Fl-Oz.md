      <li>What was awesome is that I got them completely free and found a product that I love!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s nice and light, and doesn&#x27;t look greasy on my blond hair, just gets rid of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; look.  </li>

      <li>and I really love the scent!</li>
      <li>The moment the fragrance hit my nose, I was in LOVE!</li>

      <li>did not have the corresponding shampoo and conditioner, but I can&#x27;t see it making it any better!  </li>
      <li>so I was also pleased by that!</li>
      <li>First off, the smell is great!</li>
      <li>I love the scent!</li>
      <li>A perfect daily gloss serum, leaves my hair shiny, silky, and smelling beautiful.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have gotten any luckier because this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I received a sample from Influenster to test, and I have to say this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>My hair always looks silky and smooth after this and smells great.</li>
      <li>the smell of the product is so amazing just as the rest of the line.</li>
      <li>I also found the light scent to be a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Pert is a women&#x27;s herbal-scented shampoo with conditioner, but given the scanty amount of choices men had for their own shampoos, it made sense to me.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this product was not meant to be used on my kind of hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The oil elixir smells really good, but it didn’t really act as brilliantly as it promises.</li>
      <li>Nice shine, too.</li>
      <li>I used this product along with its shampoo and conditioner which were nice</li>
      <li>I was sent this product for my honest review by Influenster.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten many compliments on how good my hair smells after using this.</li>
      <li>&amp; I really liked the shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I must say I really liked it.</li>
      <li>The rest of the hair didn&#x27;t seem too keen to play nice with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have oily hair you wont want this, otherwise this is a nice</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like putting a lot of chemicals on me, so that is one reason I won&#x27;t give 5 stars, but otherwise it seems like a nice oil to use, and the smell is heavenly.</li>
      <li>The scent smells really nice.</li>
      <li>I received this Oil Elixir for a free trial and I&#x27;m in love with the way it makes my hair feel and smell!!</li>

      <li>It worked really nice with my hair type and left it shiny and smelling delicious.</li>
      <li>Its smells great at first in the bottle.</li>
      <li>It is very light but still moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think it smells nice and the oil washes off my hands easily.  </li>
      <li>I receieved this in a kit from influenster to try for free and I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, make your hair strong and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It works best with the same shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>The aroma is OK, not something I would rave about and is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>just the smell was appealing to me.</li>
      <li>Pairing with the shampoo and conditioner my hair is shiney and looks healthy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This oil works every bit as well as the Moroccan oil I had been using.  The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s nice and light, and doesn&#x27;t look greasy on my blond hair, just gets rid of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; look.  Nice shine, too.</li>
    <li> I have super thick, super wavy, frizzy hair. I use a whole lot of oil type products on my very long hair from $4.00 to $29.00 and everything in between. Some leave my hair feeling as if I have done nothing, some make my hair look and feel a little oily. The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir made my hair smell amazing and feel very soft at the ends which is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $6.00 the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir goes a long way with just a little as most of these type products work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work a drop of the oil elixir into your hands by rubbing together into your palms. Take your hands and work them through the hair you want to get the most moisture onto. Usually the ends as that is usually where you need it but depending on your hair it won&#x27;t hurt to use throughout the hair. I concentrate on my ends and then with whatever is left give my hair a once over to catch any flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is Turkish Fig and very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;The oil does make your hair soft&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;NONE</li>
    <li> The instructions for this product say to just put a few drops in your hand and rub through your hair, concentrating on the ends. I did that, and then rubbed my hands through the rest of my hair. I tried this both dry and wet, and the dry method had a more remarkable effect. My split ends were no longer noticeable and my hair had a better sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant fresh scent which quickly dissipated. When I first put it in my hands, it seemed overly oily, but it all absorbed nicely when I rubbed it into my hair, so it didn&#x27;t leave my hands oily and it certainly didn&#x27;t have that effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ingredients are concerned, although it has some natural ingredients, this is definitely not a natural product. Some of the ingredients are things that I don&#x27;t recognize, fragrance, and dyes which I don&#x27;t think are entirely necessary. Even so, since you use such a small amount at a time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem to have non-natural ingredients, and I love what it&#x27;s doing to my hair, so I will definitely continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had natural ingredients and an essential oil scent rather than a fragrance, I would give it five stars. As far as its effectiveness, if you use it dry, you will notice the best effect. I really like the gentle shine it gives my hair without any appearance of oiliness.</li>
    <li> I received this product free in the mail to test, and I must say I am one to stick to my hair care product brand. I don&#x27;t easily change things up.  It did take me a few days to finally give it a try. Now that I have tried it I might never go back to my old brand, I love it! Along with this free sample to try I also received the shampoo and conditioner free to test. So I wash and conditioned and towel dried my hair, the bottle says use 2 pumps and focus on the ends. The moment the fragrance hit my nose, I was in LOVE! It is so lightweight not greasy at all, and my hair still smells great the next day!</li>
    <li> Great product ! A little goes along way ! I put a few drops on my ends and thru out my hair , smells great ! My hair is very soft and lots of volume! Thanks to Influenster  I was able to try it for free !</li>
    <li> I got this item free to review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a typical hair oil. It&#x27;s definitely not natural.&lt;br /&gt;I think if they would have gotten rid of the junk and just kept the natural oils, it would be a great all natural product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I received it for free from influenster to review. I did not think I would love this brand again, but I do! This oil has left my hair feeling so soft, smooth, and shiny, as well as frizz free. It is one of the best drugstore oils I have used.</li>
    <li> I love using dry oils for my hair because they don&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but this was the best one that I&#x27;ve ever used because it made my hair so much more shiny and it has a great scent! I was getting compliments all day. My hair is thick and curly and usually very dull with no shine. This dry oil really gave my hair life and I absolutely recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received complimentary samples of this product to review which is great because I don’t typically mix up my hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reference about me, I use Salon hair products (shampoo, conditioner, hydrating oil, and smoothing serum as needed), and I have a lot of hair making it look really thick, plus it is long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the elixir (2-3 pumps) and spread it evenly from root to tip in my hair while damp (after using the matching shampoo and conditioner). It isn’t too thick or heavy and smoothed in nicely. I was very surprised when I dried my hair because it seemed so smooth! Normally I have to dry it, then go back with a round brush and straighten it/smooth it with the dryer again to make it smooth. I did not have to do that with these products which saved me at least 5 minutes! My hair is so soft and shiny. I’ve tried this product for two weeks with the same results each time. I’m surprised that it makes my hair look better than my Aveda products, but it does! I’m sold on these products at a fraction of what I currently spend!</li>
    <li> This product, like all other Herbal Essences&#x27; products, smells amazing!  Post-blow dry my hair felt soft and looked great. I used the product twice - once while my hair was damp and then again after the blow dry.  The product helped tame flyaways and made my hair smooth.  A small amount goes a very long way.  Use too much and your hair will become oily - especially on the roots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone with healthy or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I received this product complimentary to test and review.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair, nearly down to my waist, and of course the ends are wont to get frizzy and dried out and need trimming, and in winter months, static can be an issue. This product seems to be very effective at making my hair look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to apply and surprisingly not gunky or greasy in the least.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easily dispenses a drop at a time. (With the long hair, I use about six drops, not the two suggested. I apply it only to &amp;#34;the ends&amp;#34;, by which I mean, from the neck down.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Seems to work well applied to either wet or dry hair. I&#x27;ve been applying it with my hands and then brushing my hair a bit to maybe distribute it better. (Yeah, a brush even with the wet hair; I just try to be careful there.) So this will also get a bit to the &amp;#34;non ends&amp;#34; of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Turns out to be really economical, since you&#x27;re using so little each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. OMG, I hate the smell. To me, it&#x27;s that fake coconut smell like some suntan lotions have. I really, really hate that smell. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this is like tasting quinine, which some people have extra taste buds for and thus can&#x27;t tolerate, since I don&#x27;t see anyone else complaining. (And how can it be called &amp;#34;fig&amp;#34;?) The only good side here is that it dissipates before too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does actually contain a number of real oils: grape seed, olive, safflower, peppermint, and mentha arvensis (wild mint) leaf oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take longer term use of this before I can comment on whether this is helping to make my hair stronger or whether its usefulness is just for the day I apply it. I will try to keep using it every day for a month and report back later.</li>
    <li> First let me say-this smells divine!  Yes, I said divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have the corresponding shampoo and conditioner, but I can&#x27;t see it making it any better!  I dry my hair three or four times a week for work, and I used this in conjunction with some Herbal Essences mousse.  When my hair was almost completely dry I put a bit of this in my hands, ran it through my hair, and got a lovely shiny gloss!  It also did a wonderful job of keeping my static frizz in check-and here in Virginia it&#x27;s cold and dry so you know it&#x27;s bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  And did I mention it smells divine?</li>
    <li> I love how wonderful this makes my hair feel. It smells heavenly. It is light and moisturizes your hair instead of leaving it dry and brittle. It does not weigh it down at all.&lt;br /&gt; This is a lot better than those expensive brands on the market and it will take care of any fly away hair. it&#x27;s perfect for staticy hair types as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure whether this product is intended for natural hair only. My hair is chemically relaxed, but I still use oil based products to keep it moisturized. This Herbal Essences product has a pleasant, flowery fragrance (but it borders on being overpowering). It adds a light amount of moisture to hair if used as recommended. I add small amount to hair several times a week before wrapping my hair before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only rated this product 3 stars, because I have not noted any special advantage to using this. There has been no decrease in shedding and my hair does not look any different.</li>
    <li> I got this oil as a part of the trio of samples from Influenster. What was awesome is that I got them completely free and found a product that I love!&lt;br /&gt; I have very curly, thick hair that can be very unruly especially in the dry winter months. I used this about two times right after getting out of the shower and that is all it took for my hair to start being tamed by this. It has decreased my frizz and smells great while doing it!</li>
    <li> For the price, this oil elixir has one silicon ingredient and the rest is a combination of very fruit oils:  grape seed, olive, saffllower and peppermint.  Smells like freesia but not overwhelmingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blowing and a little flat ironing, my bleached and very dry hair looked smooth and shiny and not weighed down at all.  For the price, this hair oil is a sweet deal.</li>
    <li> I love this hair serum it&#x27;s light weight and it doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down. The scent smells really nice. A little goes a long way.  It worked well when I straightened my hair it made it really soft. I just wish it had all natural products in it but I still love it. I got the product free to test and review from influenster.</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous hair oils over the past few years.  Primarily for my daughters who are mixed and have curlier, drier hair.  Needless to say I haven&#x27;t found anything that has been magical.  This herbal essence oil has a wonderful smell to it, I think that is my favorite part about it.  As for the oil part of it, it seems to spread well and give the hair a little sheen.  It says to smooth a drop or two on damp or try hair, focusing on the ends.  I find it difficult to make one drop spread evenly throughout my hair, so I usually end up using 2 or 3 drops.  Reading the ingredient label, the first 3 ingredients are fancy chemical names, then a variety of 5 different oils and then the perfume followed by 3 different colors (yellow 11, red 17, green 6).  I compared the label to an Organix keratin oil I had and that one also had the first  5 ingredients as chemicals, then oils, then perfume...but at least no fake color stuff in it.  Lastly I have a bottle  of pure Argan Oil which can be used on skin and hair, and it contains 99.5% argan oil, so that one is clearly the purest.  It is also the most expensive.  This bottle of Herbal Essence has a nice pump to it, so you do get out a drop at a time, no overspilling or mist spraying like other types.  It seems like it will last a long time, and for the price, it is quite reasonable.  I don&#x27;t like putting a lot of chemicals on me, so that is one reason I won&#x27;t give 5 stars, but otherwise it seems like a nice oil to use, and the smell is heavenly.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing!!!! I love the way it made my hair feel so soft</li>
    <li> Its smells great at first in the bottle. smells more chemically in the hand and broke out my back</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to try out this hair oil for free and it&#x27;s great! It smells so good and feels amazing on the hair. I either put it on before I wash my hair, to protect the ends, or apply it to the ends of my hair after washing. Also works well after hair is dried! Just don&#x27;t put too much and stick to the lower half of your hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I received a sample complimentary from Influenster and it has exceeded my expectations. A perfect daily gloss serum, leaves my hair shiny, silky, and smelling beautiful. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for my honest review by Influenster.  This oil did give my hair a little bit of moisture, but I could barely feel a difference in my hair whether I used it or not.  I have a lot of long, thick curly hair so I had to use much more than the drop or two that is recommended.  I felt that when I forgot this step my hair would still feel exactly the same as it did having used it.  Maybe this product was not meant to be used on my kind of hair.  It was not my favorite from the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection.</li>
    <li> I have not tried it and I don&#x27;t like oily stuff</li>
    <li> I have been using this product  for about a month now and absolutely love it and have seen a huge difference in my hair. I used this product along with its shampoo and conditioner which were nice but i wasnt in love with- this oil made all the difference. My hair is smooth, shiny, moisturized, and easy to style- i have also seen a huge difference in the amount of split ends I have. Both my mom and my BF commented on how great my hair looks after using this product. My mom said my hair looks so much healthier! I am really not one to fall in love with hair products but i will def continue to use this one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other hair oils before but tend not to stick with them because they make my hair look and feel greasy. This product did not weight down my hair and did not make my hair look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added this product to my normal hair routine and would rub on my ends and along the top of my scalp while my hair was out of the shower- i would then blow dry. My hair always looks silky and smooth after this and smells great. I would also run dime size amounts to my dry ends after the gym or in the morning to add moisture. It is very light but still moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe my hair as long and normal to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would def recommend this product to anyone especially considering the price compared to other products- also the smell is great and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product free to test from influenster</li>
    <li> I received the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir for free in my Influenster Vox Box to test and review. I used the product along with the Wild Naturals shampoo and conditioner. I feel like the oil elixir intensely conditions the ends of my hair without making them greasy. I concentrated the use of the product on the ends of hair to moisturize any split ends or brittle hairs. I let my hair dry naturally overnight and the next day the ends of my hair were very silky and there were no brittle pieces! I enjoyed the product and feel like when concentrated at the ends of one&#x27;s hair even someone with oily hair can enjoy the product! I plan to continue to use the elixir and recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This oil elixir surprised me. I use oils on my hair on a regular basis. Natural oils like grape seed, sweet almond, castor, coconut, and olive oil. So I will admit to being highly skeptical that this product would do anything for my hair. With that being said I am highly impressed with this oil. I use it to do a wash-and-go on my type 4 natural hair. My hair feels so soft and is honestly help with manageability as well. I do use more that recommended. I use like 10 pumps but I have a full head of thick hair so it takes more product to completely cover. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and I&#x27;m happy that I was able to receive this product for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  It makes hair silky soft without becoming greasy or stringy.  It smells wonderful without being overpowering.  We use this on healthy and dry hair with fabulous results.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a little while and my hair has never felt better. So hydrated and renewed. And the smell is killer. Love this stuff and will definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> I received my Influenster box today and decided to go right for it. One of the biggest things I&#x27;ve noticed is the smell. It has a lingering smell that I love! It&#x27;s not to oily and didn&#x27;t have my hair feeling limp and heavy. I went outside to try it against the weather and my hair still had body so I was also pleased by that! Will continue to use and hope it becomes a permanent product in my home.</li>
    <li> I recieved this from influenster to test and review. I love hair oil products because i have very dry hair. I have tried the shampoo and conditioner but wasnt a fan of the shampoo and the conditioner was ok but this oil really surprised me. I was thinking I wouldnt like it either after how i felt when i used the shampoo and conditioner, but this product shocked me. The shampoo had dried out my hair and made it feel coarse so i really needed this oil to bring back the softness to my hair, which it did. The shampoo and conditioner stink, but this oil smells really good. Ill probably go out and buy this oil after my free sample runs out. I applied this to my hair when it was wet and when my hair dried it didnt look oil or feel oily, but made my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this oil and how shiney it made my hair but it didn&#x27;t really tame any frizz or keep it soft it made it a little oily I put it on my damp hair before blow drying im not sure I would buy this item again I received it free in a vox box I received from influenster where you give your opinion on products such as beauty and health and much more !</li>
    <li> I received a free product sample from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir for 4 days, I can say that I really like it.  I will admit that I was not impressed at first.  I have curly/wavy hair and am in desperate need of a trim for the split ends.  Day 1 I washed and conditioned and used the Oil Elixir while my hair was still wet and let it air dry.  I really could not tell any difference in my hair at all.  Day 2 was more of the same.  I decided I needed more time before I wrote a scathing review.  So on Day 3 I used it again and since I had to go out I dried and straightened my hair.  When I looked in the mirror afterward, I said &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;  I finally saw a HUGE difference.  Normally after drying/straightening my hair it is straw like and brittle feeling, but with using the Oil Elixir before hand my hair was soft, manageable and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have straight hair OR curly/wavy hair and dry/straighten your hair frequently, I would totally recommend this product.  It has made a huge difference in my hair texture in just a few days.  One the days I don&#x27;t dry/straighten my hair I may or may not use it, as I can&#x27;t tell much difference, but it will definitely be part of my routine on days I do dry straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary gift. At first, I was pretty skeptical about this product. &amp;#34;You mean I&#x27;m supposed to PUT oil into my hair??? Doesn&#x27;t that kind of defeat the purpose of washing your hair??&amp;#34; Purely for the sake of having my hair smell as though it had been kissed by the goddess of nature, I broke down. After I washed my hair with the rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner, I worked  it into my ends and blow dried it. Right then and there, the heavens parted as a cherub descended and handed me a bouquet of flowers and the secret to eternal life. My hair is so soft, a mom tried to swaddle her newborn baby in it. Someone stopped me on the street and asked if I had recently returned from a trip to Tahiti. After using this elixir, I swear that my hair has never been softer and the sky has never looked so blue. Everything is in harmony and having dozens of men enchanted by my hair is a luxury that gives me a great sense of power and control. Great product, Herbal Essences. 4 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I received this Oil Elixir for a free trial and I&#x27;m in love with the way it makes my hair feel and smell!! I have wavy/frizzy hair and this oil has drastically helped to tame my frizz to show off my waves better. I&#x27;m able to comb it through my damp hair after a shower and leave my hair down without any other products added! I can never do that!! Plus it gives my hair the perfect smoothness and shine while adding an amazing scent! Did I mention it doubles as a good detangler for my knots?! I am sold on this elixir.</li>
    <li> This really moisturizes my ends and makes them look and feel so much better!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks now, and I am really impressed! First off, the smell is great! I have gotten many compliments on how good my hair smells after using this. Secondly, the product itself works great! As long as you use a small amount, it will not make your hair greasy looking. My hair was instantly smooth and shiny after the very first use! Would buy again and recommend! Was lucky to receive this as a free trial from Influenster!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and curly. I recently received a sample package of this from influenster to try and review.  This product left my hair feeling stronger and without the frizz! My favorite was the elixir.  It was easy to use right before walking out the door and lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner were alright but not top of the line but hey for the price I give it a 4 star.  My hair felt clean after using the shampoo and I would think that the conditioner would be great for normal hair.  Unfortunately for me I&#x27;ve been blessed with fine, thin hair which tends to be frizzy.</li>
    <li> First, the smell. I like it. Fragrance likes and dislikes are a very personal thing, and normally I&#x27;m not wild about a lot of fragrance. This is a sweet-smelling floral-like one, and it&#x27;s not overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;chemical.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine curly hair, but it&#x27;s now salt-and-pepper gray and has been tending toward dry and unruly.  Normally I cannot put anything on it without weighing it down, but I find that if I put ONE drop of this in my palm, rub my hands together, and then run them through my hair lightly a few times, my little flyaway pieces settle down and my hair looks nicer. After a few hours, the fragrance is still just slightly there, which is kind of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Pump a few drops of this into your hand, then spread it through your hair. Unlike some other oil-type hair products, this does not leave my hair feeling greasy, nor does it look like I&#x27;ve used any hair product other than shampoo/conditioner. I&#x27;ve got gray hair mixed in with some residual black hair. The white hairs are often more difficult to control, but with this oil elixir, they soften and sit nicely with the black. I used this along with the same brand shampoo and conditioner, adding it in while my hair was still damp. The result is soft and natural feeling hair.</li>
    <li> For the current $6 price point, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this hair oil. The worst part about it is the smell - I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what the problem is with it, but I don&#x27;t like it, and it seems that other reviewers feel the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it felt a bit thick and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would actually work, but after application it made my hair soft, tamed my flyaways a bit, and didn&#x27;t make my hair overly greasy, which was another pleasant surprise. Quite some time ago I received a bottle of Clear brand scalp and hair therapy oil and this Herbal Essences oil, while no Moroccan oil, is far superior.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and my experience with this oil elixir has been mixed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, it does nourish and softens my dry hair ends and makes my hair less staticy overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the other, even though I only apply a tiny drop, once I brush my hair, the elixir gets spread all over my hair and makes it look much flatter and a tad oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet decided if I should pick healthier looking ends over a bit sleeker and oily-looking roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decisions, decisions...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this product. It effectively produces a lot of shine in my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. A little goes a long way, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice boost. I also really like the scent. I&#x27;ve only used it on dry hair so far, but I believe that is where I can see the most benefits, especially with my hair type.</li>
    <li> I love that this oil does wonders. .I received this as a sample from influenster, and I must say it does exactly what they describe it to do.I have my natural hair, always hard for me to comb through, but I applied this oil after shampooing, and conditioning wit herbal Essences rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner samples I received together..Wil definitely be purchasing this when I use out the samples</li>
    <li> I think this hair oil elixir works great! I received a sample from Influenster to test and review. The smell is intoxicating and it left my hair sleek and shiny. The only drawback I had with it was that at first my hair felt greasy when I applied it. But after a day my hair absorbed the oil and it was no longer greasy. You only need small amount to get great results so the product should last you a while.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Influenster to try out! It is amazing! My hair was smooth, my ends were repaired! It was like I just got a hair cut from the salon with as healthy as my ends looked and felt! This is an amazing product and highly recommended for anyone with split ends or dry damaged hair. Totally a bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product and was really skeptical at first. I have really thick hair so oil&#x27;s like this typically don&#x27;t to well for my hair. I decided to give it a shot though and was very impressed. I applied a small amount to my hair after blowdrying and straightening it. Even in the super dry weather it held up great, no dry static-y hair and it was slight light and moveable, not weighed down by the oil at all.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many oils in my time trying to find the right one. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever find the perfect one with my fine hair but this wasn&#x27;t bad. It definitely did give shine and depending how you style it helps give texture as well but I&#x27;m not sure it gives me the nourishment I&#x27;m quite looking for with heat tools without having to add too much product. Definitely does have a wonderful smell to it which I find some oils seriously lack though! I also got this product for free in my influenster box.</li>
    <li> In the eighties, I was surprised to find the showers in the locker rooms flanked by bottles of Pert Shampoo.  Pert is a women&#x27;s herbal-scented shampoo with conditioner, but given the scanty amount of choices men had for their own shampoos, it made sense to me.  Even today the choices (besides Head and Shoulders, of course) are slim for men.  What does this have to do with Herbal Essences Wild Naturals?  Well, I thought in the same spirit, I needed a men&#x27;s hair groom, which I could use on bad hair days (mornings!) short of the usual gels or Brylcreem, and the little &amp;#34;dab that&#x27;ll do yah&amp;#34;.  I like what the oils do to my hair:  It moisturizes as well as tames my hair, and it gets it ready for the day. The drawback is the fragrance:  This is no herbal elixir for the hair. The fragrance is florid, so it will not become the Pert hair groom of the new millenium.  It will, however, be excellent for women who want to have their hair treated and become manageable in the same, simple treatment, and it is for this that I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hate oil products. I HATE them. This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever liked. I received it free to try from influenster and I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells AMAZING and didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily or heavy. I even put some on my skin because it smells so good! I will definitely buy this product!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Influenster to test the product. I decided to use it every other day in fear that it would weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. So far, it has done neither of those things. I&#x27;ve only used it four times, so I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet. Pairing with the shampoo and conditioner my hair is shiney and looks healthy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> there is not enough wonderful things that can be said about this product the smell is lovely it makes your hair so silky. i received this product free for this sampling purposes and reviewing and will surely repurchase. i have bleached hair and it works wonders. i love hair oils and elixirs but this by far is the best that i have used.</li>
    <li> So I had my doubts that this line scented with Turkish figs and Cassia (a flower) would smell good. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! My first thought is that is smells like bubble gum, sweet and warm. I used one pump for my medium long course Asian hair, concentrating on the ends. I could tell my hair was well conditioned and felt silky smooth. I didn&#x27;t look greasy afterwards which can be a problem with these kinds of products. Will definitely use again! I receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this oil free for review from Influenster.  I love that it is not greasy feeling on my hair. I does feel like an oil of course but without the oily aftermath. I used the oil after I washed my hair with the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner. I used a moisturizer after applying the oil and my hair felt moisturized for a few days without having to reapply product. I did also try it after my shampoo before my conditioner and it made my hair even more easy to comb through.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really complain or brag about this oil.  I think it smells nice and the oil washes off my hands easily.  I like the pump that distributes a drop at a time.  With my hair, I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  It&#x27;s not hot and humid right now so I&#x27;m not having any problem with the frizz that usually comes with high humidity. So maybe I&#x27;ll be able to tell more of a difference in mid summer.&lt;br /&gt;Not noticing any big shine difference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an oil so it&#x27;s something that won&#x27;t hurt my hair but because I&#x27;m not noticing any big difference, I doubt I will buy this.</li>
    <li> This is really helping protect my hair from heat styling, which helps my color last longer. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> After receiving this, I tried it immediately. Having used the Herbal Essences conditioner, which doesn&#x27;t condition sufficiently for me, I was interested in seeing how the matching oil would work with it.    Like the conditioner, this product is very much on the light side of things.  Light bodied.  Light in color (almost colorless).  Lightly scented.    It&#x27;s not bad for oils of this type. It does help reduce the flyaway hair that the conditioner left. I&#x27;m not sure that you use much less actual oil in the end. I found I had to use a little more of the product in order to get the effect I wanted. On one hand, I suppose you could say you are paying more for the volatile ingredients like alcohol.  On the other hand, I like lighter oils like this better because they are easily applied with more control than heavier oils.  And I particularly like the lack of color.  Many Moroccan oils, by contrast, are a deep yellow.  The pump bottle is convenient and an improvement over more typical open cap bottles.    A viable alternative for those seeking a lighter oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had been buying a similar product that was very expensive. This one does the same job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get my hair trimmed nearly often enough, which means I end up with dry, brittle ends. Herbal Essences Wild Naturals oil really pampers my poor hair and I love how silky and smooth it makes my ends feel. The difference is noticeable and immediate. My only gripe is that the scent is very strong. Not unpleasant, but strong and sweet. It&#x27;s a large bottle compared to other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and the price is great.</li>
    <li> In comparison to its Wild Naturals illuminating counterpart, Herbal Essence&#x27;s Rejuvenating Oil Elixir seems a little more up to the task. Specifically, it is less oily than the illuminating spray, provides a more natural shine, also absorbs a little easier into the hair. In line with the rest of the Wild Naturals line, the rejuvenating elixir likewise smells absolutely terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a negative - and while curly hair lapped up the elixir - it only did so on the ends. The rest of the hair didn&#x27;t seem too keen to play nice with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, and if selecting a Herbal Essences spray for on-the-go, the rejuvenating version is the best (albeit not perfect) option.</li>
    <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I have super long hair that is dry at the ends.  I could not get the pump to work and I ended up putting a lot on my hair ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my hands and hair were very greasy, but it  was readily absorbed.  If you have oily hair you wont want this, otherwise this is a nice dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my bangs and this was the real test. I waited till the next day. My bangs were smooth and soft and not greasy or oily, and my forehead wasn&#x27;t oily, nor did I break out in zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that you could get the same results from sesame seed oil, or avocado oil if your hair is not extremely dry, but this is a good product and very convenient.</li>
    <li> Worked great on moisturizing my hair and with a fresh, natural scent, I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I am an oil fanatic. My hair is coarse, wavy and of medium thickness. I do use oils on my hair every day because the ends tend to be dry otherwise. I have certain prerequisites for my hair oil: 1) It has to be effective whether I apply it on dry or damp hair; 2) It has to have an unoffending smell; and 3) It has to be reasonably priced since I have long hair and I use a lot of oil so I go through bottles pretty fast. Herbal Essences hits all the marks. I applied it to my hair when it was damp and when it was dry. Both times, it worked well. I was especially happy with the results upon application to damp hair; once it air-dried, my hair was silky, lustrous, and yet still had plenty of body. The smell is wonderfully fruity. So refreshing. And as for the price - well, it is very affordable and a plus for every day users like me.  The ingredients list grapeseed oil, olive oil, safflower seed oil, peppermint oil, in addition to cyclopentasiloxane, isopropyl myristate, and dimethicone as the top three ingredients.</li>
    <li> gosh!!!! herbal essences smell so good its soft and lite&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m natural and this is just what I need. nice soft shine</li>
    <li> I have fairly long wavy hair that tends to dry out during the winter months while the heaters are on.  I followed the directions for the Herbal Essences Rejuvenating Oil Elixir - putting a drop or two in my hands, rubbing them together, and then into my hair concentrating on the tips.  I was rewarded with hair that felt much more hydrated and which was less flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my problems tend around the tips of my hair, so I put most of the product there but then ran my hands through the rest of my hair.  I tried both wet and dry applications and found that the dry method worked best for me.  I was glad that it was a lighter oil as some products have had a tendency to make my hair feel greasy but that was not the case with the Oil Elixir.  I also found the light scent to be a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this kind of product in winter or when the Texas summer heat comes on full force.  I will certainly reach for this product at those times and recommend it to anyone who wants to give a shine and feeling of re-hydration to their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used products like this by different companies they usually make my hair look really oily but this is really good makes my hair soft without the oily look. And as a bonus it smells really good. I would recommend  this to anyone that wants to get salon quality but not pay that price for it :)</li>
    <li> This oil not only smells incredible but leaves your hair soft and shiny!  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this moisturized in forever!! Definitely do recommend this oil to everyone.  I was actually given a free sample of this conditioner by influencer to test and ended up going out and buying my own bottle its so incredible!</li>
    <li> I got this free to try through influenster.com and it is amazing! I have very fine, straight hair that is normaly so full of static in the winter i have to keep it pulled back. After using this(paired with the shampoo and conditioner) I was able to leave it down!</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Influenster to test, and I have to say this stuff is amazing. I used it on my dry hair when I first got it, and immediately felt a difference. I had JUST colored my hair, so I had tons of damage, and I could feel my tips becoming softer. I used it with my hair being damp as well, and I am also pleased with the results. I will definitely be buying more of this stuff. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone would give it ONE star. My hair has been in a bun all week. And I put it up in a bun after I wash, brush and air dry my hair. Once my bun is down my hair either gets frizzy or it gets curly. And I used the oil (ONE DROP) on my tips and within 30 min my tips didn&#x27;t even look split. I&#x27;m amazed. I was so skeptic about this herbal essence rejuvenating system because of the shampoo BUT it actually works and I love it!!!! I really really do!</li>
    <li> * I got this item for free from influenster*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product of its kind that I have ever tried. At first, I was dubious of its results because some rejuvenating products don&#x27;t work as well as they say they do but I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, it smells so good that I got compliments from my friends that my hair was smelling so great and they asked me what products I used. Second, I really think that it saves your hair from looking limp or dead. It really livens up your hair by giving it shine and a little bit of volume. I like putting it on my ends because I think it makes my split ends look less noticable.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample to test and review. I used this on my hair for a few days and so far my hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry as before I started using it. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy oily feel to it on your hands. The oil has a light, pleasant scent that is not overpowering. Overall, my hair does feel a little bit softer than before.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is amazing! The scent is perfect,light,floral,fruity and unique without being over powering. I have mixed race hair (Black and Irish) My hair is long,curly,frizzy,dry and sometimes crunchy! This product is a \\&quot;light\\&quot; oil for my hair type. It softens and adds shine without making my hair greasy. I use it in the afternoon on dry hair to fight the midday frizzies! A little goes a long way so its an excellent value too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the product and the scent is so delightful. Its totally worth trying !</li>
    <li> Like others said, this item is a light bodied oil. I have been using a heavier oil based leave in moisturizer for my Spanish/Portuguese hair, and I needed to use 4 squirts of this to even notice it. The smell is great, but I&#x27;d go through the bottle in 2 weeks probably. I reviewed the shampoo and conditioner as well. The shampoo is not sulfate free, and the conditioner is not heavy enough for my curls. I will save these items for emergency purposes. All in all, not a terrible line, just needs the SLS removed and to be made a bit heavier.</li>
    <li> Liked this product!  It left  shine, not oily looking...just the smell was appealing to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other hair oils and this leaves my hair feeling soft but not actually oily and weighed down! I love it and for the price its ROCKS! I was able to get this for free to try and review and I love it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample package of this from influenster &amp; I really liked the shampoo. I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong (the cassia extract) but without leaving it with that stripped feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was ok. It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all. The only minus is that there was no sustaining moisture when my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir. I read the ingredients beforehand and saw that it had silicones. I&#x27;m not against silicones at all but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list. Companies use it in serums so that your hair isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products. I decided to try it out anyway because every companies formulation is different. It dried my hair up sooo much and left it tangled. I decided to rinse my hair and deep condition but that did nothing so I had to shampoo &amp; deep condition all over again to get that product off of my hair.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product as a free sample through Influenster, and I was really excited because I have never used hair oil before. My hair looks a bit dry from using heating tools on it. After using this product, my hair actually looked smooth. I tried it while my hair was damp and blow dried it, but I saw that it worked better if I just rubbed a small dab in my hands and combed them through the ends of dry hair. Only use a small amount though because it is oily and it will look oily if you use too much. Awesome product though! Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice and it is not too heavy. Some similar products weigh hair down and make it look greasy, but this on sufficiently moisturizes and adds shine without that issue.I received a sample of the product in a Voxbox from Influenster in the middle of winter and it made my dried up hair look sleek. A coworker thought I had dyed my hair darker because it looked so different.</li>
    <li> I received a trial sample of this oil elixir. I like this elixir, it isn&#x27;t quite as heavy as a serum, so it was able to moisturize my hair without weighing it down. This would be a great product to use between wash days without having to worry about excessive build up. My curls were popping! It played nice with the other products I put in my hair. I will definitely add this elixir to my daily line up.  Update!! Today, before stepping into the shower, I spritzed my hair with a little water and then treated it to another dose of this oil elixir. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair, just let the steam from my shower revive my curls. Post-shower, my curls are bouncy, shiny and well-moisturized. I&#x27;m ready for the weekend!</li>
    <li> I receieved this in a kit from influenster to try for free and I am so glad I did! I have used other products like this that I purchased from a salon at a salon price. The smell is amazing and it works just as well as any salon expensive brand at a fraction of the cost. A little bit goes a long way and this stuff is way worth it! It gives your ends and damaged areas of your hair a super silky feel!</li>
    <li> i got the product free to test and review and i absolutely loved it. the formula is very light weight and bring amazing shine to my hair. the smell of the product is so amazing just as the rest of the line. it  is one of the best oil i have ever applied to my hair</li>
    <li> This product helps keep my hair moist and comfortable in between shampooing.  Like most people, I find that my hair is soft and easy to work with right after I shampoo and that hair and scalp stay comfortable and free from itching for the rest of the day. But, given the dry air when heater is running, or if I am outside in the wind, by the next day, my hair feels dry and my scalp may itch. So, I was using a moisturizer on my hair, but it took time because I needed to pre wet my hair then air dry after applying the moisturizer. With Herbal Essences, I simply place 3 drops in my palm, rub palms together gently then apply to my hair.  My hair is immediately moister, more flexible and easy to style.  The dryness is gone. No itching. The aroma is OK, not something I would rave about and is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars. I have only just started to use this product and wil revisit this review in a few months after I gain some longer term experience.</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick. I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I think this combo is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br /&gt;The oil elixir smells really good, but it didn’t really act as brilliantly as it promises. It didn&#x27;t really affect my hair in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this combination works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
    <li> thank you for blessing my hair feels fantastic got AV box from Influenster to try your product and I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> I call this hair crack! My hair is extremly curly and I blow dry and straighten it almost everyday! Since I have been using this it has made my hair ten times softer and feels healthier!! I love it! I extremly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Wish you could have put it on  wet hair instead of dry hair</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster. I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times. I love the sweet smell of the product and it lasts in my hair throughout the day. I used only 2 small drops of the oil and it helped keep my flyaways and frizzy hair in check throughout the day.  I used the combo of three for 6 washes and did not see improvement except that my hair was still frizzy and dry. I noticed that my hair looked oily and flat. I like the product to help keep my dry ends moisturized.</li>
    <li> Now as much as I like herbal essence I have to say I am very disappointed in the quality if this hair elixir. I tried it out for almost two weeks and every time it leaves my hair feeling overly greasy and sticky and not something that I would want my hair to feel. I noticed that I would wash my hair more often when using this product. Not something I would get in the future</li>
    <li> I received this free to test and review. I really liked how silky this left my hair. I have issues with brittle hair towards the ends. This helped smooth those out. I do have to say that for me it was best applied to dry hair. I had to reapply it if I put it on before blow drying. One thing to note is it is easy to over due and put to much on, so a little goes a long way. And the smell is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I like how the product is designed to come with a pump, but sometimes I just remove it and pour a small drop or 2 onto my hands.  I also like how this product can be use with damp or dry hair. I have tried both ways and personally, I saw the effects of the oil elixir much better when my hair was damp than dry. I have dry, brittle hair, so this product really help moisturizes my locks. **Product was sent free of charge by Influenster to review.**</li>
    <li> I recieved this for free from influenster to try out.  I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because it smells nice and does smooth your hair nicely, but I found my hair oily much faster between uses.  Not really a fan of it and was expecting more from it.  The shampoo and coditioner was decent as well.  I am generally not a big fan of this brand so if you usually like herbal essences you may like this.</li>
    <li> After adding this to my wet hair and blow drying, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was. Usually I have many flyways and they were barely noticeable after this product. I can&#x27;t wait to make this part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to review but all opinions  are mine.</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of the herbal essences wild naturalist rejuvenating oil elixir for free to try and review. Couldn&#x27;t have gotten any luckier because this stuff is amazing. Just a couple drops on my wet hair makes a world of difference. It takes my fly always and my hair feels and looks soft and shiny. Most hair elixirs or oils way my hair down and make it look greasy. This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, make your hair strong and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Got this through Influenster! I love the scent! I typically use extra virgin Coconut Oil and will continue to do so, but I will also use a small amount of this to add a little scent. I use the coconut oil up near my roots/scalp and will put this toward my ends so as to keep chemicals in it from my scalp.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir was smooth but not as lasting. Thanks to @Influester who provided me with a free sample I was able to try it out before purchasing it. It was not what I expected, I will give it another try.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this product as well as the matching shampoo and conditioner. I received the trio for free for testing purposes and I have been using them for a week now and it works really well. They make my hair really soft and silky smooth. However, it doesn&#x27;t do much for dead ends and heat damage. But I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with dry and brittle hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE Love LOVE! I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to tame the frizz and keep the curls and this works wonders! Smells great too... each time I turn my head I smile a little because it smells great.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to test and review via Influenster along with the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo + Conditioner. I&#x27;ve never used an oil elixir in my hair before until testing out this product and I must say I really liked it. I know there are very expensive oils out there that you can buy but this one is reasonably priced and probably works just as well. Not to mention it smells amazing! I put it on my hair after shampooing, conditioning, blow drying and straightening which usually drys out my hair quickly. The oil elixir helped lock in the moisture and also I noticed it took away the static that tends to happen during the cold winter months. My hair now feels really soft and smooth and also looks healthy and shiny! I  have only used this product for the past couple days but I can already tell it is going to be my new friend. It works best with the same shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product.  It worked really nice with my hair type and left it shiny and smelling delicious.</li>
    <li> Love this product when I blow dry and straighten my hair! No flyaways and smells great! Thanks Influenster for sending me product to review!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test and review. I got the whole set in this scent- and I really love the scent! It reminds me of the beach or something. The shampoo and conditioner pair really well with this oil. As with any oil, you can not spray this near your roots or you will look like you haven&#x27;t showerd for days. I usually spray it on the tips of my hair (sparingly) once I am done styling it. If Im going with natural hair that day, I will do it straight out of the shower. It smells very fresh and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but makes it look healthier. I have a lot of split ends and fine hair, and it really made a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance. I will be purchasing this once my sample runs out. Works just as well as higher end more expensive oils!</li>
