      <li>I look forward to putting this cream on, it&#x27;s kinda refreshing.</li>
      <li>Not Greasy like most stretch mark creams.</li>

      <li>Moringa Oil is one of the most beneficial oils for scars.</li>
      <li>Nice light citrus smell</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten nearly as many nicks or cuts from the ravor.</li>
      <li>So many of these type of creams STINK.</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>I will also be pleased to get rid of the stretch marks too, but they won&#x27;t be seen until I lose the rest of my weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my true story and my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost or for free in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion.</li>
      <li>Has a nice fresh scent and it works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to rub in.</li>
      <li>but this smelled like chemicals and just way too strong.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t bring myself to test this one out more, scent is too strong being pregnant.</li>
      <li>The cream is smooth and didn&#x27;t leave a filmy feeling.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Great product with multiple uses.</li>
      <li>So finding a good, clean natural source of Vitamin E oil like Moringa Oil is very exciting.</li>
      <li>From the time I first opened the jar until this morning, I haven&#x27;t been able to believe how fabulous it smells.</li>
      <li>This product is high quality and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>At this point, I am more interested in getting rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells very fragrant but not too overwhelming at all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell really is intoxicating and seemed to make me feel much more connected to my wee one as I applied it and talked to her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After I got the ok from my doctor that everything was healing perfectly, I decided to use this on them to take away the redness that new scars usually have.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some chronic dry itchy spots for years that this cream has alleviated so nicely.</li>
      <li>I placed it on my 8 month pregnant belly</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>The results have been great and overall where i apply the cream looks much healthier.</li>
      <li>So many Vitamin E come from highly processed sources.</li>
      <li>The cream is packaged in a very generous size container with an opening that allows for easy access to all the cream.</li>
      <li>and it has already helped decrease the redness in this area after just 2 weeks worth of using this cream.</li>
      <li>This cream is light it gets absorbed into my skin fast  </li>
      <li>Massage into skin until absorbed fully.</li>
      <li>I can put a shirt on almost right away after I apply the cream.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this tree greens stretch mark and scar cream for anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks because this product will do just that!</li>
      <li>This Tree Greens Stretch Mark Cream works really well!</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to all of my pregnant friends</li>
      <li>This Tree Greens cream was actually quite good at removing stretch marks and preventing them from coming back.</li>
      <li>Although I am using the Stretch Mark and Scar Cream from Tree Greens on my stretch marks, my main focus right now are the scars.</li>
      <li>After 3 kids my body has been stretched in many directions.</li>
      <li>and it it glides on my skin like very soft butter and is absorbed into my skin within minutes.</li>
      <li>I stoked I found this product, now I&#x27;m ready for the beach.</li>
      <li>Where ever I use this stuff it seems to be much healthier.</li>
      <li>It soaks in fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super high in Vitamin E naturally.</li>
      <li>I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend This Stretch Mark and Scar Cream.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>When I put makeup on the one near my eye, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stick out as much as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have fresh stretchmarks they are red</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any new stretch marks at all</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone who has scars (old or new) and stretch marks from pregnancy or growing</li>
      <li>I had a fairly old scar on my leg.</li>
      <li>My &amp;#34;stripes&amp;#34; are 9 years old with an additional branding 6 years old.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my stretch marks are really old</li>
      <li>The directions say to apply directly to the abdomen, hips, thighs, arms, and legs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 weeks now and my stretch marks are almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week, so it&#x27;s too early to see results.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this cream because I have some scars and old stretch marks</li>
      <li>The post says, &amp;#34;REFRESHING ENERGY BOOST of citrus is given as an added bonus, due to our carefully selected and formulated AROMATHERAPY experience.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself.</li>
      <li>I use this product on some old scars and it does an fantastic job dimensioning the scars appearance in only a few days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After 3 kids my body has been stretched in many directions. This cream is putting me back together. It feels like deep healing therapy for the skin. The ingredients are really nice. Has a nice fresh scent and it works. Will use again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This Tree Greens Stretch Mark Cream works really well! I also LOVE the smell of this product. So many of these type of creams STINK. This one works and smells great. I&#x27;m really happy. I stoked I found this product, now I&#x27;m ready for the beach. Bring it on! awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into products that don&#x27;t have a list of ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce. This product has great ingredients. Shea Butter and Moringa Oil are amazing products on there own. This cream has both! I use this product on some old scars and it does an fantastic job dimensioning the scars appearance in only a few days. I also use this product as a general moisturizer. I&#x27;ve had some chronic dry itchy spots for years that this cream has alleviated so nicely. It&#x27;s soooo nice not having these irritations anymore. Really great product!</li>
    <li> Ive had stretch marks on my hips for a few years now and I&#x27;ve tried different creams or lotions.  Some of them worked okay but what I like better about this cream is that it isn&#x27;t greasy! Nice light citrus smell and I know Moringa oil is great for your skin. I learnt about Moringa oil as I was traveling through Asia so I an glad to finally be able to find more products that use it!</li>
    <li> I have tried plenty of different stretch mark cream and none of them come close to this tree greens stretch mark and scar cream. It contains vitamin A,B,C,E, shea nut, and moringa seed. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. The directions say to apply directly to the abdomen, hips, thighs, arms, and legs. Massage into skin until absorbed fully. I have only used it on my stomach for a few days and I am seeing results. I put it on at night after I shower and in the morning. This cream is reducing the visibility of the stretch marks on my stomach. This product is high quality and smells amazing. I would recommend this tree greens stretch mark and scar cream for anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks because this product will do just that! I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> To soon to tell whether it&#x27;s working yet but I would use it more often if I didn&#x27;t mind the smell of it, smells bad.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to report that this Scar cream works really well. I had a fairly old scar on my leg. I never really considered using a cream to diminish it&#x27;s appearance. I was pretty skeptical about a cream that could actually make my scar less visible. I have to say though that this stuff works. My scar is about 30% less visible. It&#x27;s not greasy and I actually like the smell quite a bit. I look forward to putting this cream on, it&#x27;s kinda refreshing. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been getting stretch marks from bodybuilding, especially around my bicep area. I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin E creams which didn&#x27;t help much. This Tree Greens cream was actually quite good at removing stretch marks and preventing them from coming back. It&#x27;s easy to rub in. I can put a shirt on almost right away after I apply the cream. It soaks in fast. I have been using it after I shave as well and I haven&#x27;t gotten nearly as many nicks or cuts from the ravor. Where ever I use this stuff it seems to be much healthier. Great product with multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stretchmarks and quite a few scars. The stretchmarks are from having babies and gaining a lot of weight. The scars are from the things my dermatologist has had to remove from my face, neck &amp; back. Although I am using the Stretch Mark and Scar Cream from Tree Greens on my stretch marks, my main focus right now are the scars. At this point, I am more interested in getting rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried OTC scar remover creams before but they were thick hard to use and seemed to sit on top of my skin and never soak in. However this cream is made with Shea butter &amp; Morinca oil and it it glides on my skin like very soft butter and is absorbed into my skin within minutes. What is left is a soft &amp; silky feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh, the way it smells!!!!!! Wow! From the time I first opened the jar until this morning, I haven&#x27;t been able to believe how fabulous it smells. The post says, &amp;#34;REFRESHING ENERGY BOOST of citrus is given as an added bonus, due to our carefully selected and formulated AROMATHERAPY experience.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself. *ahhhhh* it smells so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having not used it long enough to see a real &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; difference, I can only tell you that my personal experience is that it &amp;#34;seems to me&amp;#34; to be repairing the skin of the scars, and they don&#x27;t look as pronounced. When I put makeup on the one near my eye, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stick out as much as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally looking forward to seeing what is in store for me in getting rid of my scars. I will also be pleased to get rid of the stretch marks too, but they won&#x27;t be seen until I lose the rest of my weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost or for free in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome. It is made with Moringa Oil and on the spanish chanel they advertise Moringa Oil alot for all of the curative abilities it has, so when I had the oppurtunity to order this product on a promotion basis for my unbiased opinion I jumped at the chance. This cream does not smell the greatest but it does have a a shea butter hint scent. I have fresh stretchmarks they are red and it has already helped decrease the redness in this area after just 2 weeks worth of using this cream. These stretchmarks are actually disappearing!</li>
    <li> This stretch mark cream is wonderful!  As soon as I peeled the plastic off I noticed the smell was AMAZING!  I placed it on my 8 month pregnant belly and it goes on smooth and silky. I have not noticed any new stretch marks at all and I am 8 months pregnant!&lt;br /&gt;The smell really is intoxicating and seemed to make me feel much more connected to my wee one as I applied it and talked to her.&lt;br /&gt;I even received an email from the company making sure that I received the product :)&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to all of my pregnant friends bellies!&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and there you have it! WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week, so it&#x27;s too early to see results. However, I like the texture and there&#x27;s a lot in the jar which is nice. I&#x27;ve been using another scar serum for several years and haven&#x27;t seen any results ,yet. Hoping I will see a difference with this one.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells Great. Not Greasy like most stretch mark creams. Worked great on my stretch marks. Wish I found this product years ago. Highly recommend.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The best stretch mark product I have my stretch marks are smooth as a baby bottom. Hopeful in time my stretch marks discoloration will fade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Scar cream with Moringa Oil for a while. Moringa Oil is one of the most beneficial oils for scars. It&#x27;s super high in Vitamin E naturally. So many Vitamin E come from highly processed sources. The best quality Vitamin E comes from natural plants like Moringa. Not all Vitamin E oil is equal. So finding a good, clean natural source of Vitamin E oil like Moringa Oil is very exciting. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and I can tell this is a quality product. The results have been great and overall where i apply the cream looks much healthier. It&#x27;s a cream that I look forward to using. Has a nice citrus smell too.</li>
    <li> i got this product at a reduced price to test it out and give my honest opinion on the stretch mark/scar cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and it has kinda made my stretch marks lighter, granted mine weren&#x27;t very dark to begin with. I also have eczema and the cream doesn&#x27;t break me out and it does make my skin softer. The smell is the best part. It has a very clean relaxing smell, the best way I can describe it is like a minty, eucalyptus smell.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this cream because I have some scars and old stretch marks I want to get rid off. I have been using this cream for a couple of a weeks now and I have noticed a difference in my scars but only a slight difference in my stretch marks I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my stretch marks are really old but it does seem to be working on the stretch marks that aren&#x27;t as deep. This cream is light it gets absorbed into my skin fast  it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling and the cream smells great. I will continue to use this cream until I finish the bottle I can&#x27;t wait to see the final results!</li>
    <li> So I got this stretch mark and scar cream about 3 weeks ago and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;About a month and a half ago, I had a minor laparoscopic surgery and had 2 incisions. After I got the ok from my doctor that everything was healing perfectly, I decided to use this on them to take away the redness that new scars usually have.&lt;br /&gt;1 week in I noticed that my scar went from a reddish color to a medium pink color.&lt;br /&gt;Second week was about the same.&lt;br /&gt;Third week I saw the most improvement! It went from a medium pink color to a pinkish beige...it is barely noticeable and I haven&#x27;t even been using this for a month!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has scars (old or new) and stretch marks from pregnancy or growing fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream at a discount from Tree Greens in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t bring myself to test this one out more, scent is too strong being pregnant. I typically like citrus but this smelled like chemicals and just way too strong. Had to wash it off to not be nauseous.  Maybe after birth I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 weeks now and my stretch marks are almost completely gone. This product really works! I totally recommend!! (:</li>
    <li> Been using the Stretch Mark and Scar Cream for a few days now and every day I can see slight changes.  My &amp;#34;stripes&amp;#34; are 9 years old with an additional branding 6 years old.  It has started to lighten it enough that I need to search for some marks. The cream is packaged in a very generous size container with an opening that allows for easy access to all the cream. The cream is smooth and didn&#x27;t leave a filmy feeling. Smells very fragrant but not too overwhelming at all.  I am wondering now, why I didn&#x27;t try this before!  I received this cream at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> never worked with me but i think it is a good product for certain kind of skin</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time. I highly recommend This Stretch Mark and Scar Cream.  It smoo t h and smells awesome.</li>
