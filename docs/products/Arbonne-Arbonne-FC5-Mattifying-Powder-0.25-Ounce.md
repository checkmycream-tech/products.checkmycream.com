    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve tried many different brands over the years to prevent oil-y makeup over the day. I live in a very humid place and &amp;#34;shiny face&amp;#34; happens a LOT! But not with this stuff! Arbonne makeup is great- I finally feel like my skin looks great! I use the mineral foundation powder and then the mattifying powder over it And for touch ups throughout the day. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The best mattifying powder I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great powder to help cover redness and as a finishing powder.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really takes the red out of my skin. Expensive but worth it. buying it on Amazon was cheaper than my own dealer discount. I will always look here first.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend several years ago and have only high praise for it.  It sets my makeup for the day and also is helpful when you need a quick \\&quot;smooth out\\&quot; without adding more foundation...Cuts the shine immediately.</li>
    <li> This powder is fantastic.  A little goes a long way, it matts my oily skin right down and is undetectable.  I will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Have used Arbonne products for awhile. Mattifing powder works well for oily skin. When used under your foundation, it takes away the shiny look.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. After applying BB cream or some liquid foundation, my face usually looks really shiny. After applying this product, I can see how matte it has made my face look. Unfortunately, i did not like the sponge that came with it. It started to look real gross after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Great as a mattifying base and for touch ups to absorb excess oil.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. The Covergirl translucent powder is way better and way less expensive,  and it actually evens my skintone. This Arbonne powder does nothing to cover my redness and actually exacerbates it by sucking up all the oil and making my skin look dry/chapped.</li>
    <li> This powder is great. I already used up two. It matifies your skin without any color. You can use it on top of makeup or alone. I use it all the time and its great. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores or causes breakouts. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It does mattify but is green in colour and so changes the colour of your foundation! A bit of an odd colour for a facial powder to be honest.</li>
    <li> Very good powder! Doesn&#x27;t stick to face ...nice matte finish after application with no oiliness left! Great and fast seller!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> A staple for your every-day make-up bag: doesn&#x27;t clog pores, works all day, blends well with a large range of skin tones.</li>
    <li> I like Arbonne FC5 Mattifying Powder just fine.  I was very disappointed it took too long get the product !!!!</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not the cheapest, but I don&#x27;t use any other face makeup. It helps to absorb some of the oil on my face (very oily) and it makes me feel drier. It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes, so don&#x27;t expect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has never made me break out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This Arbonne Fc5 Mattifying Powder is just as good as the more expensive Arbonne website.  It was just what I needed and was readily available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> i have happy with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years. It absorbs oil without looking like more make-up has been applied. My favorite powder ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have oily skin.  Arbonne has a great product line and it really works.</li>
    <li> put this one rigght aftrer your done with your make up process and BOOM will make your make up last ALL DAY and keep your skin from getting oily. HIGHLY RECOMMEND , this is the only stuff other than a primer(which makes my skin oily) last through out the day</li>
    <li> Product is as expected!</li>
