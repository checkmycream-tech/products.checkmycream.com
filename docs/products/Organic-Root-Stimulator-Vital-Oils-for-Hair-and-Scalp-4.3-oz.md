      <li>This is by far a must have because it has a great smell.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t see anyone else complaining of the same problem, but good thing to watch out for if you plan to use this product.</li>
      <li>but I ended up losing more hair...until I heard about grapeseed oil and ordered this product on Amazon and it worked really well.</li>
      <li>It contains an array of great oils such as grapeseed oil, sweet almond oil and soybean oil to moisturize dry flaky scalp if you have an issue with that.</li>
      <li>Amazing smell, oil doesn&#x27;t flow down to the neck but it dries out quickly..</li>
      <li>I ONLY WISH THEERE WAS MORE IN THE BOTTLE.</li>
      <li>Used this daily for almost a week, didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair, just more breakage if anything.  </li>

      <li>LOVE the scent; the smell lingers... especially on windy days...</li>
      <li>When I changed my home country, my hair got very dry and damaged, mostly because of the weather and stress.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your business and time .I</li>
      <li>The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations.</li>
      <li>but it is very oily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>AND i HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
      <li>I should also add I have sensitive skin, so it could very well be just me.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my natural hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I AM NATURAL</li>
      <li>plus for natural hair</li>
      <li>but it makes my hair shiny and soft while preserving the curl without being greasy.</li>
      <li>My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema.</li>
      <li>I was left with a nice subtle shiny to my hair.</li>
      <li>It contains only natural oils!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema.</li>
<li> I was left with a nice subtle shiny to my hair.</li>
<li> It contains only natural oils!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> then again, I have a head full of funny hair that absorbs everything like crazy!</li>
<li> I put this in my hair after shampooing and let my curly hair air dry.  </li>
<li> bye flakes &amp; dry scalp  </li>
<li> I have a dry scalp and tried a lot of produts.</li>
<li> If you have dry scalp give this product a try.</li>
<li> It can be very messy if I use a little too much.</li>
<li> I like this also, only needed to use a little.</li>
<li> Take care not to overdo it as a little goes a long way</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t flake like the other product</li>
<li> A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> I previously used the [[ASIN:B000ZS8MDE Organic Root Stimulator Anti-Itch Scalp Oil, 4 Ounce]].</li>
<li> It leaked and the package was a mess when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But if I used this on my scalp and left it for an extended period of time (overnight, or even just a few hours) I would get painful bumps on my scalp which (going by feel here, since I really couldn&#x27;t see them) seemed like pimples or ingrown hairs.</li>
<li> It worked for her, but  after a few days it seems to flake a little bit.</li>
<li> When I spread a few drops into my hands  and rubbed throughout my hair</li>
<li> A quarter of the product had leaked out, due to poor packaging.</li>
<li> Lately her scalp has been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This oil was a game changer for me.</li>

    <li> The oil has a great smell. It is great to use right after you have washed your hair. If you have dry scalp give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, oil doesn&#x27;t flow down to the neck but it dries out quickly.. then again, I have a head full of funny hair that absorbs everything like crazy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil. Awesome smell. I will continue to use for years to come.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product but there is one problem I had with using it. If I used this on my scalp a bit before my shower, and then washed my hair and applied a little bit of this through the lengths of my hair, it was wonderful! It smells wonderful and made my hair feel silky smooth. But if I used this on my scalp and left it for an extended period of time (overnight, or even just a few hours) I would get painful bumps on my scalp which (going by feel here, since I really couldn&#x27;t see them) seemed like pimples or ingrown hairs. They didn&#x27;t really cause much trouble, but they still hurt and my understanding is that those bumps are caused by products clogging the pores? Or CAN be, I should say. Which seems counterproductive to aiding in hair growth. But, so long as I didn&#x27;t leave it on, it was great! I should also add I have sensitive skin, so it could very well be just me. I didn&#x27;t see anyone else complaining of the same problem, but good thing to watch out for if you plan to use this product. I&#x27;ll also note that I bought it for my sister &amp; she loved it as well! Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local beauty supply shop; its the best natural moisturizing oil product on the market. It contains only natural oils!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus for natural hair wearers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product 2x a week; massage into scalp and ends of hair.... &amp;#34;you all moisturized and smelling of essential oils; which is a plus!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent; the smell lingers... especially on windy days...lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing on amazon in bulks.</li>
    <li> Very light and it smells great! Also a great heat protectant since grape seed oil has a high smoke point.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS FOR ME. I HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN REMARKS ABOUT MY HAIR. I LOVE ITS LUSTER AND EASE OF USE. SIMPLY APPLY IT AND IT DOES THE REST. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND i HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
    <li> This oil was a game changer for me. I have been looking for something that would help my hair and scalp and this is it. A very light pleasant fragrance. It is gentle on my natural hair and scalp. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair after shampooing and let my curly hair air dry.  Take care not to overdo it as a little goes a long way but it makes my hair shiny and soft while preserving the curl without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Kind of greasy.  I&#x27;m going to try the oil from Kera Care.  I only use this the day before I wash.</li>
    <li> When I changed my home country, my hair got very dry and damaged, mostly because of the weather and stress. I tried almost everything to repair it such as olive oil, coconut oil, alma oil,... but I ended up losing more hair...until I heard about grapeseed oil and ordered this product on Amazon and it worked really well. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and has a pleasant smell. It&#x27;s true that not everything works for everyone, but I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to give it a try.</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAZING AND LEAVES YOU HAIR SO SOFT. I ONLY WISH THEERE WAS MORE IN THE BOTTLE. I AM NATURAL AND THIS HAS SOME OF THE KEY OILS THAT I USE ON MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> This is a very light oil which is great for scalp massages without being too greasy. A great smell as well. It contains an array of great oils such as grapeseed oil, sweet almond oil and soybean oil to moisturize dry flaky scalp if you have an issue with that. When I spread a few drops into my hands  and rubbed throughout my hair I was left with a nice subtle shiny to my hair. Another repurchase.</li>
    <li> My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema. It breaks my heart to see her scratching. The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations. Lately her scalp has been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I previously used the [[ASIN:B000ZS8MDE Organic Root Stimulator Anti-Itch Scalp Oil, 4 Ounce]]. I purchased it on a whim in CVS one day. It worked for her, but  after a few days it seems to flake a little bit. So I decided to try this item after seeing it on Amazon. It&#x27;s made by the same company. I love this for her. It works immediately.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t flake like the other product but it is very oily.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the bottle that this comes in. The little nozzel on it is perfect for scalp application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I have to use a towel around her neck when I apply this because it drips and gets on her clothing.&lt;br /&gt;- It can be very messy if I use a little too much. A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- The seller that sent it to me via Amazon did not do a good job with the packaging. It leaked and the package was a mess when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be working for my daughter so I will be using it again!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is light, perfect scalp oil, since my scalp doesnt provide enough for my kinky coily haor</li>
    <li> It smells so good kinda like purfume for your hair a plus is bye bye flakes &amp; dry scalp  lol</li>
    <li> Used this daily for almost a week, didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair, just more breakage if anything.  I am African American with relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I like this also, only needed to use a little.</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp and tried a lot of produts. This is by far a must have because it has a great smell. It gets bothersome at times when your mate says your hair has a strong smell. Kitty kitty is the champion of them all but this is 2nd. I use this three days a week  and Kitty kitty twice</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and my hair has grown since I started using it. Organic Root Stimulator is a great product.</li>
    <li> Thanks for your business and time .I will buy again thank you.  Smell  very good.</li>
    <li> I have braids as a transitional style and using this oil for my inverted system to help my hair to grow. Then when empty I will refill with my own blended oils.</li>
    <li> They need to take this stuff off the market before somebody gets sued I swear if u light a match to it it will blow u up this is some strong stuff those that are allergic beware</li>
    <li> A quarter of the product had leaked out, due to poor packaging. Aside from that, this is a great product. I wear my hair in locs, and this oil is terrific for the scalp.</li>
