      <li>Great producce</li>
      <li>Smells good, works good!</li>
      <li>Did a good job and</li>
      <li>Smells really good.</li>
      <li>This was a good product.</li>
      <li>That being said, I was very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes well and smelled nice.</li>
      <li>Was so pleased how well it worked, considering the condition of my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo does strip your hair and the conditioner leaves them soft and smelling great</li>
      <li>BUT it sped up the process for me from the way I was originally doing my hair.</li>
      <li>She used the rest of the product in the following days &amp; loved how it made her hair feel.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair was soft &amp; in pretty good shape afterwards.</li>
      <li>This product is okay, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to remove my dreadlocks any more than regular hair conditioner did.</li>
      <li>I had a friend help and that really helped with the time I think!</li>
      <li>I had my dreads for a year and my hair came our very smooth and long.</li>
      <li>14 hours later I have straight hair again :)</li>
      <li>I wish I could get just the conditioner in a much larger bottle for a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced.</li>
      <li>to help detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo saved me so much pain and the conditioner is one of my faves.</li>
      <li>This product really helped me speed up the process of taking out my loccs.</li>
      <li>Combing out loccs aren&#x27;t meant to be a fast process.</li>
      <li>It has a really good smell and after using another product (waaay cheaper $4.99) for my take down, I ended up using the Knotty Boy kit for a regular shampoo n&#x27; condition.</li>
      <li>This product makes a good occasional alternative to using huge amounts of kids detangling spray in dry hair, and I think using this breaks and abuses my hair a lot less.</li>
      <li>I used a flea comb and a comb with a pick end can mainly used the pick to work each dread.</li>
      <li>I mainly use the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I completely recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you do have to put the time into actually brushing out your knots but it makes it so much easier !</li>
      <li>I was nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>but I could have (and have) accomplished the same results with the 4 dollar stuff you get at walmart.</li>
      <li>But it still took 6 days for me to get my 4 year old locks out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more powerful than just plain conditioner.</li>
      <li>but when u have a head full of tight kinked lockes you will still have a lot of effect combing them out</li>
      <li>Tried this out and it didn&#x27;t work any differently than normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was able to keeps long hair with only a little trim.</li>
      <li>it really helped me brush out my partial dreads.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was a rip off.  It didn&#x27;t do what it advertised and I ended up having to cut off all my dreadlocks.</li>
    <li> This was my only experience with removing dlocks, so I can&#x27;t compare to removing them without the product. That being said, I was very pleased with the product. My daughter&#x27;s hair was soft &amp; in pretty good shape afterwards. She used the rest of the product in the following days &amp; loved how it made her hair feel. My only other comment is that I thought the kit came with the pick u needed (single metal pick) but it did not.</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;Used to help detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo saved me so much pain and the conditioner is one of my faves. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It just takes alot of time but, does work. You need to be VARY patience!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this emergency removal kit. I was not impressed. It did nothing to assist w/ the take down of my locs(of 4.5yrs). It has a really good smell and after using another product (waaay cheaper $4.99) for my take down, I ended up using the Knotty Boy kit for a regular shampoo n&#x27; condition.</li>
    <li> Not only did it take my dreads out but it fully restored my hair. It took a while to fully comb them out (about 18 hrs, but with help it could be faster)&lt;br /&gt;but my hair looks like I never had dreads before so that made me happy! I completely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> My son said it did not work at all.... His hair was in tangles and it did not soften it at all</li>
    <li> Shampoo does not lather, did not dissolve wax or help with softening the buildup of wax and/or lint.</li>
    <li> it is a great product and u should by it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dreads but my thick long curly hair is constantly trying to turn into them. The underneath hair on my neck gets almost felted at times and has to be massively detangled. This product makes a good occasional alternative to using huge amounts of kids detangling spray in dry hair, and I think using this breaks and abuses my hair a lot less. I mainly use the conditioner.  It really works great on the horrible snarls. It&#x27;s too expensive to use more than occasionally though, so not quite five stars.  I wish I could get just the conditioner in a much larger bottle for a more reasonable price. I&#x27;m going to try the other Knotty Boy products to see if they might work for my situation for less $$.</li>
    <li> This product in no shape, or form, met my expectations. I wasted money. I am very disappointed! this is pitiful.</li>
    <li> It helped with combing out my dreads. But it still took 6 days for me to get my 4 year old locks out. The shampoo isn&#x27;t meant to lather just to let you know. It strips your hair but it doesn&#x27;t get into the lock to strip all the wax and stuff that is trapped within them. I would say buy at least 2 meatal tooth combs and their detangaler because the co will run out way before you are even near done. Over all it works but you still have to put in a lot of work.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was so pleased how well it worked, considering the condition of my daughter&#x27;s hair. I was nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend it to everyone in need of removing their dread locks.</li>
    <li> Got it on time!!! Will update when I start and finish my lock removal</li>
    <li> This was a good product. Moisturizes well and smelled nice. It&#x27;s a little more powerful than just plain conditioner. I had my dreads for a year and my hair came our very smooth and long. Was happy I was able to keeps long hair with only a little trim.</li>
    <li> Did a good job and 14 hours later I have straight hair again :) I bought v05 for backup and used half the bottle. I used a flea comb and a comb with a pick end can mainly used the pick to work each dread. I had a friend help and that really helped with the time I think!</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to remove my dreadlocks any more than regular hair conditioner did.</li>
    <li> Took out my daughters &amp;#34;dreadlocks&amp;#34; from her not combing her hair properly. Great producce</li>
    <li> Tried this out and it didn&#x27;t work any differently than normal shampoo and conditioner. Very overpriced. It expected to work at least as well as clarifying shampoo but I could have (and have) accomplished the same results with the 4 dollar stuff you get at walmart.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!! Saved my hair without having to resort to cutting out my dreads. Smells good, works good!</li>
    <li> It was as simple as the instructions said...it was great</li>
    <li> This product really helped me speed up the process of taking out my loccs. Smells really good. Combing out loccs aren&#x27;t meant to be a fast process. So yes, it will take a while BUT it sped up the process for me from the way I was originally doing my hair.</li>
    <li> My locks were tighterrr than i thought. The shampoo does strip your hair and the conditioner leaves them soft and smelling great but when u have a head full of tight kinked lockes you will still have a lot of effect combing them out i ended up cutting most of mines.</li>
    <li> it really helped me brush out my partial dreads. it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you do have to put the time into actually brushing out your knots but it makes it so much easier ! the shampoo &amp; conditiner smell good too !</li>
