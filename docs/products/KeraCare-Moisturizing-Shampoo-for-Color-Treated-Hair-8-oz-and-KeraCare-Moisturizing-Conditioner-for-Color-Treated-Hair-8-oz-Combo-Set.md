    <li> Products smell nice, conditioner is a little slippery so a little goes a long way. I does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different moisturizing shampoo/conditioners and this product does not rate highly. I found the shampoo to be SUPER greasy. It doesn&#x27;t even lather up well. I only put the conditioner on the ends of my hair but my scalp is still super greasy from the shampoo. The conditioner is decent but the shampoo is terrible. Perhaps if you have a super dry scalp this product is for you. If you&#x27;re just looking for intense moisture for dry hair I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER stop using this duo...leaves my hair soft/shiny!!  The conditioner is an &amp;quot;automatic detangler&amp;quot; that leaves your hair soft and fresh!!</li>
    <li> my hair is much stronger now and i attribute it to this product.  i also like the way my hair feels afterwards</li>
    <li> I love KeraCare Moisturizer shampoo and conditioner. It makes my relaxed hair silky soft. Wonderful product especially reladed hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing products for my hair type which is 4a and the conditioner is to die for!</li>
    <li> luv this product. Did not know they made a color treated product.  I was using the sensitive kind.  But my hair is colored so I prefer using color treated items.  I luv it.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is a little different the last time it was a  clear gel like consistency now it&#x27;s a creamy yellow consistency, but other than that the product is great.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I just got my hair done with an organic dye and part of the instructions that I had were to buy a shampoo and conditioner that had UV protection in it. So, I figured that I would start with these...they are a smaller sized bottle but come in the set. They have an OK scent and I like the shampoo but the conditioner leaves a weird residue on your hair that dries to a firm and tacky hold on your hair. I adjusted the conditioner to a quarter sized dollop and did not condition my roots and that seemed to improve it somewhat, maybe all UV protectant conditioners are like this but I like my hair to be a little bit more residue free so I can add products afterwards.  **UPDATE** These went in the trash, I used less and less product and try not to shampoo my hair more than every other day. I also did not put any conditioner on my scalp and it still left it all a greasy mess with a weird residue. Hate it</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo/conditioner makes my hair feel. It coats my curly strands well and leaves it feeling moisturized. I plan to buy more for myself and one for my mother. Only thing I don&#x27;t like.....the smell reminds me of dog shampoo. I can&#x27;t say I still smell it after I rinse out the conditioner but it&#x27;s always the 1st thought when I later up with the shampoo</li>
    <li> I really love these products. My hair feels soft and manageable, but my only draw back is my scalp still itches after I use it. Pureology shampoo does a great job cleaning my scalp and its sulfate free too. I&#x27;ll continue to use, maybe shampoo with this first then follow up with Pureology.</li>
    <li> After just two uses, it left a strong build-up on my hair. It looked dirty and matted within 18 hours. Just tossed it, frankly wondering if I received a defective batch. It was that terrible.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!  It leaves your hair soft and mosturized!  I have also used the KeraCare for dry &amp; itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> Keracare Duo the best, soft manageable hair after washing get for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feelings so soft and easy to comb when I use this product. It is really great when I complete the set when using the creme press.</li>
    <li> These products work great on my hair. It leaves my hair so soft and easily manageable. I would definitely recommend this product to people who have color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Love this line. Great for relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I expected a better finish with this product considering the price. My hair was dry and lifeless after I used this product.  I used a less expensive product the next wash and there was a world of difference.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. Excellent shampoo &amp; conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and easy to style. My hair is healthier than it has been in a very long time.</li>
