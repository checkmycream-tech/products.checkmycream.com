      <li>I love this product sooo</li>
      <li>I love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>Glad it was recommended to me.</li>
      <li>Redken &amp;#34;So Soft&amp;#34; with Avocado Oil made the most difference for softness and shine</li>

      <li>I was heartbroken over the discontinuation of Redkin Age Reset masque and this is a pretty good substitute.</li>

      <li>I recommend Redken Extreme, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>and I saw a brilliant shine FROM WITHIN that has not been there for a long time.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and frizzy, what a combination</li>
      <li>Leaves hair silky smooth</li>
      <li>It smells good going on, but doesn&#x27;t leave an overpowering cloud of perfume after rinsing; I have allergies and am sensitive to that sort of thing.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>I will try leaving it on for a full fifteen minutes from now on.</li>
      <li>I love All Soft Heavy Cream and hoped this would be as impressive.</li>
      <li>So I need a fair amount of deep conditioning treatments to keep my hair borderline</li>
      <li>My hair is below my shoulders, straight and fine.  </li>
      <li>I have 4a/4b hair and this stuff leaves my hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>This produced even more natural shine and softness.  </li>
      <li>I use the Redken So Soft shampoo &amp; conditioner on a daily basis and it is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and silky, easier to style, and a lot more shiny and swingy.  </li>
      <li>My hair rarely ever gets oily, even if I don&#x27;t wash it for 4 days in the winter, and even when I sweat a ton during my workouts.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks more sleek and a bit more flat but healthy instead of dry.  </li>
      <li>I used this for the first time yesterday after shampooing.</li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deep conditioner</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable and rinses out cleanly.</li>

      <li>Nice and thick and very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>My hair didnt appear to be shinier, softer, in better condition, less frizzy, or anything else.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for damaged or preventive</li>
      <li>This is an amazing treatment for dull and damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>It works but I feel like I am putting on normal conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;All Soft&amp;#34; heavy cream and this one feels better on my hair.</li>
      <li>I think $19  (current price on amazon) is a really reasonable price for a product that offers positive results.</li>
      <li>My hair would feel very soft after I washed it out.</li>
      <li>It made my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>The Redken Diamond Oil Deep Facet Intensive Treatment is intense!</li>
      <li>It is worth every single penny.</li>
      <li>I have naturally 4a curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and alive again</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and will continue to use Redken products.</li>
      <li>It has been highlighted and colored over the years so has lost its natural shine from within.  </li>
      <li>I did like that my hair was soft.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is a known irritant for sensitive skin &amp; scalps.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it instead of conditioner and my hair is so soft and shiny</li>
      <li>about - unlike All Soft which leaves your hair smelling as if youd just been at a fancy salon.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of this treatment but after combing my hair today I had considerably less breakage.</li>
      <li>I use this instead of regular conditioner by washing my hair when I first get in the shower and then putting the deep conditioner in for the remainder of my shower.</li>
      <li>and it has left my hair soft, shiny and manageable!  </li>
      <li>I wash my hair an average of every 2 days (more or less depending on the season).  </li>
      <li>Rinse it out completely, and dry with an old t-shirt</li>
      <li>but there are other products that will do the same for you and won&#x27;t cost this much!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a single knot in my hair for days.</li>
      <li>I dry with a hair dryer, and my hair is SO SHINY AND SOFT!  </li>
      <li>I use it 2 times a week, on towel dried (t-shirt dried) hair, focusing most of the product on the ends of my hair before dabbing a tiny amount around the roots.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have below the shoulder, course, frizzy hair, that I color at least once a month.  This product is WONDERFUL!  I use it 2 times a week, on towel dried (t-shirt dried) hair, focusing most of the product on the ends of my hair before dabbing a tiny amount around the roots.  I then pile my hair up and put it in a shower cap, and let it sit for about 15 -30 mins.  Rinse it out completely, and dry with an old t-shirt (this will seriously cut down on frizzy hair if you replace your towel with an old t-shirt!).  I dry with a hair dryer, and my hair is SO SHINY AND SOFT!  The frizz is gone! It is smooth and gorgeous!  I love this product sooo much!&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I don&#x27;t recommend the diamond oil shampoo &amp; conditioner - it left my hair weighed down and flat, with no shine.... Very disappointing.  I use the Redken So Soft shampoo &amp; conditioner on a daily basis and it is great.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but there are other products that will do the same for you and won&#x27;t cost this much!</li>
    <li> I have 4a/4b hair and this stuff leaves my hair soft and healthy. This is my favorite deep conditioner</li>
    <li> It made my hair very soft. I had been doing a lot of gardening in the sun, as well as coloring my hair, and it made a big difference in just one use.</li>
    <li> Great product for once a week conditioning.  Highly recommend.  Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly amazing!! I&#x27;ve used oribe, kerastase and luxury brands and I have got more compliments on how healthy my hair looks after a month of using this mask. My hair dresser was one of them! Highly recommended for damaged or preventive</li>
    <li> My hair which is relaxed didnt have the silky feel when it was dried. But it did look revived. So as a restorative protein deep conditioner, I give it a thumbs up. But as a hydrating moisture sealing fixer, I give it a thumbs down. My sis who also has relaxed hair tried it and her hair felt silky and looked revived. Her hair structure is less coarse than mine. So I gave the conditioner to her. I am reverting to my macadamia hair mask.</li>
    <li> Great product for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I receive a sample kit from my daughter. The Redken Diamond Oil Deep Facet Intensive Treatment is intense! After shamppoing with Redken Diamond Oil Shampoo, I left this treatment on for 5 minutes and I was pleasantly surprised my dry hair and overbleached frizzy brittle ends were smoothed away! I use the intensive treatment once a week now to restore my hair to look and feel healthier. I also purchased the Redken Duo Diamond Oil Shampoo and conditoner for daily use.</li>
    <li> didnt perform like what I buy in the salon</li>
    <li> This is an amazing treatment for dull and damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was completely dry with split ends.&lt;br /&gt;Now after one application combined with a few drops of the diamond oil and steam, my hair is alive again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance that it contains.  Fragrance is a known irritant for sensitive skin &amp; scalps.&lt;br /&gt;It would be way better without the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and frizzy, what a combination huh, anyway this product worked ok made my hair super soft but way too flat. Probably if my hair was thicker it would work better. I did like that my hair was soft. Just not the flat part.</li>
    <li> my wife tried this and her feedback was the following:&lt;br /&gt;- after applying the cream her hair was not soft at all&lt;br /&gt;- after applying it was still dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She asked a friend to try as well and the feedback was the same... very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The product worked just as I expected. I&#x27;m African American and I just recently began using Redken products. I didn&#x27;t think they were intended for my hair, which is naturally tightly curly. I was pleasantly surprised and will continue to use Redken products.</li>
    <li> I have the used this product every time I shampoo my hair and it has left my hair soft, shiny and manageable!  I use it in conjunction with the compatible Diamond Oil for extra shine.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair feel. I use it instead of conditioner and my hair is so soft and shiny</li>
    <li> This stuff is pricey, but a little goes a long way towards restoring damaged hair and protecting dry hair from the elements and styling tools/products. I mix this half-and-half with a liquid conditioner (this one is a thick cream), and still it works wonders. It is worth every single penny. It smells good going on, but doesn&#x27;t leave an overpowering cloud of perfume after rinsing; I have allergies and am sensitive to that sort of thing. No worries there with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying it for my wife all the time. She loves it. She says her hair got much better. Since I do not use it myself, I&#x27;m unable to provide more specific details. However, she recommends it.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick and very moisturizing! Smells great and I use with the shampoo! Makes my hair bouncy, silky and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...</li>
    <li> did not come shrink wrapped, did not come with safety cover under the lid, looked like some was missing.</li>
    <li> Really excellent on my color treated hair. My hair is much softer and shines. Glad it was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> My hair is below my shoulders, straight and fine.  It has been highlighted and colored over the years so has lost its natural shine from within.  I have tried everything to get the shine back.  Redken &amp;#34;So Soft&amp;#34; with Avocado Oil made the most difference for softness and shine so I thought I would give this a try.  I shampooed my hair and got out of the shower and put this on after towel drying my hair.  I left it on for about 25 mins.. This produced even more natural shine and softness.  I could feel it as I rinsed my hair in the shower.  It was like silk.  I held a mirror up to see the results after blow drying and I saw a brilliant shine FROM WITHIN that has not been there for a long time.  My hair looks more sleek and a bit more flat but healthy instead of dry.  I can take my hair in my fingers and rub it back and forth and it is like silk even after blow drying.  I took the time to make this review because I saw results with just one application.</li>
    <li> As a fan of dying my hair I use this about every two weeks. It keeps my hair soft and manageable. There&#x27;s not a single knot in my hair for days.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I flat iron my hair 3 times a week, my hair is in good condition</li>
    <li> I was heartbroken over the discontinuation of Redkin Age Reset masque and this is a pretty good substitute.</li>
    <li> It works but I feel like I am putting on normal conditioner. I recommend Redken Extreme, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great. I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;All Soft&amp;#34; heavy cream and this one feels better on my hair. Gives it a great shine too.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this on my weave and it brings the dullness, dry frizzy look back to life. I repeat this will bring your hair back to life in a instance! I&#x27;m talking shiny, bouncy clean feeling awesome job Redken!!!  Happy Customer indeed:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a real difference yet. I will try leaving it on for a full fifteen minutes from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair treatment ever!!!!</li>
    <li> There is no denying that this is an amazing hair product if you need moisturization. I bought it to hydrate my hair and it does just that. I have healthy hair and wanted to maintain that health. After using this treatment I believe that if you have healthy hair already, this isn&#x27;t a necessity for you. You can find much less expensive options at the drugstore that will do just as good a job. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, though - it&#x27;s a great product. I believe that if you had damaged hair you would greatly benefit from this. I have hair down to my waist and the amount you get is very small, so to get the most out of this product I would slather my hair in coconut oil, put my hair in a pony tail, apply a small amount of this throughout the length of the pony tail (focusing on the ends), and then create a bun that would sit atop my head for a day or two to let the product soak in. My hair would feel very soft after I washed it out. If you have damaged hair you will love this, but if you have healthy hair, there are options that are more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I have thick, color damaged, heat damaged Chinese hair:  I dye my hair about 3 or 4 times a year.  I wash my hair an average of every 2 days (more or less depending on the season).  I use a hair dryer half the time, and a curling iron once or twice a week.  My hair rarely ever gets oily, even if I don&#x27;t wash it for 4 days in the winter, and even when I sweat a ton during my workouts.  So I need a fair amount of deep conditioning treatments to keep my hair borderline normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t going to perform miracles on anyone with damaged hair like mine, but my hair feels totally great afterward.  It&#x27;s soft and silky, easier to style, and a lot more shiny and swingy.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of deep conditioning treatments and this works as well as the best of them.  I think $19  (current price on amazon) is a really reasonable price for a product that offers positive results.</li>
    <li> Smooths out the frizz but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Redken makes great hair products and this is one of their best. I use this instead of regular conditioner by washing my hair when I first get in the shower and then putting the deep conditioner in for the remainder of my shower. Leaves my hair soft and manageable and rinses out cleanly. No residue or buildup.</li>
    <li> I was very unimpressed with this intensive treatment from Redken. I love All Soft Heavy Cream and hoped this would be as impressive. Sadly it did nothing for my hair at all. In fact it seemed to dry it out. My hair didnt appear to be shinier, softer, in better condition, less frizzy, or anything else. Also,the smell is nothing to write home about - unlike All Soft which leaves your hair smelling as if youd just been at a fancy salon. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this or buy it again.</li>
    <li> It only took a few uses to see the results of this product.  The cuticles of my hair have smoothed out.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairstylist and I love it.  My hair is shiny and alive again</li>
    <li> best Redken product ever</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as expected. Thanks !</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted and expected :) No problems whatsoever</li>
    <li> not as impressed with this line its not as great as it was made out to be , I have bleached hair and since I have used it like 4 times now I have notice a lot of hair coming out , this of course if the total package shampoo condition an this once a week</li>
    <li> I have naturally 4a curly hair. I used this for the first time yesterday after shampooing. It went on very smooth and has a nice consistency. I left it on my hair for an hour under a plastic cap. When I rinsed it out my hair was a little bit softer but this did not provide a lot of slip. At first I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of this treatment but after combing my hair today I had considerably less breakage. Because of that I will probably keep this in rotation.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my hair so soft! It is definitely the best thing I&#x27;ve come across for reducing frizz and making my curls more manageable.</li>
    <li> I love it, great for my hair.</li>
