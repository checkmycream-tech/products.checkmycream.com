      <li>I just wish the set would come with more clippers...</li>
      <li>I felt like a freak of nature, and ended up spending most of the night in the bathroom drinking vodka tonics until I didn&#x27;t remember if I even *had* hair, let alone what it looked like.</li>
      <li>love that there is a variety of sizes and the butterfly clips are great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Second, the clips hold the roller wonderfully.</li>

      <li>I love</li>
      <li>The arm that converts this set from a horizontal to a vertical one is ingenious.</li>
      <li>More than I wanted to spend, but you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to look like a sexy Sophia Vergara for the party after all.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to find a hot setter that I was happy with.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and a great deal of it - in order to properly curl in sections I need much more than fifteen curlers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great, leave my hair soft and 00 cero  frizz..</li>
      <li>It is well worth it to pay for good hot rollers!</li>
      <li>I got these after my hair stylist suggested I get a set for easy hair styling.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and to store also.</li>
      <li>I have hair that sets easily and retains curls, so it&#x27;s not me.</li>
      <li>amazing product, i have never had such effortless gorgeous bouncey hair before.</li>
      <li>Converts from a horizontal to a vertical hair setter  Dual split vertical cover for easy access  </li>
      <li>This setter is for me, hands down, perfect.</li>
      <li>heat quickly, have a good variety of rollers and the clips are light-years better than the old metal pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These curlers, a little mousse, and finish with with a nice comb through hair spray holds great for me.</li>
      <li>but since there ceramic and better for my hair its worth using them.  </li>
      <li>It does give a smooth, no frizzy, look.</li>
      <li>They get hot!!</li>
      <li>Let curls cool for perhaps another two minutes - spray, tousle lightly</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length very fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>but the teeth are long and they often get bent and don&#x27;t mesh perfectly which isn&#x27;t really a problem unless you&#x27;re super anal like me</li>
      <li>I love the qty of large size rollers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also cool looking</li>
      <li>I had an important work party to attend and was excited to use these rollers so I could be a hot, bombin&#x27; babe.</li>
      <li>It is just the thing for a quick hair do before you run out the door.  </li>
      <li>I love the look of hair rollers (not actually on, but the way the hair looks after), but these fried the heck out of my previously lovely locks.</li>
      <li>I quickly took out the rollers to see broken-off singed chunks of hair all over my head.</li>
      <li>You need to move quick.</li>
      <li>All in all for a girl with a LOT of hair with pretty good volume, they make curling my hair a much more viable option than it previously was when I had to use a curling iron, put it up and set it once</li>
      <li>and I immediately spent a good hour or so trying it out.</li>
      <li>These are almost cool to the touch when they&#x27;re supposed to be hot.</li>
      <li>Maybe they are just for the professional, I surely had no luck with them.</li>
      <li>and you get a much more natural curl right off the bat</li>
      <li>so well if I had fine hair, but they do great for my long and coarse hair.</li>
      <li>I am (vainly) willing to pay to get a very HOT roller.     </li>
      <li>I have long hair &amp; I roll my hair before makeup &amp; when my 10 min makeup at the most is finished, down they come with beautiful curls as the result.</li>
      <li>Walk right out of the house looking like</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s notable to mention that the non ionic Babyliss set I purchased from Folica had a huge note plastered on the cover which stated not to use the setter with the cover closed.</li>
      <li>The curlers are easy to work with, has a &amp;#34;Hi and Low &amp;#34; setting which heats up quickly, takes up very little counter space, and is attractive.</li>
      <li>It took some practice, and some products designed for ultimate hold for fine hair, used in conjunction with these rollers do it all!  </li>
      <li>Once up I blast the curlers with my hair dryer on the high setting to set the curls and then let them cool while up before taking the curlers out.  </li>
      <li>They get extremely hot very fast.</li>
      <li>These seem like normal curlers &amp; nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for years.  </li>
      <li>They get HOT, and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the downside to the rollers is that they get so hot that they burn you a bit - and there is nowhere to put your fingers on the roller</li>
      <li>The curlers were so hot, I  couldn&#x27;t touch or pull them off of the rods.  </li>
      <li>But since I need a hot setter in order for it to curl my hair, I don&#x27;t mind the fact that the ends get a bit hot.</li>
      <li>I have been using hot rollers off and on for over 40 years</li>
      <li>HOT for my fingers.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get quit as hot as steam rollers.</li>
      <li>With this setter, they stay exactly where I put them.</li>
      <li>First, I purchased the  [[ASIN:B00007M0CP Conair Xtreme</li>
      <li>I have been using these rollers for several years and they are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Hot temperature setting is really hot for those of us who need it  </li>
      <li>They just did not get hot.</li>
      <li>Besides this was actually only $4.00 more than the lower end 30 roller Babyliss at Folica.</li>
      <li>30 roller set is just better than the smaller 20 roller sets  </li>
      <li>I have (HAD) very long, very fine hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product came in and it was everything is said it was.. The service was prompt and the product great..</li>
    <li> I purchased these rollers a few weeks ago and am seriously thinking about sending them back. I used them on 3 different occasions and they did not give me the results I was looking for. The main issue I have with them is that they do not get very hot, which prevents them from curling the hair properly. I was only able to get loose waves and they only lasted a few hours, even with using a maximum hold hairspray. The other issue I have is that even though there are 30 rollers in the set, they only provide you with 15 roller clips, so I had to buy extras. For the price I paid these rollers should have performed a lot better. I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> Me too, girl friend, I was misguided by the [...] reviews. These rollers are bad news, for me, anyway. The one thing they do good, is removing your finger prints, if inclined to do so. They get hot!! The actual roller measurement is misleading because they measure the end cap and not the rolling surface where the curl is made. They are concaved )( like this, so the curler is at least a size smaller. The rollers are not smooth or flocked to hold tight. They have these little triangular nubs all around the roller base and my curls come out all bent and funky with dents and I use perm papers on the ends of my hair before I roll it up so I do not get those bent, fishtailed effect when removed. I can only imagine how bad my curls would be without end papers to protect them a little from the nubs. Do not get me started on the clamp type clip to hold the roller in place. I have been using hot rollers off and on for over 40 years and I prefer the metal U shaped clips that produce a dentless curl. The clamps have sooo many thin fingers that I pick up all kinds of hair I don&#x27;t want in the curl, especially in the back, where I can not see, and many dents are left with these. I wanted one set of rollers to do my hair and with thirty rollers, I thought I found my perfect set. These are now in the closet, collecting dust, and I broke out my three sets of cheaper rollers that are large, like I need and are far superior to the expensive Professional set by Babyliss. Maybe they are just for the professional, I surely had no luck with them.</li>
    <li> The product was what I expected it to be and unfortunately I had to return it.  However, the service from the seller was excellent!a</li>
    <li> Loved the varitiy, BUT, very slow to heat up and quit working after less than two years of occasional use. I&#x27;d advise you to keep shopping or soon you&#x27;ll be back shopping, just like me.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for years.  After returning from a brief time with short hair, I purchased these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They heat quickly, have a good variety of rollers and the clips are light-years better than the old metal pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value if you use everyday.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE OTHER PEOPLE STATED...IT JUST DOESNT HEAT THE ROLLERS WELL...AND CURLS DONT LAST...NOT ENOUGH CLIPS...TOO BAD...I TOO WENT ON A RECOMMENDATION FROM YOU TUBE.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my fiance back in sept.  now come March she is still in love with it</li>
    <li> I have shoulder blade long, medium fine hair. I got these after my hair stylist suggested I get a set for easy hair styling. These babies really do work. My only issue with them is that there is no indicator to tell you if they are hot or not. My stylist also suggested applying mousse to the damp hair for extra curl holding power.</li>
    <li> These rollers are not worth the money they don&#x27;t get hot enough which is the biggest thing for hot rollers. I purchased these for myself I&#x27;am a profesional hairdresser and thought highly of babybliss products now not so much,</li>
    <li> \\&quot;BaByliss Pro\\&quot; does a good job in curling the hair and giving it body.  It does not give tight curls nor make the hair look \\&quot;curly\\&quot;.  It does give a smooth, no frizzy, look. It is just the thing for a quick hair do before you run out the door.  To maintain the look for the next day, you must roll the hair before going to bed.  Two negative issues I have are (1) it is a bit pricey and (2) it does not come with 30 hair clips. I bought additional clips that work well.  However, I do like it and I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the BaByliss pro curlers because it had 30 rollers and since i have long hair i have to use 2 sets of rollers for my hair. I researched the rollers and found several different options. I decided to try then to eliminate using 2 sets of curlers daily. I wasnt impressed and would not recommend the curlers  to anyone. Poor curl and didnt last all day. I am back to using my old rollers that curl my hair and keep it all day.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to find a hot setter that I was happy with. First, I purchased the  [[ASIN:B00007M0CP Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]] from Amazon, which has gone up to $36.40 from the $22.77 I paid for it last week. One of the main reasons for that purchase was that it was and still is being advertised on here as an ionic set, which it is NOT. This problem was taken care of by Amazon to my complete satisfaction, however, in my rush to \\&quot;judgement\\&quot;, I then ordered the [[ASIN:B001AMSAAY BaByliss Pro BABHS30S Ceramic Instant Heat 30-Roller Hair Set, Varied]]from Folica for $59.95 &amp; free shipping plus a free compact curling iron. It was $10.00 more than what Amazon is charging, but without checking on the model numbers and stupidly trusting Folica (my 1st purchase with them and my last), I read their description which clearly states that this set was also ionic. WRONG. I admit that I actually liked that setter, but having an ionic setter is important to me, as it&#x27;s less likely to damage the hair. Any heat appliance causes damage to the hair cuticle, and even though the manufacturers of all these technologically advanced appliances (ionic, tourmaline, etc) claim they are gentle to the hair, according to my stylist the ionic ones are the better ones to buy, especially if used on a regular basis. Thus my obsession and frustration in obtaining an ionic setter that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune and also had above average customer reviews on Amazon. My old Clairol one from 20 years ago finally died and I needed a replacement.     Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t too pleased to open the box from Folica to see that the Babyliss I ordered was not ionic. I emailed them immediately, wanted a refund in full, with return shipping paid for, as this was clearly false advertising on their part. Getting a refund with them was a nightmare. They did NOT want to pay for return shipping. Had to fight for it. They did not want to have UPS come to my home to pick the package up as Amazon always does. I&#x27;m disabled and had to have my son help me bring the package down to a UPS shipping center. Folica refuses to take blame for the misleading advertising and still has not changed their description, so buyer beware when shopping with them.     After returning the setter to Folica, I did some research (which I should have done before, I know) and found out that Babyliss was bought out by the Conair Corporation. So I swore I would not shell out big bucks for another Babyliss. Not if Conair offered something similar and cheaper under the Conair brand label. However, I poured through review after review on here. According to fellow customers, Remington was rated the worst, and other setters had problems with clips, or they didn&#x27;t get hot enough to set the hair, the covers were chintzy and busted off, or the clips would fall right out of the hair..and on and on. I realized that all the other setters had problems I wasn&#x27;t willing to deal with, so I spent the money and purchased this Babyliss one. I did a lot of comparison shopping in regard to the price. Amazon was THE least expensive out of everyone, especially since we have the Prime shipping, which meant it was free 2 Day shipping. For example, Folica (ugh) is charging $79.95 for this setter. It cost me $63.90 here at Amazon! No brainer. Other stores had similar pricing as Folica and most charged to ship it.     This setter is for me, hands down, perfect. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey for me. More than I wanted to spend, but you get what you pay for I guess. This setter heats up in about 5 minutes, which is a little slower than the Conair one I had purchased, but I can wait the few more minutes. The arm that converts this set from a horizontal to a vertical one is ingenious. It saves so much space on my vanity to have this set up vertically. It&#x27;s also cool looking I have to admit. The sturdy double doors open up to just a plethora of rollers. The sizes range from jumbo to small and if you have long hair, which I do,this is important. The jumbo rollers really are, jumbo. The large rollers on this set are larger than the so called large rollers on other sets. On all the other setters, I don&#x27;t even use the small size rollers, as they are useless for my head of hair. It&#x27;s notable to mention that the non ionic Babyliss set I purchased from Folica had a huge note plastered on the cover which stated not to use the setter with the cover closed. That means you have to open the cover on the setter before turning it on. I don&#x27;t know what will happen if you forget to do that, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to find out. With this setter, they direct you to keep the split cover doors closed while heating as the negative ions pour over the rollers.     Rolling my thick, coarse hair was easy with these rollers. They get HOT, and the stay cool ends are not exactly \\&quot;cool\\&quot; so you do have to be careful not to burn your fingers. But since I need a hot setter in order for it to curl my hair, I don&#x27;t mind the fact that the ends get a bit hot. The claw clips are better than any other type of clips I&#x27;ve ever used. With the Conair, they always seem to fall down one complete \\&quot;roll\\&quot; after I&#x27;ve positioned the clip around the roller and my hair. Still doable, but not perfect. With this setter, they stay exactly where I put them. Not sure if they would stay in place so well if I had fine hair, but they do great for my long and coarse hair. My hair is difficult and always has been. Hard to flat iron, won&#x27;t take highlights or color very well, and hard to curl. I need high temps and this set delivers. If I want more of a wave, I just leave the rollers in for a few minutes. For a soft, sexy, messy beach hair I leave them in longer and after letting the hair cool down after removing the rollers, I simply use my fingers to rake out the curls. I also use a rubber vented brush and have brushed them out. This creates less defined curls and more of a wavy look. I&#x27;ve found using a regular hair brush makes my newly curled hair poofy and big and I&#x27;m not really in to big hair. My only complaint with this setter is that they only give you 15 clips for a 30 roller set. I&#x27;m not sure why these manufacturers do this. Seems silly to me. I can get 3/4 of my hair done with the 15 clips, then I have to start unrolling the 1st rollers I put in so I can use those clips.     So in a nutshell-  Pros of this setter and getting it at Amazon-  From $15-$30 cheaper at Amazon than other online stores  Ionic and Ceramic   Soft Claw type Clips are one size fits all and stay in place  Dual temp switch, low, high plus off with red LED light when is use   Hot temperature setting is really hot for those of us who need it  Converts from a horizontal to a vertical hair setter  Dual split vertical cover for easy access  Can keep covers closed while on, without fear of damaging the setter  Larger roller sizes than other setters  8 jumbo, 8 large, 8 medium &amp; 6 small rollers, suitable for ALL hair lengths  Color coded rollers make it easier to return rollers to setter after use  30 roller set is just better than the smaller 20 roller sets  Innovative design looks great on your vanity!  Uses posts to heat rollers, not the flimsy slide bars that the Conair set uses  Cloth sturdy drawstring bag provided for clips  One year warranty, they will repair or replace any unit which is defective one year from date of purchase    Cons  Needs to come with 30 clips  Cool touch ends are not exactly cool when setter is set to high  I&#x27;d prefer the soft, flocked type rollers, over the hard plastic ones (but that just takes time to get used to, still not bad though)        I give this setter 5 stars. It took me three setters, a lot of aggravation and going through and reading every single review before settling on this setter and I am very happy with it. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Not sure if it will last 20 years like my old Clairol set did but nothing seems to last that long anymore. Hope this review helps the next person, who like me, is obsessed with hair and hair care products. I say even if you are on a budget, splurge and get yourself this professional setter. In the long run I think you will be happier. Besides this was actually only $4.00 more than the lower end 30 roller Babyliss at Folica. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> After countless disappointments with hair setters, most recently the dreadful 20 roller \\&quot;ion shine\\&quot; set by Conair, I am absolutely thrilled with this hair setter. It was given to me as a gift and I immediately spent a good hour or so trying it out. With the proper product and a few shots of hairspray, I finally had the results I wanted. My only complaint, as with every hair setter, is why, oh why do they only give you fifteen clips? I have very fine hair, and a great deal of it - in order to properly curl in sections I need much more than fifteen curlers.  I am very happy with this product. For light waves I can set the heat to low, and for long-lasting curls I can put the set on high and leave the curlers in longer. It&#x27;s extremely convenient in that it stands vertical and can be used on dry or damp hair. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> amazing product, i have never had such effortless gorgeous bouncey hair before. Recommend for people who have issues with volume. I just put it in do my makeup and take it out. Walk right out of the house looking like i curled out my hair</li>
    <li> I loved that these rollers were vertically oriented and that there were lots of sizes and lots of rollers.  I hated that they took a long time to heat up.  I purchased these rollers on July 20 and on September 9 of the same year they stopped working.  For the price I paid, I thought they would last a very long time.</li>
    <li> They shipped me the wrong product! they should not advertise for something they do not have in stock...I got the real rollers from flat iron experts and i would give them and the product 5 stars! Those rollers are unbelievable! I just wish the set would come with more clippers...but they are awesome!</li>
    <li> I have tried many items to create the type curls that I want. Babyliss did it!  Easy to use and to store also.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m torn between the 3 star \\&quot;it&#x27;s ok\\&quot; and the four star \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; honestly this is my first set of hot rollers other than a really cheap set I bought at target that didn&#x27;t work AT ALL a couple years back and threw out not long after, so I don&#x27;t have much expertise in how other brands or styles of rollers measure against these.  I did some research and saw that the BaByliss rollers were one of the top rated/reviewed/recommended brand next to the Caruso steam rollers and decided to splurge and give them a try.  I have a lot of hair too so the 30 roller set was appealing and I definitely had to purchase additional hair clips to accompany them as they only provide you with 15 or whatnot.    This is what I found:    The curl only holds if you use them on the high setting on slightly damp hair.  You don&#x27;t want your hair too wet or it won&#x27;t dry once in the roller but just barely damp.  What works best for me is to blow dry my hair till it&#x27;s just slightly damp and/or use a spray bottle to slightly moisten hair before putting it up in the roller.  Once up I blast the curlers with my hair dryer on the high setting to set the curls and then let them cool while up before taking the curlers out.  At first my hair is crazy curled (super cute and springy looking but I have a lot of hair and it gets BIG, I usually clip it or head band it back for the first day) but it looks awesome the second and third day as it starts to calm down and fall.  I&#x27;ve tried them on dry hair and you get a much more natural curl right off the bat but they fall out within a couple hours even with hairspray.  I still haven&#x27;t perfected the natural loose curl look that holds without going through that first day of super curly hair.      Also, the clips that come with the set are really flimsy.  They do hold the rollers and hence get the job done but the teeth are long and they often get bent and don&#x27;t mesh perfectly which isn&#x27;t really a problem unless you&#x27;re super anal like me (I always make sure they are closed correctly when not in use w/o any of the prongs in the wrong slots) but the ones you can buy as additional are really strong and are thicker plastic.  The only drawback of the clip style is that it does cause your hair to kink towards the root where the roller was placed, but I don&#x27;t really see any good way around that when using hot rollers in the first place other than using hair accessories to minimize initial appearance.    All in all for a girl with a LOT of hair with pretty good volume, they make curling my hair a much more viable option than it previously was when I had to use a curling iron, put it up and set it once and I&#x27;ve got curls for days, so I&#x27;m happy.  4 stars it is.</li>
    <li> I plan on returning it.  It may be a good product for others, but not for my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look good</li>
    <li> The curlers are easy to work with, has a &amp;#34;Hi and Low &amp;#34; setting which heats up quickly, takes up very little counter space, and is attractive. Buying additional clips for the curlers is easy enough through a beauty store. The size variety gives me the options I need. These curlers, a little mousse, and finish with with a nice comb through hair spray holds great for me. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a lemon or not, but I would not recommend this product. I tried hard to give it a shot, but even after the product is plugged in for an hour it still never heats my rollers properly. I have hair that sets easily and retains curls, so it&#x27;s not me. These are almost cool to the touch when they&#x27;re supposed to be hot. Not happy at all, and since I waited too long to return the product, I&#x27;m stuck with an expensive set of crap rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own risk, but make sure they have a good return policy where you purchase this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 6/10/12 - I have to commend Conair customer service, they agreed to take my product back and send me a replacement. I had to wait 8 weeks and pay for shipping, but I didn&#x27;t mind. I got the new generation of this model and it still heats unevenly. I had them plugged in for 30 minutes, some of the rollers heated well, others barely got hot. My hair didn&#x27;t curl properly and I still had to use a curling iron to fix the mistakes. Not to mention... I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon is charging 155.00 for this set??? I paid 50!! DO NOT BUY THIS SET FOR $155.00, it is not worth that much, trust me!</li>
    <li> I styled my hair with mousse and set the curls with hairspray after I removed the rollers.  The curl lasted about 2 hours when my hair promptly fell flat.</li>
    <li> Buy these and you won&#x27;t need to buy any other form of volume/curling products.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is a variety of sizes and the butterfly clips are great!&lt;br /&gt;I rave about these to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I will buy these again if mine ever stop working!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for hair rollers, look no further.  These are the best available!  I have nothing negative to say about them.  They are PERFECT in every way!</li>
    <li> The one good thing about these curlers is that they have a ton of different sizes and the unit stands up, which takes up less space.  However, my hair really wasn&#x27;t curly after I took the curlers out.  It was just sort of dry.  I prefer the velvet rollers.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are the best I have ever owned. They get extremely hot very fast. I have long hair &amp; I roll my hair before makeup &amp; when my 10 min makeup at the most is finished, down they come with beautiful curls as the result. I love that they sit upright taking up only a small space on my vanity. Because of the many rollers, the case is larger than your average Hot Roller case but because of how great they are, I actually packed them in a suitcase &amp; took them on a week long trip to Phoenix recently. If they hold up, this will be my last set of rollers to buy. Keeping my fingers crossed as I really really like them.</li>
    <li> HOT for my fingers. Difficulty putting on and have them stay!</li>
    <li> It is well worth it to pay for good hot rollers! First, these rollers get way hotter than my Conair rollers, which means the curl will stay in MUCH longer. Second, the clips hold the roller wonderfully. I will be able to do housework, put on makeup, etc. while wearing these, which is what I wanted. My Conair rollers came with the wire \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape holders and the curlers would just fall out if I tried to move. Third, I have extremely long, thick hair, and I didn&#x27;t even need all the clips given (15). I am assuming this is why they only give 15 clips. I agree that it is a bit strange to give 30 different rollers and only 15 clips, but I suppose that it is because you will choose the different sizes you want that day and therefore, won&#x27;t need all of them. I&#x27;d say the downside to the rollers is that they get so hot that they burn you a bit - and there is nowhere to put your fingers on the roller that is \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or made of a different material. You need to move quick. It is price I am (vainly) willing to pay to get a very HOT roller.     PS - The curl and SHINE you get from these is REAL.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length very fine straight hair. I just want some all-day body on top without the two hour prep work every morning! It took some practice, and some products designed for ultimate hold for fine hair, used in conjunction with these rollers do it all!  I ditched the clips that came with it. The \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; wire clips don&#x27;t impact the lower edge of the curl as much. The wires also allow you to twist the base of your curl for a little more lift if you spray at the root for volume. Barely damp towel dried hair - loaded with soft control curl hold product, roll hair - put on makeup and outfit, spray high control product between the rollers and let it dry about two minutes. (Perfume and powder touch up) Gently unwind your curls working with the direction of the roll. Let curls cool for perhaps another two minutes - spray, tousle lightly and Oh MAN - ultra-femme all day, you&#x27;ll be tempted to add smouldering kohl eyeliner! Thank you BaByliss Pro!</li>
    <li> I have been using these rollers for several years and they are my favorite.  Personally, I would prefer more of the smaller rollers.  The clips that come with them are USELESS, I use the pins that came with another type roller and they work fine.</li>
    <li> Just the fact alone that it stands up and takes less counter space is reason enough to buy this great hair roller set.  I think the rollers are easy to roll hair in and the small teeth hold in the roller.  I have chin length hair and it sets it perfectly.</li>
    <li> Too bulky and heavy for travel. The Conair sets are lighter and just as effective.</li>
    <li> Yes, I like the curler set really well. They don&#x27;t get quit as hot as steam rollers. I have to adjust to that. I like the amount of curlers but unfortunately I will have to purchase some more of the clips as there is not enough for every curler. So I give only four stars. It did come packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have been using my first Babyliss for a little over a month and it surpasses any hotrollers I have used before. The curls stay in. It heats up quietly and fairly fast. I am impressed. Worth the extra money compared to other products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this curler set for only a year and a half, and it worked great until yesterday.  I plugged it in, and when I went back to roll my hair in about 15 minutes, the curlers had melted onto the rods.  It was set on the low heat setting.  The curlers were so hot, I  couldn&#x27;t touch or pull them off of the rods.  I had to use a cloth to pull the curlers off of the rods.  They had actually started melting.  This could have been a very dangerous situation. It certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the expense since it didn&#x27;t last very long, and there is a very big danger of overheating and melting.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Paid $188 for it on Amazon. wtf? Took 30 days to get to me (very late Xmas, thanks). I really though this would work well. For one, the packaging had obviously been opened before. Anyway, the curlers put off a horrific burning smell. But even through that, my wife tried it twice. Both times they did not heat up correctly. They just did not get hot. So - it did not curl. This seems to be a recurring theme among commenters on this product. I think they need to go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I love these. they leave me with beautful curls,and they look great sitting on my makeup desk..and the fact that you get 30 rollers was a deal maker for me.I dont have to do half of my head at a time..</li>
    <li> I love the qty of large size rollers.  My hair is a little thick and so I like to use small amount hair per roller.  It seems the curls are not as set as I would like them to be but since there ceramic and better for my hair its worth using them.  My last set lasted 25 years and I have having issues letting the old set go.  They are still working just not enough rollers.</li>
    <li> Really like these hot. curlers best ones I have used yet. Curl lasts all day. I recommend these to all that use electric curlers</li>
    <li> Great.. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommended..&lt;br /&gt;Works great, leave my hair soft and 00 cero  frizz.. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I love the look of hair rollers (not actually on, but the way the hair looks after), but these fried the heck out of my previously lovely locks. I have (HAD) very long, very fine hair. I had an important work party to attend and was excited to use these rollers so I could be a hot, bombin&#x27; babe. I put them on the lowest setting, then carefully rolled my hair up into them. Ten minutes later, I smelled a horrible burning-hair smell. I quickly took out the rollers to see broken-off singed chunks of hair all over my head. I had a feeling I wasn&#x27;t going to look like a sexy Sophia Vergara for the party after all. I tried brushing through my hair, but more burned pieces broke off. I was left looking as if I was wearing a witch&#x27;s wig. Yep, it was that bad. The people at the work party giggled and pointed like middle-school bullies. I felt like a freak of nature, and ended up spending most of the night in the bathroom drinking vodka tonics until I didn&#x27;t remember if I even *had* hair, let alone what it looked like. Never again will I use these rollers. I was unable to return them, so my kids now use them as monster-truck tires for their toy cars.</li>
    <li> These seem like normal curlers &amp; nothing special.  Not worth the extra money I paid.</li>
    <li> It sums - it has one temperature - whatever it decides - we will never buy another one. It Sucks!</li>
