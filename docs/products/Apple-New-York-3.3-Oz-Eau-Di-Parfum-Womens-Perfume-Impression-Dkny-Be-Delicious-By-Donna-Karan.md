    <li> I can not stand this scent! It does NOT smell anything like DKNY be delicious! It smells cheap, disgusting, bad! Do not be fooled, this is horrible!</li>
    <li> Item was received quickly and in good condition. Fragrance is pleasant and much like the real one. Fragrance lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my mom as a present ....she had her heart set on it so i wanted to make her happy, needless to say she loved it. We got it just on time like expected, and smelled awesome!</li>
    <li> The product arrived, broken, the perfume did not smell like the actual product does in stores.It had to be a fake/imposter perfume. I contacted the seller regarding a refund and did not hear back from her.Very dissapointed in the service. I paid for a product that was defective and broken and was not provided a refund.</li>
    <li> Its a fake not the real perfume</li>
    <li> Smells floral instead of like green apple, sprays like a squirt gun (as one user before stated) and is absolutely NOT Dkny. I bought it as a gift for someone close who&#x27;s just gotten out of an abusive relationship -believing it was Dkny- and got quite a shock when I opened it. Now I sincerely regret not first looking at the reviews... They don&#x27;t deserve this knockoff rubbish and neither do you.</li>
    <li> I got more than expected! Smells great and lasts long. I ordered one and I got three and two others were different sense which was awesome and they even came with lotions! they smell amazing but nothing what I thought I ordered but hey I got more so definitely worth it</li>
    <li> The product was as shown and arrived quite swiftly. The package was appropriate for the perfume I liked it much</li>
    <li> I love this fragance. It lasts all day. Besides, every body who is around me like it too much also.</li>
    <li> I never smelled the original, but this impression is very pleasant and light, good for spring and summer.  It may not last long on me, but such fragrances usually don&#x27;t at the best of times.</li>
    <li> The ad was not very clear that this was a knock off. I bought it expecting DKNY, not off-brand impression perfume. Butttt it still smells alright.</li>
    <li> Smells just like DKNY Apple Be Delicious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. Nobody will be able to tell that it is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;When I orderd it I actually thought it was DKNY, and did not realize it wasn&#x27;t until I checked my order online.</li>
    <li> This perfume claims to be DKNY Be Delicious and it is not. This is a knock off!!! It smells really similar to it but it wears of in minutes. When I tried to spray it on myself its not a mist like it should be. I sprays out like a squirt gun leaving marks on clothing. I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> WELL.. WAS SOME WHAT DISSAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE. ARRIVED ON TIME. ALTHOUGH PRODUCT LID WAS BROKEN.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO FRAGRENCE WASNT TRUE TO WHAT IVE EXPERIENCED BEFORE. MAYBE NEXT TIME WILL BE BETTER.</li>
    <li> Uhhh I am going to \\&quot;read the fine print\\&quot; next time. Quickly skimmed the page when I was looking for the DKNY perfume and saw this price and bought it. Didn&#x27;t know it was a knock off. Packaging is just like the original.... thats about it. I hate the smell. Smells like rubbing alcohol. So annoyed right now.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the item I ordered.  I received an unauthentic version.  The picture is does not represent what I actually received.  Will never order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price ... perfue for Each of the women who have received a gift. I loved the aroma and that they do not know its price is the perfect gift ...</li>
    <li> First one came in broken the second got here in record time in great condition and excellent smell love this perfume will deffenetly repurchase</li>
    <li> Its not DKNY as I thought it was, but that&#x27;s what I get using my phone and the app instead of waiting until I got home to actually get the item I really wanted.  Its close to the scent, but no cigar.  It fades fast, and doesn&#x27;t exactly smell the same.  That&#x27;s what I get for buying knock offs..</li>
    <li> I thought this product was the real perfume and not a knock off of it and it&#x27;s nothing close to the real things. I gave it to an 11 year old friends daughter. I will read better next time. I didn&#x27;t realize they sold knock offs like this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> ES MUY RICO, YO LO HE USADO MUCHAS VECES, CUMPLE MIS EXPECTATIVAS PARA NO SER ORIGINAL, HUELE IDÉNTICO A LA VERSIÓN ORIGINAL</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, the first time i got it, it was a bday gift from my boyfriend, when i brought it on amazon it was a gift to my mother because she loved the way it smelled. would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the real product, this impression misses by a mile.  Happily spent more to buy the genuine scent for my wife, there is a huge difference.</li>
    <li> when i saw the price for this perfume i could not go wrong it would have cost more any other place.  my daughter loves this scent  it makes a great gift.  thanks to everyone there  keep up the great job</li>
    <li> Wow, this one was soooooo bad! It&#x27;s a total rip-off of DKNY. Not even remotely close! And I had to throw it away because every time I wore it (even the tiniest dab) I got raging headaches! Horrible- DO NOT BUY!</li>
