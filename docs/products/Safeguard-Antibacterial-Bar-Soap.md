      <li>because honestly my skin seems clearer and cleaner, and with 24 bars of soap under the sink, I won&#x27;t be shopping for soap again for a year.</li>
      <li>I liked the soaps with aloe for my allergies</li>
      <li>great clean smelling soap.</li>
      <li>but I got what I wanted, at a fair price, no shipping costs and my husband is set to be sparkly clean for more than a year!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have any comments regarding whether it is effective or not, but so far it has a nice smell that is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best bath soap on the market!</li>
      <li>I have pets in my house, and it&#x27;s very important to me to use antibacterial soap to wash hands with.</li>
      <li>Going to order more.</li>
      <li>Hence the 3 star rating which means it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>glad I found this soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a no brainer for me, and as a result I now price-compare most of my household items to see if it benefits me to \\&quot;Just Prime</li>
      <li>Time was when a bar lasted months and months, but now it&#x27;s more like weeks and weeks.</li>
      <li>It was better than buying in the store.</li>
      <li>I love this soap</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Quite pleased with this purchase</li>
      <li>Safeguard used to be my favorite soap.  </li>
      <li>Have used safeguard for many years.</li>
      <li>Time was when a bar lasted months and months, but now it&#x27;s more like weeks and weeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this was a picking error at the warehouse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite bath soap.  </li>
      <li>I have used this soap for many years.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS SOAP LEAVES NO FILM ON THE TUB OR YOUR BODY</li>
      <li>Size is appropriate.</li>
      <li>the savings made it worthwhile.</li>
      <li>Using Safeguard many years</li>
      <li>hopoe theres more cheaper.</li>
      <li>I love Safeguard, and I really love the price on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Most others have in the 0.30% range of triclocarban or triclosan as another soap uses.  </li>
      <li>I think Ivory is intended to be gentle and maybe good for a baby&#x27;s skin,  but keep it away from me!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Publix never puts Safeguard on sale for some reason and I&#x27;m glad to see more and more supermarket items available with amazon at a price lower than what I get at the store and with FREE Super Saver Shipping.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle.</li>
      <li>In this kind of soap, I like a mild scent, good lather,  antibacterial action, and making the skin feel clean without being &#x27;filmy&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Does not dry out my skin and cleans great.</li>
      <li>While I have allergies to some products, this one is fine for me and doesn&#x27;t seem too drying.</li>
      <li>Safeguard white, with aloe, is a great product.  </li>
      <li>but I was happy to try this again at the terrific price.</li>
      <li>Safeguard has been the primary soap bar used since 2002.</li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s free shipping,</li>
      <li>It kind of comes and goes in the stores, depending on what tie-in promotional deals they&#x27;re doing, Safeguard is one of the older brand names, but the soap works, and the smell is not over-powering, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon stocks it and at a reasonable price, I put it on Subscribe &amp; Save, and forget about it.  </li>
      <li>Mine and hers; manby pamby in one, and the original in the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mine and hers; manby pamby in one, and the original in the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Safeguard was an original.</li>
      <li>But this is a soap that does what soap should do, gets you clean, keeps you from smelling</li>
      <li>, what more can you ask for really?</li>
      <li>That was true throughout my service in the Navy.</li>
      <li>AND THEN SMELL THAT FRESH CLEAN SMELL</li>
      <li>I saved a tremendous amount over store pricing.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a bar soap a few years ago and loved the scent haven&#x27;t been able to find it ever since</li>
      <li>DOES NOT DRY HANDS OUT AS MOST SOAPS!</li>
      <li>It is easy on the skin and really helps fight bacteria.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and left your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It does melt/wash away rather quickly than other soaps, but for the price and the results, I am more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>After visiting five local stores and lots more in a town nearby, I was thankful that the soap my dad prefers was still available at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the fragrance anymore.  </li>
      <li>Back in High School, at the peak of the Vietnam war, let&#x27;s see how many years ago that is - more than my fingers and toes</li>
      <li>I guess it moisturizes as well, and my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel quite right to me after showering.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Safeguard always came in beige, until some engineer decided to change it and add a bunch of touchie feelie junk to it and make it white like 99.9% pure Ivory soap, and trendy with Aloe.</li>
      <li>GOT MYSELF A LARGE SUPPLY OF THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>We like it very much.</li>
      <li>It has kept our skin feeling soft, clean, and fresh.</li>
      <li>This also has a higher amount  of triclocarban 0.75% (the antibacterial ingredient).</li>
      <li>, life&#x27;s too short as it is to be spending more than you have to there.  </li>
      <li>How would she know, she probably wasn&#x27;t born until the first Iraqi war.</li>
      <li>This being the first time trying Safeguard</li>
      <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, Amazon sells this product in bulk and the price is much better than my local superstore.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s most likely why Safeguard can claim to eliminate 99% of bacteria.  </li>
      <li>I had my mom buy it for me to use after football practice; I got pretty ripe.</li>
      <li>but at first I thought &amp;</li>
      <li>How would she know, she probably wasn&#x27;t born until the first Iraqi war.</li>

    <li> Good antibacterial soap</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied for the safeguard i&#x27;ve purchased,it&#x27;s cheaper than in the store and usually theres no safeguard in the store anymore,that&#x27;s why i decided to buy in amazon &amp; it&#x27;s free shipping,hopoe theres more cheaper.</li>
    <li> I hate change. I&#x27;m old so it&#x27;s to be expected, I suppose. Back in High School, at the peak of the Vietnam war, let&#x27;s see how many years ago that is - more than my fingers and toes, I read about an \\&quot;antibacterial soap\\&quot; called Safeguard. Forty three years ago, antibacterial wasn&#x27;t a word you heard much. Now a days, everything it seems, including gasoline for the car, is listed as antibacterial. Safeguard was an original. I had my mom buy it for me to use after football practice; I got pretty ripe. It worked, and worked well. After starting to use Safeguard soap, I never used another brand for all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My health is above average. I have less colds and illnesses than people I work with. Generally, I use my sick days to get working on the honey-do lists, not to stay in bed. That was true throughout my service in the Navy. Bottled up in a nuclear submarine, playing cat and mouse with ruskie subs in the arctic during the Cold War, we tended to recycle a lot of illness around the crew. That&#x27;s another word that popped up in my lifetime; recycle. Pop used to come in glass bottles, and you had to return the bottles to get your deposit back, it worked well until the engineers decided to change things and use cheaper bottling materials. They still use the deposit system up in Michigan. Where was I, oh, on the submarine. I got less colds than my shipmates, and I attribute that to Safeguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safeguard always came in beige, until some engineer decided to change it and add a bunch of touchie feelie junk to it and make it white like 99.9% pure Ivory soap, and trendy with Aloe. Aloe, some green plant that is supposed to be good for you. Salad is good for you, it&#x27;s green, but I don&#x27;t know about this plant. Anyway, my wife wanted to try the white Safegurad, so we bought some. I don&#x27;t like it! It&#x27;s white. It should have been beige, and maybe that would make it tolerable. I really couldn&#x27;t use it because it dried my skin out badly. My wife loves it (thus the rating), and it doesn&#x27;t affect her. We now have two soap holders in the tub, one white and one beige. Mine and hers; manby pamby in one, and the original in the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of change, I wrote to the makers of Safeguard a couple years back and complained about their changing my soap. Having used it for over forty years now, I noticed that a bar wasn&#x27;t lasting very long. Time was when a bar lasted months and months, but now it&#x27;s more like weeks and weeks. Some young girl wrote back and swore up and down that the formula has never changed. How would she know, she probably wasn&#x27;t born until the first Iraqi war. Ever notice how we count our generations by wars? Where was I, oh yeah, weeks and weeks. It wasn&#x27;t until I went out to our farm house (we are pretty much living at the lake place now) and ran across some old toilet paper in the cupboard, that I discovered what changed. That roll of toilet paper looked huge to me. I took it to the lake and compared it with the roll we currently buy of the same brand. There is over one half inch difference in the width of the two rolls. Cost savings means less product, and a higher price. My Safeguard might be the same formula, but it&#x27;s not the same size. Sneaky little bast....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Safeguard is my soap. Has been for forty years, and will be until they stop making it, or I die. My wife likes this version.rating), and it doesn&#x27;t affect her. We now have two soap holders in the tub, one white and one beige.

    <li> My hubby was addicted to Irish Spring soap and I wanted him to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is the ONLY one he has liked from the MANY other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I like it too.  Clean, fresh smell and not very drying--compared to other antibacterial soap brands.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this soap.</li>
    <li> Publix never puts Safeguard on sale for some reason and I&#x27;m glad to see more and more supermarket items available with amazon at a price lower than what I get at the store and with FREE Super Saver Shipping. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> This is all we use and at a great value</li>
    <li> Got a great price on 24 bars that could not be beat.Does not dry out my skin like other soaps.Quite pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> triclocarban is capable of altering programmed gene expression,modulates gene regulation.Have used safeguard for many years.Have had and have health problems that mirror the studies.</li>
    <li> I have been using Safeguard for over 40 years. It is by far the best bath soap on the market!</li>
    <li> I dont find the deoderizing as good as it was or as good as when the bars&lt;br /&gt;are purchased in store.  why i do not know.  Could someone explain that to me?</li>
    <li> The products are good in quality! And the only reason I did not give 5 stars is that Amazon should offer a pack of Safeguard Soap in  different favor. Now I have to use the same favor of soap again and again and again and again... There are 24 of them...</li>
    <li> Made in Thailand explains why this soap is not the same as purchased locally here in a store. ALSO, being ripped-off as they are advertised as 4oz &amp; box states 3.2oz &amp; I think they are 2.5oz if that!!!&lt;br /&gt;VERY UPSET with this product.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS VENDOR!!!</li>
    <li> I think, this is the best hand soap there is! I have pets in my house, and it&#x27;s very important to me to use antibacterial soap to wash hands with. I find Safeguard to be what I need, - it&#x27;s very good and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands like other soaps do (and I wash my hands about 30-50 times a day, sometimes)!</li>
    <li> Using Safeguard many years and it&#x27;s one of the best soap for any case. High quality, long time usage. Going to order more.</li>
    <li> Safeguard Antibacterial Soap/Aloe/White is a great soap. It is easy on the skin and really helps fight bacteria. We like it very much. We are unable to use any other kind of soap on our skin for bathing.</li>
    <li> I always purchase this soap. It smells great and it is antibacterial. You get lots of bank for your buck with this product. Wort purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for many years.  It leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean, but not dry.  I buy it in bulk, so I never run out..</li>
    <li> This is still the best bath soap ever--and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried lots of others.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, Amazon sells this product in bulk and the price is much better than my local superstore.</li>
    <li> Safeguard has been the primary soap bar used since 2002. We used to purchase this at Target (seemingly the only chain that carried this in an 8-count) until I found the subscribe-and-save deal on Amazon that offered a coupon and a discount for way less than what I would purchase at Target. We use this soap religiously. It has kept our skin feeling soft, clean, and fresh. The scent that it leaves is very subtle and comforting--it almost reminds me of baby shampoo in the delicacy of the fragrance. It does melt/wash away rather quickly than other soaps, but for the price and the results, I am more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> I liked the soaps with aloe for my allergies the price was decent with prime shipping.</li>
    <li> After 40 years of using another brand, I found this to be a pleasant change. Also, it was priced much lower than I could find locally.</li>
    <li> 24 bars of soap for this price was a steal. Tired of constantly changing brands of soap as my supermarket had different sales, and ending up smelling like the reject end of the Old Spice plant, I went back and checked Amazon for the antibacterial soap brand that my father bought for years. As soon as the Safeguard arrived, I threw out the space age lufa that had come with my last bottle of &#x27;liquid soap&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did, because honestly my skin seems clearer and cleaner, and with 24 bars of soap under the sink, I won&#x27;t be shopping for soap again for a year.</li>
    <li> I just love this soap its antibacterial, smells good, a great price, and I feel good about using it  just cant find anything better.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it helps a lot with my sensitive skin. This is basically a STEAL! much cheaper than what i pay in the market or at Walmart. I love it</li>
    <li> Stars tell the story... AS advertised and described in listing. Color is correct. Size is appropriate. Easy to handle. Smells great. Delivered to me close to what I needed.</li>
    <li> My rating is more like 4.5 stars rounded off (an even number is rounded down, remember).  In this kind of soap, I like a mild scent, good lather,  antibacterial action, and making the skin feel clean without being &#x27;filmy&#x27;.  This soap delivers well, except for the last one.  I guess it moisturizes as well, and my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel quite right to me after showering.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a male thing.  I guess some men don&#x27;t want to apply lotions and other gunk to their skin as it may seem too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I can say about this soap is its scent:  it&#x27;s just right, without being too strong (like Irish Spring) or smelly like Ivory.  Ivory soap reeks, in my opinion, and has no deodorizing qualities whatsoever.  Combine its stinkiness with B.O., and you have a very noxious stench, indeed.  I think Ivory is intended to be gentle and maybe good for a baby&#x27;s skin,  but keep it away from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is also a decent buy and you get twenty-four bars of soap for your money.  For a single guy like me, I won&#x27;t be buying bath soap again for a long, long time!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it&#x27;s my go-to daily soap I love the white pack because it has aloe yet its hard to find the white packs in the store. Walmart carries it but thats about it. the other stores and pharmacies only carry the beige kind glad to find it here in a large pack no less. LOVE THE SCENT!</li>
    <li> Once again, Amazon saves the day. After visiting five local stores and lots more in a town nearby, I was thankful that the soap my dad prefers was still available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Safeguard white, with aloe, is a great product.  Nice smell, in addition to it&#x27;s antibacterial qualities. Receiving this product thru the \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program is wonderful.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re always looking for inexpensive soap to put in health kits that are distributed in disaster areas around the world.  We&#x27;re supposed to use 4-5 oz bars which are getting harder &amp; harder to find.</li>
    <li> It was better than buying in the store. The price was also better and the best part is I didn&#x27;t have to leave home&#x27;</li>
    <li> I opened the box and there were 3 loose bars (in their individual cardboard boxes) of soap in a plastic bag, instead of the 3 packs of 8-bars each that I expected from the description and picture. I&#x27;m sure this was a picking error at the warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I should have just used the return service when I realized they shipped me the wrong quantity but at first I thought &amp;#34;oh hell, I must have misunderstood the listing&amp;#34; and just opened the soap and used it. By the time I realized how much I&#x27;d overpaid and how wrong the order was, it was too late for a return because I&#x27;d opened the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just be aware - Amazon&#x27;s pickers might make this mistake and if you get the wrong product you should use the return mechanism and don&#x27;t be dumb like me and open the package!</li>
    <li> I saved a tremendous amount over store pricing.  Although I had to purchase a larger quantity the savings made it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SOAP LEAVES NO FILM ON THE TUB OR YOUR BODY</li>
    <li> This is an effective soap with a very pleasant scent.It lathers well and is easy to hold onto due to its hand  friendly shape.</li>
    <li> Safeguard basically makes this soap in two colors, white and beige (skin) color, I prefer the white, just seems soap should be white.  It kind of comes and goes in the stores, depending on what tie-in promotional deals they&#x27;re doing, Safeguard is one of the older brand names, but the soap works, and the smell is not over-powering, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon stocks it and at a reasonable price, I put it on Subscribe &amp; Save, and forget about it.  One less thing to run down at the grocery or Walmart, life&#x27;s too short as it is to be spending more than you have to there.  But this is a soap that does what soap should do, gets you clean, keeps you from smelling, what more can you ask for really?</li>
    <li> Safeguard used to be my favorite soap.  Now, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the fragrance anymore.  It&#x27;s me; not the soap.  Hence the 3 star rating which means it&#x27;s okay.  It does the job but appears to be drying to my skin now that I&#x27;m older.  This will be used in the Summer season when I&#x27;m gardening and more active and on and off in the Winter.  This also has a higher amount  of triclocarban 0.75% (the antibacterial ingredient). This is higher than other antibacterial soaps on the market.  Most others have in the 0.30% range of triclocarban or triclosan as another soap uses.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad but it&#x27;s most likely why Safeguard can claim to eliminate 99% of bacteria.  I did appreciate that the soap is white and not beige.  I also appreciated the terrific value.  If you like Safeguard, buy this!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t reorder due to the fragrance and the dryness factor but I was happy to try this again at the terrific price.</li>
    <li> I love Safeguard, and I really love the price on Amazon.  After using it, my skin feels clean and not dry.  I have tried other soaps, but i I always come back to Safeguard.  I buy it about once a year and it last about one year.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath soap.  Unfortunately, my supermarket no longer carries it, so I was able to buy a year&#x27;s supply on Amazon.  I ordered the white one, and I had previously used the yellow colored one.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the two.  While I have allergies to some products, this one is fine for me and doesn&#x27;t seem too drying.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 25 years as it seems to be one of the only brands that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  The big benefit for buying at Amazon is the price.  This is for 3 packs of soap, and the cheapest retailer around wants the same money for a single pack.  It&#x27;s a no brainer for me, and as a result I now price-compare most of my household items to see if it benefits me to \\&quot;Just Prime it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The last few bars of Safeguard I used leave me with a petroleum-like odor on my skin. Has anyone else noticed this? I wonder if they changed their formula or if there was mistake and/or a recall.</li>
    <li> This is the soap my husband really likes, don&#x27;t think it was much less expensive on Amazon but I got what I wanted, at a fair price, no shipping costs and my husband is set to be sparkly clean for more than a year!</li>
    <li> All my friends are asking me to order some for them. I would recommend this soap to anyone, very satisfied with this order.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY soap that one of my friends use, so I gave as a gift.  I&#x27;ve used this item several times in the past, but I now use other gels and body wash.</li>
    <li> Great product for bathing.. Does not dry out my skin and cleans great. Smells good too. I exercise allot so I need the best and this is it.</li>
    <li> Good bath and shower soap. It is as good as surgical prep soap it&#x27;s also sudsy.</li>
    <li> GOT MYSELF A LARGE SUPPLY OF THIS PRODUCT! WASH YOUR HANDS REAL GOOD ONCE AND THEN SMELL THAT FRESH CLEAN SMELL AND YOU WILL SEE! DOES NOT DRY HANDS OUT AS MOST SOAPS! HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Safeguard since 1966 because I like the aroma, the texture, the shape and the fact that it&#x27;s antibacterial.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find so I was really happy to see it on sale on Amazon.  I hope P&amp;G don&#x27;t discontinue it because ordering online was very convenient.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested that I buy this soap for its anti-bacterial qualities, and because I have a spreading rash, partly due to the heat and possible contamination from a fitness place I attend.  Just purchased a 12 bar package of 4 oz. bars (white, with aloe), currently on sale at Target for $6, which is 50 cents per bar.  It normally sells for $7.79, which is about 65 cents per bar, compared to Amazon&#x27;s price of $1.25 per bar.  Don&#x27;t have any comments regarding whether it is effective or not, but so far it has a nice smell that is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> great clean smelling soap. I purchased a bar soap a few years ago and loved the scent haven&#x27;t been able to find it ever since and i want it. this will suffice until then.</li>
    <li> This being the first time trying Safeguard I was very pleased with the soap. The smell is pleasant and left your skin feeling soft and smooth. Great price too!</li>
