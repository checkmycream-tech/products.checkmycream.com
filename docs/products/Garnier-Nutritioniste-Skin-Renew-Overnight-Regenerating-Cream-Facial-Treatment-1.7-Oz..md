      <li>This is one of my favorite skin creams...</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>in 1 nite my skin was softer and looked better.</li>
      <li>I have used another Garnier night cream before (the anti-wrinkle night cream), but switched to this one because it&#x27;s better..</li>
      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>love this product...not sure why they discontinued it</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>so my work for me but not for you :)</li>
      <li>love it, love it, love it...</li>
      <li>I am glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight and my skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed by any of the &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; overnight creams, but this one was the only one that really absorbed well.</li>
      <li>The consistency is light and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>thank you so much...!!!</li>
      <li>A nice smooth cream that makes my skin feel soft and smooth in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Feels light and fresh.</li>
      <li>but I did not see much change, perhaps I need to offer more than one bottle.</li>
      <li>it helps to quickly fade the marks on my face.</li>
      <li>I am new to this product but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>this cream really works fantastic....</li>
      <li>so I really can&#x27;t give an accurate review on whether its working for me or not</li>
      <li>it absorbs really quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for only 2 weeks, but really love how it makes my skin feel soft and look smooth...</li>
      <li>The long lush eyelashes that grow as a result of using this product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>Now if I can just find it cheap enough to apply to my legs ;)</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s reasonably priced and as good if not better than some of the products that you get from the department stores.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Actually I really like garnier products...</li>
      <li>I want to use it on my whole body.</li>
      <li>and i have had no issues with any blemishes in a while, which i&#x27;m giving some credit to this cream even, it really has helped even my skin out at night i think.</li>
      <li>the smell is also nice, not strong..</li>
      <li>i live in a dry climate and have tried many products.</li>
      <li>I was crushed when it was no longer available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>My skin really feels soft in the a.m.</li>
      <li>Other lotions can feel heavy or greasy but this one just feels pleasant.</li>
      <li>I would have bought out the entire online available products but shipping is charged on every SINGLE one ordered, not just a one-time charge for the shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years at night because it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
      <li>and I wake up with soft skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles but it helps keep dry spots moisturized.</li>
      <li>but at least try is the only way to find out :)</li>

<li> but I read all the reviews on here and let my hopes get a little too high.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been getting small lines on my forehead and slightly pronounced lines smile lines around my mouth-this product has helped reduce and diminish them.</li>
<li> After a long use, it will make your skin even drier.</li>
<li> I will recommend burst bee instead for your dry skin if you are thinking for a long term used.</li>
<li> I am currently using this product but I am not using I with other garnier products</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know about the regenerating yet as I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
<li> If you have a dry skin, this is not for you.</li>
<li> I just bought a few other products in the garnier line to try now, daycream and cleanser...</li>
<li> I am a Black woman with loads of hyper-pigmentation.</li>
<li> Shipping time was good-the package arrived in less than a week.</li>
<li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t mad, but when I contacted the seller, it was as if they were accusing me of lying when I told them.</li>
<li> I saw no difference in my skin at all and ended up just using it as a hand cream since I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
<li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.</li>
<li> and I even wear less makeup!</li>
<li> Hard to find</li>
<li> When I received it, the cap was missing and looked as if it was a bit dirty!</li>
<li> weird</li>
<li> my skin hurts when I put this moisture and in the morning it seems worse than the day before!I didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
<li> This product is so bad, I cannot use it anymore.....</li>
<li> VERY, VERY, VERY, disappointed.</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed...!!..</li>

    <li> this cream really works fantastic....love it, love it, love it...will order again for sure....fast shipping and great price too...!!!...try this for yourself...you won&#x27;t be disappointed...!!..thank you so much...!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I want to use it on my whole body. I like that it absorbs really quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Other lotions can feel heavy or greasy but this one just feels pleasant. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance. Now if I can just find it cheap enough to apply to my legs ;)</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I get it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of night creams (nivea, olay, clinique) and this is by far the best.  I wake up and think my skin actually looks softer and fresher.</li>
    <li> I am a Black woman with loads of hyper-pigmentation. This worked wonder for me. I saw results literally the next day. I now use this as well as chemical peels that I also purchased from amazon and the results are amplified!! My skin tone is evening out beautifully and I even wear less makeup!</li>
    <li> i have semi-oily skin, and this is the perfect lightweight overnight cream, pleasant scent, and not too thick to rub in nicely. My skin really feels soft in the a.m. and i have had no issues with any blemishes in a while, which i&#x27;m giving some credit to this cream even, it really has helped even my skin out at night i think. I just bought a few other products in the garnier line to try now, daycream and cleanser... we shall see.</li>
    <li> This product is so bad, I cannot use it anymore.....my skin hurts when I put this moisture and in the morning it seems worse than the day before!I didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product but I am not using I with other garnier products and I don&#x27;t always use it every night so I really can&#x27;t give an accurate review on whether its working for me or not</li>
    <li> I like this product. Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t create grease. Feels light and fresh. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles but it helps keep dry spots moisturized.</li>
    <li> I use this bottle up but I did not see much change, perhaps I need to offer more than one bottle.</li>
    <li> this is the best hydrating cream i have ever used. in 1 nite my skin was softer and looked better. i live in a dry climate and have tried many products. but this is great.</li>
    <li> Does it smell good? Yeah. Does it feel good on? Sure. Was it affordable? Yep. But it has done nothing but clog my pores. My spots are just the same as ever. I know this product isn&#x27;t specifically for spots but I read all the reviews on here and let my hopes get a little too high. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> A nice smooth cream that makes my skin feel soft and smooth in the morning.  Don&#x27;t know about the regenerating yet as I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
    <li> Actually I really like garnier products...I feel it&#x27;s reasonably priced and as good if not better than some of the products that you get from the department stores.  I am new to this product but so far so good.  Definitely would buy again</li>
    <li> Over time I noticed this did nothing for me. I saw no difference in my skin at all and ended up just using it as a hand cream since I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !this is awesome and i can tell the skin is nice after I used it and is easy to apply, the price is great I used every night and you dont have to apply a lot , I do recommend it but that again everyone skin is not the same so my work for me but not for you :)but at least try is the only way to find out :)</li>
    <li> Hard to find and I love it.  Best night time moisturizer I have used.</li>
    <li> If you have a dry skin, this is not for you. After a long use, it will make your skin even drier. I will recommend burst bee instead for your dry skin if you are thinking for a long term used.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these because they stopped selling it in my local drug store.  I am glad I found it.  It&#x27;s a great product and I like the texture and I believe it keep  my skin beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  The beautiful changes in my complexion/skin.  The long lush eyelashes that grow as a result of using this product is absolutely amazing.  I was crushed when it was no longer available in the stores.  I would have bought out the entire online available products but shipping is charged on every SINGLE one ordered, not just a one-time charge for the shipment.</li>
    <li> love this product...not sure why they discontinued it</li>
    <li> Amazing, light, and effective. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years at night because it&#x27;s not heavy and I wake up with soft skin.</li>
    <li> When I received it, the cap was missing and looked as if it was a bit dirty! At first, I wasn&#x27;t mad, but when I contacted the seller, it was as if they were accusing me of lying when I told them. VERY, VERY, VERY, disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks, but really love how it makes my skin feel soft and look smooth... the smell is also nice, not strong.. I have used another Garnier night cream before (the anti-wrinkle night cream), but switched to this one because it&#x27;s better..</li>
    <li> This product has been nothing but wonderful to me and my skin is so freaking smooth! And I also can&#x27;t find this in stores... weird</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite skin creams...really helps reduce wrinkles and smells so great! Even though it says overnight, I use it every morning after shower and at night.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> I love the product but I wish it would have reached my hands.. where&#x27;s my stuff. thank  you so kindly.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! The consistency is light and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. It is probably one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my hyper pigmentation- it helps to quickly fade the marks on my face. I have acne prone skin(I&#x27;m 24) and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me breakout. It also works well on premature wrinkles. I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been getting small lines on my forehead and slightly pronounced lines smile lines around my mouth-this product has helped reduce and diminish them. I didn&#x27;t think a 1.7 oz tube would last that long-but mine has lasted about three months. Shipping time was good-the package arrived in less than a week. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This cream smells so good, and feel incredible on my skin! It is lightweight and my skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by any of the &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; overnight creams, but this one was the only one that really absorbed well. Smells fresher than the others too!</li>
