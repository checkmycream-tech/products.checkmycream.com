      <li>This color is nice.  </li>
      <li>I used it on my Mom&#x27;s nails and it looked nice.</li>
      <li>However, it definately has a warm brown undertone that makes this color both warm and sexy.</li>
      <li>and it is deep and beautiful and matches the OPI color beautifully.</li>
      <li>Gelish has the best gel polish by far, Goes on nice and smooth and even.</li>
      <li>so maybe u have to use more coats of polish</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>I love this color and get compliments on it</li>
      <li>Totally LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>The color looks better in person</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>I bought this polish along with the basecoat, top coat, PH Bond and the curing light.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i couldn&#x27;t have been more happy with the color it comes out to be (with only two coats too)!  </li>
      <li>and it went on easy and</li>
      <li>I have tan skin and dark hair and it complements me perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that perfect dark maroon color.  </li>
      <li>did give it four stars because though the color is wonderful, it came on just a LITTLE streaky.</li>
      <li>I have found my technique that works best for me and my colors last about two weeks without really any chips.  </li>
      <li>I love this color, doing my own gel nails at home has saved me money and time, it is easy and simple.</li>
      <li>and I get the full 3-4 weeks of wear.</li>
      <li>and I was surprised that I liked it.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful dark red with glitter - just love it!</li>
      <li>Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Elegant Wish&lt;br /&gt;good product, dry fast under uv light (2m) , nice color.</li>
      <li>but when it&#x27;s all finished in reality it very simple and looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment on the products and lights.</li>
      <li>I am NOT a professional but this product requires no skill, you just need to be able to polish your nails!</li>
      <li>beautiful color, it is a deep red, almost a maroon color.</li>
      <li>and it usually works great</li>
      <li>Gorgeous dark cherry....</li>
      <li>The shimmer isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all, just a nice subtle frost.</li>
      <li>I tend to find that most colors dont always come out the same as what you think you might be buying online.  </li>
      <li>the color is exactly as it looks.  </li>
      <li>This was the first color I purchased.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a pretty color either way</li>
      <li>I have never been able to grow my own nails, they are too thin and just split and break.  </li>
      <li>very dark and has an amazing shimmer.</li>
      <li>Not glitter, but high shine!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing Gelish on my nails since about September and really the whole technique is trial and error.  </li>
      <li>By then i&#x27;m ready for a new color anyway!</li>
      <li>but it seems to have a more brown tone to it and a slight frost.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had been more of a deep red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a burgundy than a deep red.</li>
      <li>You HAVE to be accurate in painting the nails and careful not to let the product to bleed into your cuticles.</li>
      <li>I prefer Gelish to OPI GelColor, as OPI tends to shrink from the free edge a bit, therefore not lasting quite as long as Gelish.</li>
      <li>I had a professional manicure done using Harmony Gelish and it lasted nearly 3 weeks, but not because it was flaking, because it was growing out with unpolished new growth.  </li>
      <li>, I suspect it was old.  </li>
      <li>I added natural nail primer after pH Bond</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because in the picture it appears much darker than it actually is</li>
      <li>just does not \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my natural nails, within 24 hours it is flaking off.  </li>
      <li>how well it bonds to my natural nails allowing them to grow.  </li>
      <li>I ended up buying another band that is not so thick love the color</li>
      <li>The other one I bought at the same time, Sweet Chocolate, also would not cure.</li>
      <li>I do wish the product pics were more accurate :(</li>
      <li>My only resort until this product was to go to get gel nails professionally.</li>

<li> Use caution when using this product and alternate with a nail strengthner every other use</li>
<li> In my personal opinion, I think this is too dark and too purplish brown.  </li>
<li> This item would not sure when used on me by my manicurist, I wonder if it was old?  </li>
<li> A deep dark redish/black....</li>
<li> I needed 3 coats to get the dark brown color, but that just makes it last longer!</li>
<li> The only down side it the guessing of the color.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very, very similar to black cherry berry if you use three coats.  </li>
<li> It is sort of similar to black cherry berry</li>
<li> I have even done what I call a \\&quot;refill\\&quot;, lightly buffing the edge of the polish at the base of the nails and applying the base and color on the new growth and then a coat of color plus a top coat on the entire nail, curing between each coat.  </li>
<li> I just received this color the other day</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping it lasts 2 weeks like my other gel polish...</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t chip though for a week and a half</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s dangerous to use extensively as I found out too late.</li>
<li> but it makes your nail to thick</li>
<li> this is tooo thick</li>
<li> This product weakens your nails to the point of paper thin.</li>
<li> Paper thin and rather painful with no to little protection.</li>
<li> the slightest touch rips your nail to a painful mess.</li>
<li> stays on 1 week +, needs to be applied in very thin layers.</li>

    <li> I got this color in the mail last week. used it thursday and still have to chipping or peeling. (after one week and one day) the color is BEAUTIFUL! very dark and has an amazing shimmer. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It is sort of similar to black cherry berry but it seems to have a more brown tone to it and a slight frost. I have tan skin and dark hair and it complements me perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to grow my own nails, they are too thin and just split and break.  Regular nail polish just does not \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my natural nails, within 24 hours it is flaking off.  I had a professional manicure done using Harmony Gelish and it lasted nearly 3 weeks, but not because it was flaking, because it was growing out with unpolished new growth.  I bought this polish along with the basecoat, top coat, PH Bond and the curing light.  I LOVE how well it bonds to my natural nails allowing them to grow.  I have even done what I call a \\&quot;refill\\&quot;, lightly buffing the edge of the polish at the base of the nails and applying the base and color on the new growth and then a coat of color plus a top coat on the entire nail, curing between each coat.  FANTASTIC results!!!  I am NOT a professional but this product requires no skill, you just need to be able to polish your nails! I was able to keep this polish on my toenails for over 6 weeks!!</li>
    <li> Love Gelish! This is a beautiful color with shimmer!! The color looks better in person the picture does not do the color justice.</li>
    <li> I love this color, doing my own gel nails at home has saved me money and time, it is easy and simple. Worth the investment on the products and lights.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous dark cherry....the product photo makes it look brown but is not. It is gorgeous though! I do wish the product pics were more accurate :(</li>
    <li> beautiful color, it is a deep red, almost a maroon color. Looks great, and stays on like all gelish polish.</li>
    <li> Having to go through Chemo, my nails has never been the same. Paper thin and rather painful with no to little protection. My only resort until this product was to go to get gel nails professionally. This product is slightly more complicated than simply painting your nails but when it&#x27;s all finished in reality it very simple and looks amazing. Totally LOVE this product. The only down side it the guessing of the color. Often it&#x27;s slightly different when it come out of the bottle if they put the sticker and not a window. You HAVE to be accurate in painting the nails and careful not to let the product to bleed into your cuticles. Other than that it&#x27;s an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a year since I started using this product and I have found out that though it strengthens the nail with the gel...it&#x27;s only temporary and not only temporary but it&#x27;s dangerous to use extensively as I found out too late. This product weakens your nails to the point of paper thin. Literally. the slightest touch rips your nail to a painful mess. Use caution when using this product and alternate with a nail strengthner every other use</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color.  Deep burgundy with a hint of shimmer.  The shimmer isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all, just a nice subtle frost. Perfect for Fall and Winter.  I have been using Gelish for several months, and have 25 colors.  This is one of my favorites.  It cures beautifully and has great coverage.  I prefer Gelish to OPI GelColor, as OPI tends to shrink from the free edge a bit, therefore not lasting quite as long as Gelish.</li>
    <li> I love this color and get compliments on it everytime I wear it. I pair it with OPI&#x27;s Royal Raja Ruby. 3 coats and it is deep and beautiful and matches the OPI color beautifully.</li>
    <li> Gelish has the best gel polish by far, Goes on nice and smooth and even. This is a great color for fall. Love it.</li>
    <li> In my personal opinion, I think this is too dark and too purplish brown.  Wore it once but wasn&#x27;t fond of the color.&lt;br /&gt;Gelish, however, is a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a burgundy than a deep red. It looked purplish on me. It didn&#x27;t chip though for a week and a half so I&#x27;m pleased. Just wish it had been more of a deep red.</li>
    <li> This item would not sure when used on me by my manicurist, I wonder if it was old?  Because we use this brand often and it usually works great, I suspect it was old.  The other one I bought at the same time, Sweet Chocolate, also would not cure.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Gelish colors! It is a beautiful dark red with glitter - just love it!</li>
    <li> This color is nice.  It&#x27;s very, very similar to black cherry berry if you use three coats.  However, with two coats, it covers well and is a lighter shade of burgundy/wine.</li>
    <li> This color looks great! It&#x27;s that perfect dark maroon color.  Not glitter, but high shine! My daughter asked for it for Christmas and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the color it&#x27;s like a medium brown with a gold shimmer in it but I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because in the picture it appears much darker than it actually is but I only used to coats so maybe u have to use more coats of polish but it&#x27;s still a pretty color either way</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> great products. I added natural nail primer after pH Bond and I get the full 3-4 weeks of wear. Without it, I averaged 14 days.</li>
    <li> I just received this color the other day and I was surprised that I liked it.  I used it on my Mom&#x27;s nails and it looked nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing Gelish on my nails since about September and really the whole technique is trial and error.  I have found my technique that works best for me and my colors last about two weeks without really any chips.  By then i&#x27;m ready for a new color anyway! my bf got me this color for christmas and i LOVE IT!!! i couldn&#x27;t have been more happy with the color it comes out to be (with only two coats too)!  A deep dark redish/black.... I tend to find that most colors dont always come out the same as what you think you might be buying online.  SO like I said, trial and error. But i will say this color is one of my favs for the winter and is a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Elegant Wish&lt;br /&gt;good product, dry fast under uv light (2m) , nice color.</li>
    <li> This was the first color I purchased. I needed 3 coats to get the dark brown color, but that just makes it last longer! Love it!</li>
    <li> stays on 1 week +, needs to be applied in very thin layers.</li>
    <li> this is tooo thick I ended up buying another band that is not so thick love the color but it makes your nail to thick</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color! Just to let you know, it&#x27;s a little different than the picture: the actual polish is a little more red and a little glittery. However, it definately has a warm brown undertone that makes this color both warm and sexy. Wonderful color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it four stars because though the color is wonderful, it came on just a LITTLE streaky. Nothing too noticable, but not quite as solid as I like.</li>
    <li> I have used this product just once and it went on easy and the color is exactly as it looks.  I&#x27;m hoping it lasts 2 weeks like my other gel polish...we shall see.</li>
