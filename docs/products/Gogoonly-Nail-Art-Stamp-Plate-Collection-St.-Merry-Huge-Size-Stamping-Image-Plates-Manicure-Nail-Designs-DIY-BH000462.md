<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesomely beautiful ;) designs</li>
    <li> My daughter is having fan with it so I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Rosie</li>
    <li> This was my first stamping plate. Once I learned the dos and don&#x27;ts it really became fun.</li>
    <li> I love these plates !</li>
    <li> super loving this plate so much designs!!</li>
    <li> I just adore this plate! My nails aren&#x27;t extremely long, but they&#x27;re long enough that I often have problems with the designs on other plates being too small. The full size images on this plate are large, which I very much appreciate. The plate is etched well, and the images are beautiful. I&#x27;d love to see more plates from this brand.</li>
    <li> Best plates ever good quality good size delivered quickly love to have more I would highly recommend buying these love them!!!😊</li>
    <li> IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Im happy for this plate, stamp very nice and i love the desing! 💅🏽👍🏽😊</li>
    <li> I saw this plate on IG and had to try it.  The designs are beautiful.  I feel so bad they are to short for my nails.  I can use them for designs, just not full nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome plate!! Edged nicely n images pick up on 1st try</li>
    <li> I love the images,they are etched very well&lt;br /&gt;One problem though,all it was in was a cardboard envelope inside a paper envelope,and when I got it all four corners were bent,I was able to bend them back but not all the way,so when you scrape off the polish some of it stays on the corner&lt;br /&gt;But over all I&#x27;m very happy,and plan on buying more plates by gogo only&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I love this thing the stamp come out perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it so much and the price is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love these plates!  Great engraving!  Clear stamps!  Great price!  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Had a dent. All images wouldn&#x27;t transfer.</li>
    <li> Itching is purfect! Thank you! Great item to add to your stamping Collection!</li>
    <li> There is a lot of designs to choose from and its imprinted very well, just about all of them stamp very well.</li>
    <li> love the plate so much, wish you guys make more,  keep up with this awesome work</li>
    <li> I love this plate. Etching is deep enough, image sizes are large enough for my long nails. Plenty of options to choose from.  The only thing I would want changed is a complete design such as the hearts design on the bottom with the message, the heart was not complete. Overall I would recommend and to let you know I bought a duplicate a back up so I have 2. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Really like this plate.  Have only tried 4 of the stamps.  One of them is not working so well.  But, I&#x27;ll try again.  This plate has a lot of designs that I really love.</li>
    <li> I Love this plate. I just bought the other two in the set and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. They stamp great. I am using the MoYou rectangular squishy stamper and the Creative Shop Stamper. They designs are etched deep and just adorable.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice plate. Every image stamped beautifully even the fine lines. They are slightly larger than other full nail designs out there, but I don&#x27;t think they are the largest. I own a lot of plates but I have nothing like these images, there may be some of the same &amp;#34;theme&amp;#34; but definitely not the same. Just like the St. Happy plate the backing is a little flimsy but it is just backing. There is a clear film on the back, which I&#x27;ve never seen on plates before, but this backing is smooth and shiny unlike others that are matte and sorta textured. You can remove this with tweezers, just like the blue film on the front.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Nice plate. Pretty designs. Can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
    <li> Really nice, well-etched plate. Great selection of designs.</li>
    <li> images are very pretty and stamped well :)  Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> This plate is outstanding quality, I am very pleased. Even the finely etched lines stamp well. I love the unique designs and the price is great for the amount of different images you get. Definitely recommend this plate.</li>
    <li> Nice designs, but arrived extremely scratched up. Almost doesn&#x27;t count.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Gogo Only St. Happy stamping plate and loved it so much I immediately ordered the St. Merry plate. The plate size is not huge, and fits in my Helmer from Ikea perfectly.  Any nail art enthusiast will love this!</li>
    <li> Beautiful plate, thanks!</li>
    <li> This plate is absolutely amazing. Looking forward to purchasing the other 2 as well</li>
    <li> I purchased this plate a few months ago as my first ever stamping plate.  Now that I have more experience I would have to rate this plate a 4/5.  My main reason for not giving it a 5/5 is that the designs are quite large for a normal nail and it is often hard to fit the full design on my nail.  Also, there are about 10-15 images that I use frequently; the rest I&#x27;m not fond of or the designs are a bit too big.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as someone&#x27;s first stamping plate (try MoYou or Bundle Monster) but it is a pretty good plate in general.</li>
    <li> Beautiful images. The packaging is quite flimsy, so it&#x27;s just pure luck that the plate didn&#x27;t bend. If it arrives in good condition, you will be happy with it. The images are a good size for longer nails. However, most of them will translate nicely on a shorter nail too.</li>
    <li> These are awesome nail stamp plates.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this it took way too long.</li>
    <li> When I received my plate I noticed several dents in the plate. I went ahead and stamped all of the images and the dents did effect the images so I&#x27;m returning this plate for a refund. Some of the images don&#x27;t stamp well either I&#x27;m thinking its not etched well. I have loads of plates and actual stamping polishes so I believe I gave this plate every chance I could to produce a great stamped image and it failed in my opinion. Obviously I  got a damaged and defective plate.</li>
    <li> I have many plate brands and these are the worse of all i have.The etching is too shallow to pick up a hood image.What a waste.</li>
    <li> It is better than what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Love this plate! It was packaged well and arrived quickly. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with any of the images transferring to the stamper. It&#x27;s fun mixing and matching designs. Overall out of all the plates I have this one is by far my favorite all time go to stamping plate.</li>
    <li> The plate is really pretty, and stamps well. I like the package. I don&#x27;t give 5 stars because my plate had scratches, not in the images but in one side, and I consider that you should receive a neat product because the appearence of the one that I received is like damaged. I will post a picture.</li>
    <li> Gross,tolle Motive,aber der Versand plus Steuer plus plus plus, sorry wird teuer.</li>
    <li> This new company: Gogoonly is a superior stamping plate manufacturer. I have both plates and they are wonderful!</li>
    <li> These Plates are beautiful! Very large images clear images.  Stamps very clean, I hope they make more!</li>
    <li> Just OK. This is my first stamping plate. I learned that cheap polish will not work well. To have a nice visible clear stamp, you must MUST MUST have good grade polish. I also noticed it depends how I use the scraper if the image picks up on the stamper. Is that odd? Some images pick up perfect if I scrape left to right. Some wont pick up if I scrape bottom to top. If I put clear polish on top of the stamp, the stamp runs. You definitely have to be careful when cleaning your plate. Paper towels scratched the plate.&lt;br /&gt;The stamps themselves are really cute; and really cute IF I can get them on my nail visibly without breaks and faded areas. It takes a little of trial and error I guess.</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are so huge and pretty😊 i couldnt descide which ones to Buy so i got the st. Meryy and the st happy and i loved them both they both stamp beautifuly and are good quality.😊 MAKE MORE STAMPING PLATES GOGO ONLY🙏🏼</li>
    <li> The designs in this plate are really lovely, and some of the more intricate ones with lots of flowers and lines look wonderful on the nail. I had no problem with the depth of any of the engravings; once I got the hang of it, I got every bit of the tiniest line work on the stamp. I absolutely recommend this plate, and will probably buy more from Gogo Only in the future.</li>
    <li> Fine images pick up well.</li>
    <li> Thank you.  FAST shipping. Product looks like a decent quality stamping plate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a stamping plate with images large enough for my longer nails without having to spend an arm and leg. I&#x27;m so glad to have found Gogo Only! The etching on the plate is perfect, each image comes off on your nail nice and crisp. The images are not only long enough but wide enough for what I would think would be the majority of nails out there.They are perfect for me. I just wish they had more plates available than just the 2 they offer. I would definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> When I received my plate, it had a scratch on one of the images.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a decent plate.  The images picked up pretty well depending on what polish you use.  It&#x27;s the size of an mini Ipad</li>
    <li> Awesome. Took some time to get the hang of the stamping technique though</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but the i;mage picked up great.</li>
    <li> Love the images, clean transfer and works well with both stamping polish and regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Really great plate. For anyone wondering the images are 1.6 by 2.2 cm.</li>
    <li> So impressed with how well these images pick up and stamp. A nice variety of designs, the packaging is absolutely ggorgeous and the plate very well made. Great quality, get it!</li>
    <li> Of all the plates I own this is by far the best quality. The plate is heavy duty, deeply etched. It transfers well even with refined &amp; intricate detail. Excellent plate. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this plate! I am so excited to try it out but I need a couple of things so I will be going to the store tomorrow. I love the designs they are so pretty. I also received my plate really fast. I will really enjoy this plate! Thank you so much for the great quality you do!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! The St. Merry is a beautiful must have nail stamping plate! I love nail stamping and I am just so amazed at all the unique beautifully etched images that are on this plate. I am so pleased and for the reasonable price of $12.99. I look to purchase more plates from GoGo Only.</li>
    <li> Beautiful plate! Super quality, great designs, all over just great! I&#x27;m enjoying this plate enormously. I hope they make many more plates. I&#x27;ll buy them all!</li>
    <li> I love these plates. Please make more</li>
    <li> Love these plates. Im new to stamping and had ordered cheaper plates. They worked decently but you get what you pay for. These plates were reasonable and the quality is far superior. Images are extra large and deeply etched. Every image came out clear on the first attempt. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> It was a little scratched but besides that I live the plate</li>
    <li> love the images but the plate was bent in the corner and the middle too. It still works but wish it came straight not bent. I tried to fix it. The corner and the side.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Variety of Designs&lt;br /&gt;-Very Affordable&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Slip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None ATM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this plate on a bit of a whim. I got it to try some of the designs that I felt would fit a Fourth of July theme. While it has many lovely designs I was able to get some great ones for my Fourth Mani. You will see the designs used from this plate on my pointer and ring finger. The plated worked great and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Mine had a little dent in it when it arrived leaving one pattern unusable.</li>
    <li> Very pretty designs and it stamps well on the rubber stamps that I purchased separate. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.....she loves me more now...highly recommended. ...!!!</li>
    <li> great designs, stamps very sharp and clear.</li>
    <li> Well etched and so many great, versatile images on one plate. I will get a ton of use out of this one.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a bent on it.</li>
    <li> This stamping plate is awesome! I&#x27;ve bought plates before that were not deep enough and the stamp always came out thin and almost see though. The first time I used this I got a great transfer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The patterns are all beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more plates from this brand :)</li>
    <li> I am new to stamping. I had to go through several stampers to find what works for my super curved nail beds. The next challenge was finding plates where the design would also transfer well. Some of the other brands I have tried were hits and misses. One of the popular brands (apparently you cannot state brands in the reviews) weren&#x27;t as easy to grab the whole design and were better for larger/longer nails. Another inexpensive, yet popular brand works ok but often has cutesie stuff that I don&#x27;t dig. I had heard so many good things about these GoGo plates - I had to try one. EVERY single image transfers. Use nice thick polishes and scrape away the polish (on the plate) with an old credit card holding the card at a 45 degree angle and grab the angle without pushing hard. Works- Every. Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the design after each stamp pick up with acetone. Slip back into it&#x27;s cardboard sleeve. (be sure to remove the front and back protective layers on the plate)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have short nails? I do. And short nail beds. No only can people with longer nails use these designs BUT there are plenty of designs that I can fit on my short nails. Because of my work I sometimes have to cut them ultra short and I have tiny nail beds and I can STILL find designs to fit on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully used some standard nail polish to stamp with. Just make sure it is very opaque - a one coater. Thinner polishes will not work well. Stamping polish is helpful but only necessary if you don&#x27;t have nice thick/opaque polishes on hand. If using polish- make sure it&#x27;s a one coater. Most of those stamp decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point for the quality you get is just wonderful. I just bought their other plate - St Happy- because you need both. I hope they keep coming out with more designs. They are defintely my favorite that I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLATE. I GET COMPLIMENTS ON THESE STAMPS EVERYTIME I WEAR THEM.</li>
    <li> These images are large enough for my long nails which most other stamping plates won&#x27;t cover. I just wish they had more designs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping and read a lot of reviews on all the different plates! I have to say I&#x27;m in love with both of my GoGo only plates. The images are beautifully etched with so much detail and they are huge which is great because I have big nail beds so coverage is awesome...after some learning curves between which way to scrape to pick up the image and priming my stamper I&#x27;m happy to say I think I have it all figured out...looking forward to more plates from this excellent company!</li>
    <li> Great designs, pick up flawlessly!</li>
    <li> If you have smaller fingers this is the kit for you. Nice images and the packaging was good.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PLATE!!! The designs are perfect and they are bigger than I expected. I have very big, long nails and they will cover most of my nail, more than I expected. Buy this!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This plate is great. The images transfer easily and it has a great variety of images. I highly recommend!</li>
