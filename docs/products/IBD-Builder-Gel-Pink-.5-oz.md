      <li>however I have been doing my own nails for the past eight years now.</li>
      <li>Definitely well worth the effort.</li>
      <li>It was just wires crossed about my new address</li>
      <li>No body even knows these are not my natural nails</li>
      <li>SINCE MY GROWING DAUGHTER WANTS HER NAILS DONE, I CANNOT AFFORD CONSTANT SALON VISITS</li>
      <li>lasts a full 2 weeks no more salon visits</li>

    <li> Since my nails are so thin, I use it over my own nails to keep myself from biting them, and I don&#x27;t have to spend any money at the nail salon, now that I can do my own nails.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO DO NAILS AT HOME, AND LOVE IT. I USED EXACTLY AS DIRECTED AND GOT THE RESULTS I WAS HOPING FOR. IT DOES TAKE PRACTICE FOR THE APPLYING AND SHAPING, THAT OF COURSE WILL COME WITH TIME. JUST REMEMBER A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, AND TAKE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE NEW SINCE PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. THIS IS PERFECT TO SAVE US MONEY SINCE MY GROWING DAUGHTER WANTS HER NAILS DONE, I CANNOT AFFORD CONSTANT SALON VISITS AND THIS IS SALON RESULTS :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used gels for many years, was a professional nail tech for 10 years.  This gel did not meet my expectations.  It was more of an opaque pink than translucent, and I did not care for the appearance.</li>
    <li> Less than half the jar had gel.</li>
    <li> Great product and lives up to the expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Apply small amounts for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;Can drip if large amounts applied</li>
    <li> This stuff peels off as soon as I&#x27;m done doing my nails. Another waste of money. I&#x27;ll just stick to the colored polish which is awesome</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional manicurist however I have been doing my own nails for the past eight years now. I have switched from acrylic to gel because of the smell and the lifting I got from acrylic. The pink is not too bright, it&#x27;s a perfect natural color to use for pink and white nails.</li>
    <li> best builder ever! lasts a full 2 weeks no more salon visits i save so much money now, this builder is strong just like acrylic but better because it lasts longer</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be pinker but you can hardly tell the difference between this color and clear builder gel. you have to apply more than one coat of just the pink.</li>
    <li> Gels are quick and easy to use. IBD products are reliable, with quality and dependability always in mind. A little practice is necessary to get used to using gels if you haven&#x27;t used them before. Definitely well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I did finally get my order. It was just wires crossed about my new address but I am very pleased with this product and definately would order again! It works great and has saved me money on having to get my nails redone!</li>
    <li> Cures great and does not lift if used properly. You do not need a polish because this looks like a natural pink.</li>
    <li> IBD Pink Gel Builder is the ONLY pink gel I will use. PERIOD. IBD has a cool cure and cures rock hard in less than 2 minutes ! Easy removal with drilling or filing. Up until recently I would only use IBD products, and still I will ALWAYS reach for IBD over anything else !!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great quality</li>
    <li> very good . was excatcly what i order. very good quality . i will order more soon and price are good</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this builder i will never bye again</li>
    <li> I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Gel. I discovered you can use this gel as your builder. I&#x27;m brand new at doing my own nails. I&#x27;m a Retired Cosmetologist by trade but didn&#x27;t know how to do my own nails. LOL I decided after years of paying others to do them for me I&#x27;d save money and do my own. I ended up ordering enough products to last the rest of my life. I just turned sixty-five in Nov. I&#x27;m having fun  doing my own. P.S. UPDATE This product SUCKS THE BIG ONE!!!!!! The first time I used this gel, it was GREAT. I tried to use it again this week and threwit in the trash. It was thicker and very stringy; globbed on my nails so much I wasn&#x27;t able to brush out. I thinned it down with acetone but it wouldn&#x27;t cure. BIG WASTE OF TIME &amp; MONEY!!!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The pink is so natural looking that I use this all the time. No body even knows these are not my natural nails</li>
