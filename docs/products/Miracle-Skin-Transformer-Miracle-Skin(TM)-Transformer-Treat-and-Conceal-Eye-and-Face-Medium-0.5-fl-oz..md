      <li>Perfect for those parts that need to be concealed.</li>
      <li>This is the best concealer on the market.  </li>
      <li>Best concealer ever!</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>The best concealer I have ever used!!</li>
      <li>The concealer is great.  </li>
      <li>So so, great coverage</li>
      <li>Now that Sephora doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, I am so happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>May be good at covering but at what expense??</li>
      <li>The blending is good</li>
      <li>This is a good product, blends in well with the color of my skin.</li>
      <li>but the coverage is great &amp; smooth velvety texture too, so I felt generous.  </li>
      <li>Great coverage and nice smooth feeling</li>
      <li>I found it especially useful for under the eyes.</li>
      <li>Not to be corny, but this concealer is honestly a miracle.</li>
      <li>It really helps create a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>Best coverup really covers my lines.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read their return/exchange policy before ordering.</li>
      <li>but I am still hoping :)</li>
      <li>Works fabulously!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>While at first I was pleased with the color and creamy texture of this product, I didn&#x27;t feel that it wore well throughout the day any better than grocery store concealer.  </li>
      <li>I am a real person and I am completely in love with this concealer!</li>
      <li>It feels smooth, almost like powder.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>The light by itself is my shade.</li>
      <li>I had originally singed up for the automatic delivery of this product line and discontinued that for 2 reasons, 1-it was way too often</li>
      <li>and the product lasts forever (although the company will let you space it out more if you ask them), and 2-all I really wanted out of the grouping was this concealer.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and covers nicely.</li>
      <li>Received the product really quick, product is way lighter than I thought it would be, I have to really blend it in well with my translucent powder, but it does cover imperfections OK.</li>
      <li>The best concealer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price as only a tiny drop is needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite concealor so far!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price for the value and coverage that it provides.</li>
      <li>And it blends right after you apply.</li>
      <li>so I knew that Medium was the right shade for me.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and blends easily and wears for a long time.</li>
      <li>I found that applying just a tiny amount with a small brush works the best.</li>
      <li>Conceals better than drugstore brands, but only about as well as the Clinique Airbrush concealer...and needs to be touched up about as often as it, too--usually midday....</li>
      <li>I bought this at Sephora when it first came out.</li>
      <li>I do have fair skin, but I use the regular miracle skin medium as my only foundation and this is heavier and a bit darker.  </li>
      <li>Some one who did not like it posted that she was leery of all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>So I have to mix it with the light first to get the proper shade.</li>
      <li>and pat it on to my face and blend around gently.</li>
      <li>OR AS MUCH</li>
      <li>It does come in more colors, and you need less of it, but I would not call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;--I</li>
      <li>color is too yellow, super opaque</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easily and can be worn in combination with other makeup products.</li>
      <li>Good for scar coverage and little tube lasts a long time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised how much darker the medium is.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>This is my daily eye treatment, and it really does works miracles.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll only need tiny bit at a time, because it covers so much.</li>

<li> It didn&#x27;t completely hide a dark blue bruise I had on my face from an injection which took forever to fade, but helped a lot and covered the yellow as it healed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be buying this again but think it will last a long time.</li>
<li> Most of the time I have been met with disappointment.</li>
<li> Had a strange consistency, and provided zero coverage.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s one that stays on for a long time!</li>
<li> Not for dry skin.....</li>
<li> I read the ingredients carefully &amp; as an Esthetician</li>
<li> have genetically dark circles--</li>
<li> I have tried a lot of products that promised to conceal imperfections and dark circles/spots on skin.</li>
<li> The Tan shade is too dark for my skin</li>
<li> The Tan is way too dark for my skin.</li>
<li> I had a trial size of this product for almost a year since you only need a small dot of it to cover under eye circles and small blemishes.</li>
<li> I literally squirt a half a dime size out</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little too dark, looks like dirt on my face.  </li>
<li> AS LITTLE</li>
<li> I discovered this a few years ago after reading a review in the WSJ of their tinted moisturizer.  </li>
<li> I have some redness and uneven skin tones and it perfects everything.</li>
<li> A few weeks ago I got a sample of the product from Sephora</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had a similar experience as one of the other reviewers.</li>
<li> Applies well to small targets  when you use a concealer brush.</li>
<li> If you have an issue with dark circles or if you are tired from a late night, this product transforms the look of your under eye area, making it blend in with the rest of your skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> The sticker the seller put on the package says Medium but the box and the concealer tube clearly says Tan. :(</li>
<li> My chin acne got worse with one application.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m unable to use it.</li>
<li> (sounds crazy I know!)</li>
<li> /&gt;It was a bad choice for under eye darkness, it may work as an eyelid base?</li>
<li> Color was horrible.</li>

    <li> Not for dry skin.....</li>
    <li> The best concealer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price as only a tiny drop is needed.</li>
    <li> Not to be corny, but this concealer is honestly a miracle. I had originally singed up for the automatic delivery of this product line and discontinued that for 2 reasons, 1-it was way too often and the product lasts forever (although the company will let you space it out more if you ask them), and 2-all I really wanted out of the grouping was this concealer. I actually use it as an all over foundation (the foundation in the product line provides virtually no coverage at all). I literally squirt a half a dime size out (sounds crazy I know!) and pat it on to my face and blend around gently. I can&#x27;t even describe the consistency. It goes on so smoothly and evenly. I have never used anything else like it. I have some redness and uneven skin tones and it perfects everything. You won&#x27;t need any powder, or anything else. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, blends in well with the color of my skin. I use it over primer and it doesn&#x27;t settle into lines. It didn&#x27;t completely hide a dark blue bruise I had on my face from an injection which took forever to fade, but helped a lot and covered the yellow as it healed. Applies well to small targets  when you use a concealer brush. I also use it on the bridge of my nose and between my eyes as well as the sides of my nose. It really helps create a flawless finish. I&#x27;ll be buying this again but think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered the concealer in Medium but received Tan instead. A few weeks ago I got a sample of the product from Sephora so I knew that Medium was the right shade for me. The Tan is way too dark for my skin. The sticker the seller put on the package says Medium but the box and the concealer tube clearly says Tan. :(</li>
    <li> I do have fair skin, but I use the regular miracle skin medium as my only foundation and this is heavier and a bit darker.  I found that applying just a tiny amount with a small brush works the best.</li>
    <li> The best concealer I have ever used!! I bought this at Sephora when it first came out. Now that Sephora doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, I am so happy to find it at Amazon. Some one who did not like it posted that she was leery of all the positive reviews. I am a real person and I am completely in love with this concealer! It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s got a powdery finish. It does not sink into my lines. It&#x27;s one that stays on for a long time!</li>
    <li> Not a miracle...color is too yellow, super opaque...looks  cakey.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bad choice for under eye darkness, it may work as an eyelid base?</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer on the market.  I tried in my Birchbox months ago and finally purchased the big tube.  This will last me for months!</li>
    <li> I got this for shading purposes. It&#x27;s a little too dark, looks like dirt on my face.  So I have to mix it with the light first to get the proper shade. The light by itself is my shade. I&#x27;m surprised how much darker the medium is.  The concealer is great.  It goes on smooth and blends easily and wears for a long time. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and covers nicely.</li>
    <li> Not the under eye coverage I was looking for.. Same coverage/color as Miracle Skin Transformer.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products that promised to conceal imperfections and dark circles/spots on skin. Most of the time I have been met with disappointment. That is not the case with this product. It actually does make a visible difference in the look and even the texture of your skin. I found it especially useful for under the eyes. If you have an issue with dark circles or if you are tired from a late night, this product transforms the look of your under eye area, making it blend in with the rest of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and can be worn in combination with other makeup products. The blending is good so you can&#x27;t see lines of different colour where you have used it. Excellent. I wish the tube was a bit bigger though!</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this product.  I am almost 70 and this is the only concealer that does not cake up under my eyes.  I would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Best concealer ever! Just dab will do.</li>
    <li> Conceals better than drugstore brands, but only about as well as the Clinique Airbrush concealer...and needs to be touched up about as often as it, too--usually midday....It does come in more colors, and you need less of it, but I would not call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;--I have genetically dark circles--have had them since the age of 5...covering them since a teen...and I have yet to find a miracle--but I am still hoping :)</li>
    <li> I had a trial size of this product for almost a year since you only need a small dot of it to cover under eye circles and small blemishes. This size will probably last me for 2 years.  It&#x27;s well worth the price for the value and coverage that it provides.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll only need tiny bit at a time, because it covers so much. It feels smooth, almost like powder. And it blends right after you apply. It&#x27;s my favorite concealor so far!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I had a similar experience as one of the other reviewers. I ordered the concealer in Medium but received a Tan shade instead. I&#x27;ve been using the Miracle Skin Transformer for the face from Sephora in Medium, so I knew that was the correct shade for me. The Tan shade is too dark for my skin and I&#x27;m unable to use it. I&#x27;ve reached out to the seller to request a return, however, they don&#x27;t accept them. Make sure you read their return/exchange policy before ordering.</li>
    <li> Color was horrible. Went on cakey and accentuated lines.  May be good at covering but at what expense?? Accentuated lines.</li>
    <li> Works fabulously! Covers well too. Good for scar coverage and little tube lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Perfect for those parts that need to be concealed.</li>
    <li> I discovered this a few years ago after reading a review in the WSJ of their tinted moisturizer.  This is my daily eye treatment, and it really does works miracles.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Had a strange consistency, and provided zero coverage. Also, it separated on my skin throughout the day. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> While at first I was pleased with the color and creamy texture of this product, I didn&#x27;t feel that it wore well throughout the day any better than grocery store concealer.  I will use it up but won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. Makes skin look flawless and airbrushed. One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and nice smooth feeling</li>
    <li> AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH COVERAGE I NEED IT DELIVERS AND ALSO IMPROVES THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN</li>
    <li> I applied as directed and it started burning my skin.  My chin acne got worse with one application.  Will not buy again.  Wish I could return.</li>
    <li> Best coverup really covers my lines. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> So so, great coverage but doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent or heal breakouts!  I read the ingredients carefully &amp; as an Esthetician saw that the ingredients were something to brag about.  However, it wasn&#x27;t...only because it had 0 effect helping my breakout.  I would&#x27;ve gave it 2 stars but the coverage is great &amp; smooth velvety texture too, so I felt generous.  Too pricey so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Received the product really quick, product is way lighter than I thought it would be, I have to really blend it in well with my translucent powder, but it does cover imperfections OK. I don&#x27;t know if there is a darker shade or not will check and see if I can return it for that one.</li>
