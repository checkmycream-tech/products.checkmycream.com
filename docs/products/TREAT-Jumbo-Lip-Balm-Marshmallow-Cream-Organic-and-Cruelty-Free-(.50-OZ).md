      <li>In fact, all the ingredients are easily identified on the label (coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax, flavor, stevia, and vitamin E).</li>

      <li>It glides right on and even though the tube is large you are still able to throw it in your purse on the go.</li>
      <li>Using products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals is important to me and for a company to share the same love for animals is a huge reason I&#x27;ll be a customer.</li>
      <li>First, this is organic, natural, toxin free, and cruelty free so I can feel good about using it and letting my young daughter use it.</li>

      <li>I love that it has all natural and organic ingredients.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let&#x27;s discuss how big this thing is. Everyone thinks I&#x27;m using a glue stick on my lips. Lol. And then the taste is great. And the quality, I&#x27;m so amazed. I love this chapstick. It smells just like Marshmallows and it&#x27;s cruelty free.. treat beauty this is amazing</li>
    <li> Makes my lips feel so good after I use it.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!  I LOVE this lip balm!  It is SO BIG (you need your whole hand to hold it!) and feels so soft and nice on your lips!  I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this balm.  It&#x27;ll last a long time and I couldn&#x27;t possibly lose this in my purse!  *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably purchased ten of these lip balms.  Nothing else compares!</li>
    <li> This balm is huge! It will definitely last a long time. It smells and tastes fabulous! It is highly moisturizing with a smooth rich formula that glides on and feels great. Its cruelty free and all natural and organic! Amazing! Hands down, the best lip balm ever! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> THIS IS HUGE!!! I knew it was going to be larger than my normal lip balm but this is crazy! I Love it! I was given this lip balm at a special prices in exchange for my honest review to share with everyone. There is nothing bad to say about this lip balm!  My kids love it because of the flavor and it also doesn&#x27;t not burn their lips like chapstick and other balms. It has a great sent and is not all sticky.  It glides right on and even though the tube is large you are still able to throw it in your purse on the go. I think that this balm between me and my 2 little ones will last us at least a year!</li>
    <li> Wow, this lip balm is AMAZING!  I am in love.  First, this is organic, natural, toxin free, and cruelty free so I can feel good about using it and letting my young daughter use it. In fact, all the ingredients are easily identified on the label (coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax, flavor, stevia, and vitamin E). Not only that but it feels silky and hydrating on my lips.  I am finding I don&#x27;t have to reapply it as much as my previous lip balm which is even better since as a busy mom I don&#x27;t always think about it.  The marshmallow scent is awesome, it smells like a rice crispy treat, in fact now I may have to make rice crispy treats ;). Finally this tube is HUGE, so it is definitely worth the money!  I am including a picture of this tube with a regular sized tube of lip balm to compare. This Chapstick is one of my favorites and I may have to get a few more for Mother&#x27;s Day gifts coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is the biggest lip balm I&#x27;ve ever seen! I keep it in my purse so I can use it all day. It really does smell like marshmallows, too! It&#x27;s cured my winter chapped lips and they are soft and smooth now. I like it&#x27;s big size so I will have it awhile. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase another when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product but it&#x27;s huge and I feel like I am putting it all over my face and chin instead of my lips.</li>
    <li> Delicious scent; buttery feel; realistic marshmallow taste; substantial, easy to hold/use size...great for whole family. Still, I prefer the Hurraw brand the best.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful!  One swipe and have both your top and bottom lips covered!</li>
    <li> So lovely for my lips and smells/tastes amazing!</li>
    <li> These lip balms last FOREVER! They smell delicious and are super moisturizing! Thrilled that the company went completely organic with these! My favorite lip balm hands down! Even got the BF to use one (BTW, Treat, would you consider making a more man-friendly one, that fits nicely in a pant pocket!?). Make great gifts too!</li>
    <li> This makes my lips feel so soft and smells yummy! Also I knew it was going to be a big tube but this was much bigger than I anticipated! :)</li>
    <li> The best lip moisturizer ever. The marshmallow is awesome.  Going to try peach and coconut next.  Buying one for all my friends</li>
    <li> Smells great. Application isn&#x27;t great. Can&#x27;t quite pinpoint what the problem is. Not very smooth and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I have the treat pink buttercream lip balm as well &amp; love them both. They smell amazing &amp; are very hydrating &amp; silky. I keep one one my vanity to apply before lipstick &amp; one on my nightstand to apply before bed. Love that they don&#x27;t have any crazy ingredients. The marshmallow is my favorite scent. Smells just like Rice Krispie treats!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll open with I have pretty sensitive skin...this made me break out badly all around my mouth/chin. Careful ladies</li>
    <li> Just awesome... Everything is great about it</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It&#x27;s thick and long lasting (the consistency and wear is exactly like Chapstick) and the best part is - it&#x27;s all natural!!!  My toddler also really likes the taste and it makes it so much easier to put it on her. It really does taste like marshmallows!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes pretty well, better than Baby Lips. I felt some of the grit that some reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. If anything that&#x27;s good for exfoliation :) Smells nice, tastes a little sweeter than I expected, but that&#x27;s okay! Very big, it does look like a glue stick, lol. I want to try the vanilla one now!</li>
    <li> There are so many reasons why I love this lip balm. It&#x27;s gigantic for one, MUCH larger than your average lip balm. Also, it&#x27;s cruelty free and organic. Using products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals is important to me and for a company to share the same love for animals is a huge reason I&#x27;ll be a customer. This lip balm smells absolutely delicious too and applies perfectly. It makes my lips so smooth. I love that it&#x27;s three times bigger than any other lip balm because it will be easy to find when you&#x27;re roaming around in your purse without looking! It will last such a long time too. This is a fantastic price for such a large lip balm. Now i need to purchase all the other flavors! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> To me personally it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as everyone says, I don&#x27;t really care for the taste. BUT it moisturizes my lips so well!!!! That being said I would like to buy a second one, just a different flavor next time.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! It&#x27;s healing and smells incredible.</li>
    <li> Smell so I sweet and yummy!!!!! It&#x27;s vegan and I love how moisturized my lips stay for so many hours. Better than eos. Big size, will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this! It smells so good! The only thing that doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> Its like the episode of spongebob when Patrick put everything on Wumbo. Lol this thing is huge. it feels great on my lips and I know it will keep my lips feeling great! I love that even though its big it fits in my pocket. It smells like a Marshmallow. I think it will last me a whole year. I received this for inspection and my unbiased honest review.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good and it&#x27;s very moisturizing on the lips. The size is really ideal also, the small chapstick tubes always get lost by me. This one is impossible to lose and it will last forever. Way better than EOS as well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Sweet with staying power.  Now to try the other scents!</li>
    <li> Love love love this! I love that it has all natural and organic ingredients. It smells great! Just don&#x27;t let it melt; it starts to go soft just being in my pocket.</li>
    <li> This has saved my lips and i use it everyday. I love how it is cruelty free and is all natural, the taste is amazing and is a bit smokier than the soft candy. i couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it :P it lasts very long, I put a bunch on at night and it still stays in the morning. I cannot believe that this product does not get the credit it deserves this is amazing. Just remember to not let it sit in the car on a hot day because I forgot it and it melted :( but it can be quickly fixed with a short blast of a blow dryer on low setting. I love it and will repurchase until they stop making it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Lasts and like the large size and that it is organic</li>
    <li> love that it has coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin e - my lips have never felt better.  love that it is huge and smells delicious too</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried every chap stick and lip balm/conditioner/salve/ointment/treatment only to be met with some sort of chemical taste followed by a sickly sweet artificial flavor of some sort!!!  Not anymore with this ☺️!  A perfect lip balm/chap stick with NO chemical taste and a faint lovely flavor!  I saw this on you tube from Kandee Johnson and figured if she liked it I would give it a try. I&#x27;m going to buy one of every flavor!  She was right about these and I&#x27;m thrilled. I will stock pile and stash these everywhere now. Customer for life!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm in my opinion. I love the scent and it is extremely moisturizing</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AND tastes like candy. OMG Sooo yummy. My husband loves kissing me when I put this on. It isn&#x27;t over the top smell wise, just enough. This works great at really conditioning and softening my lips, not just coating it with junk that dries them out worse. The last tube of this I bought lasted me two years so if you ask me $9.99 is a great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome has made such a huge difference compared to Carmex and all the others. biggest plus is that it actually soothes instead of burns when I put it on!</li>
