<li> and it doesnt last as long as it use to,  but overall</li>
<li> It has a different consistency, and the fragrance is lighter and lasts less.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product, it&#x27;s hard to tell, I bought 2 bottles and they both look the same as my leftover bottles of Angel Mist, as for the fragrance, I am undecided at this point</li>
<li> Shipping was crazy fast too..</li>
<li> I just could not believe it was discontinued at Victoria&#x27;s Secret, knowing it&#x27;s the only scent I can tolerate.</li>
<li> A friend was having trouble locating VS Divine.</li>
<li> I prefer the lighter body mists to the heavy perfumes, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
<li> I apparently ordered the wrong thing!  </li>
<li> Hard to Find.  </li>
<li> Also, FYI, I found out today, at the Victoria Secret store, the reason Victoria Secret discontinued this line is because it was not selling, so they pulled it off the market.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
<li> Sad day at my house when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>

    <li> always smells exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.... I hope you never run out. My husband, children, nieces &amp; nephews Know me by this scent LOL</li>
    <li> great smell and a great price. was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I just could not believe it was discontinued at Victoria&#x27;s Secret, knowing it&#x27;s the only scent I can tolerate. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here in Amazon and at a great price, too. I&#x27;ll definitely stock up.</li>
    <li> I love my Victoria&#x27;s scents, but this one did not agree with me at all.  I ended up giving both away as gifts to others. Not what I was expecting,</li>
    <li> I apparently ordered the wrong thing!  Disappointed.  My mistake</li>
    <li> Scent is very light, soothing, just beautiful smelling fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product, it&#x27;s hard to tell, I bought 2 bottles and they both look the same as my leftover bottles of Angel Mist, as for the fragrance, I am undecided at this point whether it is the real deal or not, I am finding this products scent does not last as long as the one I bought in the store.  Maybe it is my imagination thinking is it real or not.  Also, FYI, I found out today, at the Victoria Secret store, the reason Victoria Secret discontinued this line is because it was not selling, so they pulled it off the market.  Also, I am a first time Amazon purchaser, so maybe a little sceptical.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. A+++</li>
    <li> Love it, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am saddened that it has been discontinued.  Sad day at my house when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> A friend was having trouble locating VS Divine. I was happy to find it on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price. And I needed it quickly and the speed of delivery was perfect!</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to purchase a perfumed body spray that is no longer available at Victoria Secret. It arrived in a timely manner and I am very pleased with the process it took to receive this product.</li>
    <li> All time fav body spray for VS</li>
    <li> This was great since my Grandma used it and she has past on I wanted the perfume to keep her in my memories thanks</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and came fast!</li>
    <li> So in LOVE with my favorite body mist from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  I smell yummy.  Folks have to remember that this is the BODY MIST and NOT the EAU DE PARFUM!  It has a different consistency, and the fragrance is lighter and lasts less.  But for the PRICE, you cannot beat it.  I prefer the lighter body mists to the heavy perfumes, but that&#x27;s just me.  This bottle should last through the summer and I will order another if I can get my hands on one.  I rotate &amp;#34;Divine&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;Heavenly&amp;#34;, but &amp;#34;Divine&amp;#34; is by far my fave.</li>
    <li> My favorite VS body spray. Shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> spray did not function &amp; leaked</li>
    <li> The order came quickly. It smells like a lot of alcohol is in it and it doesnt last as long as it use to,  but overall, it still smells good. I cant wait for it to make its way back if it ever  does.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again.  Thank You</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars because it awesome I love the smell but it didn&#x27;t arrive on time!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  I was pleased I could find it.</li>
