<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff. First day there is a scent too it. There after it goes away. Bare with it for a nice golden glow.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect color for my skin.  I&#x27;ve bought it over and over.  no streaks and great color fast.  Yes, the guide color does wash off with water, but under that is your permanent skin color.  The more often you use it the darker you get and then you can use it less often.  If you don&#x27;t give it 30 minutes or so to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it will rub off on your clothes.  I put it on after a shower and then blow dry my hair, etc. and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Thought this was good to begin with. Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like some fake tan. Definitely had to leave 3 hours as not dark enough otherwise. Doesn&#x27;t tan legs well for some reason. However after a few days I started itching and it&#x27;s actually a nightmare. I could scratch my skin off its so irritating. Won&#x27;t use again. Massive waste of money for me sadly</li>
    <li> I love the color and application is easy</li>
    <li> After searching, testing and looking kinda orange for sometime, I&#x27;m glad to say my search for the perfect self tanner has come to an end!  Fake Bake, is everything is claims to be... and do!  It instantly gives you a great sun-kissed tan without having to wait DAYS for that gradual &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34;.  This product is super easy to use, doesn&#x27;t transfer, has a beautiful beach MILD scent, that goes away pretty quickly! In order to maintain the tan, its best if you use it every other day, and of course BE EASY BREEZY!  I&#x27;m extremely happy with the seller as they shipped items super fast and arrived well packaged!  Def, my staple HG self tanner!</li>
    <li> As so many others, I have tried tons of self tanning products . Some good, some bad, some really bad. This one is great for good color. After you figure out just how to apply it best, the color is great! There are a few things to learn along the way, but by my sexing bottle I was loving it!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t apply after you SHAVE &amp; or a hot shower- this opens your pores &amp; allows the product to settle in them, this causes those yucky brown dots all over your legs, face etc. Shave &amp; EXFOLITATE&#x27; the night before or a few hours prior to applying. I find putting it on &amp; going to bed is best. I wake up to fab color, not that much rinses off ( depending on how much you slap on!) . You don&#x27;t need much, color guide is dark &amp; it&#x27;s better to need a second coat than to over do it &amp; look terrible! ;)&lt;br /&gt;I keep coming back to this tanner , I try others  but there&#x27;s always something I don&#x27;t like. This Is easy, good color, not that expensive and doesn&#x27;t make me break out! Just remember the \\&quot;pore\\&quot; thing &amp; you&#x27;ll have a great tan with this stuff. Never cared for the FB lotion, too thick &amp; hard to spread. This speeds easy with the mitt , another plus to this . I would def say to try this if your looking for a good self tanner &amp; have bought &amp; used almost every one out there but were not satisfied. Well worth the reasonable price.  Jenn~</li>
    <li> Truly is flawless. I have recommended to several friends, and turned several friend on to this.  I heard about this product from a friend that purchased it at a local salon. ($25).  And I went and purchased a bottle myself. I loved it, but had to find a more economical means to be able to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;I order 2 or 3 of these every single summer.  The color is very subtle, and just as the name states its flawless. I&#x27;ve never had streaks or splotches, or problems with it looking bad, except for when i have tried to do mutiple applications in one day to achieve a much darker color. (apply, let it dry, apply again, let it dry, etc)  I highly recommend Only one application a day.  I probably dont apply as directions recommend, but love my results.  It does not last as long or stay with you as most self tanners. (but it doesnt give you a dark stain or streaks either!!)  i apply every morning before leaving to go to work. I mist my sponge applicator and wipe on my legs, and arms and neck/chest area.  Even when i am tanning this gives me extra color and cranks my tan up a notch.  It will stay with you a day or two but quickly fades. but the bottle last so long, and takes so little, it last forever, even applying to bare legs every day.  Very little to no odor.  Dries very quickly.  It is a water consistency when you spray it out of the bottle.  I recommend the sponge be washed with soap and warm water every week or two.  (I wash mine in the bathroom sink after an application, and slide over the bottle so it will stand up and air dry) If not the tanner left on the sponge starts to turn green, and when you apply it to your legs it will have that green tint.  This application comes wtih 2 purple rubber gloves. I do not wear my gloves, but keep them inside the glove and keep the gloves between my palm and the sponge.  It will stain your palms.  I have been using this product for over 4 years.  These bottles used to have a really bad problem with them leaking.  But the manufacturer has corrected this problem, and they no longer leak.  I do a lot of traveling, and keep an overnight bag packed and ready to grab and walk out the door.  I purchased one of the small empty spray bottles at the drug store, and keep a small bottle and one of my old sponges packed in my overnight bag for weekend trips.  This stuff truly is great if you just want a little color.  Don&#x27;t expect a hawaiian tropic tan overnight.  It does get a little darker every day, with daily use.  I also recommend bathing at night to keep it from coming off on your sheets.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, easy application &amp; smells great!:)</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying a self tanner. I did a lot of research and decided to buy fake bake. I tried it for the first time and I really love the the natural tan color it gives me. It&#x27;s not orange at all!! I&#x27;m reall happy with this product so far. The down side is probably gonna be the up keep and re exfoliating and applying weekly  but at least I&#x27;m not exposing my self to harmful rays to achieve how tan I am!</li>
    <li> I have used this many times before. Such an amazing product. Great quality. Actually gives you a nice tan. Easy application. Not orange! Love it!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion around! I&#x27;ve tried many others and always go back to this. The color is great and it doesn&#x27;t steak like other brands. Love this and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;m as pale as they come and have tried several different self tanners and all have been streaky or orange. Thats just not the case with fake bake flawless. It is extremely easy to apply and smells great! The only downfall is that it does have a strange odor after awhile.</li>
    <li> I have used Fake Bake Flawless for a couple of years and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I received Fake Bake Flawless Darker. It&#x27;s in silver packaging instead of purple so I knew right away it was the wrong product. I checked online to see if I had mistakenly put the wrong item in my cart but I didn&#x27;t. Since I needed it before leaving town and didn&#x27;t have time to return the dark one, I gave it a try. It works the same, smells the same, comes with the mitt, but is significantly darker. I have pretty fair skin so it definitely looked like I had applied a ton of self tanner. The regular fake bake is a great product and looks natural. But I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again because of the huge inconvenience.</li>
    <li> This self tanner had awesome reviews so I decided to give it a try. It arrived much sooner than I expected. I&#x27;ve only used it one time since I got it, but so far I like it. It has a nice coconut smell when applying. The next day it did kind of have that self tanning smell, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I loved that it came with gloves AND a mitt for application. Usually you have to buy them separate. I put it on in my bathroom and thought the lighting was good, but could see spots I had missed when I went into another room. So I recommend applying in a very well lit room.</li>
    <li> Does a good job with coverage but need to plan ahead. Second application smooths and covers areas missed the first time. But I really like how easy it is to use and the mitt is fantastic!  (Don&#x27;t know how we ever used this stuff without a mitt!). As far as sunless tanners go...this is the best I&#x27;ve used. Must follow directions!</li>
    <li> Awesome...Easy to apply looks great..</li>
    <li> This gives the best color and is the most noticeable of the self tanners I have tried. It&#x27;s my favorite tanner to use on hands/feet. The only downfall is that it fades rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I like using the mitt and the end result. I will tell my friends about this product.</li>
    <li> I have used few different tanning products and this type is my favorite. The color is natural looking and pretty easy to get on with out streaks. For some reason the store I usually get it at has stopped selling it so I was happy to find some online</li>
    <li> I love the way Fake Bake tans me.  I am a reformed sun worshipper, and I miss having a deep brown tan for half the year.  I have tried all the tanning creams and lotions out there, and Fake Bake is the first to turn my skin an authentic color of brown, instead of the orangey colors the other brands call tan.  The bonuses are the tropical scent and the easy application.  I will never consider tanning in the sun again!</li>
    <li> I love the color this gives me. It goes on even and smooth. The only complaint I have is it does not fade evenly.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY self tanning products and this is by far my favorite. It was so easy to apply, lasted about a week, and it smelled so good! It wasn&#x27;t sticky, and it dried quick. I love the dark color I get from it too. This will definitely be my #1 product for self tanning! The only con is it doesn&#x27;t work well on the face, just makes it look dirty. But I have purchased the fake bake face product and I&#x27;m going to give that a try!</li>
    <li> This has been my all time favorite in regards to color and smell. I love that they include gloves (which are very necessary! As well as the mitt, which is also necessary.&lt;br /&gt;If I do back to back applications over a couple of days my color generally lasts for over a week, which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It will build up a little if you are not careful, especially on the inside of the arms near the pit.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottle is a pump and more than not when I try to spray it directly on me it ends up dripping big drops that I have to hurry and rub in. I have gotten to the point where I spray it on the mitt or have even poured it a little in to the mitt. Also, because of this, it is difficult to get my back done by myself.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!:&lt;br /&gt;Do not wear white if you will be in the sun with this product and are prone to sweating. It will stain your clothing! My stomach/chest sweats a lot when I am really hot and I looked down one day, the entire front of my shirt was splotchy with brown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pic posted was taken immediately after applying. I have light olive complexion, so I tan fairly easy, but was pretty white on this day, before applying.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used! No streaking, minimal smell, very easy to apply, almost instant color.  The only negative thing is that it will rub off on white clothing and on bed sheets, although it doesn&#x27;t stain.  It would also be nice if the color lasted longer...it has to be reapplied every other day.</li>
    <li> It does make your skin a nice, even color. To my surprise, when I got into the shower the day after putting it on...it washed right off and down the drain! I can only imagine how embarrassing it would have been if that would have happened in the pool!!</li>
    <li> blends easily.  if there are lines, it&#x27;s easy enough to blend more product in and correct.  doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes if given enough time.  looks natural.  not messy</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it gives me the most beautiful color, it doesn&#x27;t streak me at all, &amp; it smells so good, I look like I have been tanning for weeks &amp; it done this over night, I will be buying this again, &amp; the shipping was very fast :))))</li>
    <li> I have always liked this self tanner, its inexpensive and blends well. I have gone back to this product even after using the high end products.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  Gradually makes you darker.  Not orange.  Doesn&#x27;t get streaky.  Doesn&#x27;t get darker on knees, elbows,etc.  Nice, natural golden tan color!  LOVE IT.  Never liked a tanner before using this one.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d put it on as directed at night and then go to bed, in the shower in the morning most of it washed away and what didn&#x27;t wash away was a huge orange mess that stained my skin for a month!! I looked like a hot, orange mess! Totally not worth it! Stay far, far away!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite tanning spray!  It looks more natural than anything I have ever used.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I found Fake Bake to be very useable, no streaking, good color, I will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product! It definitely works.. it&#x27;s easy to type apply and does not streak. It gave me a slight tan the first time I applied it. After using it 3 times, I had a very nice tan!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like was that the glove gets pretty worn out after a few uses. It&#x27;s not the best quality glove, but definitely better and easier to use than the rubber gloves that also come with it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff you could ever buy. Comes in a hurry and i just love it. so easy to apply, u can watch you tube videos</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used. It does not fade away patchy. After I had applied this at night and got a shower the next day my tan was still there. Yes some did wash away but that is the bronzer you can see while applying to make sure you have covered every area. I didn&#x27;t notice any transfer to my clothes, and got many compliment on my tan. A few of my friends even asked if I had gone tanning. The glove makes application easy and effortless. Also make sure to exfoliate before applying the self tanner!</li>
    <li> This is the Best Stuff Ever</li>
    <li> I have used this brand several times for the last 3 years  and I don&#x27;t know if it is out of date/ watered down, I just have patches of tan all over!&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this purchase to say the least.</li>
    <li> It looked and smelled great, but I work out a lot and my sweat made streak marks!</li>
    <li> This tanner is amazing! I&#x27;ve used a lot of drugstore brands and nothing compares to this stuff. Also I usually get really itchy on my legs after using the drugstore bought lotions and sprays and I have not had any reaction to fake bake! I love being tan (fake tan) and this product has been great. Just ordered again.</li>
    <li> first time i tried a tanning product that didnt streak on me and didnt make me orange!!! love this stuff and will always go back to this product if i want a tan!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but I just couldn&#x27;t. The very first few times I applied the color,  it looked good. But after a few washes and a few more applications, I started to turn orange and my knees looked like I had been playing in dirt; splotchy and orange. Maybe I received a bad bottle, but I had to throw it out unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This is a really good size bottle!!! SEVERAL applications here.  It is a beautiful color.  Either get the face product or use this VERY sparingly on the face - it seems to take TOO well on my face haha.  HIGHLY recommended if you can&#x27;t afford to go get routine spray tans.  You&#x27;re going to get what you need from this for probably a couple months if you are applying once a week or so.  I don&#x27;t use a lot - maybe that&#x27;s why mine is lasting so long :) The mitt that comes with it is SUPER, although I have to have help on my back...</li>
    <li> I love everything about except I have to put it on everyday to keep the tan. It is so natural looking and no streaks. This is my second bottle and it&#x27;s the only thing I use now. It&#x27;s a must have :)</li>
    <li> Maybe most of these positive reviews are written before people shower??!&lt;br /&gt;Because every time I&#x27;ve used this tanner, it looks awesome after I apply at night, but then the next morning in the shower I watch it all wash down the drain!  Frustrating.  It&#x27;s one of the few I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smell so horrid, that I want to jump out of my own skin from the constant stench.  Oh well....off to look for more options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 20 fake tan products, from high end ($70) to drugstore brands and this one is the absoulte best. It&#x27;s easy to apply, looks so real, smells really good (like piña colada), and I always get compliments on my awesome tan! Such an amazing product, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT!! And didn&#x27;t make me orange which was a major plus... I recommend this product to anyone wanted a nice, natural tan! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Not orange!  I have used for a month a few times of week and have had so many compliments on my tan.  It is very easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  I apply at night and shower in the morning.  You can see some of it washing off, but if you think about it, the other brands probably wash off as well, but they aren&#x27;t tinted so you can&#x27;t see it.  I have recommended this to everyone!  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My go to self tanner!</li>
    <li> I Love Fake Bake.  I found it summer of 2012, and loved it.  Was so glad to find it this summer at half the price!!</li>
    <li> The color is awesome (no orange)and it smells like coconut! Does not have the typical smell... I&#x27;m a regular stay tanner and this is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> The best.  No fuss.  Not messy or smelly.  Goes on even and the color is as natural as the sun.</li>
    <li> Love it! It dries super fast, not sticky and pretty and dark colour</li>
    <li> I absolutely love being tan, but I&#x27;m not at a stage in life where I&#x27;m outside in the sun all the time. I&#x27;m also awful with sunless tanner, so I ordered this product with some hesitation. I followed  a previous reviewers advice, and cut the straw before use to eliminate dripping (have never had an issue). This goes on with some color, so it&#x27;s very easy to see where spots are missed (which is always my problem). I put lotion on my feet, hands, elbows, and knees, before I start, and do a very light swipe across them. If they do get over-colored, it&#x27;s pretty easy to wash them into a normal shade of tan. It usually takes about two applications to get the color I want, which lasts about a week. I definitely recommend this product, and have subscribe &amp; saved it!</li>
    <li> I tend to use this and try not to shower, b/c after I do, so much of the color is gone. I think it looks the best when it&#x27;s first applied. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take time to do product reviews but this is just one of those products that you find that really works well and will continue to use. I use it about once/twice a week and I am never streaky or orange. Its pretty hard to go wrong with Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with fair skin in their twenties who is over the whole tanning bed and laying out for extended amounts of time (unless at the beach). I chose to try this product before breaking out my white legs this spring. I can have a nice hint of color or look as (naturally) dark as I&#x27;d like to.--Without the guilt of laying out for too long.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Perfect bronze tan after just my first use!</li>
    <li> Okay so I just applied this for the first time last night. The color is nice and the scent isn&#x27;t bad. It was very hard to apply to the back of my legs since I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing. I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my feet look either. I think it&#x27;s a pretty good product but think the application instructions could be more specific. My advice would be to have some one else apply it for you. I will not be wearing and shorts or even sandals until this wears off.</li>
    <li> The tanner itself is the BOMB! Only tanner I have ever used that does not look fake (despite the name;), doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, and doesn&#x27;t smell gross.  It leaves a beautiful even tan and I also like the scent (coco-nutty).  The only complaints I have are that the bottle was leaky at the top by the spray nozzle from the first use-so it drips everywhere- and that the mitt seems to be decomposing after only about 5-7 applications.  I think it is key that you wash it out and air dry it after every application.  I&#x27;m sure it was just a faulty bottle as well though b/c I don&#x27;t see a lot of other complaints about leakage.  Hands down this is totally worth it and at an affordable, fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 years now &amp; have not found anything that&#x27;s better or more fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Instant AMAZING color!!!&lt;br /&gt;Looks NATURAL&lt;br /&gt;Basically fool proof&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Comes off a little on clothes (Always washes out)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get wet after applying, will show spots</li>
    <li> The first application using the mitt was great. Color blends &amp; stays really well. By far the best I have used. Smell is not bad - didnt smell like all the other sunless products. The one complaint is with the mitt. After about the 2nd use it started wearing out- little pieces of it would come off while applying. I did not wash it between the two applications- maybe that would&#x27;ve helped. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> By far the best self tanner i ever used, no smell, no stickiness, inexpensive, stays on for a reasonable amount of time ,,, about 4 days for me, def recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it and I&#x27;m like vampire white, it turns kinda orange at first BUT THATS JUST THE COLOR GUARD don&#x27;t be alarmed after 4-6 hrs shower n it&#x27;s a nice glow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake Original for years and discovered the Tanning Liquid on Amazon while looking to reorder. After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. The smell is better than the original, but doesn&#x27;t last. It feel that it leaves a nice base tan look, but I think the original has a deeper and much more natural color. This one dries super fast making it difficult to get an even look. I have never had a problem with streaking with the original, yet somehow I have managed to miss spots almost every time I have applied this one. I gave it 4 stars because it is still one of the most natural self tanners on the market. Fake Bake products are the best.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend. I have used St. Tropez before and I like it but this is better! It&#x27;s so easy to apply and dries super quick! I didn&#x27;t have any problems with splotches and the color was really noticeable. I had a few ppl ask me if I went tanning even! I&#x27;m pretty pasty though in the winter so maybe it was just a big difference from my normal color. It even went really well on my face, which usually isn&#x27;t the case with self tanners. Doesn&#x27;t last too long on skin but the bottle seems never ending so when I finally do run out I will definitely purchase again and it&#x27;s super cheap so that&#x27;s nice too!!</li>
    <li> i have tried tons and tons of spray tans but i honestly cant get enough of fake bake! i always find myself coming back to this product it smells amazing its easy to apply and the bottle last for a while!!! but i use it all the time so about 2 months for me haha! BUT love how it comes with a mitt and a nozzle to apply it on which is great!! The tan looks like a tan!!! i get complements all the time about my completion and i just tell them its fake bake</li>
    <li> I have searched reviews and tried so many self-tanners I had nearly given up. After watching Youtube videos and reading reviews on this one, I decided to try yet another one. Atlas! I found one I truly love. The color it gave was an instant golden brown glow and the initial smell was great and even the later day smell was good. I love how quickly this product dries and how great I feel with the color! Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than a lot of other things (Jergens). And it makes you smell like sweet potatoes, I hope you like sweet potatoes. The only thing I have a problem with is how it fades after a few days. And don&#x27;t use it on your face. You look like you tripped and slid in dirt. Not attractive. The bottles doesn&#x27;t last but 9 applications but don&#x27;t sparse out on areas that you think aren&#x27;t a big deal. It&#x27;s noticeable and gross.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d a great product. Easy to apply with the mitt and gloves so it really doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks if you know how to apply it and take the proper steps to prep your skin prior to applying it. The only CON is that it settles into my pores but that&#x27;s my problem and not the product&lt;br /&gt;Great buy that&#x27;ll give you a great temporary tan</li>
    <li> Great natural looking tan. Does&#x27;t streak and easy application.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it stays for days and it dries in seconds. Once you wash it off it DOES NOT rub off on clothes even white white outfits!!!! I have tried several products over the years and once I used this I stopped looking.</li>
    <li> Yep, a fake tanner that really works.....is easy to use.....smells great.....  I know.  Honestly.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.  I have used every fake tanner here in California.....and every fake tanner available in south Germany and northern France.  THIS product beats ALL of those.</li>
    <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t waste your money on this it just is a gross looking tan and you just constantly loon dirty</li>
    <li> I wish I could give half stars, because this is more of a 3.5 for me.  It&#x27;s not the end-all-be-all that people claim, but it definitely is better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the color.  It&#x27;s very natural, and I always get compliments when I use this.  People legitimately think I just came from vacation, so that&#x27;s impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love how much work goes into putting this stuff on.  I&#x27;d prefer just the aerosol spray, because this is sort of labor intensive.  Also, I find it difficult to perfect the technique.  Sometimes it goes on flawlessly, but other times it collects in every hair follicle on my leg.  So rather than having tan legs, I have pale legs with tan-accented hairs.  Not sure what I&#x27;m doing differently. (And I&#x27;m not asking for suggestions, so keep it to yourself.)</li>
    <li> Works great on my fair skin.  Very natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> Love this self Tanner. Doesn&#x27;t make me sweat. Dries fast. Isn&#x27;t sticky. And smells great.</li>
    <li> This was awesome!~ I am white, real white, chalk white.  Marshmellow white.  This gave me a nice tint, no streaks, no orange, liver failure hue.  Just a nice tint.  It was easy to apply and well priced.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Just make sure you really go lightly on your knees and feet, because it will tend to darken those places more than others.</li>
    <li> I love this tanner! It looks so real and is easy to apply, I suggest you watch a video on Youtube on the best way to apply. Only one downfall, the mitt would be better if it fit a little tighter on your hand, it wants to slip off.</li>
    <li> Love Fake Bake. It gives you natural looking color, no orange! There&#x27;s no odor and it is so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> great stuff! i use it all year long to keep a nice glow instead of looking super pale!! the more you add on the darker you get! i dont tan well so this is great for those who dont tan easy!</li>
    <li> I have bought this self tanner multiple times. I have tried all kinds of other self tanner but this is by far my favorite! you see where you are applying because there is a color guard in it, so you get an even tan. it also fades nicely and not blotchy, which is also a plus for me since I am fair skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to find a great self tanner.</li>
    <li> Oddly this has been a hit in the past for me as I reordered again. However this time I experienced streaking after a shower. I waited overnight 10 hours before showering so I was disappointed this happened. I have used this product before and have never had this issue and did not change my process. I reapplied again determined to look tan in shorts and was successful with no streaks, so don&#x27;t give up on this one. Also I use in between getting natural tans and blends fine.</li>
    <li> Goes on super easy and isn&#x27;t streaky or orange looking. For only $12.95 it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Easy way to keep a summer glow.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  It is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Natural looking tan. Brown tan, not orange. No streaking. No orange knuckles. They also sent me a bottle of fake bake dry oil with it...accident, or does it come with it?</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this meaning it&#x27;s pretty okay. I ordered almost 3 weeks ago and it still hasn&#x27;t arrived. Should be here tomorrow or the next day though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell to this, which is great, but you can smell it if you are working out or taking a shower as water/sweat activates the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the mit, but I feel like you have to use a LOT to get a decent color. My last bottle lasted for about 4 full body applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so great for the face, since it makes you look blotchy. I prefer to use the lotion version on my face and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO streaks whatsoever! Huge bonus. I can seriously try to mess it up, and there are still no streaks. Woo!</li>
    <li> Best self tanning product I have purchased</li>
    <li> No more Tanning beds for me, this is great stuff ,DO Not be fooled by the Name It works and work very well follow directions to the letter for great results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of tanning beds since I was younger (probably around 15-18) and I always got great results in the bed, but once in awhile I would get burned from them changing the bulbs. I started using self tanners after I got my third tattoo and a lot of them made me orange... Which no one likes! I heard about this brand before, but was super skeptical to try, but I randomly decided one day I&#x27;m going to buy it. And oh my lord, the color I got after one coat! It&#x27;s just beautify and I&#x27;m obsessed with the whole Fake Bake line! Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you exploite and keep your skin moisturized! It helps your tan last longer</li>
    <li> Love it for a quick tan! But must plan on when to put it on, needs at least 24 hr to settle, if gets wet bleeds off. Oops! Otherwise no streaks, no orange great color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different self tanners. This is one of my favorites! Only use this product before bed! It does have a color guard in it so you will appear darker until you take a shower in the morning. It dries fast has a nice coconut/beachy smell. In the morning it does smell like a self tanner not the previous smell. One reason why I like it you can see where it goes and where you need to apply more. I used it for three days prior to a week vacation. It gives a nice natural tan. It lasted the whole week and came off natural not streaky. I used it once before my three day application and did not exfoliate before and it didn&#x27;t last. I then exfoliated once and applied three days in a row and it lasted! I recommend youtube a tutorial on in it prior to using for tips on applying!</li>
    <li> Did first application last night and I love it. So easy to apply. Washed off the guide this morning and was pleased with how it looked. No residue on my sheets or pajamas. Just make sure to exfoliate well before applying. Tan looks nice, no weird orange color.</li>
    <li> If you want a natural looking tan, this is the way to go! They have a MIT that shows exactly where u miss.. Only downfall is it is messy. I use this everyday and hear at least one compliment on how naturally tan I look and people are shocked I rarely hop in the tanning bed!! The best fake tan ever!!</li>
    <li> This product presents with a beautiful, natural looking tan. I would say that it goes on as close to flawless as you are going to get from a self-tanner. I am always hesitant when it comes to putting a product like this on my face but this is one that I do not have to worry about. I have pretty sensitive skin but this did not cause any irritation. Great buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Went on very smooth and even. People thought I got a spray tan. Very good for self tanner but the Skin Deep app rates it&#x27;s toxicity a 6 so not sure if I would order again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this self tanner. I&#x27;m extremely pale and live smack dab in the middle of Florida so having a tan is just.. well.. necessary! :) My disappointment is the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller, I imagine it was just my luck from Fake Bake having a fault in the bottle. Whenever I press down to spray the product onto my skin or the mitt (whichever!) it sprays out from the cap. How? I have no idea. It&#x27;s extremely messy and I pretty much have to seal my entire bathroom when I spray it on because I never know which of my personal belongings or part of my white countertop this stuff will stain. Thankfully it comes off easy but the entire process with this product is normally perfectly seamless, really sad this time. Will purchase again, perhaps just not from this seller.</li>
    <li> This review is for all you girls (or boys) out there who are Gingers like me, or otherwise have really pale skin. Ever since I was about fifteen years old and realized that my skin was literally the color of looseleaf paper, I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect way to get a little color. Not a lot of color, which looks tacky and fake, but just a little subtle color so that I&#x27;m no longer see through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without further ado, this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Dior Bronze down to Banana Boat and this is the most effective. Here&#x27;s how I rate effectiveness in my self tan products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. How natural the color looks. If I put on a self-tanner and I look even remotely orange and/or glittery, I don&#x27;t care what other great benefits it has, I would never buy it again.This one is by far the most natural that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. How even the color goes on. This is not the absolutely best product for that-- if streaking is your main concern, you should stick to gradual tan lotions and stay away from liquids. I have solved the problem with streaking with this product by mixing it with a little bit of self-tan lotion (I like St. Tropez best, but Jergens makes a pretty good cheaper alternative) and rubbing it in. You could also use the glove that is provided with the package, but I find that it still doesn&#x27;t prevent streaking fully, and a large amount of the liquid is absorbed into the glove, which is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. How long it lasts / evenly it fades. Again, this one holds up the best. No spray tan lasts forever, and I&#x27;m actually not a fan of the ones that brag about staying on for weeks, because I find that those tend to go splotchy and uneven. This one will be gone in a few days if you only apply once and then give up, but if you do what I do and mix a little in with your daily moisturizer, you&#x27;ll find yourself with a constant glow that never goes away completely. Another benefit of this trick is that you can change upthe ratio of Fake Bake to lotion to adjust the level of your tan. In the summer, I add more Fake Bake to my moisturizer to make it look like I actually have a bit of a tan. In the winter, I only add a little just to retain a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Whether I&#x27;m going to ruin all my clothes/sheets/towels/etc by wearing it. Before I discovered this method, I would literally avoid wearing anything light-colored for fear that I&#x27;d sweat and my self-tan would soak into my clothes. I also avoided rain, swimming pools, and generally being around water. Not the best way to live your life. My current method of mixing some of this stuff in with my regular moisturizer works brilliantly. I NEVER see traces of brown, stains, etc, on my clothes, and I don&#x27;t even shower in between applications. I put the mix of Fake Bake and moisturizer on right out of the shower each morning and it works wonders. (Added bonus: maintaining an even tan is a good way to incentivize us to moisturize every day like we&#x27;re supposed to!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, don&#x27;t waste your money on higher priced items- this is the best product for at home self-tanning.</li>
    <li> I love this more than the St.Tropez but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long, well none of the self tanners do besides the lotions. So i guess you could try to extend the tan with a self tan lotion of choice.</li>
    <li> The product smells very nice.  Kinda like a coconut beachy smell.  The color is pretty darn good.  dries fast and non sticky.  the mitt and gloves are amazing and provide a really even application.  would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The color is great, a nice brown with no orange, but not very dark.  The smell is amazing and it does dry fast!  Would be 5 stars all the way if not for the poor color level.  I like how I look with the color guide on but then it all washes off.</li>
    <li> This product is great. All my friends use it and I had to have some. You do not look orange and you can tell a different right away.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not work well as far as color goes and a couple days later I developed a itchy rash all over my legs and thighs.  It had to be this lotion as it was the only product I have used that is different and the rash is only where the lotion was applied.  I guess i am going to have to wait it out. I have used other tanning products without a problem but I will never use this again.&lt;br /&gt;Signed my legs are driving me crazy itchy</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily and evenly.  I don&#x27;t even need to use a plastic glove to use this product.  I just spray it directly onto the application glove to apply.  Very quick to go on, and very quick to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it would last longer.  I have to reapply every other day.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve tried every drugstore self tanner out there. I heard good things about this one so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s definitely the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever used, but its not perfect. I feel like its very high maintenance. Shave &amp; exfoliate before using. Apply. Leave on at least 4hrs. Shower again. Although the mit makes it easier to apply, you&#x27;ll still have splotchiness in some areas and the hands never look very natural. And if you shower daily as I do, you&#x27;ll notice how quickly it fades. Also, be careful if you work out after you rinse it off. No matter how well I rinse in the shower, if i work out &amp; sweat, it drips down my face &amp; neck. BUT I guess that&#x27;s the trade up with spray tans as opposed to a real tan. I still use it when I&#x27;m feeling especially pale because like I said, it&#x27;s definitely better than the drugstore sprays &amp; lotions</li>
    <li> Best fake tanner I have ever purchased/used. One application makes me look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for 3 months. Love it!!</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this product. Easy to use and drys quickly. But I notice it does rub on my clothes a bit.</li>
    <li> What is the best way to wash the mit ??  I am really happy with the product...only suggestion I would have is to try it on your legs first until you know how dark it is....</li>
    <li> Loved  it and it does not stink. That was the best part, plus it dries instantly and does not streak</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if chemicals are better than being radiated by the sun or tanning beds but my wife uses this daily.  She loves it and prefers it to all the other fake tanners.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally very fair so some sunless tanners look too fake on me because they are too dark. This one gave me a gorgeous natural glowing tan (not orange at all). The mitt makes it really easy to apply without streaks or dark patches on the knees or elbows. The color lasted for several days...longer than I had expected based on some other reviews. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those that hates being sickly pale, but I hate the feeling of tanning (philosophic much?) and I&#x27;m terrified of being wrinkly when I&#x27;m old, so I&#x27;m on a constant hunt for the perfect sunless tanner. I&#x27;ve tried dozens! Now, all sunless tanners are expensive. You pretty much get what you buy, I think with this one, you really get more. With airbrush cans, you can really only cover your body 2-3 times before it is out. I&#x27;ve been using this multiple times a week for about a month and I still have over half the bottle. Being that it is winter though, I typically only put it on my upper body, focusing on arms and chest since thats all that is exposed really. It is a perfect, realistic color. I shower before bed, then apply it. In the morning if I have any lines, I can blend them in pretty easy with a damp washcloth. I would not recommend this for your face, mine at least is too inconsistent with dry and oily patches so I looked quite splotchy the next morning. Instead, I use a gradual tan face moisturizer like Jergens. Be careful with the back of your hands too. If I don&#x27;t do mine at all, they end up looking too white, so I spray some on the mit and lightly buff over the tops of my hands, avoiding my knuckles. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another bottle when this runs out!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanning product I have ever used.  It goes on effortlessly, looks great and has absolutely no unpleasant scent.  I highly recommend this Fake Bake product and will be looking to purchase more from them myself!</li>
    <li> Since high school I have had this love for golden skin but being a redhead that was hard to come by for me. I did use tanning beds for way too long and finally decided to give it up for my future self&#x27;s sake. Being a single mom and a student I do not have a lot of extra money to spend so have mostly spent my years trying every drugstore and inexpensive sunless tanner you could think of. I finally decided to move up a money bracket higher when I got tired of turning orange and staining countless amounts of clothes.. That lead me to Fake Bake Flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a couple of months but I am in love!! I bought it locally not off of the internet but I feel like everyone should know that this stuff is the best!&lt;br /&gt;The fist application my color didn&#x27;t seem to change much at all and I was ready to sit down and right a nasty review but I kept at it. A couple of days later I did another round and the results were much more favorable! I did it about three times the first week to get to the color that I liked best but I don&#x27;t feel like I used that much tanner, or that it was a waste. Since then I have applied it once a week to maintain and it is just fabulous. This past week I have not used any at all and the tan has gradually faded but in a way that is not obvious and unlike some other tanners I have used it fades in a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way- it doesn&#x27;t turn more orange before it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave behind a mess. I wore a white skirt the day after an application and I didn&#x27;t have any tanner left on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great considering some tanners smell like.. nastiness.. The application is easy, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it with the mitt I&#x27;ve always just used my hands (blehk!) but the mitt is a fabulous addition. I watched some youtube videos to see the best way to apply and they helped too (I know, you&#x27;d think after 10 years of sunless tanning products I&#x27;d know how to apply them most efficiently but hey I&#x27;m a work in progress!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;Unless something else comes along of the same quality and costs less I can&#x27;t see myself switching- ever!?&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanning products and this is the best to date.&lt;br /&gt;Easy application and natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;All self-tanners have a &#x27;smell&#x27; to them, and Fake Bake is no exception- but the order is not as strong/offensive as many on the market. I&#x27;ve had no problem with the product rubbing off on clothing or bedding.</li>
    <li> first off the product shipped quick and i just tried it yesterday slept with the product on and its pretty decent good for a quick tan.</li>
    <li> Not as good as others that I have used and appears streaky if you go over the same body part more than once. On a positive note less odor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after seeing all the wonderful reviews, and I have to agree with most of them. It smells amazing and gives a gorgeous even tan that is buildable. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my tan and people asking me if I just got back from the carribean. It also smells amazing and leaves my skin super soft. There are only two complaints I have. One, I wish there was a way to have a different glove. It is lose wich I understand since you are constantly switching hands and taking it off to spray but sometimes while rubbing in the tanner the glove will slide off or rotate. Second complaint (and maybe it&#x27;s just me) but my hands look great the first day then soon I have \\&quot;brass knuckles\\&quot;. My recommendations when buying this product would be, wash the glove before first use, always exfoliate, and use lotion on dry skin and to maintain your tan.</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday on my legs and it was so easy to apply. I sprayed directly onto my skin but you can spray the glove first if you&#x27;re scared. The product blended in so evenly and gave me a great looking tan. The only issue I have with this product is the it shows all the pores in my legs; I assume this is because I shaved right before applying the product, so wait about a day after shaving and maybe that will help. Overall this is an amazing product that gives great results.</li>
    <li> i have been applying fake tan products for years and also do proffesionaly. This has got to be one of the best products on the market for those who want a nice natural even tan. it also appears to last quite well. Best used on a skin that already has a little colour from the sun but also looks nice applied onto pale skins. Does not look over done and gives a natural look.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best sunless tanner around. Put it on at night and in the morning when you shower it comes off evenly with no streaking. The only thing I wish is that the color would last longer, it is something that needs to be done I would say every other day if you want to keep the same color.</li>
    <li> Good color for fake tan..but hate that you can see every hair follicle on my legs! I shave and exfoliate before using and you can STILL see follicles...looks like i never even shaved. Hoping for better results on the rest of my body, but im half afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this product and love it! It gives a golden brown color on my skin with NO orangey tint. It does not have an odor like most self tanning products. I do not lay out in the sun but love looking like I did.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  I use it sparingly.  Great for some extra color especially if you are already a bit tan.  I really only use it on my legs as they seem to get less color than the rest of me :)  I also like to use it in the winter for a sun kissed look.  I spray just a pump or two on the mitt add a bit of water and rub it into the mitt than apply to my face. Without the water added to it the appearance is too dark, I am very fair tho. Be careful if you have any blemishes, scratches, dry patches bc the color will stick extra in those areas and leave them looking dark on your face.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;m a former tanning bed queen and sun worshiper  I miss having a tan and tried many other products that smelled gross and left you a funky orange color.  This doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and smells amazing, like tropical suntan lotion.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Worst ever! Smells like all the others, very blotchy and ORANGE!!</li>
    <li> I like the ease of application and the color, but it comes off on to my clothes.  I would certainly advise anyone purchasing to be aware that it may rub off on clothes or bedding.</li>
    <li> My favorite tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Not too dark, no streaking, and easy to apply. I would like it more if it stayed on longer. Have to use every other day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Looks  like a real tan.</li>
    <li> One of the better self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.  Not HG level but pretty good.  The problem with this (and most) is the layering process.  It begins to look bad after a few applications and/or after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell less offensive than most and the mitt it comes with is pretty nice as well.  The color is nice, not orange based which is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Love it until you shower and washes right off</li>
    <li> This is a orangy and a very dark off color. It darkened every flaw making my skin look weird. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Love the glove application. I put it on at night and shower in the morning, as it does develop that self-tanner smell over time.</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner.  It has a pleasant tropical smell...and it goes on evenly when applying with the mitt.  Great color!!  Won&#x27;t go back to any other product!</li>
    <li> better after 2nd application!</li>
    <li> This product does work once you shower it leaves you with a nice tan. Just remember to use nose plugs and lip balm when applying to you&#x27;re face for safety precautions.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this tanning product, I&#x27;ve tried st. Tropez and I didn&#x27;t like it . The green base in it made me very yellow and sick looking , this one has a purpleish red base bronzer and I&#x27;ve compared the color I get from this one to one with no color base (banana boat which is my next favorite, cheap to) and it&#x27;s the most natural brown color you can get , I&#x27;ve found that blonde hair makes your fake tan look more fake,(just some things I&#x27;ve discoverd from my self tan journey) brown hair brings out more of the brown in your fake tan while blonde brings out the gold (yuck) also wear neons and other high contrast colors or very light pastels work too, always make sure your face is slightly less fake tanned than the rest of you , your hands also, but yes my favorite by far , I like how it smells like a nice coconut smell and as it develops it smells more like chocolate (weird but cool) it comes in a spray bottle and you apply with a mitt I found the mitt to be not that great though I love the sun goddess mitt a lot better it doesn&#x27;t dry weird on the mitt...LOVE but keep it in the refrigerator and make sure you shake well every time you spray more of the product. Nobody knows I fake tan and I always get compliments on how tan I am, asking me were do I go tanning so give this a try oh but even though it stays on for a long time always exfoliate once a week and re aply a light coat for maintenance so it won&#x27;t go patchy lol I know it sounds like a lot of work but the color is so worth it, it&#x27;s hard to find a natural looking tan from a bottle, and this seller is awesome I only had to pay a dollar for shipping so the price you see is the price you get and it delivered faster than the estimated time!</li>
    <li> It was a good self tanner only problems we had with it was it got all over everything. It doesn&#x27;t stay on you.</li>
    <li> Im really happy with this. Really good color. Ive been asked if ive been tanning. Easy to put on also.</li>
    <li> This product worked just as I expected. Since I have fair skin, I had to use it in moderation because it would get a little splotchy, but other than that I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners but this is my favorite.  It is basically streak free, dries quickly and lasts longer than most of them do.  Also the smell is very minimal.</li>
    <li> My favorite self tanner, by far!  The color is perfect &amp; application is easy &amp; streak free.  So much cheaper than a spray tan &amp; is actually much more flawless.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about the weird places along your hands &amp; feet because you are applying yourself &amp; you can apply less in those areas.</li>
    <li> Good product. Keeps my tan even</li>
    <li> Works well. Good value. Love the color of my &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34;. Not orange.</li>
    <li> I have tried an endless amount of self tanners ranging from drugstore to premium products and this is without a doubt the best self tanner I have ever used! I am an avid banana boat endless summer self tanner user but I absolutely hate the smell of it (and most self tanners for that matter) but this smells so good! Taking it out of the box I was a little intimidated by having to use gloves and the mit because I thought it was going to be messy but it was just the opposite. I applied it about half an hour before I went to bed as the driections say it activates better when your resting. I went to bed a fair/medium color and woke up with a glowing brozned summer tan. I only &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; two spots-on my elbows because I didn&#x27;t bend them enough and I could have blended my wrists a little better but it was a learning experience. I applied morrocan oil to my knees, elbows and ankles before applying to avoid super dark areas. The only warning I can give is to make sure your pores are closed before you apply it, like if you just shaved wait a while so your pores aren&#x27;t open to absorb all the color. The great part about this product is a little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. Overall I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  I have gone for spray tans and paid $50, this is far better and great for last minute party color</li>
    <li> I will only use this self tanning lotion. I have tried them all and nothing else compares to the color and smell.</li>
    <li> It was easy to apply. Looked like a golden tan for about 3 days then turned into more of an orangy-ish color, but it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;fake\\&quot; looking. It faded pretty evenly. The initial application scent is very nice. I did notice a SLIGHT self tanner smell to it about one day after initial application, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I will use it again because of the easy, fool proof application and because it didn&#x27;t streak at all.</li>
    <li> allows for mistakes because its not so dramatically dark.  I have used it three times so far, each a few days apart.  I love the color, not orange at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners. I like this one. You have color immediately when you put it on. The mitt makes it nice to apply. It goes on pretty evenly (for a self tanner). Once you shower (after 6ish hours) you have a more natural looking tan with less blotches. It is not a DARK tanner in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Product came very quickly.  Best self tanner I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
</ol>
