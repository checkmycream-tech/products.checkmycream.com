      <li>started using the Aveda Smooth Infusion Conditioner with the Aveda Smooth Infusion Shampoo and could not be happier!</li>

      <li>They really are superior.  </li>
      <li>I can most definitely now see the great results from this</li>
      <li>Also, you are definitely paying more than the suggested retail price with many of these \\&quot;dealers\\&quot;!!</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years.</li>
      <li>but this is better than the retailer and it came right to the door.  </li>

      <li>I use this shampoo along with the smooth infusion conditioner and it has really helped control the frizzies in my curly hair.</li>

      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I also started using the Aveda Brilliant Emollient Finishing Gloss prior to flat ironing</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and silky and very clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I chose 3 stars because for me it doesn&#x27;t do the main things it advertises, which are to smooth your hair, get rid of flyaways, and make it straighter.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product at the Aveda school salon and it left my hair smooth, shiny and full of body!  </li>
      <li>You may not really be getting the authentic product!</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and when I want to wear it straight, I use the Smooth Infusion products to keep it straight and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have hair that is naturally very straight</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
      <li>So make sure you use an entire bottle before making a decision on this one.  </li>
      <li>you only need a small amount of this shampoo --- wonderful product!</li>
      <li>I at first did not like it as I like a shampoo that lathers a lot</li>
      <li>It gets my hair clean and makes it soft.</li>
      <li>It really smoothes my hair and bye bye frizz.</li>
      <li>The cheaper brand (but still pricey) was very drying and didn&#x27;t give any \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; effect at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still pricey, hahaha.</li>
      <li>: I have not noticed any difference in this category, even after also using the Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used an entire bottle of this shampoo in combination with the Smooth Infusion conditioner.</li>
      <li>One night I switched back to my left over Aveda and my hair looked great the next day.</li>
      <li>and it really lathers up.</li>
      <li>I dont use much anymore.</li>
      <li>My gray is coming in fuzzy and curly, and this product really helps.</li>
      <li>Absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>Really helps the frizz in my hair</li>
      <li>Exclusive plant infusion of organic aloe, maize and guar bean creates a smooth new surface on hair: Same as #1</li>
      <li>The combination truly makes my hair soft and so much EASIER to style!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Truly a HIGH QUALITY product</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product ----</li>
      <li>For me it isn&#x27;t worth the extra price.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, long, very wavy and dry to start.</li>
      <li>Prior to using these products, I would need a relaxer every 8 weeks, but now I can go 3 or 4 months, and my hair is much healthier!  </li>
      <li>It is far cheaper in the salon!  </li>
      <li>Heard lots of positive comments on Aveda products and finally decided to try myself.</li>
      <li>I bought the large bottle of this shampoo and use it daily.</li>
      <li>Just start using it so far</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and of course frizzy at times.  </li>
      <li>I bought the whole set of three for $75 overall</li>
      <li>These products may be a little pricey, but they&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
      <li>, my hair is less dry and more manageable to style.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, relatively thick, wavy hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not purchase this product here but was given a bottle by my daugher.  My hair is naturally curly and of course frizzy at times.  It took about two weeks for me to notice the difference.  I at first did not like it as I like a shampoo that lathers a lot but I have gotten used to it and love it.  So make sure you use an entire bottle before making a decision on this one.  It seems a lot to pay for shampoo but when you start getting compliments on your hair you will be glad you purchased it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a great job or keeping my thin and wispy hair in check, it always looks good when I use this stuff.  I have hair that is naturally very straight but this helps keep my hair shiny and minimizes my fly-aways. I&#x27;m not sure how it works with hair that isn&#x27;t naturally straight though.</li>
    <li> Life changing. I am a black female and no longer have to use relaxers going on 2 years now.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair feels amazing! Never changing again!</li>
    <li> Love it. Love the feel. Love the smell</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with thick hair past my shoulders.  I first tried this product at the Aveda school salon and it left my hair smooth, shiny and full of body!  I typically use this shampoo and conditioner followed by a little of the glossing straightener before flat ironing my hair.  For best results, you really do need to use the products together - I tried using the glossing straightener without the shampoo &amp; conditioner but it wasn&#x27;t the same.  Prior to using these products, I would need a relaxer every 8 weeks, but now I can go 3 or 4 months, and my hair is much healthier!  These products may be a little pricey, but they&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Just start using it so far it&#x27;s ok because I do not have all the rest to go with it but it is just too expensive</li>
    <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t too impressed for the price but then after switching to something a little cheaper that claimed to have the same end result as the Aveda I am convinced. The cheaper brand (but still pricey) was very drying and didn&#x27;t give any \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; effect at all. My hair was so much harder to work with. One night I switched back to my left over Aveda and my hair looked great the next day. Smooth and so much easier to work with. May I expected to look like I just walked out of the salon using Aveda for the first time which is a little ludicrous but after switching to something else I can most definitely now see the great results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still pricey, hahaha.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really smoothes my hair and bye bye frizz. Perfect for dry, treated hair. Absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My bottle just finished and although I have another, different shampoo on hand, I will definitely get another one of these soon. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this product works well for &amp;#34;blended&amp;#34; hair; left my hair feeling dry and limp.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo.  Really helps the frizz in my hair</li>
    <li> works great!  took out one star because of the price.</li>
    <li> Aveda will not guarantee their product when it is sold through diversion! You may not really be getting the authentic product! Also, you are definitely paying more than the suggested retail price with many of these \\&quot;dealers\\&quot;!! SHAME ON THE SALON OWNERS WHO SOLD THEIR PRODUCTS TO A THIRD PARTY! THIS IS DEFINITELY AGAINST THE SALON AGREEMENT WITH AVEDA.</li>
    <li> Just love this shampoo.  I used it a long time ago but then switched to just store brand shampoos.  Just went back to using the Aveda products again.  They really are superior.  My hair is shiny and smooth. A must especially if you have thick hair</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo along with the smooth infusion conditioner and it has really helped control the frizzies in my curly hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff.  My gray is coming in fuzzy and curly, and this product really helps.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, relatively thick, wavy hair. I used an entire bottle of this shampoo in combination with the Smooth Infusion conditioner. Aveda claims that this product does the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Moisturizes and reduces frizz: I have noticed a definite difference in this category. My hair feels soft and silky and very clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Exclusive plant infusion of organic aloe, maize and guar bean creates a smooth new surface on hair: Same as #1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Significantly reduces unwanted wave, helps prevent flyaways: I have not noticed any difference in this category, even after also using the Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Protects against surface damage from heat styling: Maybe, but hard to tell. My hair stylist still said I had a lot of split ends. I&#x27;m not convinced that a shampoo can protect against heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Softens hair with a luxurious lather: Same as #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a pretty good shampoo but I chose 3 stars because for me it doesn&#x27;t do the main things it advertises, which are to smooth your hair, get rid of flyaways, and make it straighter. For me it isn&#x27;t worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> I did not smell any wonderful fragrence, was I supposed to.  I like the way my hair feels.  I wish the price was less but this is better than the retailer and it came right to the door.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> I dont use much anymore. I like the wen products better.</li>
    <li> I first recieved some small samples of this and the conditioner in the mail from Aveda. I wanted this product so I could tame my frizzy hair. It&#x27;s not 100% with getting rid of the frizz, but it does make my hair feel like silk!! I also like the smell to. After I tried it i had to buy the product so I just bought the shampoo becuase it is a little pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveda since 1988.  I am also a licensed hairdresser.  DO NOT BUY AVEDA HERE!  It is far cheaper in the salon!  For example the Shampure and Conditioner they have here for $33?  Is only $10.50 per bottle (shampoo conditioner) in the salon.   You are not saving any money on Aveda Products here.</li>
    <li> Smells good, suds up good. I do like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My previously damaged hair has a beautiful sheen.</li>
    <li> I bought the large bottle of this shampoo and use it daily. I loved it until one day after a few months of using, I noticed it smelled bad. I opened the bottle and found it had turned, it was rust colored and smelled odd. I threw it away but wonder why Aveda sells a big bottle if the shampoo can not last longer than a few months</li>
    <li> Great product !  I love Avada. This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth. Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I find that it did not do anything for my hair. Not one bit of a difference. Same as any regular shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought the whole set of three for $75 overall and it did not work for me. I have long, thick hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution for and this product really didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Considering what I paid for it, I expected it to turn my hair into gold. It didn&#x27;t. It gets my hair clean and makes it soft. And you don&#x27;t have to use very much. I squirt about a nickle size amount into my palm and it really lathers up. All the ingredients are from plants like coconut and aloe.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. My hair has gotten healthier while using this. It does help straighten my thick wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveda products for 2 years now. My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been in. I have naturally curly hair and when I want to wear it straight, I use the Smooth Infusion products to keep it straight and smooth. Highly recommend this product ---- you only need a small amount of this shampoo --- wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Heard lots of positive comments on Aveda products and finally decided to try myself. No regret at all! Works great for my curly dry frizzy hair, gives it shine and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner, straightener, and smoother, and I am very pleased. Well worth the price. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years. The scent is nice and the results are great. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> good good good good good, I look like a movie star and my dog likes it and my hair is beautiful</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, my hair is less dry and more manageable to style.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, long, very wavy and dry to start. Was looking for something to smooth/straighten my hair but not weigh it down or make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Aveda Smooth Infusion Conditioner with the Aveda Smooth Infusion Shampoo and could not be happier! The combination truly makes my hair soft and so much EASIER to style! My hair never looks greasy or overly saturated when I use this product line. This also has a wonderful clean scent that I find to be calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Negative: I still need to flat iron my hair after blow drying as these products don&#x27;t quite straighten enough for my hair type. There are better products out there for the purpose of straightening HOWEVER Smooth Infusion does help to relax my hair to make it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a HIGH QUALITY product line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also started using the Aveda Brilliant Emollient Finishing Gloss prior to flat ironing and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok.  I was not really impressed with it, it&#x27;s not a life changer.  The smell is great and it foams really nicely.  It does get hair clean without drying it out.</li>
