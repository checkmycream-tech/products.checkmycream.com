    <li> I suffer from Cluster Headache. So, I put my two gel pads in the freezer and switch them out if needed. So far, it really works for me (most of the time, my Cluster Headache disappear just after using one pad freeze). Soft eye cover, good velcro closure and the mask fits great. I don&#x27;t use the aromatherapy because some scents increase my Cluster Headache. In summary, I love very much this product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use these in my massge practice and the clients love it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay cold too long but it is so comfortable and the fact that there are 2 gel pads makes up for that to me. You just freeze both and switch them out. This is the perfect thing to use while healing after an eye surgery!</li>
    <li> Used after I had prk eye surgery.  I loved that I was able to swap out ice packs since it came with two.  It was large enough to block out light and super soft and comfy.</li>
    <li> Love it just what I needed for me eye pain thanks</li>
    <li> I only used the packs cold so far to help with migraine pain and they work well. It would be better if the velcro would adjust tighter though. Overall I am pleased with the mask and am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sinus allergy face</li>
    <li> best hot/cold mask ever had !!!!</li>
    <li> Did the job when I had a migraine and love that it gives you two gel packs so you can keep one cold and use the other hot.  I also can&#x27;t do fragrances and most don&#x27;t give you the option.  This did which was also a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the cost.  The only con was the size of the strap; it should have been a little longer.</li>
    <li> It cold only a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this based on other reviews. I was disappointed. I put both packs in the freezer to use when a migraine hit. After putting one in the mask and putting it on... I had two problems. the mask is not comfortable around the nose area, the cut was awkward for me. and second, the fabri is so thick, I couldn&#x27;t feel the coolness of the pack. I ended up taking it out, wrapping a piece of tshirt cloth around it, put it over my eyes and then put the mask on top to hold it in place. not idea but it worked ok. I like the softness of the fabric. wish the straps were  cloth covered elastic band instead of Velcro. it keeps getting caught in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I try to use it so I get my money&#x27;s worth, I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> really great help, relaxing and helpful in dealing with allergies and stress relief&lt;br /&gt;f</li>
    <li> Could not use the soft mask. It did not fit my face.&lt;br /&gt;The gel packs are OK.</li>
    <li> awesome!!! fast shipping too!&lt;br /&gt;This is a luxury product! If your looking for relief or pampering, this is it!</li>
    <li> So far, I have only used the cold gel. My issue is that less than 10 min after removing gel from the freezer, it is no longer cold. Also, I don&#x27;t like the fit of the product.  I would not recommend buying this product.</li>

    <li> Soothing but didn&#x27;t help with the sinus pressure.</li>
    <li> Amazing for migraine or sinus headache relief!!!</li>
    <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t dissipate well, some areas are very hot and others hardly warm. Continuing to look for something better.</li>
    <li> Good shape. Good quality. I enjoy the lavender scent it&#x27;s very calming. The combination of cold and aroma therapy is the only thing to help with my migraines</li>
    <li> love it))) really gets  the job done</li>
    <li> Soft eye cover, good velcro closure. Two packs; one for cold &amp; one for hot. Read the directions about heating and follow them. It works. The scent is nice also.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is just what i needed for allergy season, which has been severe this year for some reason. I just could not get rid of the sinus pressure and pain. Once I received this product,  I alternated between hot and cold compresses, and my goodness, what an improvement! I also discovered that this mask works wonderfully to help with migraines. i have also tried using the aromatherapy insert. i use regularly to help alleviate stress, help me to relax and get ready for bed. i have also discovered that the cooling mask helps with eye swelling, or eye pain. What an awesome product. I can go on and on about the benefits I am continuing to find! I cannot wait to try some if your other products!</li>
    <li> I really love this ice pack. The only problem I found is the packs don&#x27;t stay cold long enough, so I am switching them out frequently.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light. It works quite well on my sinus.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love. Very comfortable and makes me feel great.</li>
    <li> This is a very flimsy product and the gel pack is very small.  The picture of the product really doesn&#x27;t look like what I received either.  What I received was much smaller and didn&#x27;t really cover the sinuses on either side of my nose.  I returned the product and received a refund.  Take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I don&#x27;t care for this. Nice design, nice concept, well made. The gel packs do not stay cold enough long enough at least for me.</li>
