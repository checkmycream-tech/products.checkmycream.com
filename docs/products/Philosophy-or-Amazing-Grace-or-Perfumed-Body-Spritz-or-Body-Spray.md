<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my Amazing Grace body spray, use it every day over my Amazing Grace lotion and before Amazing Grace perfume. I will get random compliments about how good I smell!</li>
    <li> Philosophy Amazing Grace Body Spritz has a nice delicate scent and lingers without being overpowering. The scent is light enough for daytime wear, yet works for evenings and special times, too.</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite body spritzes.  It is a light fragrance that I pair with the body lotion.  I wear it almost every day and have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells so good. I definitely will order three more bottles. Thank you</li>
    <li> Myself and so many amazing womenswear this product. I remember hearing one time that it was created not to be too much of a &amp;#34;pushy&amp;#34; fragrance but to be soft. Many teachers, nurses, physicians that I know wear this product. It&#x27;s so beautiful that when I have been at a doctor office or before surgery in a hospital that I have been able to spot it and remark on loving their frangrence. Amazing Grace!</li>
    <li> Love Amazing Grace perfume, so decided to try the spritz.  Absolutely love it.  Will order more in a few months when I run out.  My order was shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick freshen up.  Perfect right out of the shower or in the afternoon for a quick boost of fragrance.  It is not perfume or cologne, it is a spritz. Don&#x27;t expect anything else.  It does what a spritz is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering, and if you want a pick-me-up, or to just freshen up a bit as you head from work to meet up with friends or colleagues, this does the trick.  I also love to spray a tiny bit on before and after a workout.  It&#x27;s a great mood booster for me, and I appreciate the light, delicate, and clean scent it has. For a body spray, I think the scent has pretty good staying power.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Amazing Grace. The body spray is much lighter than the perfume so I have to reapply once or twice during the day. I have received compliments on how good I smell when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for a few years now. The fresh smell is awesome and is the perfect follow-up to a bath or shower.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Very faint scent and doesn&#x27;t last on my body.  Even tried spraying my on my clothes but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> The body spray is a light, lovely version of Amazing Grace.  It&#x27;s especially good for layering over the scented body lotion.  This form is great for those of us who don&#x27;t want to have a big perfume aura.    My only complaint, and the reason I gave it four stars, is the atomizer never worked.  I had to buy an empty bottle with atomizer and decant this one into it.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent from philosophy.  Received as expected, happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Light, clean and fresh body spray.</li>
    <li> I love the spritz. I use it daily BUT why the hugh price increase?? I just ordered more but was dissappointed in the price increase $25 to $44+ thats a hugh jump amount..Any special reason? I am curious.. I would have purchased a few more if I had known and now will look further for a lesser price.</li>
    <li> Its smells ok...but it does have a distinct underlying alcohol smell</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I purchased the Spritz and the Perfume and use them together or separately. I&#x27;ve read where some people keep their Spritz in their refrigerator. I haven&#x27;t done that but might give it a try in the summer time.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this fragrance into my lungs!</li>
    <li> i love amazing grace but this spritz does not have the same fragrance nor does it last more then 10 min.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance of this body spray it is light and floral. I&#x27;ve used the cologne but had not tried the body spray until now. Will probably buy again! :)</li>
    <li> Good with other  amazing grace products and layering the scent. Would not be good just by itself.</li>
    <li> Love it, great seller</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Philosophy scent for everyday use. The fragrance is so light and clean - it reminds me a bit of that fresh soapy scent you have right when you get out of the shower. A nice alternative to all the fruity and sugary sweet scents that are out there nowadays.</li>
    <li> Philosophy has struck a gold mine with the Amazing Grace fragrance! This body spritz is just right for a light scent anytime of day!</li>
    <li> My mother loves the Philosophy scents, especially Amazing Grace.  It makes a wonderful gift, the scent is so light, fresh and clean, I have helped my father get her the lotion, spritz, and hand wash for Christmas for a couple years now.  My mother loved White Shoulders as long as I can remember, after she discovered this, she has a new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a regular thing for me to order Philosophy Amazing Grace Products.  It was given to me as a gift 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked every since. I&#x27;ve given it as gifts also.  I love the soft smell that last all day. I get lots of compliments. Great Product.</li>
    <li> This is such a clean feminine scent.  I can wear this because of my sensitive skin.  I get lots of complements.</li>
    <li> Very light wonderful smell. Unforgettable who wears this as people will remember you smell Amazing.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent from Philosophy!</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Philosophy!  Great products all the time!  This scent is just wonderful!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nice light scent, smells great</li>
    <li> Love this spritz - the perfume is so expensive so I hate to use too much of this but with the spray you can use a lot and not break the bank.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean, soft, bright -</li>
    <li> this body spray smells so good</li>
    <li> As a fan of most Philosophy products, I tried this as an alternative to their Amazing Grace perfume.  The spritz has the same beautiful scent but goes on everywhere and lasts almost all day.  This will become your signature scent--people stop me all the time to ask what I have on because it&#x27;s such a nice, interesting, light perfume with enough scent that people will notice.  Think this will always be my go-to.</li>
    <li> Everyday someone asks me who smells so great. I work in an office and the smell is soap and water clean and not over powering! People love it!</li>
    <li> nice suttle scent, doesn&#x27;t know you out or anyone around you,lol</li>
    <li> smells so good...nice and light to layer over the lotion and then add perfume before heading out the door</li>
    <li> Does not smell good. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have smelled the perfume and it is awesome, but to me this is bad, really bad. I cant understand how it smells nothing like the perfume. It has a bitter cheapy smell right out of the bottle, I waited a few hours thinking it would get better because some perfumes do, but it did not! It could just be my nose, but I will never order perfumes from unknown sites again.</li>
    <li> I cant get enough of it! There was a problem with receipt and the shipper shipped a new one without charge. Great customer service experience there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so soft and I get compliments from people all the time.. it&#x27;s not over powering at all so great for the office. :)</li>
    <li> This product is one I buy on a regular basis. I love the clean, natural smell! This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Just doens&#x27;t last more than a few minutes though.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at Ulta, I loved the fragrance, so I bought the shower gel/shampoo, body spritz, lotion, and fragrance spray.  Even though I layered the products, the smell was gone within an hour!!  Way too expensive for not lasting!  Now I see I&#x27;m not the only one with this experience.  Definitely won&#x27;t waste my money again!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected. Arrived promptly. Very happy</li>
    <li> The lid was broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not not smell like the product I sampled at Ulta. I even took this bottle up to Ulta and compared it. It is not the same.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite, best way to get it. Delivered to your door.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the Body Spray, I spray a ton on and within an hour I can&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;To me it seems watered down!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE AMAZING GRACE, but this spray doesnt smell anything like it...</li>
    <li> Very soft musk scent.  Great everyday body spray that lasts all day.  One of my favorite things to do is spray it on my hair or, at times, spray it on my sheets.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife and granddaughter really like this product.</li>
    <li> Great for after shower for a light scent.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the best scent ever, it is light but lasts all day. I use the lotion and the spritz and the scent lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> Very please with Amazing Grace</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance and this Body Spritz is very light - not like a heavy perfume.  I use this with the Amazing Grace Body Emulsion which is a great body lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes and lotions but always return to this.  Strangers stop to tell me how good I smell - gotta love that!</li>
    <li> i had no problems with this order.</li>
    <li> Love the spray - clean fresh sent of Amazing Grace, not as strong as perfume which is what I love about it.  I can spray it on my clothes and it is a nice light fragrance. And a lot less expensive than using the perfume all the time.</li>
    <li> It has a very faint smell.  I am very disappointed.  My girlfriend has it and I loved hers, that is why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Great body spritz.  Light scent but very feminine.  Good price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Great product, shipped fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I should have known - spritz fragrance can&#x27;t duplicate a true scent.  I absolutely love Amazing Grace and this spritz just doesn&#x27;t live up to the true essence of it.  It seems to have an underlying, perhaps alcoholic smell, that comes through.  I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  It won&#x27;t stand alone, but is okay when layered with the bath and lotion, I guess.  For the price, I was rather disappointed in it and definitely would not recommend it or purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Please philosophy, make the scent of amazing grace last longer and smell stronger. It is my signature fragrance but I have to reapply several times throughout today.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother in law and she loves this stuff. It&#x27;s also cheaper here then on JC Penny. 😛</li>
    <li> This was recommended by many people. I didn&#x27;t go out &amp; smell it before I purchased it. The smell is ok, nothing to rave about at all.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and lasts longer than most body sprays.. LOVE</li>
    <li> I love this but I didn&#x27;t receive this!  The bag on the outside of the bottle said Amazing Grace but the bottle said TRUE GRACE.  I didn&#x27;t spray it to check...waiting to see what Amazon&#x27;s going to do ...</li>
    <li> after your shower spray a little on and you feel amazing, smells really really clean. alot of compliments when going into the public</li>
    <li> Good stuff, fragrance lasts without being overly scented. Clean &amp; fresh.</li>
    <li> It is only $25 at Ulta so I would not get it here because it is almost double the price on here... :)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells amazing</li>
    <li> Nice, soft scent. I use in combination with the lotion and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Amazing Grace it smells great and it lasts! Thank you so much it got here on time and I will most definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy a waste makes you dry doesn&#x27;t do anything the perfume is amazing just use that</li>
    <li> I love philosophy amazing grace and this is great to use after shower and just to freshen up.  loved it</li>
    <li> It smells great when it&#x27;s misted on but that is it. The fragrance does not stay even moments after spraying it on. A waste of Money. Should have returned it because it&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom closet. Lost the shipping label.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE perfume! I love this lighter version that I can spray all over. Best smell ever.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo great and the bottle is huge, I feel like I can use this more freely than the perfume ;)</li>
    <li> Scent just like perfume.  Very good for after bath/shower. Of course doesn&#x27;t lat as long, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
    <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, but I like the clean smell.</li>
    <li> I bought for my mother who loves this aroma like many others do. Sold alot on QVC, this is same product.</li>
    <li> not as fragrant as I expected or long lasting - but my room smell good after spaying !&lt;br /&gt;I may need to try an oil.</li>
