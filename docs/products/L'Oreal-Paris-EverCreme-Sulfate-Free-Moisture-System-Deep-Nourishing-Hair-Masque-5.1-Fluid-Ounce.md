      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this series of shampoos and conditioners.</li>

      <li>nothing more than a so so conditioner.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>For some reason I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
      <li>I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD</li>
      <li>It smells phenomenal, can&#x27;t describe it</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many conditioning products (probably hundreds).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done a bit of experimenting and this is the most effective routine for me, with outstanding results: silky, smooth hair every time.  </li>
      <li>Thank you L&#x27;Oreal! :)</li>
      <li>I seriously walked around all day with this wonderful smell and people complimenting me on my hair smelling great.</li>
      <li>I now have silky soft beautiful bouncy hair without blow drying it or doing anything to it.</li>
      <li>Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, from high end brands to anything else, nothing else has given me as outstanding results as this product!!  </li>
      <li>For the BEST results, apply product to DRY hair.  </li>
      <li>A very, very good conditioner especially for gray/white hair.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that is Sulfate free.</li>
      <li>Best of all, this product does not weigh your hair down like most conditioners.</li>
      <li>nice and rich and a super companion to the Evercreme cleansing conditioner...</li>
      <li>The texture of my hair greatly improved, and it was smoother and definitely felt more hydrated.</li>
      <li>, I strongly recommend it for everyone with colored treated hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PS, if like me you find Shea butter is too strong smelling then mix with this http://www.amazon.com/Mango-Madness-Fragrance-Oil-Scented/dp/B00424UL5E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1368364280&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;mango+madness</li>
      <li>Only gave this 4 stars because it has a very strong scent - it is pleasant, but strong.</li>
      <li>I am African-American and have fine, relaxed hair that is prone to tangles.  </li>
      <li>When I read the rave reviews about this conditioner, I prayed that they were accurate  -  </li>
      <li>I wish this product was available in stores as it&#x27;s now overpriced on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>After being in low humidity surroundings this does a great job in conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>sulfate free is here to stay</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it felt fantastic.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and smells so good.</li>
      <li>I use a fabulous moisturizing shampoo that leaves hair clean but not stripped.</li>
      <li>My hair is silky after use, no more fly away hair!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a rich conditioner that would add slip to my hair.</li>
      <li>Overall for the price I think this is a nice option for a conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice.</li>
      <li>The price is sooo cheap compared to most high end products I buy.</li>
      <li>I love this whole line.</li>
      <li>The scent must have been quite mild, and it disappeared when I rinsed the product out of my hair.</li>
      <li>The first time i left it on for 30 mins and rinsed it off, my hair felt like silk and my ends looked amazing!</li>
      <li>This one comes out in the top ten to be sure.  </li>
      <li>You will notice such a big difference when combing your hair, and the smell is also wonderful!!!</li>
      <li>, IT WORKS REALLY WORKS!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used this a handful of times on my hair and my hair feels softer and stronger. Its really working for me.</li>
    <li> It deeply moisturized my chemically-straightened hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other hair masques out there (Moroccan Argan Oil, VO5 oil, etc.) and many do-it-yourself hair masques and this is by far the best. For reference I have straight dark blond hair that hangs below my shoulder blades. In general my hair is pretty normal, the roots get oily after 2+ days but the ends are super dry and brittle since I go too long between cuts and my hair is long and bleached from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This masque was amazing. I left it on for 5-10 minutes while I was in the shower, rinsed, and let it air dry and it felt fantastic. The ends felt like they were newly cut, my hair refused to tangle, and dried softy and bouncy! For me, it&#x27;s a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note - I&#x27;ve tried Ever Pure and had terrible results with that (the leave in conditioner left my hair dry and crunchy) so if you&#x27;ve had that experience don&#x27;t through out L&#x27;Oreal all together - the evercreme line is great!</li>
    <li> I never liked anything except this. Not even the other loreal products in the same line. It really makes my hair go smooth without that greasy look and feel on hair.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff ever.  I use it as my regular conditioner but probably should actually try it as a deep conditioner.  Everytime I try something else I come back to this.  It&#x27;s awesome and relatively cheap.</li>
    <li> First let me start with my hair, Bleach blonde, chin length, oily roots dryish ends. It was slightly damaged but I got a hair cut before trying this, Which cut all the damage off. I did not use the whole line of evercreme. FIRST TRY- I washed with TIGI bed head Urban Antidotes Level 2 Recovery (that I absolutly love btw) then applied this, left on for 3-5 minutes and rinsed with cold water. Towel dried,  Applied leave in conditioner and a very small amount of antifrizz oil, products I use after every hair wash. I Didn&#x27;t really notice anything special. SECOND TRY- washed with bed head then applied this. This time I left on for 10-15 minutes, rinsed with cold water. Applied same products to towel dried hair. As my hair started to dry the ends were getting frizzy (normal) so I blow dried. Soft hair but it didn&#x27;t look sleek. Flat ironed and WOW! My hair feels/looks amazing. This product did not weigh my hair down. It smells phenomenal, can&#x27;t describe it but it&#x27;s the best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve tried. The price is sooo cheap compared to most high end products I buy. It was under $10 vs $20-30 I would pay for a high end product and it does just as good!&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Probably Not. Not because it didn&#x27;t deliver but because I never repurchase an item unless it really blows me away. Plus I like trying new products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice, and my hair is brighter after use. Also, it smell good.</li>
    <li> My hair is so dry that I wear this as a leave-in conditioner, but boy, it works wonders! My hair is much more manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I am 53 and I have shoulder length, blonde highlighted, fine hair. It gives incredible shine, body and movement. It makes my hair look like when I was much younger. It smells fabulous and it gives me the best results compared to all the other products I have tried in the past. If I have time, I will leave it on for at least 30 minutes but 3-6 minutes in the shower works too.</li>
    <li> I will admit I am a sucker for new products, especially hair products, so when I saw this new line by Loreal, I *had* to try it.  I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price, but I convinced myself it would be worth it.  I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair with highlights and my hair naturally leans towards the dry side. Anytime I see something that says moisturizing (add to it nourishing) then I am pulled away from my go to brand (Infusium 23).  I was excited to try it and I just knew it was going to be a hair miracle, but sadly it  was not at all! I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask and I have been using all four items for over a week now.  My hair has been harder to detangle, drier, and a little crunchy feeling (this could be from the leave in?)  The only positives I can say is that my hair does seem to be a bit curlier and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice. I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
    <li> Its not what I have expected, I used many products that are much better than this one and they were more or less with the same price, it didn’t make any difference to my hair, I wouldn’t buy it again and I will not recommend it to a friend. I do not know how loreal made this product.</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing. I love how soft my hair felt. My hair felt like I had a Brazilian Blowout.&lt;br /&gt; I cannot believe it&#x27;s discontinued :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this instead of conditioner since it came out. Highly recommend if u have dry or frizzy hair. Deep conditions without weighting hair down. I personally love the scent as well. I wait about 15 seconds after applying than run my fingers through my hair and it detangles without breaking my hair. ( I have long, natural blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all using this)</li>
    <li> Tried a sample of this and had to buy some. Made my hair so soft and shiny! Love the smell as well, kind of coconut almond-ish scent. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal has such great products and this one is great for my hair because I&#x27;m African American and need that extra moisture.</li>
    <li> When I read the rave reviews about this conditioner, I prayed that they were accurate  -  and they were! My hair is bleached platinum blonde and extremely dry. I&#x27;ve used only high-end products (eg. Kérastase, Moroccanoil) for the last 5 years and this conditioner beats them all. I&#x27;ve done a bit of experimenting and this is the most effective routine for me, with outstanding results: silky, smooth hair every time.  1. Wash hair every other day 2. First wash: KMS Colour Vitality purple shampoo for blonde hair, followed by L&#x27;Oréal EverCreme, WHICH I LEAVE IN OVERNIGHT. (Honestly  -  try this, the results are incredible). Rinse out the next morning and style as normal. 3. Second wash: Klorane Mango Butter shampoo followed by their Mango Butter conditioner.  If you have time, leave in the conditioner for a few minutes whilst cleaning your teeth or showering. Rinse out and style as normal.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product for the smell alone! I am Caucasian with very tight curly hair which you are supposed to condition well, at least once a week. Loreal EverCreme is perfect for this, and did I mention the smell? I seriously walked around all day with this wonderful smell and people complimenting me on my hair smelling great. This product being sulfate free is a definite plus. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> BEST deep conditioner I have used. I have very long, wavy hair that I just started coloring red. This has kept my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair shine and soft</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have been coloring my hair for many years, and, after one use, my hair felt soft with great shine! Will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and proceeded to use it. It was ok. If I decided to switch to sulfate-free products, I would use this. I think it would be good for someone who has dyed hair because it would not cause color to fade. I will give this to my daughter to try, she has blue hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a rich conditioner that would add slip to my hair. NO! I use a fabulous moisturizing shampoo that leaves hair clean but not stripped. I used this conditioner afterwards and OMG!! It literally turned my hair into a stripped most tangled mess I&#x27;ve ever dealt with!! I even used a major detanglers afterwards and it did not work even a little. I had to cut a knot out of my hair!! It was that bad!</li>
    <li> Once again,  you cannot have enough of this product.......  You&#x27;ll find yourself ordering it again and again as it&#x27;s the best thing on the market  - - believe me!  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! It says to use once or twice a week to condition but I got hooked and started using it after every wash and my hair got SOOOO soft and shiny. Highly recommended from someone who always had very dull hair.</li>
    <li> I have very dry gray hair so wanted to give this product a try.  Got it because it is sulfate-free.  For the BEST results, apply product to DRY hair.  Leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse.  Do not shampoo.  This really finally made my dry hair soft and shinny.  Only gave this 4 stars because it has a very strong scent - it is pleasant, but strong.</li>
    <li> What a great hair mask, I love everything about it. The price, the scent and of course the way it makes my hair feel. I put it on and let it sit on my hair for a few minutes before washing it, and my color treated hair feels very soft and healthy after it dries. I also love the fact that is Sulfate free. Will be re purchasing for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my HG hair mask. I use it a few times a month with my Redken cleansing shampoo. My hair is left really manageable, shiny, and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. I have been using twice a week and feel like it has been making a difference.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down. Love the smell,  too!</li>
    <li> Really prompt delivery, very happy!</li>
    <li> I came across this product by chance, and my only regret is not having found it before! This works wonders for my hair! I have bleached blonde highlights and my hair tends to get very dry and coarse but thanks to this product I now have silky soft beautiful bouncy hair without blow drying it or doing anything to it. I don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone but it has definitely work for me, I strongly recommend it for everyone with colored treated hair. Is easy to apply, this is what I recommend you to do: after going through your regular shampoo routine, apply as much as you need depending on how much hair you have, leave it on for 2-3 minutes and then wash it all out thoroughly. You will notice such a big difference when combing your hair, and the smell is also wonderful!!! give this a try and you will not regret it. I will continue to use this wonderful Evercreme nourishing masque! Thank you L&#x27;Oreal! :)</li>
    <li> Many hair products come in tubes, which makes it difficult or impossible to use the whole package.  This is a thick conditioner which is nevertheless easy to use because you scoop it out of an open tub.  (Cleanliness of the hands shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, as it might be for other health and beauty products, as hands should be clean from shampooing!).  It does provide a noticeable amount of moisture to hair, especially often-dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;According to the label, this is a \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; product, not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my hair so soft and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I gave this conditioner 3 stars only because of the price. I have been searching for a really great conditioner for my not so really great hair. This stuff is wonderful for my hair and the creaminess of it makes it&#x27;s way through my very thick tangled hair and I don&#x27;t even have to use an extra leave in conditioner when I&#x27;m done with my shower. I know paying this much for it is my own fault, but paying more than double what it would be in store or even at any other website is just terrible. I well be buying this conditioner again, but not from this seller.</li>
    <li> Overall for the price I think this is a nice option for a conditioner!  It is pretty heavy and thick so it might weigh your hair down. It does leave your hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking in dyeing your hair and staying longer, this is the secret. Need to wash it first with this product dry hair thoroughly then apply color you wish for! Boom it&#x27;s lasts another 3 weeks even you shower daily.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and makes my hair softer.  I&#x27;ve seen better and more noticeable results with other products, but it works fine enough.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I use the shampoo as well.  Finally I&#x27;m not a frizz ball. Leaves nice and curly hair. I also use the spray from this line.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel remarkable.  Does wonders to hair that is damanged from heat and straightening daily.  Used once a week, and noticed that hair improved in appearance and texture.</li>
    <li> nothing more than a so so conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  So sorry it was been discontinued. I don&#x27;t know what I will get once my last jar is gone.  I&#x27;m using sparingly.</li>
    <li> very effective, leave my hair smooth and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month.  I have curly hair that is naturally dry and frizzy without proper moisture. It detangles, leaves my hair super soft and easy to manage. I also use the leave-in conditioning spray from this line. I wish this product was available in stores as it&#x27;s now overpriced on Amazon.  Currently, I&#x27;ll keep buying it on Amazon, but if the price goes up anymore I&#x27;ll have to switch.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Team Natural look away now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural hair but i straighten it with heat cos i wear a head covering everyday and it looks untidy with an afro underneath. This allows me to use much less heat- just one pass with the iron (Babyliss Steam). I wash with the Loreal Cleansing Conditioner, use this product as instructed and allow to air dry to about 70%, then apply shea butter to the new growth, coconut oil to the scalp and EverSleek leave-in to the tips. Air dry or tension dry with a low heat. I use Organics keratin spray and iron on mid to low heat (about 200). No breakage or split ends!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, if like me you find Shea butter is too strong smelling then mix with this http://www.amazon.com/Mango-Madness-Fragrance-Oil-Scented/dp/B00424UL5E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1368364280&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;mango+madness</li>
    <li> I love this whole line. I use this after I color my hair because I don&#x27;t care for the conditioner that comes in the box. This is great and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this line. It works good in my thick semi curly frizzy hair. I use it once a week for good results.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing, you can smell the coconut oil when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Works great! My hair is silky after use, no more fly away hair!</li>
    <li> So happy to have this product in my life again! For some reason I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. Thank you good buy ny! It arrived WELL before the expected delivery. Kudos!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this series of shampoos and conditioners. They leave my hair feeling soft and manageable without feeling overly greasy or oily. Highly recommend for those with dry/colored hair.</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY BAD WELL WATER AND IT HAS RUINED MY HAIR, WHEN I MOVED HERE 4 YEARS AGO, MY HAIR WAS IN VERY, VERY GOOD CONDITION, WITHIN A MONTH IT WAS HORIBILE. I HAVE TRIED EVERTHING, NOTHING WORKED. I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT, IT ARRIVE THE VERY NEXT DAY, I USE IT, AND KEPT IT ON MY HAIR ALL DAY WITH A PLASTIC COVER AND A CLOTH HAIR COVER, THAT NIGHT I RINSED IT OFF, MY HAIR FELT LIKE IT DID BEFORE I STARTED USEING THIS WELL WATER, IT WORKS REALLY WORKS!! I WILL BE BACK TO REORDER!!!! THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS AT A PRICE I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD AND I DID&#x27;NT HAVE TO WAIT LONG TO GET IT !!!!</li>
    <li> After being in low humidity surroundings this does a great job in conditioning my hair.</li>
    <li> I have ruined my hair by dying and highlighting it three times within a year. It went from black to light brunette so needless to say, it&#x27;s completely fried. I&#x27;ve tried many different conditioners, oils, and treatments to try to replenish the lost moisture. Thus far, I like the EverCreme Deep Nourishing Hair Masque better than any products (even including Moroccan oils!). Best of all, this product does not weigh your hair down like most conditioners. I use it three times per week and love it! Obviously my hair has not turned from dried out to virgin healthy overnight but the texture has definitely improved.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and smells amazing! I would recommend this hair product to anyone. I tend to use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> This mask is really good! The first time i left it on for 30 mins and rinsed it off, my hair felt like silk and my ends looked amazing! I now use this once a week and leave it on for 15 mins. It works wonders &amp;#60;3 will be buying again soon</li>
    <li> A very, very good conditioner especially for gray/white hair.  Easy to use and really tames down the wiriest gray hair!</li>
    <li> I am African-American and have fine, relaxed hair that is prone to tangles.  I tried this conditioner today and I am throughly impressed!  I have tried many, many conditioning products (probably hundreds).  This one comes out in the top ten to be sure.  It smells terrific; but more importantly, it really coats my hair well and conditions throughly- even after just a few minutes.  I imagine the results would be even better if left on longer.  After using this conditioner, my hair is very soft, shiny and has a lot of body.  My hair was much easier to detangle right out of the shower too.  This will defenitely be one of my go-to products.</li>
    <li> For me this product works best if I mix it with warmed coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I just purchase this product, and it has its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it smells amazing! And the scent actually stays for a couple of days. It leaves your hair feeling very silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It made my hair too greasy. After the second day, my hair was visibly greasy, my scalp itched and it looked dirty. Also, I have issues with dandruff and the shampoo and conditioner made it worst...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have normal to oily hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it. If your hair is Dry go ahead, you won&#x27;t regret it!.</li>
    <li> For reference, I have extremely dry, delicate, damaged hair from professionally bleaching and toning my naturally thick, black Asian hair to platinum blonde for the last year and a half. I first tried [[ASIN:B00B4A35WK L&#x27;oreal Paris Everstrong Reconstruct Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, 8.5-fluid Ounce]] with the [[ASIN:B002PBGBB4 L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Deep Replenishing Masque, 5.1-Fluid Ounce]] for every wash and it did hardly anything, then I continued using that masque with [[ASIN:B00B49OREG L&#x27;oreal Evercreme Intense Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]] with some improvement. It wasn&#x27;t until I started using this Evercreme masque twice a week with the Intense products that my hair really started looking and feeling much better. The texture of my hair greatly improved, and it was smoother and definitely felt more hydrated. A lot of my breakage and split ends disappeared, so I noticed a lot less hair coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only purchase one item from this entire line, it should be this.</li>
    <li> I like the matching shampoo and conditioner (intense version).  This gives me similar results to the conditioner and is less convenient - but I had to try it!</li>
    <li> I used this in place of my normal conditioner last night and this stuff is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the regular shampoo and conditioner from this line (they were good but not wonderful), but this mask worked wonders on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record (since hair type/condition may matter in terms of whether this will be a good product for you), I have thick, waist-length, color-treated hair. It tends to be dry and the ends are a little problematic (I don&#x27;t get split ends, but the ends don&#x27;t look as good as the rest of my hair). I shower at night and let my hair air dry. At any rate, I have a problem with frizz and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to work through my hair. I only vaguely remember a scent and at this point, I&#x27;ve forgotten what I thought of it. The scent must have been quite mild, and it disappeared when I rinsed the product out of my hair. I used my usual detangler and went on about my evening. The next day, my hair looked pretty nice. I didn&#x27;t have much frizz and I had fewer flyaways than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were two things that really stood out for me. First, my hair just flowed when I moved (if that makes sense). Not as well as a shampoo commercial, but much better than usual for me. Second, my hair stayed straight and didn&#x27;t puff out (it often goes wavy by the afternoon, simply from humidity). Even the ends felt a little softer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was very happy with the performance of this product. I&#x27;ve tried out a lot of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners lately. Some of them are great and some, not as much (and many appear to be very similar, despite the different claims on the bottles). But this one stands out from the pack.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  This conditioner works as advertised.  It left my hair feeling extremely soft, moisturized and very manageable.</li>
    <li> My daughter won&#x27;t use anything else.  Don&#x27;t ask me.</li>
    <li> good choice ! I recomend it and smells really good...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair moisturizer of ALL TIME!!!  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how this has transformed my hair. I hope they keep remaking this, as it&#x27;s my Holy Grail hair moisturizer.  This has even allowed my hair to grow longer. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, from high end brands to anything else, nothing else has given me as outstanding results as this product!!  I will repurchase until there is hair on my head!!</li>
    <li> nice and rich and a super companion to the Evercreme cleansing conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;i love this product line! sulfate free is here to stay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all different masques from different brands like Redken and Bumble and Bumble, and this is by far my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat after use, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
