    <li> This stuff is truly wonderful!  I like to use it around my mouth, beside my nose and across my forehead.  It fills in all those tiny, annoying lines and keeps your make-up from &amp;#34;settling in&amp;#34;.  This is the second time I have purchased this product and I will continue to use it.  I bought my first container of primer in late December and it lasted me until the end of March, early April.....a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Finish makeup look smoother.</li>
    <li> I tried and trusted primer</li>
    <li> I love this product...it makes your skin feel like velvet.  After I put it on, I cannot believe how soft my skin is...so soft that afterwards I don&#x27;t want to put on any makeup at all.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the Bella Terra face and eye cream/serum and under my Bella Terra foundation. Although I like the overall appearance of minimal pores and such, if you apply too much, you will start to get shiny throughout the day.</li>
    <li> very good product have used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many name brand primers and this one is the best.  It makes your mineral make up look flawless on your skin.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed this time with the Bella terra primer. It wasn&#x27;t the same primer it is more like a baseline type product nothing like the smooth clear primer I have used in the past.  I had to stop using it because it broke my face out. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different primers to use prior to applying mineral foundation. This goes on really nicely. It takes very little product. I use a makeup spatula with it so I don&#x27;t contaminate the remaining product that is in the jar. I see a difference in how the mineral foundation works with this product. It&#x27;s also compatable with other mineral foundations. I also like that my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; look less noticable when I use this before applying makeup. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> smoothest primer on the market....love it.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and even though it tends to be dry I have to be careful with moisturizers or I&#x27;ll wind up greasy...this primer is wonderful, feels like silk going on, and does wonders with the Bella Terra Mineral Powder Make-up...Money well spent.</li>
    <li> This is a unique product, that truly is amazing. My skin is extremely soft , moist &amp; clear. Prior to using this product my skin was very dry. I would recommend this product to anyone of any age.</li>
    <li> I have been **really** trying to love this. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with it. I&#x27;ve been wearing this primer for approx. a week and a half now. My foundation DOES go on more smooth and my face feels softer. That&#x27;s where the positives stop. After a few hours my face looks horrendous! To put it bluntly, I looked gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this over moisturizer/under moisturizer and alone. Both times the results are the same. It looks and feels great at first, but later in the day my foundation cakes and separates around my nose, under eyes, and mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m following the directions. Could it be that it&#x27;s only meant for mineral powder foundation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with -&lt;br /&gt;YSL Touche Eclat Foundation&lt;br /&gt;Make Up For Ever HD Foundation&lt;br /&gt;Sonia Kashuk Perfecting Luminous Foundation&lt;br /&gt;Chanel Lumiere Aqua Foundation&lt;br /&gt;Dior BB Hydra Life&lt;br /&gt;Dior Hydra Life Tinted Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jart BB Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;among others (high end to drugstore)but they&#x27;re all liquid foundation. I&#x27;m a makeup artist, so I have plenty to choose from. I also got a HUGE cystic pimple on my jawline like I&#x27;ve never had before.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to this primer or just my hormones. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more days. If it keeps on like this - I will be returning.</li>
    <li> This product allows the foundation to go on flawlessly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This primer is s good. A lot comes in the jar and it is very light on my skin. I would not use any other primer. My makeuo always stays on a lot longer after using it. I can tell a big difference in the texture of my face if I dont use it.</li>
    <li> Great product,  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Wow...so silky...Just a little goes long way!</li>
    <li> Superior service and customer satisfaction! This is a wonderful primer to use:  all natural, no animal testing, glides smoothly, and great price!  My order was lost and contacted the seller.  Within a very short time, I had my product!  I give 5+ stars!</li>
