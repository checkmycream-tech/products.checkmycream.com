      <li>As a product it could be better, and the shipping flaws could be greatly improved.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, great exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>Smells so yummy and feels so amazing</li>

      <li>Do yourself a favor and compare products by weight or just make your own.</li>

      <li>I LOVED that it is all natural and it SMELLS just like Florida!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best body scrub I&#x27;ve ever used for my sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>,the scent is amazing definitely  gives me that Summer time  beachy feeling.</li>
      <li>very nice little gift jars</li>
      <li>The price was right.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used this salt scrub and will say I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed at all.</li>
      <li>I first encountered this product in a restroom in Hilton Head,SC.  </li>
      <li>I tried this salt scrubs on my hands  and this feels more like salt rub and not enough coconut oil in this mixture</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in future.</li>
      <li>I did not return it considering it costs more to ship it back than to purchase it</li>
      <li>would&#x27;ve given this a higher rating (or more likely just not bought it) if the sellers would&#x27;ve include something in the picture for size comparison.</li>

      <li>I discovered this product at a Florida surf shop, and it absolutely amazed me.  </li>
      <li>it was great , only it was stoo small</li>
      <li>This salt scrub works great on those little cracks you get in your fingers and hands caused by dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I personally did not like the scrub but for those who are looking for a more gentle body exfoliant, this is worth a try since it&#x27;s very small and cheap.</li>
      <li>The salt is so fine it doesn&#x27;t scratch at my dry skin like a thicker sugar scrub</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>would, and the oils in the scrub lightly mosturizes and hydrates dry skin nicely, unlike other scrubs that leave a thick oily film.</li>
      <li>The scents range from light to heavy but</li>
      <li>was much too wet, filled with our, did not like the consistency, have used salt scrubs before this one is too wet.</li>
      <li>The spoon would have helped mix the salt and oil back together as it has separated (which is normal).</li>
      <li>The scrub leaked all over the box and was super messy.</li>
      <li>They were tilted in shipping and the sand at the top was all dried out, plus they didn&#x27;t contain the little spoons to scoop the stuff out with.&lt;br</li>

<li> they had two other larger size jars too!</li>

<li> Despite liking the product itself, I have to give this 2 stars because the picture gives no indication just how small the jar is.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> My only disappointment is the cost.  </li>
<li> This scrub comes in a very very very small container and does not come with the spoon either.</li>
<li> This is very small just like description  </li>
<li> but no it was not the same rub:(</li>
<li> I would give the item 5 stars, but without the spoon, it is going to be difficult to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> was much too wet, filled with our, did not like the consistency, have used salt scrubs before this one is too wet.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time.  Lovely scent, great exfoliant.  It came with an elastic sround the rim, but no wooden spoon as shone in the picture.  I checked the box.  The spoon did not come loose in shipping.  The spoon is missing.I wanted to leave the scrub in my guest bathroom, but i am going to have to find another way to access the scrub.  I would give the item 5 stars, but without the spoon, it is going to be difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body scrub I&#x27;ve ever used for my sensitive skin. The salt is so fine it doesn&#x27;t scratch at my dry skin like a thicker sugar scrub would, and the oils in the scrub lightly mosturizes and hydrates dry skin nicely, unlike other scrubs that leave a thick oily film. My skin has never ever felt this good, and I&#x27;ll never use another scrub again! It&#x27;s so good I came on Amazon just to purchase and review, i almost never review items! Best scrub ever</li>
    <li> Despite liking the product itself, I have to give this 2 stars because the picture gives no indication just how small the jar is. It&#x27;s barely enough for one shower. This inspired me to search Pinterest for &amp;#34;salt scrub&amp;#34; and found tons of recipes. I can now make a big mason jar of scrub for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given this a higher rating (or more likely just not bought it) if the sellers would&#x27;ve include something in the picture for size comparison. Do yourself a favor and compare products by weight or just make your own.</li>
    <li> These are tiny little bottles of soap scrub. They were tilted in shipping and the sand at the top was all dried out, plus they didn&#x27;t contain the little spoons to scoop the stuff out with.&lt;br /&gt;They were immediately returned</li>
    <li> I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton while vacationing in Florida and came across Florida Salt Scrubs. I loved it SO MUCH I just ordered several jars as gifts for my bridesmaids!! I LOVED that it is all natural and it SMELLS just like Florida! I went to their website and also ordered the Key Lime scent (holy cow!)--and they had two other larger size jars too! They make the perfect gift! The salt was ultra fine, unlike a lot of other salt scrubs I have tired. The coconut oil-- SO good for my skin!! I cannot say enough GREAT things about this salt scrub! Oh-- and my bridesmaids LOVED their gift!! I will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best products out there.  I discovered this product at a Florida surf shop, and it absolutely amazed me.  I&#x27;m constantly washing and working with my hands so my hands to to be dry and course.  My wife would complain about it all the time, so it was a problem I needed to address.  Thing I like best about the product is it leaves no oily residue just soft clean skin.</li>
    <li> Scent is great. The salt is finer crystals than other salt products this product is non greasy and can be used even with out washing off. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this salt scrub and will say I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed at all.I am using this on my hands and I can feel the salt and oils ,the scent is amazing definitely  gives me that Summer time  beachy feeling.My hands are super soft and ready for manicure.This is very small just like description  so I wasn&#x27;t shocked by the size at all exactly as I was expecting this to be and yes it did come with little wooden spoon if it didn&#x27;t I had plenty of those disposable  wooden ice cream spoons around my house.I ordered another in a different  scent I wanna try all of these.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s enjoyed the gift and the results of the scrubs. The price was right.  I would purchase once again without reservations.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the salt scrub to be so small for the price.  My fault for not looking very closely. :/ smell  is great</li>
    <li> Bought for friends for Xmas and they loved it so much they went back and bought more! I will be buying more in future.</li>
    <li> I thought it was very good but only wish it had more oils in it. I used it a few times and have plenty of salts left but oil is gone even though I mixed it well with each use</li>
    <li> I bought one of each of the 2.9 size Florida Salt Scrubs. The scents range from light to heavy but the after effects are heavenly. I use them on my feet as well. What a treat. I&#x27;m going after the larger sizes next time.</li>
    <li> I tried this salt scrubs on my hands  and this feels more like salt rub and not enough coconut oil in this mixture I was extremely disappointment to me after trying one rub in Fort Myers Florida  which I love the feel of it at the restaurant we were eating while on vacationing in Florida . Did not buy at restaurant since they were out them.So when I saw this Florida Salt Scrubs at you web site I figure this was going to be the same rub I use but no it was not the same rub:(</li>
    <li> very nice little gift jars</li>
    <li> I first encountered this product in a restroom in Hilton Head,SC.  My hands felt so good after using it, that I asked how I could get some.  I was given the website and ordered the product.  My only disappointment is the cost.  Otherwise  this product is good for your skin and your skin will be softer and smoother if you use the Salt Scrub.</li>
    <li> it was great , only it was stoo small</li>
    <li> This salt scrub works great on those little cracks you get in your fingers and hands caused by dry skin.  A little in the hand and then a couple minutes of application and your hands and skin will be on the road to recovery.</li>
    <li> This scrub comes in a very very very small container and does not come with the spoon either. The spoon would have helped mix the salt and oil back together as it has separated (which is normal). The coconut scub smells nice, but was just to greasy and sandy. I personally did not like the scrub but for those who are looking for a more gentle body exfoliant, this is worth a try since it&#x27;s very small and cheap. However, my problem was the shipping. The scrub leaked all over the box and was super messy. I did not return it considering it costs more to ship it back than to purchase it but half of my product was covering the shipping box. Maybe a seal would prevent this? As a product it could be better, and the shipping flaws could be greatly improved.</li>
    <li> Smells so yummy and feels so amazing it my absolute favorite salt scrub!!</li>
