<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> item exactly as dуscribed, arrived it time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet , but Schick products are usually very good .</li>
    <li> I have a [[ASIN:B003BVINQI Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor]] and until I bought this shave gel I was using [[ASIN:B0000530MU Edge Shave Gel Extra Moisturizing With Vitamin E - 7 Oz]]. The combination worked fine, but I would often experience some drag and resistance while shaving my cheeks, and almost always had some residue left over from the Edge gel. For the most part this Schick Hydro Shave Gel is the same as any other shave gel you can get, with some differences:    - It definitely works better with my Hydro 5 razor. That resistance and drag that I get using Edge gel? Nonexistent with this. My razor glides smoothly, firmly, and comfortably.  - None of that leftover gel residue I got with the Edge gel. My face is much cleaner after shaving (before rinsing) than it was before.  - At least compared with the Edge gel, you&#x27;re getting more with this. The Edge gel is 7 oz., whereas this is 8.4 oz.  - This appears to be cheaper than the Edge gel, both here on Amazon and where I got mine. I only paid $3 for it at Target.      I recommend you use this if you have a Schick Hydro razor. Coming from my Edge gel to the Schick Hydro gel I definitely noticed a difference in \\&quot;compatibility\\&quot; between the gel and my razor. This just seems to work much better with it. If you don&#x27;t have a Hydro razor then I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll notice any real difference with whatever you&#x27;re shaving with. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; gel and the regular one, but it feels good to me.</li>
    <li> My electric razor stopped giving me a good shave and left unsightly hair on my neck.  So, I decided to return to shaving with a razor.  My only problem was selecting shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the products of my youth, some modern shaving soaps have chemical additives that irritate my skin.  Some shaving products dry my skin, while others leave my face with a bit of redness, a bit like a mild sunburn.  I need a product that is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Schick Hydro Sensitive Shave Gel is not a shaving soap.  Instead this gel is specially formulated for sensitive skin.  I was impressed to read that it has aloe and emollients.  So, I decided to switch to this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the Schick Hydro Sensitive Shave Gel.  My face feels cool when I apply the gel and seems somehow to smooth the passage of the razor when I shave.  After the shave, my face is comfortable with no redness, dryness or irritation.  I like this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this product.  The Schick Hydro Sensitive Shave Gel is great for shaving and is a good answer to the question of skin irritation</li>
    <li> im still  tring this one so far ok</li>
    <li> It works fairly well for shaving.  My problem is that I think gel is messier to apply and get from the container.  I still prefer the foam type.</li>
    <li> Good for my tough beard and tender redhead skin.</li>
    <li> This product is better  than the expensive one out there. I bought it for my Brother, and he likes it so much. I am going to buy it again. This time for myself.</li>
    <li> Read the full description. I thought I was getting two cans of shave gel, and only got one. I&#x27;ve bought the same can before at a brick and mortar for half the price. My fault, but the picture of two shave cans misled me</li>
    <li> Hi guys, go for it coz it is just what your body (mostly face) needs ok! It works just perfect!!!</li>
    <li> https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;pe_250480_145942760_cm_1_star4?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B00NVVU9DI%3A4%2C&amp;channel&#x3D;ec_dgt&amp;crAuthToken&#x3D;gBCbrrU5m5wTv0rm3ThuYJ%2F%2Bge4Spu3TvFOzgnEAAAADAAAAAFXDlqlyYXcAAAAA&amp;customerId&#x3D;A3EXGDFXLIY7EJ#</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, however, WalMart sells same item .75 cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this shaving gel.  It gets the job done and leaves my face and body smooth.</li>
    <li> I kept the first bottle in the bathroom and it got wet, rusted up, and blew up. Maybe it saw too much water from constant condensation, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle I kept in my room, hoping it would be kept dryer than the first. I took it with me whenever I shaved (about 3x per week). Well this bottle got wet, rusted up, and blew up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product which makes shaving with a blade so easy and effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking I was getting two cans of Schick Hydro Sensitive Skin Shave.  But once I got my order, I found that the company only sent me one can.  When I ordered this item it was two cans, but guess what I got one can that I am not happy with.  The product works great, the company lied right out.  When I made my order, it showed two cans, if you go back to the product page on Amazon you will only see just one can now.  What a major rip off, I will never order another thing from this company.</li>
    <li> i am real plaesed with my whole schick shaving sustem&lt;br /&gt; i will recommend this product highly - it works real well on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Always used to be a Gillette man, but got a coupon for Schick Hydro 5 and Gel Shave cream, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
    <li> It was priced fantasically....so I purchased a few of them.  If you can get it cheapier? buy as many as you can.  This product is normally around the $5 range.</li>
    <li> It gives a smooth shaving experience. Very nice shaving gel. Highly recommended. After shaving with this gel l have no irritation whatsoever, the smell is great.</li>
    <li> it is a good product and does not dry my face with too much alcohol and chemicals.</li>
    <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves good.&lt;br /&gt;No skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Cool graphics. (its like I&#x27;m shaving at the beach)</li>
