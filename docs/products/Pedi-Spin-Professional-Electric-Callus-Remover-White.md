      <li>the deal was ok...</li>
      <li>This team works well although it would be great if I had more power to rotate as much pressure if it is turned off for safety must be not to damage the skin just have to adapt not just pressure and thus the rest goes well</li>

<li> Despite some of the other negative reviews, this product works extremely well and if used correctly, it is well worth the money.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected, does not work well, no instructions to it as well.</li>
<li> I saw a commercial on tv for it and was really excited to get it; but really disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not recommend! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> It would stop spinning when applied to foot, also the callous remover would not spin at all.  This was a piece of $#%# don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> was not to my liking because one team came with broken and additional parts will not see the functionality according believed he had saw some advertising</li>
    <li> Despite some of the other negative reviews, this product works extremely well and if used correctly, it is well worth the money. It removes calluses and the end result is SMOOTH FEET. Two important keys: 1) Follow the directions, soak and then dry your feet. 2) Ensure that too much pressure is not applied when using the product. Be patient, take your time and you will see results.  It stores nicely in one of those nylon sun-glass bags (with drawstring). I am not a company spokesperson but probably should be. It really does work.</li>
    <li> this machine function but is defficient</li>
    <li> I was wrong...the deal was ok...</li>
    <li> Went into the garbage after one use. A foot file works better than this. Save your money, the Ped-Egg is better.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what they claim it does. It stops if you put press it little on your foot. Also Pedi Spin removes very little off your feet. I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> its not working as a remover ,looks like a toy.</li>
    <li> It not as is seen in the TV commercial. If not an imitation, but slows down when in contact with skin and I can not delete anything. not recommended. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> When you use it, the stupid file attachment keeps flying off!</li>
    <li> The Service was amazing.. The product didn&#x27;t commint my expectations</li>
    <li> not as good as seen on tv</li>
    <li> This is the bad device I can buy its good for nothing,haven&#x27;t strenght dont remuve anything</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t function, as soon as you put in the batteries, is ever get on, you can not get off the device until you keep out the batteries&lt;br /&gt;Fabio Murillo</li>
    <li> This team works well although it would be great if I had more power to rotate as much pressure if it is turned off for safety must be not to damage the skin just have to adapt not just pressure and thus the rest goes well</li>
    <li> awful device. doesnt work at all.</li>
    <li> waited 6 weeks for to get from China battery cover didn&#x27;t want to stay on and as soon as it touched the skin it stopped, it did manage to rip the skin off the back of my heel and 5 minutes after I got it the damn thing just quit so I threw it in the trash and I&#x27;m out 6 bucks</li>
    <li> Might have a different opinion if it worked. I&#x27;m not spending $46 return shipping for a $7 +/- product.</li>
    <li> it was not at as they said it was.  It was on the balloon.  When I put it on my feet it stop spinning.  When you hardly touch your feet it spins, but when you apply pressure it stop.  it was in the garbage it 1 min.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove anything from my feet at all.  Total waste of money.  I saw a commercial on tv for it and was really excited to get it; but really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, but you need be patient, you need go slow in your feets for see the change</li>
    <li> The appliance stops working when you try to use it for removing dead skin. Does not work as advertised. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>

    <li> Not what I expected, does not work well, no instructions to it as well.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work on working feet... If you are a super model with baby skin maybe you might have better luck.</li>
    <li> It was broken when I received it. I unwrapped it from the shipping package, and didn&#x27;t open the product right away. I threw out the address and everything before I opened it. Dumb move on my part. Lesson learned. That&#x27;s what I get for trusting it was working.</li>
    <li> Works very well but caution must be taken in overdoing it, can eat into good hide.</li>
