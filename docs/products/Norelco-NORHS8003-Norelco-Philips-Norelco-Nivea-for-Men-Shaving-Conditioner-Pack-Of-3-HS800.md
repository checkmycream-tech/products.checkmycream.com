      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it as a gift for any guy, with a suitable razor that is!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>What more can I say,  I am a happy user.</li>
      <li>I had to return it because I could not use it with the Norelco razor model I own.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product and very pleased with the service.  </li>
      <li>It protects my skin while I shave, and I make sure that I do not run out because of amazon.com.</li>
      <li>The product produces a very clean shave.  </li>
      <li>Great for men with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It is still the best shaving system for me but a little more information for the user would help both of my concerns.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Telephone call to Norelco revealed that the REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  </li>
      <li>Can be used with any water friendly electric razor.</li>
      <li>Again, the product arrived very quickly, and the product was as stated, also got an extra shaving unit with it, which was a nice suprise.</li>
      <li>He had heard good things about it and was curious.  </li>
      <li>Use these up pretty quick as well.</li>
      <li>Provides OK protection but not as soothing or smooth as using some other gels.</li>

      <li>My husband uses this &amp; really likes the  connivence  of the shaver, &amp; also likes the conditioning in the shave cream.</li>
      <li>They are fast on the order.</li>
      <li>One of the cans was all most empty</li>
      <li>product and  service is typical of the outstanding work done by Amazon in making Customer Service and Satisfaction its number one goal.</li>
      <li>I have changed to Old Spice body wash applied to the face before saving a fraction of the cost and much smoother.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner itself is good, but this is a RIP-OFF ad -- by a not-very-apologetic seller.  </li>
      <li>gel provides me with the closest shave I can get for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I changed to Old Spice while i was waiting for the shipment to arrive.  </li>
      <li>I got it back so fast, I did not even use up the container that I started when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, this conditioner is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I actually got them with the new shaving heads, but I had to find that out by trial and error.  </li>
      <li>It was not clear how I would get new replacement reservoirs for the conditioner.  </li>

    <li> The conditioner itself is good, but this is a RIP-OFF ad -- by a not-very-apologetic seller.  The picture shows the replacement cartridge, which used to come with the 3-can set.  Telephone call to aSavings revealed the ad was &amp;#34;for illustration purposes only&amp;#34;.  They DID allow me to return it and did credit my card, but I still had to pay return shipping :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Telephone call to Norelco revealed that the REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  So much for a really neat system.  You can keep your old cartridge from going bad for at least a while if you regularly rinse the system in alcohol.</li>
    <li> One of the cans was all most empty</li>
    <li> I have changed to Old Spice body wash applied to the face before saving a fraction of the cost and much smoother.  I changed to Old Spice while i was waiting for the shipment to arrive.  Now I wish I had never bought it.  Reminds of me of printers and ink costs.</li>
    <li> I have experinced trouble in finding this product in local drug stores and in big shopping malls. There were other choices but non for my razor. I enjoy this product and very pleased with the service.  What more can I say,  I am a happy user. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product from Amazon for over 4 years.  The product produces a very clean shave.  Price is great.  It arrives on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product and  service is typical of the outstanding work done by Amazon in making Customer Service and Satisfaction its number one goal.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product. I had to return it because I could not use it with the Norelco razor model I own. When I read the web discription it did not tell this product was for a specific model razor.</li>
    <li> Again, the product arrived very quickly, and the product was as stated, also got an extra shaving unit with it, which was a nice suprise. Like I said before, Norelco is a great product and Amazon is a great place to shop. BZ</li>
    <li> It was not clear how I would get new replacement reservoirs for the conditioner.  I actually got them with the new shaving heads, but I had to find that out by trial and error.  Previously, it came with the conditioner.    The conditioner formulation appears to have changed.  It does not lubricate as well and more is required to get the same shaving result.    It is still the best shaving system for me but a little more information for the user would help both of my concerns.</li>
    <li> Great for men with sensitive skin.  Can be used with any water friendly electric razor.</li>
    <li> Provides OK protection but not as soothing or smooth as using some other gels. Use these up pretty quick as well.</li>
    <li> The product does what is expected. The quantity is good in that it lasts months. The replacemnet cartridges prolongs the life of the shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this &amp; really likes the  connivence  of the shaver, &amp; also likes the conditioning in the shave cream.</li>
    <li> The product is not worth overcost. Can&amp;#34; throw away Norelco elec. razor because product is hard to find here.</li>
    <li> Good products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel provides me with the closest shave I can get for my sensitive skin.  Also use it the shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff just makes my Noreleco shaver glide over my face. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that my whiskers totally disappear I would swear the shaver never touched my face.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Just a refill as I use this product all the time. Good price.</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely manner and to specifications.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> My dad asked for some of this last Christmas.  He had heard good things about it and was curious.  He was thrilled with the results!  I&#x27;d recommend it as a gift for any guy, with a suitable razor that is!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item before and as long as they make it I will purchase it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this conditioner is the one for you. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It protects my skin while I shave, and I make sure that I do not run out because of amazon.com. They are fast on the order. I got it back so fast, I did not even use up the container that I started when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  One can didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The Conditioner white plastic container that snaps into the handle that was pictured with this item did not come in the box, why not, I have bought this item a dozen times and it always is included when it is pictured with the item, what is the deal, how do I get this rectified, please forward my missing item or don&#x27;t purchase from this false advertising store!!!</li>
    <li> fine product, have used it for several years</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the lotion I expected and cartridge replacement was not included, as pictured.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Easily loads into my norelco razor and dispenses properly for a very close comfortable shave. Arrived on time. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
