      <li>This is my favorite brand, love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I but to put on my skin and hair, this is one of my top favorites.</li>
      <li>This shampoo was natural and not tested on animals, so I thought it would be great to try.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair feel so clean and manageable.  </li>
      <li>an added footnote, I recently colored my hair with henna, and I am still enjoying great hair from this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I use Giovanni Eco Chic with Keratin and Argan Oil, and my hair is just fine (I still dye it, but I don&#x27;t do anything else to it).</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love it for its mild scent, conditioning effect, and of course it&#x27;s ethics.</li>
      <li>Not only are no animals used and abused for testing, it&#x27;s a great shampoo line</li>
      <li>used this shampoo while living in three different houses with well water, as well as a house with city water, and it works great in all those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It might work if you don&#x27;t have superfine, chemically treated and abused hair like I do, but I&#x27;d say if you do ANYTHING to your hair, don&#x27;t buy</li>
      <li>For a natural shampoo you get very good lather and the slight smell is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I get clean hair without stripping it.</li>

      <li>It makes my hair feel so clean, but not stripped.</li>
      <li>I found that I had to use a lot of the shampoo in order to clean all my hair.</li>
      <li>I would say that this brand is still better than most others that aren&#x27;t natural, but I would still recommend researching to see if the product is genuine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really like the smell so much better than some of the designer shampoos.</li>
      <li>I love the gentle lather.  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this brand to anyone who is looking to switch to more eco and animal friendly products.</li>
      <li>Great, soft, citrusy smell, leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>The smell is clean and light, it gets your hair really clean, leaves no residue but still lathers really well.</li>
      <li>I was so happy whenever I would go to a hotel and have some other shampoo to use!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>Rich shampoo cleans really well without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>(Right now, I wash about every 3-5 days).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just right for my hair.</li>
      <li>but I get my fun lather back :-)</li>
      <li>It is pure and simple with the great aroma of added essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I am ready to give up unless someone gave give me some hope with a product i have not used ARRGGGHHH!</li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re all natural, and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>shampoos started pointing out that they were \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;, I checked the bottle, and sure enough the BWC Shampoo has no sulfates, either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finally back to buy some more.</li>
      <li>and I had been using baby shampoos for the last many years</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled upon this brand,  but it has been my favorite shampoo ever since I first tried it several years ago.</li>
      <li>But thankfully, now with this &amp;#34;Beauty without Cruelty&amp;#34; Daily Benefits Shampoo, I&#x27;m back to having nice clean shiny hair again.  </li>

      <li>ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;+ does not dry nor darken fairly blond dry hair,&lt;br /&gt;+</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> leaves my hair rather dry/brittle. i do like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have tight curly hair and I found this shampoo to be too drying for my hair. its definitely not a shampoo to use everyday. maybe once a month to clean massive built-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a vegan eco-friendly shampoo that cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.  This shampoo works!  And it smells nice, too.  Before I was stuck with ALAFFIA Everyday Shea - Moisturizing Shampoo ... that stuff was terrible!  No matter how many times I washed my hair with it, my hair would come out greasy and not clean.  Unfortunately I purchased the Everyday Shea stuff in bulk, so I was stuck with it for a very long time. I was so happy whenever I would go to a hotel and have some other shampoo to use!  I just had no idea that eco-friendly shampoo could be that bad.  But thankfully, now with this &amp;#34;Beauty without Cruelty&amp;#34; Daily Benefits Shampoo, I&#x27;m back to having nice clean shiny hair again.  The other benefit is that you only need a tiny bit of shampoo each time.  My bottle has lasted me about one year.  I&#x27;m finally back to buy some more.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my new favorite.  I have been trying to stay away from harsh chemicals.  According to the Environmental Working Group website, this shampoo rating is very low (meaning low in chemicals).  I thought I would give it a try.  Love, love, love it.  It leaves my hair clean and soft much like the expensive salon shampoo.</li>
    <li> Vegan and cruelty-free, plus does the job that no other shampoo seems to do. Will get this every time! Great scent and doesn&#x27;t require tons of it to get your hair clean, like Kiss My Face does.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Order this shampoo all the time.</li>
    <li> Not only are no animals used and abused for testing, it&#x27;s a great shampoo line and I really like the smell so much better than some of the designer shampoos.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo for the rfirst time and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I will definitely buy it again.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is phenomenal.  I love how it makes my hair feel so clean and manageable.  I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled upon this brand,  but it has been my favorite shampoo ever since I first tried it several years ago.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, non drying, tons of lather. Beauty without the cruelty, perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand, love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great, soft, citrusy smell, leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner leaves your hair super soft with no residue. It smells pretty good, I’d say amazing. This is one of the best vegan cruelty-free products I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It makes my hair very soft. My 4 year old daughter uses it too.</li>
    <li> My review echoes many of what has already been said.  I have very thick, coarse hair and this shampoo is the only one that gets my hair and my scalp very clean.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was natural and not tested on animals, so I thought it would be great to try. It did not seem to provide much benefit for my hair needs, though.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, great price and fast shipping from vendor!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful to use.  It is pure and simple with the great aroma of added essential oils.  Once I used this product I realized that no other shampoos can even come close in comparison.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.  It is very moisturizing for my dry, color treated hair.  The scent is very light but pleasant.</li>
    <li> Just great:&lt;br /&gt;+ perfect low pH (info from the BWC site), pH balanced,&lt;br /&gt;+ vegan, no animal testing / ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;+ does not dry nor darken fairly blond dry hair,&lt;br /&gt;+ expiration date Jan. 2016,&lt;br /&gt;+ paraben and SLS free,&lt;br /&gt;+ made in US,&lt;br /&gt;+ bottle plastic #2 (rel. safe, reusable),&lt;br /&gt;+ the label is cleanly removable (if moving slowly from the edge),&lt;br /&gt;+ organic essential oils aroma (nice to me, not too strong).</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair (which I do color) and I had been using baby shampoos for the last many years but honestly I&#x27;ve missed the lathering, which baby shampoos of course don&#x27;t use.  I had been using the BWC leave-in conditioner for several years, so I decided to try the shampoo.  I shampoo about every 5-6 days.  (No one should shampoo every day -- no wonder those reviewers said their hair is dry!) I love the gentle lather.  This feels like a \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; shampoo -- it gets stuff *out* of my hair and does not coat it with anything.  So I get the same feeling of clean and simple as baby shampoo but I get my fun lather back :-)</li>
    <li> The very best and only stamp I will ever use.  I love it and recommend it to everyone!  Being organic doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit!</li>
    <li> This is a review for the shampoo/conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thin, straight, blonde hair. My scalp is dry so my hair gets oily rather quickly. With this combination, my hair and scalp are less oily, which means that I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often. (Right now, I wash about every 3-5 days). Because it is not weighed down, the blonde in my hair stands out better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for two months now, and it has really dried out my hair like another reviewer said. As a result, my hair is dry, frizzy, tangled, and less manageable. I&#x27;ve been getting knots in it a lot, and I&#x27;ve actually had to cut a few of the knots out. I am thinking that this is a result of the conditioner rather than the shampoo, but I can&#x27;t be certain.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of other natural hair products that I have tried have made my hair really oily but have maintained the health and manageability. The alternative that this combination has given me--dry and damaged--certainly isn&#x27;t any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am not sure about the ingredients in this particular combo, but when I looked up another product by BWC: Beauty Without Cruelty Rosemary/mint/tea Tree Shampoo 16 fl oz, the reviews talked about the harmfulness of the ingredients in that shampoo (one person used the word \\&quot;carcinogenic\\&quot;). I would say that this brand is still better than most others that aren&#x27;t natural, but I would still recommend researching to see if the product is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am going to continue using this combination until it runs out; however, I do not plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for daily use - nice lather, light scent, and no build up. This is a great value also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BWC shampoo for almost nine years.  It works very well.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or leave it limp.</li>
    <li> Wanted to update my review this shampoo is terrible.  It used to be great but now leaves my hair dull, dry and breaking..  Truly awful shampoo!!! BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Cleans well and smells great!</li>
    <li> I went vegan a few years ago and changed everything I bought. I tried a number of natural shampoos and conditioners, and while I alternate frequently, this is one I always come back to. The smell is clean and light, it gets your hair really clean, leaves no residue but still lathers really well. I use this one in the winter when my hair gets weighed down by hats and static, and I use the Moisture Plus line year round since I have dry hair. Those also have a light, sweet scent, feel great on my hair, and make my hair look great. I also use their skincare items. HIGHLY recommend this brand to anyone who is looking to switch to more eco and animal friendly products.</li>
    <li> Best hair care brand. Period. And they&#x27;re all natural, and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo.  It leaves my hair clean without harming animals.  Win!  Win!</li>
    <li> I refuse to buy any product where an animal was tortured to produce it. I&#x27;m not even vegetarian or Vegan,  I just think it&#x27;s evil when a dominant species with thumbs and giant ape brains  forcefully abuses a species at a less evolved level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if super advanced aliens came here and started testing on your friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use their conditioner to wash my hair but will use a drop of this if I  am filthy.</li>
    <li> This is my daily shampoo. I love it for its mild scent, conditioning effect, and of course it&#x27;s ethics. It works perfectly for my dry hair when I also use a good conditioner, preferably Collective Wellbeing&#x27;s conditioner for frizz and curls.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good daily shampoo to use, without harsh and chemical ingredients, that is not tested on animals. Beauty Without Cruelty was the answer to my needs. It is made with great ingredients like horsetail and nettle, and does not have carcinogens, to add volume or poisons to my hair (which also be absorbed in my skin). My hair rinsed clean and it felt great. There are no strong perfumes and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a healthy shampoo option.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  For a natural shampoo you get very good lather and the slight smell is pleasant.  Definately not the noxious chemically smell of regular shampoos.    You DO need to use a conditioner after using this shampoo though.  I have always used conditioner so it is not a problem for me but if you can&#x27;t take the time for this step then you might want another shampoo.    After my local grecery store stopped carrying BWC shampoo I turned to Amazon where I now have it on subscription for a better price than what I was buying it for locally.</li>
    <li> Rich shampoo cleans really well without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The major selling point for me is its &amp;#34;beauty without cruelty.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My local store also stopped carrying this shampoo just after I discovered it. So I&#x27;m very happy Amazon has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle citrus scent&lt;br /&gt;- Sparing amount gets the job done, one bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;- Pure and clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;- nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: My hair is oily and doesn&#x27;t need conditioning. As mentioned by others, if your hair needs conditioning then this shampoo alone won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few shampoos that does not seem to where my hair down.  In addition, it lathers very nice for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was surprised because I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that much out of this shampoo BUT after I used it my hair was so shiny and it&#x27;s weird but when I was blowing my hair dry it dried almost twice as fast and I used the same mousse in my hair but a little less.  I&#x27;m thinking that it was the shampoo, maybe it made my hair a little less heavy?????</li>
    <li> Beauty without Cruelty is a wonderful shampoo, especially good for those people allergic to certain \\&quot;soap\\&quot; products like me.  My hair feels squeaky-clean and totally refreshed after each shampoo.  Wonderful, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Everybody knows store-bought shampoos induce dry rot in your hair, but I had the mistaken notion that it was because of harsh chemicals and all that. I bought BWC shampoo and conditioner as part of my quest to buy only vegan products and with the idea that since they were \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; they wouldn&#x27;t harm my hair. Ah--no. After one month my hair was so dry and fragile that I had to cut six of the painstakingly grown inches off my hair (it took about three years for me to grow just that much). It *seriously* messed up my hair. Granted, I color my hair and used to straighten it, BUT when I was using salon shampoos and a salon deep conditioner, my hair was at least tolerable to deal with. It might work if you don&#x27;t have superfine, chemically treated and abused hair like I do, but I&#x27;d say if you do ANYTHING to your hair, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up cutting all my hair off (pixie cut) six months ago because of a horrible trim-that-was-actually-the-stylist&#x27;s-attempt-to-put-layers-in-my-hair, and I figured, if I&#x27;m keeping it short I&#x27;ll go back to a vegan shampoo, but I most definitely did not choose this one. I use Giovanni Eco Chic with Keratin and Argan Oil, and my hair is just fine (I still dye it, but I don&#x27;t do anything else to it). So if you want to go vegan or vegetarian with your shampoo, try that one.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It makes my hair feel clean without leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> Bought the set, shampoo and conditioner. Each has its own excellent properties. I get clean hair without stripping it. Fine hair is really hard to deal with. Anything can wash your hair, only a few can clean it properly.</li>
    <li> With Beauty without Cruelty Daily Benefits Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;*Hair is shiny and manageable&lt;br /&gt;*Hair feels clean and silky, not coated with \\&quot;product\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;*Smell is pleasant and citrusy while shampooing, but doesn&#x27;t make a cloud of perfume to disturb others in the movie theater or in the car.&lt;br /&gt;*Hair is not staticky, even in the driest winter air&lt;br /&gt;*Never had to switch shampoos in the 12 or so years since I discovered this one.&lt;br /&gt;*Hair stays clean for 2-3 days before I need to shampoo again&lt;br /&gt;*Also makes a great body wash&lt;br /&gt;*BWC means it&#x27;s not tested on animals, ever.  Moreover, they don&#x27;t keep \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their products with new ingredients that may have been tested on animals by other companies.  Clean your hair with a clean conscience!&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve used this shampoo while living in three different houses with well water, as well as a house with city water, and it works great in all those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this shampoo is perfect.  When used along with the Beauty Without Cruelty Daily Benefits Conditioner, my hair is silky, shiny, and manageable.  In the wintertime, my hair is not staticky.  There is no goopy buildup or stickiness, and when I run my hands through my hair, it doesn&#x27;t make my hands have that weird slippery feeling you get from shampoos and conditioners with silicone in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shampoos started pointing out that they were \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;, I checked the bottle, and sure enough the BWC Shampoo has no sulfates, either.  In the past, I used to have to switch shampoos every couple of month, because they seemed to stop working properly.  I have been using BWC shampoo for probably 12 or 13 years now, with no need to switch.  I could not be more satisfied.  It works better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, including salon shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added footnote, I recently colored my hair with henna, and I am still enjoying great hair from this shampoo.  It looks and feels as excellent as ever.</li>
    <li> So this is not great stuff. I have fine wavy/curly hair. I do not dye or use any styling products. My hair does not get blowed dried or straightening or curled,etc. It is completely NATURAL. SO why is it so hard for me to fine a natural shampoo that doesnt dry out my hair or make me lose hair. This shampoo has made me lose a lot of hair and my hair feels more dry. I have been on a mission to find a natural chemical free shampoo for a least a year. I have gone through all the products at Sprouts and now have gone through alot on online and BLAHHH. I feel theres no hope. I have tried Max Green Alchemy, John Masters, ALBA, ABBA, Jason Naturals, Andalou, Christina moss, Aubrey, etc. AND they have either made my hair dry or made me lose too much hair. How is that possible if when I use to use store bought products I didnt have that problem. I am ready to give up unless someone gave give me some hope with a product i have not used ARRGGGHHH!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now. It makes my hair feel so clean, but not stripped. It smells amazing. I&#x27;ve very picky about the products I but to put on my skin and hair, this is one of my top favorites. My boyfriend even started buying it too!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo it&#x27;s just right for my hair. The plus moisturizer makes my hair too greasy</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and this shampp completely dried it out. It was bought as a gift for me, but I would never buy this for myself. I feel bad for the one who bought this for me because it was a COMPLETE waste of money.</li>
    <li> Left my hair extremely dry and brittle.  Threw out my bottle--will NOT be buying this product anymore</li>
    <li> I originally bought BWC shampoo with a desire for natural product. I used the shampoo alone without any conditioners. I found that I had to use a lot of the shampoo in order to clean all my hair. Okay, whatever, if it does a good job, that&#x27;s okay. My hair looked fine, it did not dry it out. However, prior to using this shampoo I had never had dandruff. Now my head snows :( My husband noted the same thing when he used it. For us, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
