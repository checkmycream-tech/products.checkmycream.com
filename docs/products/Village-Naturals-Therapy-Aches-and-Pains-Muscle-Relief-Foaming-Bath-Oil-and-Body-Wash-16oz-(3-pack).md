<li> My father approved of it as well, and we both recommend it highly for everyday aches, and major sprains or pains from surgeries.</li>
<li> The scent of this bath oil is fresh and clean smelling and the feel of the oil is just right, not too greasy - just adding some softness to the boring bath water.</li>
<li> /&gt;A must try after a long day at work or working in the garden.</li>
<li> Again I ordered this for my 87 years young, and her husband was having trouble with pain in his shoulder.</li>
<li> It doesnt dry out your skin, you can apply &amp; leave on &amp; it doesnt have a long period of &amp;#34;that odor&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Definitely want to try the other scents.</li>
<li> A few drops of essential oils are about the same.</li>
<li> All those other products INCLUDING Bi-freeze.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does have a mint smell to it and when you get out of the shower/bath I feel a slight tingle.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
<li> Very, Very disappointed that about half of a bottle had liked into the plastic bag and out into the card board box.</li>
<li> We both use it everyday.</li>
<li> He used this product and has no more pain.</li>
<li> Just received 3 bottles where each one had leaked out at least 1/4 each bottle in transit. .</li>
<li> It also helped with the pain left over from Moms broken hip!!!</li>
<li> I became obsessed with baths as a way to relax and that led me to bath salts which I then discovered this foaming bath salts in a wash form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> We bought it at our base exchange in Germany but have yet to see it again.</li>

    <li> My mom swear by this stuff. She&#x27;s a breast cancer survivor and shes still in physicak therapy so she gets aches and pains. I show up with a bottle of this stuff and the biggest smile comes over her face. she says that this is the best relief she has ever gotten from a bubble bath</li>
    <li> Love this makes me feel so relaxed while soaking it really works good on my tired muscles</li>
    <li> Love the entire line of this product. Feels great when I need to calm my muscle &amp; back pain, and the oils in it leave my skin nice &amp; soft. I like the smell too. Highly recommend village naturals products</li>
    <li> Love these.  Bought at walmart and then could not find it.  I love these.  They really work.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged and had to be returned.</li>
    <li> I think it was a great deal. I gave two away as gifts. I love anything that smells like menthol. I have only used it as a body wash on areas of my body that always hurt me. I feel a real cool sensation. I do think once I use it to soak in a bath with it I will notice more of an effect of it helping the deeper aches and pains if I soak for a long period of time. You can&#x27;t beat the price and if you have friends or family who have aches and pains and can take a bath I think they would find this body oil &amp; bubble bath to help them relax and give them a overall good feeling. You just need to make sure they appreciate the menthol, spearmint, etc. odor as some people do not.</li>
    <li> Tried this product before really helps ease the pain in my legs and lower back. Very, Very disappointed that about half of a bottle had liked into the plastic bag and out into the card board box.</li>

    <li> the best ever  love this for aches and pains</li>
    <li> Love these! Great scent! Definitely want to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but buying in bulk quantities it would be nice if the packager would be certain the lids are screwed on tight..... I ordered four packages of three bottles each and had some of the soap in each of the four plastic bags......Thank goodness they were in plastic bags.</li>
    <li> It bubbles up beautifully and is very relaxing in my bath.  I recommend this product. Wish the bubbles lasted longer after I use bar soap, they seem to dimiinsh.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and smells great!  It does help with aches and pains as well. I&#x27;m really glad I found this and so is my husband. We both use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;My mother uses it every day and swears by it. She is ninety-one and she says it helps to get hero bing each day as she puts it on her bath water .</li>
    <li> Smallish bottles did not get over powering sent. A few drops of essential oils are about the same.</li>
    <li> Again I ordered this for my 87 years young, and her husband was having trouble with pain in his shoulder. He used this product and has no more pain. It also helped with the pain left over from Moms broken hip!!!</li>
    <li> My father is an ex-Marine who does a lot of manual labor every day, and often has muscular tension and aches. I bought this for him and myself. I used it to get over ankle surgery, it eased the pain and stiffness in my ankle, as well as the aches and pains from being on crutches for months.... My father approved of it as well, and we both recommend it highly for everyday aches, and major sprains or pains from surgeries.</li>
