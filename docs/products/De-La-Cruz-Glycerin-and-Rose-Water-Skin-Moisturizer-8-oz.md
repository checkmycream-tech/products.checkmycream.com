      <li>Smells pretty, benifits skin, good price.</li>
      <li>this is a great product it leaves my skin soft and very clean.</li>
      <li>it removed the makeup and leave my face clean and it has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>You may want to dilute in in an empty spray bottle for best results.</li>
      <li>Well, I have since done that, but I really like this one way better than my own mix.</li>
      <li>It does a beautiful job of helping my chronically dry hair feel better and look shinier.</li>
      <li>I should have read the fine print, if there is any, before I did.</li>
      <li>Makes skin supple, provides a soft glow, and has a pleasant smell, to boot.</li>
      <li>It could have been filled with anything.</li>
      <li>I mist it over my face cream and remain happily comfortable in my skin all day.</li>
      <li>I figured if I liked it, I would order the 2 separately and mix my own in the future.</li>
      <li>I use this after i wash my face and it makes my skin really soft and smells so good.</li>
      <li>a great product but with so many other choices available</li>
      <li>This is lovely and sweet smelling and it really works!</li>
      <li>Also, I thought it would be more pure -- it contains a substance considered &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; to skin, i.e., dimethicone.</li>
      <li>I use it instead of soap since it leaves my face nice and soft.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses it after a shower, makes her skin feel soft, she likes the smell of it , nice</li>
      <li>Probably best for overnight use as it can be a little sticky to the touch and may be too much for daytime use.  </li>
      <li>A little is best because it does cause a sticky feeling if you use too much.</li>
      <li>I do dilute with 1/3 water, as my main uses are under moisturizer &amp; to spray over the top of mineral powder makeup to set it.</li>
      <li>I love this product for removing make up and refreshing my face at the same time.</li>
      <li>I have used many products over the years and cant believe how soft my skin is with this product I put it in a spray bottle and spray it on after a shower</li>
      <li>I cannot see any difference so far, any change after more than month.</li>
      <li>The product smells nice, and goes on fluidly.</li>
      <li>Not a cloying, too powerful scent.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not too picky about additives, the price is right.</li>
      <li>so when I saw this, I decided the price was right</li>
      <li>Looking for hyaluronic acid, aloe vera gel, and 100% pure glycerin now!</li>
      <li>It was the first time I&#x27;ve bought it, so I didn&#x27;t expect it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using glycerine and rosewater for about 40 years under my moisturizer and absolutely works!</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised and arrived on time, no problems at all.</li>
      <li>First, It was leaking in the box when it arrived.  </li>
      <li>really like this, smells nice and helps with dry skin</li>
      <li>I bought this brand instead of my usual because of the good price.</li>
      <li>Scent is soft and floral and my skin feels revitalized after a quick mid-day spritz.</li>
      <li>I prefer to use pure rosewater on my face (as a toner).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a Pure Rosewater &amp; Glycerin product.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression this glycerin was pure with rosewater as an additive, but the ingredient list is not displayed.</li>
      <li>Not a true rose smell.</li>
      <li>Working very well.</li>
      <li>This is too liquid for me and doesn&#x27;t really smell too much of roses.</li>
      <li>I would not have purchased this product so readily</li>
      <li>very well.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time as stated - Working great on my face issue - Mixed with Raw apple cider vinegar by Braggs</li>
      <li>Have tried many products and decided to use something traditional and simple.</li>
      <li>did I rate it highly?</li>
      <li>Really makes skin soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived on time as stated - Working great on my face issue - Mixed with Raw apple cider vinegar by Braggs</li>
    <li> It has an amazing smell and the glycerin is great for my skin. You may want to dilute in in an empty spray bottle for best results.</li>
    <li> Lovely.  I keep a small spray bottle at my desk and use for a mid-day facial refresher.  Scent is soft and floral and my skin feels revitalized after a quick mid-day spritz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this purchase, but I don&#x27;t think it is the fault of the product. I didn&#x27;t realize that I was merely getting glycerin water with a little rose scent, although that is exactly what was advertised. My fault completely that  did not pay attention. I was expecting a lotion. This is too liquid for me and doesn&#x27;t really smell too much of roses. That said, iit may be the perfect product for someone else. I am keeping it, hoping to make use of it in some way.</li>
    <li> softens the skin like butter, its a part of my daily skin regimen, cant do without it</li>
    <li> very good I works great</li>
    <li> I bought this brand instead of my usual because of the good price. It arrived today, and I am very disappointed to learn that it has additives, which I am trying to avoid. That&#x27;s the reason I buy what I expect to be a &#x27;natural&#x27; product, eg, just rosewater and glycerin, period. Had I known about these other ingredients (which are not mentioned in the listing), I would not have purchased this brand. This has polysorbate 80, dimethyl copolyol, and and DMDM hydantoin (whatever those are) and \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; which sounds a bit suspicious as well. This is NOT an all-natural product. The consistency is different from the one I usually use, and it has a strange-looking oily suds. I will be going back to my usual brand (which I have already ordered, as soon as I saw what was in this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, as I say, smells nice and probably softens your skin just fine. If you&#x27;re not too picky about additives, the price is right. If you want to steer completely clear of additives, go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Great for after the bath.</li>
    <li> I have been using rosewater and glycerin for years. I use it while damp from the shower. I put some in my hair while damp to control fly-aways and frizz. It does a beautiful job of helping my chronically dry hair feel better and look shinier. I also add some to bath water for a pleasant, hydrating soak. I put some in with my face lotion as it adds an extra moisturizing and softening than lotion alone. Be careful not to use too much on hair or it may look greasy and feel weighed down. I don&#x27;t have that problem because I have such incredibly dry hair. It smells amazing, like Nivea lotion or Dove soap. Not a cloying, too powerful scent. Consistency is silky and thin, not sticky and thick like many glycerin products. If you are an overall &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; person, like myself LOL, you can&#x27;t go wrong. (Dry hair, dry skin, etc.)</li>
    <li> For anyone who has sensitive skin, beware as this has fragrance and smells awful.  Check out heritage rosewater &amp; glycerin.</li>
    <li> I love this product for removing make up and refreshing my face at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product since Walgreens stopped carrying it.  Love the scent and the rest of its properties.  Thank you for carrying it.</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove my makeup.  it removed the makeup and leave my face clean and it has a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful. I spray this on our sheets and also the bedding in our guest room. Very light smell.</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry soap and use this to make it smell good plus it&#x27;s glycerin makes my clothes feel softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using glycerine and rosewater for about 40 years under my moisturizer and absolutely works!</li>
    <li> Often during the winter, my skin becomes so dry that it feels as if it could crack by smiling. Have tried many products and decided to use something traditional and simple. Makes skin supple, provides a soft glow, and has a pleasant smell, to boot. The most effective and inexpensive moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. I mist it over my face cream and remain happily comfortable in my skin all day. It seals in moisture, but if you use the amount needed to wear it alone, makes you a little too shiny. Great as a body spray also and helps get rid of the curse of itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I find this mixture to be very soothing for my very rough dry skin. I have dry skin patches on my body and around my nose and putting this lotion on it help relieve it totally. I&#x27;m very happy with this mixture would highly recommend.    6-2016  Still loving it 😍</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it after a shower, makes her skin feel soft, she likes the smell of it , nice</li>
    <li> This is lovely and sweet smelling and it really works! Just a little bit goes a long way. Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Makes your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Working very well. Skin is softening up as I continue to apply it each evening before retiring.</li>
    <li> I just went natural and I brought this product to make homemade leave in conditioner. This product works great and was exactly what i needed. Great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Love the  feel on my legs and arms. Light and good for my skin. Recommended to several friends and family.</li>
    <li> I bought this and use it in my mist bottle mixture for my hair. A little is best because it does cause a sticky feeling if you use too much. It has a very nice rose smell and makes my hair very soft and keeps it moisturized.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible according to my nose!  Not a true rose smell.</li>
    <li> I have Eczema and real sensitive skin. A friend had told me about rose water I tried it and it works great. I have used many products over the years and cant believe how soft my skin is with this product I put it in a spray bottle and spray it on after a shower and it smells great and makes my skin so soft!!</li>
    <li> Come on time .packed very well. I used it on dry skin and it works like a dream .within two days my skin looked so good.</li>
    <li> Great item. Arived in a bag. Leaked in bag but not a lot. Smells like roses. Great on my skin. I use it as a serum. Would buy again. It is mostly real rose extract and glycerin.</li>
    <li> This rose water and glycerin got good reviews so I ordered some. I should have read the fine print, if there is any, before I did. It contains polysorbate 80, Dimethyl Copolyol and DMDM Hydantoin. You may want to research these ingredients before deciding if you want to buy. I&#x27;m sending mine back. I hope one of the others is better. I hope the description of some of the Rose Water Glycerin products includes ingredients.</li>
    <li> I splash my face with water in the am and put this Rose Water on my face to wake up and smell like the rose garden&lt;br /&gt;until I have time to get into the show.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty, benifits skin, good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on keratosis pilaris (ugly red spots on the skin resembling chicken skin) which calls for glycerin and rose water. the product has both, smells GREAT and does the job of keeping my skin moisturised much longer. However you go through this in about 2 weeks .Its a great product but with so many other choices available I dont think I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get some glycerin for a face moisturizer, but I also had wanted to try rose water so when I saw this, I decided the price was right so I ordered. I figured if I liked it, I would order the 2 separately and mix my own in the future. Well, I have since done that, but I really like this one way better than my own mix. I put a little bit on my face at night and in the morning it is so soft. I really wish I had stuck with this one, but any future purchases, will be for this brand.</li>
    <li> This product which should be soothing contains, among other chemicals, Polysorbate 80 which can be an irritant producing rashes &amp; hives. The full ingredient list is not available in the listing. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a Pure Rosewater &amp; Glycerin product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and arrived on time, no problems at all. (Why is there a minimum word count for reviews?)</li>
    <li> This Rose-Water is a great skin softner and value for the money. Try it i&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> needs to be in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> this is a great product it leaves my skin soft and very clean. I use it instead of soap since it leaves my face nice and soft. i use it on my five year old to remove dirt and grime. plus it smells lovely on the skin . Would recommend !!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of roses, so a thumbs up for that.  The product itself dries a little sticky, but that may be typical. It was the first time I&#x27;ve bought it, so I didn&#x27;t expect it. I think it definitely softens your skin.</li>
    <li> I usually buy another brand with no preservatives, chemicals, etc. But this has not irritated my sensitive skin, &amp; I like the added boost of moisture from the glycerin. I do dilute with 1/3 water, as my main uses are under moisturizer &amp; to spray over the top of mineral powder makeup to set it. I have experienced no stickyness.</li>
    <li> really like this, smells nice and helps with dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this glycerin and rose water. I use it as agent.e make up remover  and travels with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this from cvs out of curiosity and I like it! I was hesitant to put it on my face because it isn&#x27;t all natural. I prefer to use pure rosewater on my face (as a toner). I tried it on my face and it&#x27;s kind of sticky (I think it&#x27;s the glycerin) so I won&#x27;t use it as a face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I rate it highly? I&#x27;m going to use it at a leave in conditioner for my frizzy, afro-textured hair. I think the glycerin will help to smooth it out a bit and the rosewater will give a wonderful scent. I&#x27;m also going to put some of it in a spray bottle to use as a moisturizing body mist when the weather gets warmer. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid (about $3), it&#x27;s a great value and a versatile product. I love the smell of roses so I&#x27;m glad to have this product in my beauty arsenal!!</li>
    <li> The bottle was open and leaking in the package. It could have been filled with anything.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I mix it with lotion and then spread it around.  It really makes my skin soft and less crepey-looking.  And, it smells wonderful!  I have re-ordered this product twice and plan to re-order again soon.  I love the fact that it makes my skin look healthier.</li>
    <li> This is best product ever! I use this after i wash my face and it makes my skin really soft and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I received this water a little while ago because I heard it was good for dry hair. They were right!!!! I&#x27;ll never again use just plain water and oil for my natural hair. If you are having this issue trust me you won&#x27;t be sorry for investing into this product. It smells wonderful too!!</li>
    <li> This smells great and really feels soothing on the skin.  Probably best for overnight use as it can be a little sticky to the touch and may be too much for daytime use.  Really makes skin soft.</li>
    <li> This product to me is just like water, it doesn&#x27;t work on my skin at all. I cannot see any difference so far, any change after more than month.</li>
    <li> First, It was leaking in the box when it arrived.  Also, I thought it would be more pure -- it contains a substance considered &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; to skin, i.e., dimethicone.</li>
    <li> The product smells nice, and goes on fluidly. However, I don&#x27;t really have dry skin, but I was looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to the myriad of surreptitiously comedogenic moisturizers on the market. I can&#x27;t use this under my mineral makeup, because, in addition to my naturally oily skin, I live in a humid climate and this glycerin product dries with a shine. This kept the drier parts of my skin soft post-chemical peels, but I didn&#x27;t like the slight stickiness and high shine that I woke up to in the morning. I was under the impression this glycerin was pure with rosewater as an additive, but the ingredient list is not displayed. I would not have purchased this product so readily had I known the additional ingredients included DMDM hydantoin, polysorbate 80, dimethicone copolyol (a water-insoluble silicone responsible for the shine), an an added fragrance (which could be various formulations).  Not sure this is what&#x27;s clogging my pores and causing new acne, so I will probably just give it to my mom who is battling dry skin resulting from a medical disorder. Looking for hyaluronic acid, aloe vera gel, and 100% pure glycerin now!</li>
