      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>Excellent dye release and very nice red color.</li>
      <li>it is the best henna that I have used and it imparts a good amount of color from the very first use (smile).</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I have only good things to say about my experiences with Amazon.\\&quot; All the best [at Amazon], from \\&quot;Smilely\\&quot; in Califonria.  </li>
      <li>for that if you&#x27;re just doing your own tattoos for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very cheap quality.  </li>
      <li>Which is why it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as the good quality hennas do!</li>
      <li>This time we paid more attention to getting a good consistency (I would describe it as smooth and \\&quot;pudding\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely authentic.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>We purchased more packets.</li>
      <li>I love the product and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
      <li>many places where I have tried to order</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Yes!\\&quot; I am ordering more of the good stuff and placing it in the freezer to keep it fresh.</li>
      <li>I just love it and so will you.</li>
      <li>If you are not immediately satisfied, it was our experience that the hair lightens and \\&quot;reddens\\</li>
      <li>I used it more for conditioning purposes than for color.</li>
      <li>I have not used it for a henna tattoo, so it might be okay</li>
      <li>it is easy to mix and apply.</li>
      <li>My hair felt incredibly strong and it stopped the breakage immediately.  </li>
      <li>We all left it in for around three hours and the results are beautiful for all of us.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna to dye my hair for some years now and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, the texture is perfect and is really 100% natural, it gives my gray hair a beautiful red color and lights up my naturally brunette hair.</li>
      <li>Smell does subside with time (though our male friends notably commented on the pleasant scent of tea).    </li>
      <li>It did have a smooth consistancy</li>
      <li>but i do warn that a pudding consistency may not be enough to rinse it out of hair while it is great for the application process.</li>
      <li>it does cause drying so make sure you have a really good moisturizing deep conditioner and leave-in.</li>
      <li>(Smile!)</li>
      <li>If you are looking for pure, finely sifted henna...</li>
      <li>so the color blends a bit better, but in spite of the mess and the time, I am happy to have found a natural alternative to the chemical dyes.  </li>
      <li>This henna is said to be rare and</li>
      <li>so my hair is nice and vibrantly red (I choose not to mix it in the iron container like the directions asked, this stopped it from turning brown.)</li>
      <li>but honestly I got some on my skin and washed it off after I noticed an hour later when i noticed</li>
      <li>We did add some water right before use.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really know how it compares to other henna brands, so I will try jamila henna next since I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it.</li>
      <li>It was the first time for me.</li>
      <li>I followed with a hot oil treatment.  </li>
      <li>Also this is my first time trying henna</li>
      <li>i believe my next attempt will be to dillute it alot more than before</li>
      <li>{I really don&#x27;t like the smell of indigo!}  </li>
      <li>The stain was dark orange at best with two separate tries and it kept clogging.</li>
      <li>It did what it said but next time I&#x27;ll purchase mine from the mehandi website to be sure I&#x27;m getting the real deal.    </li>
      <li>and honestly I was worried that at this price it wouldn&#x27;t produce a dark stain.</li>
      <li>We mixed the product with strong tea and let it set for about an hour.  </li>
      <li>The color is also not that of pure henna.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be well sifted but still gritty, which means it probably has finely ground sand added to bulk it up.</li>
      <li>Now I live in the USA, but that does not stop me from purchasing exotic products from other countries and especially when Amazon.com makes it so easy by bringing me all of the American and exotic products on one site.</li>
      <li>Got this for my hair-it worked really well.</li>
      <li>An important thing to consider in the future is that Henna is drying to your hair.  </li>
      <li>First of all this is BROWN henna not red, that&#x27;s the first thing I noticed on the package when I opened it.  </li>
      <li>It might give a decent dye on hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried that so I cannot say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a bit of research (see hennapage.com \\&quot;Henna at 60x\\&quot;)</li>
      <li>I love this product and it have my hair feeling full, thick, and soft.</li>
      <li>Test patches are highly recommended for blondes.     </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an AA woman with naturally kinky hair and this really has improved the state of my hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, the henna works pretty well for my hair type (very coily type 4a)</li>
      <li>I personally recommend applying the product by taking large amounts in your hands (gloves required!)</li>
      <li>The color deepened after a few days and gave my gray hairs a nice deep copper color.  </li>
      <li>Most likely the sand has been dyed green to make it look greener {fresher} than it really is.  </li>
      <li>Though the packet DOES say \\&quot;Dark Brown\\&quot;, rest assured: the tint is most definitely red.  </li>
      <li>&quot; considerably after a day or two.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s all natural henna</li>
      <li>Ladies, it&#x27;s time to impart color the natural way as women have been doing for thousands of years.</li>
      <li>It does loosen your natural curl pattern</li>
      <li>Real henna is red and this one was brown and added brown coloring to my hair.</li>
      <li>Product developed an orange/brown hue when mixed which is not typical of pure henna.</li>
      <li>It has dark stain and quick die release.</li>
      <li>considering henna only deepens your natural hair color, as a black woman, i think it shows that my hair really wasnt a black puff after all ( always had a coopery outer layer but can only tell in the light).</li>
      <li>I purchased this product from my local Indian grocery -- it was my first experiment with henna on my long African textured, 1B loc&#x27;d hair.  </li>
      <li>&quot;, but a tasteful, natural looking red.     </li>
      <li>and it only left a light yellow mark that was totally gone after a few hours.  </li>
      <li>Maybe the stuff at the Asian market was sitting on the shelf for a while which is why I got such a poor dye, so others may have better luck if they can get it fresher.</li>
      <li>Real pure henna has an orange/red dye molecule in order to get a dark brown dye either ppd a synthetic sulfate or matalic salt must be added, unless they went the organic route and added indigo in the mix but either way this is not pure henna</li>
      <li>it defined my natural curl pattern but it did dry it out (which all henna does)</li>

<li> The product was left in my hair for two hours, my friend&#x27;s for three and a half.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Based on the other reviews as well as the advice from the lady in the store I didn&#x27;t use an overly acidic recipe. I used a lemon, a lime, a raspberry tea decoction and distilled water. I also added some katha per the lady in the store. Excellent dye release and very nice red color.</li>
    <li> I saw this henna at the local Asian market and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The stain was dark orange at best with two separate tries and it kept clogging. It seems to be well sifted but still gritty, which means it probably has finely ground sand added to bulk it up. It&#x27;s also very green and likely has green dye added. Maybe the stuff at the Asian market was sitting on the shelf for a while which is why I got such a poor dye, so others may have better luck if they can get it fresher. It might give a decent dye on hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried that so I cannot say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a bit of research (see hennapage.com \\&quot;Henna at 60x\\&quot;) I found confirmation that this brand uses green dye and sand in their product.</li>
    <li> I had previously used other henna products meant to bring out highlights and lighten hair. My RA, who grew up in India, gave this packet to myself and a friend to try. I had auburn hair to begin with and my friend had dark brown. We mixed the product with strong tea and let it set for about an hour.  The product was left in my hair for two hours, my friend&#x27;s for three and a half. The product brought out definite highlights in both of our hair. We purchased more packets. This time we paid more attention to getting a good consistency (I would describe it as smooth and \\&quot;pudding\\&quot; like, using all tea) and letting it set. We did add some water right before use. Another friend with dark brown hair also used the product. We all left it in for around three hours and the results are beautiful for all of us. \\&quot;Red\\&quot;, but a tasteful, natural looking red.     A few side notes:  We did a test patch on two girls with blonder hair. One left it in for 45 minutes and the other perhaps an hour and a half. There was no noticeable difference to their hair. Test patches are highly recommended for blondes.     Though the packet DOES say \\&quot;Dark Brown\\&quot;, rest assured: the tint is most definitely red.  However, those intent on a Lucille Ball color should perhaps try another product.    One packet is enough for two people of average hair length and thickness, but, as always, air on the side of caution.     I personally recommend applying the product by taking large amounts in your hands (gloves required!) and applying it liberally to the hair.  Another person is advised. Also, covering the hair with a plastic bag during the waiting period(as we did the second time) seemed to amplify the results.     If you are not immediately satisfied, it was our experience that the hair lightens and \\&quot;reddens\\&quot; considerably after a day or two. Avoid shampooing for at least 24 hours and then sparingly for a day or two. For stronger results, apply thicker and leave longer or repeat the process.     Smell does subside with time (though our male friends notably commented on the pleasant scent of tea).    Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Everything turned out really good besides the face the henna package had a rip in it after i opened the mail packaging and it spilt everywhere, but it worked nicely and looked great :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman w/4a hair. I applied and left on hair over night, as I usually do! This is some bad henna. No tent, and it dried my hair out so bad!!! I waited a few weeks, deep conditioned weekly, and my hair is still dry. And my curls are gone! I have about 100gs left that im chucking in the trash! Waste of money... Would only get one star but it delivered timely, so can&#x27;t hate on that...</li>
    <li> Henna is good quality and quantity. It has dark stain and quick die release. for body art it does need an terp to get max stain. good for hair too.  This is sifted so that is really good for beginner henna artist.</li>
    <li> This henna is probably not pure.  It is very gritty which means it has had sand added to it.  Most likely the sand has been dyed green to make it look greener {fresher} than it really is.  It also smells different than other hennas.  Reminded me of when I add indigo to my henna. {I really don&#x27;t like the smell of indigo!}  I did go ahead and use this henna one time and although it worked, it was very drippy and messy {I mixed it the same as usual and don&#x27;t usually have it dripping down my neck}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this henna.  I have not used it for a henna tattoo, so it might be okay for that if you&#x27;re just doing your own tattoos for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very cheap quality.  Which is why it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as the good quality hennas do!</li>
    <li> I used it for my hair.  I like it.  I haven&#x27;t tried it for henna tattoos, but it is great for hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this henna as a protein/coloring treatment for my hair.  It was the first time for me. I followed with a hot oil treatment.  My hair felt incredibly strong and it stopped the breakage immediately.  An important thing to consider in the future is that Henna is drying to your hair.  Plan to moisturize for several weeks to regain moisture balance after using henna.  That is the same with all henna according to my research.  I like the 200g package and it was plenty for my APL hair.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Greetings,  To whom it may concern:    I am very delighted with my purchased product and with the delivery-time, too!  \\&quot;I have only good things to say about my experiences with Amazon.\\&quot; All the best [at Amazon], from \\&quot;Smilely\\&quot; in Califonria.  (Smile!)</li>
    <li> When you get into Henna it can be pricey and honestly I was worried that at this price it wouldn&#x27;t produce a dark stain. I was very surprised it created quite a dark stain and lasted I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product for the price!</li>
    <li> First of all this is BROWN henna not red, that&#x27;s the first thing I noticed on the package when I opened it.  Also, I prepared it just like the package said (soaked it over night, then applyed for 5 hours) and there is absolutley NO change.  My hair is dryed out, worse than if I spent all day at the beach and it smells like old spinach.  I still have the same ugly undyed hair that needs color.  While it was on my hair it slowly dryes out and drips down your neck and ruins whatever you&#x27;re wearing.  It did have a smooth consistancy so it may be good for henna tattoos but honestly I got some on my skin and washed it off after I noticed an hour later when i noticed and it only left a light yellow mark that was totally gone after a few hours.  This is NOT worth the time, effort or money.  I&#x27;ll switch back to chemical dye just so I don&#x27;t have to deal with that again. :(</li>
    <li> This Henna works so well!  It&#x27;s definitely authentic. I didn&#x27;t leave it on for as long as I&#x27;ve heard you have to leave it on for.  I left it on for 3 hrs and it worked great!</li>
    <li> this henna product is great. it is easy to mix and apply. If all done correct and you leave it on long enough it can last a solid week.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my local Indian grocery -- it was my first experiment with henna on my long African textured, 1B loc&#x27;d hair.  I mixed three packages of the henna with lemon juice and clove powder and let it sit overnight for the color to release. So as to not over dry my hair, I gave myself a deep conditioning treatment also the night before.  The next morning left the product in for just a little over five hours and I was very happy with the results.  I did not find the powder excessively gritty, but rinsing the paste out of my locs did take some time to do.  The color deepened after a few days and gave my gray hairs a nice deep copper color.  I will put indigo at the roots so the color blends a bit better, but in spite of the mess and the time, I am happy to have found a natural alternative to the chemical dyes.  After discovering henna and indigo, I will never go back to chemical dyes again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic effects. It colored my hair and made it stronger (great source of protein). The reason it gets four stars is because it is modified henna. Real henna is red and this one was brown and added brown coloring to my hair. It did what it said but next time I&#x27;ll purchase mine from the mehandi website to be sure I&#x27;m getting the real deal.    p.s. it does cause drying so make sure you have a really good moisturizing deep conditioner and leave-in.</li>
    <li> I bought the henna to make temporary tattoos and after hundreds of tests, using pure, mixed with tap water, distilled water, with lemon, oil used to mix the henna powder mixed with indigo, in Finally, I tried in every way possible and definitely not good for anything, is the worst product I purchased at Amazon.com, totally disappointed me and I urge everyone not to lose their money, that the henna is good for nothing, is the worst thing that can exist. I put a star because the Amazon.com system will not let me put zero stars.  Yo compre esta henna para hacer tatuajes temporales y después de hacer cientos de pruebas, de usarla pura, mezclada, con agua de grifo, agua destilada, con limón, con el aceite que se usa para mezclar la henna, mezclarla con polvo indigo, en fin, la probé de todas las maneras posibles y definitivamente no sirve para nada, es el peor producto que he comprado en Amazon.com, me decepciono totalmente y le recomiendo a todos que no pierdan su dinero, que esta henna no sirve para nada, es lo peor que puede existir. Le puse una estrella a este producto porque el sistema de Amazon.com no me permite ponerle cero estrellas, que es lo que merece este mal producto.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it have my hair feeling full, thick, and soft. I always wear my hair in braids, so when I take my hair down I put this henna on it.  I just love it and so will you.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for pure, finely sifted henna...this is not it.  This product is gritty and hell to wash from hair.  I am assuming that this product contains some additive (sand?) to bulk up the weight.  The color is also not that of pure henna.  The dye content is also weak.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hair-it worked really well. I had no complaints. There was an abundance of henna in the package for a great price. I didn&#x27;t think it was too gritty, it&#x27;s all natural henna so my hair is nice and vibrantly red (I choose not to mix it in the iron container like the directions asked, this stopped it from turning brown.)</li>
    <li> Ladies! What are you doing still putting those harsh dyes in your hair when you could be using an all natural product such as henna? Now I live in the USA, but that does not stop me from purchasing exotic products from other countries and especially when Amazon.com makes it so easy by bringing me all of the American and exotic products on one site. I love it! This henna is said to be rare and many places where I have tried to order it does not seem to keep it in stock and now I know why....it is the best henna that I have used and it imparts a good amount of color from the very first use (smile). Meaning, you get shine, strength, and color all with one application. \\&quot;Yes!\\&quot; I am ordering more of the good stuff and placing it in the freezer to keep it fresh. See it&#x27;s plant base and needs to be treated as such. Ladies, it&#x27;s time to impart color the natural way as women have been doing for thousands of years. Do you use a product that can impart color that has been around for thousands of years? There is none, so let&#x27;s go back to our roots and leave the chemicals to the chemist as they are too harsh. Fact, I was looking at a show on television and two people were examining a dead corps and the one guy said, \\&quot;Why is her scull black\\&quot;? And the other person said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s from the hair dye that she had been using.\\&quot; That still creeps me out to this day.</li>
    <li> This product is not sifted and does not stain skin in the traditional manner. Consider something else.</li>
    <li> This is great. I get it locally at an Indian grocer in Davie, FL. It is not the best sifted henna but it works wonders for my hair. I&#x27;m an AA woman with naturally kinky hair and this really has improved the state of my hair. It does loosen your natural curl pattern but it adds incredible shine.    I have pics that show how shiny my hair is at [...].</li>
    <li> This is not a pure henna it has had something added to it to alter the shades results. Real pure henna has an orange/red dye molecule in order to get a dark brown dye either ppd a synthetic sulfate or matalic salt must be added, unless they went the organic route and added indigo in the mix but either way this is not pure henna and I will not be buy another product from this seller.</li>
    <li> I used this henna and mixed it with green tea, coconut oil, olive oil, and conditioner and applied it to my hair. The dye takes about 30 minutes to an hour to release. I left it on my hair for about 4 hours with a plastic cap before it started to turn to liquid and drip down my neck so I rinsed it out. I used it more for conditioning purposes than for color. But it did give me a slight brown tint in the sunlight. And it also helped with breakage that I was experiencing after I used it for the 2nd time.     Overall, the henna works pretty well for my hair type (very coily type 4a) it defined my natural curl pattern but it did dry it out (which all henna does) so I had to deep condition twice to get the moisture back. Also this is my first time trying henna so I don&#x27;t really know how it compares to other henna brands, so I will try jamila henna next since I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it.</li>
    <li> I love the product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is great and I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna to dye my hair for some years now and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, the texture is perfect and is really 100% natural, it gives my gray hair a beautiful red color and lights up my naturally brunette hair. The pack was perfectly sealed and preserved. Will definitely continue using this brand and this seller.</li>
    <li> is nice a product; i even like the earthy smell of it. considering henna only deepens your natural hair color, as a black woman, i think it shows that my hair really wasnt a black puff after all ( always had a coopery outer layer but can only tell in the light). my hair did feel stronger after use but i do warn that a pudding consistency may not be enough to rinse it out of hair while it is great for the application process. i believe my next attempt will be to dillute it alot more than before so i could give it the 5 stars it deserves.</li>
    <li> Tried it on hair with some acidity to develop color. Product developed an orange/brown hue when mixed which is not typical of pure henna. Poor hair color result after 6hrs of application. Will discard left over in packet.</li>
