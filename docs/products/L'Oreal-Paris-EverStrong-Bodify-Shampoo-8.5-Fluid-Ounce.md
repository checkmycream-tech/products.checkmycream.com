      <li>My hair is very fine and would break easily.</li>
      <li>Have fine hair, enhance color to help give me more body, t L&#x27;Oreal Paris</li>
      <li>These L&#x27;oreal Sulfate free shampoos and conditioners are among my top shampoos and conditioners of all time, which includes salon brands.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo for how cheap it is.</li>
      <li>It does add body as it says it does, and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to break as easily as before I used this product.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of L&#x27;Oreal, but this line is pretty good and worth the price.</li>
      <li>I freely admit, it was the advertizing for L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong that drew me in.</li>
      <li>Fabulous scent, invigorating sensation, rich texture...and</li>
      <li>My hair smelled wonderful (similar to Aveda), but more importantly, it continues to be soft, shiny, and healthy looking after several months of use.</li>
      <li>and I no longer even use conditioner because my hair in such good shape.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and my hair feels really nice, so soft.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product!</li>

      <li>Has a nice fresh scent, not sweet like most.</li>
      <li>I love that it is so natural with no sulfates, too.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo with a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter since it is sulfate free to help with her dandruff and it may be good for that, however I will likely never find out because the smell from this shampoo is making me have an allergic reaction even being in the same room as my daughter now after she has used this (once).  </li>
      <li>Finally a SLS-free shampoo that foams properly and cleans effectively!</li>
      <li>Perhaps this works better on younger hair (I&#x27;m 68)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for awhile, and love the body it gives my fine and limp hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo gave me more body, tamed the fly-away&#x27;s and left my hair very soft!</li>
      <li>but she has to flip her head forward and thoroughly blow dry to get more fullness.  </li>
      <li>Does&#x27;nt take alot and works very well for what you aepect it to do.</li>
      <li>I have long hair colored light blonde, and when I use this, no more tangles, either, which is very nice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will continue to use again.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think it possible, but this shampoo (used with the matching conditioner) left my baby fine hair even more flyaway and shapeless than before.  </li>
      <li>Also an amazing product, but at $38 for an 8 oz bottle, it got pretty expensive.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair very soft but not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I cannot find this product anywhere locally but Amazon carries it for a great price.</li>
      <li>I used to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s top-of-the-line product, Kerastase (Bain de Force shampoo, and Lait Vital conditioner).</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong products are great for long hair that may be slightly damaged due to flat irons and blow dryers.</li>
      <li>There are all different types of types of shampoos and conditioners in this sulfate free line such as; Moisturizing, Damage Repair, Extra Volume and Extra Body</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really attest to whether or not it adds body, because I use it with the EverStrong Hydrate conditioner rather than the accompanying EverStrong Bodify conditioner (my hair is on the dry side during winter months).</li>
      <li>it leaves my long thick tresses lush, full, and tamed.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine and thin hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this shampoo, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t think they are making it anymore....  My hair is thinning and this seems to give it the body it needs to look fuller.</li>
    <li> This shampoo (and the conditioner) has it all.  Fabulous scent, invigorating sensation, rich texture...and it leaves my long thick tresses lush, full, and tamed.</li>
    <li> I always expect more from L&#x27;Oreal. This is a middle-of-the-line product that just does a so/so job on hair. It also does not, in my opinion, have a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and my hair feels really nice, so soft. I have long hair colored light blonde, and when I use this, no more tangles, either, which is very nice. It does add body as it says it does, and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to break as easily as before I used this product. The smell is ok, not the greatest, but clean and natural, not perfumey. I guess I&#x27;m used to shampoos like certain Bedhead ones which have a great smell so I am biased. I love that it is so natural with no sulfates, too. I just wish this came in bigger sizes!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it possible, but this shampoo (used with the matching conditioner) left my baby fine hair even more flyaway and shapeless than before.  I gave the product two stars only because it also left my hair extremely shiny.  Perhaps this works better on younger hair (I&#x27;m 68) but I will be throwing it away and going back to L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I used to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s top-of-the-line product, Kerastase (Bain de Force shampoo, and Lait Vital conditioner). Also an amazing product, but at $38 for an 8 oz bottle, it got pretty expensive. I&#x27;ve tried a few different products, but have always gone back to Kerastase. It&#x27;s the best. Or so I thought.     I freely admit, it was the advertizing for L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong that drew me in. I tried the Everstrong Bodify shampoo in combination with the Everstrong Reconstruct conditioner. AMAZING. My hair smelled wonderful (similar to Aveda), but more importantly, it continues to be soft, shiny, and healthy looking after several months of use. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s BETTER than Kerastase, but I will say that it&#x27;s every bit as good. And for the price, you can&#x27;t get any better.    GREAT product, GREAT price.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed at the lather of this shampoo - I think it did a good job removing built-up residue from the Pantene shampoo and conditioner I was previously using. I can&#x27;t really attest to whether or not it adds body, because I use it with the EverStrong Hydrate conditioner rather than the accompanying EverStrong Bodify conditioner (my hair is on the dry side during winter months). I think if I used the Bodify products together, it would probably increase the volume of my hair. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo with a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ll probably use it again, but it&#x27;s definitely not a \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I learned that shampoo with sulfates are about the worst thing you can use on frizzy hair.  So I tried a no-sulfate moisturizering shampoo for a while but it weighed my hair down. Next I tried L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Bodify shampoo and it gave my hair lots of body &amp; bounce. I love it! Unfortunately, I cannot find this product anywhere locally but Amazon carries it for a great price. Ordering my second bottle now!</li>
    <li> If there was an option to give zero stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;They may not contain sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lareth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate and myreth sulfate. They do however contain disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, which the Cosmetics Database actually rates as a moderate hazard ingredient because of its potential to carry ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane, known toxins and carcinogens. Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is even worse, since it actually increases absorption levels, and can be contaminated with nitrosamines.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase products made by L&#x27;Oreal, and do not recommend others buying this product. I suggest, read the ingredients to everything you buy, educate yourself with what they all mean, and make your decision from there.</li>
    <li> Was hoping that it would be more moisturizing for my hair but I have a hard time finding shampoos that I really like to use all the time.  Maybe I should try it next time with the conditioner...</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo.  I am not a fan of L&#x27;Oreal, but this line is pretty good and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and longlasting. Does&#x27;nt take alot and works very well for what you aepect it to do. Highly recommend and will continue to use again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is better than the conditioner.  L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong products are great for long hair that may be slightly damaged due to flat irons and blow dryers.</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my hair body and smells really nice. Finally a SLS-free shampoo that foams properly and cleans effectively!</li>
    <li> This does what it claims! I also like the scent of the shampoo. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> These L&#x27;oreal Sulfate free shampoos and conditioners are among my top shampoos and conditioners of all time, which includes salon brands. They smell great and love how healthy and shiny my hair looks. I only have to get my hair trimmed once a year now and I no longer even use conditioner because my hair in such good shape. (My hair type is straight, fine and is longer than shoulder length). There are all different types of types of shampoos and conditioners in this sulfate free line such as; Moisturizing, Damage Repair, Extra Volume and Extra Body I have tried these 4 kinds and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter since it is sulfate free to help with her dandruff and it may be good for that, however I will likely never find out because the smell from this shampoo is making me have an allergic reaction even being in the same room as my daughter now after she has used this (once).  My eyes burn, my lungs get tight and I start to get a sore throat.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in this but I can&#x27;t be around it.  Awful.</li>
    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are in my top 3. It makes my hair very soft but not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> Have fine straight hair.  Have been using this for a couple of months along with the Bodify conditioner.  Cleans well but isn&#x27;t drying. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Great scent. Definitely adds some body.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for how cheap it is. It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s so lightweight. It leaves my hair feeling silky and not weighed down like other shampoos in the same price range.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine and thin hair. This shampoo gave me more body, tamed the fly-away&#x27;s and left my hair very soft! The scent does seem slightly medicinal...but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I will definitely be buying more of this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for awhile, and love the body it gives my fine and limp hair. Suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it, despite searching everywhere for it. I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.</li>
    <li> will be ordering more, truly does what it says.  Have fine hair, enhance color to help give me more body, t L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Bodify Shampoo helps.</li>
    <li> The shampoo should be used with the companion conditioner for ultimate results. I have used this product for over 2 years. My hair is very fine and would break easily. The shampoo and conditioner just about eliminated the breakage and shedding all over my clothes. Has a nice fresh scent, not sweet like most. Just recently had to refil product and could not find the shampoo and conditioner in stores. So I was so glad to find it at Amazon. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used a few of these L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners for about eight years now, and my once broken and thinning hair is thick and full even at age 63. I&#x27;d say it works and is also sulfate-free (no SLS or SLES), which is a crutial feature to me.</li>
    <li> I started buying this for my daughter about a year ago and she uses it, along with the conditioner, every day and loves it.  She has flat hair and this helps but she has to flip her head forward and thoroughly blow dry to get more fullness.  I would give this a try.  Good luck!</li>
