      <li>loved  this  product,,buit  </li>
      <li>I purchased this based on the good reviews,....</li>
      <li>The Best Results Are Obtained On CLEAN HAIR.</li>
      <li>All my favorite products seem to have succumbed to the Great Recession.</li>
      <li>This product is especially good right after any chemical treatment, like coloring, perming, or straightening since it seals the hair cuticle and helps prevent breakage and frizzing from damaged ends.</li>
      <li>Safe your money don&#x27;t pay this price !</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell what long-term effect of using this product would be, but as a quick fix to ensure a \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; day it is great.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>THANKS to this ONE OF A KIND PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>Can we continue to get more??</li>
      <li>It gave my hair volume and healthy shine, without making it too crunchy.</li>
      <li>I rarely review products but this stuff is so good.</li>
      <li>That leads me to believe that most of what I was seeing was breakage and not fall-out.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, and I need MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
      <li>To those who haven&#x27;t seen good results, I suggest that you give this time to work, and follow the directions and use a clear (non-conditioning) shampoo and allow to air-dry before treatments, and something milder and preferably sulfate-free (or just conditioner, which emulsifies excess oils) between treatments.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to find this on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a good solid product.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best treatment for highlighted, relaxed, dry and/or damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>This is easy to use and really does work.  </li>
      <li>can no longer find this product locally and I am thrilled I can still buy it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>well I tried this product right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering some right now.</li>
      <li>My favorite moisturizer, which has kept my skin nearly line-free even though I&#x27;m turning 40 this month and have fair, freckled skin is no more.</li>
      <li>conditioners, oil treatments, protein treatments, leave in conditioners were doing nothing compared to this first application.</li>
      <li>and I thought for sure it would take over a month to get it back in soso condition.</li>
      <li>It gives you enough for 6 applications so is ok for the value I guess.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers have mentioned to use a clarifying shampoo for better results, and this is true.</li>
      <li>With the first use I didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but</li>
      <li>With each application, gives your hair more and more body, giving hair damaged by excessive processing new life.</li>
      <li>One beauty supply store owner said they were revising the packaging, which looks to have been designed in the 70s or 80s, so it really is about time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really does bind micro-proteins to the hair shaft and close the cutilcle.  </li>
      <li>, it shipped promptly, and I really thought it improved my hair&#x27;s condition.</li>
      <li>It seems all the stuff that really works falls by the wayside</li>
      <li>This product absolutely works as described.</li>
      <li>Since the shipping costs about as much as the product, I order 3 boxes at a time, which lasts for months.</li>
      <li>I am very distressed now that L&#x27;Oreal does not produce this product.</li>
      <li>The effect really is durable.</li>
      <li>Buy Advanced Haircare Color Vibrancy Root to Tip Fixer by L&#x27;Oreal and only cost $ 6.99.</li>
      <li>I really hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
      <li>It really should be more widely advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a new head of hair!</li>
      <li>After being told by a friend about HAIR FIXER and going to two local vendors who no longer carry the product I found it on Amazon and ordered it 3 washes later and my hair is not shedding and I still have 3 more treatmenst in the box.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, short of shaving my head, but I looked around online (especially Amazon) and found this product.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
      <li>The Conditioning Action Will Last Through Many Shampoos With Each Application Building On The Last.</li>
      <li>The original instructions also told you to not excessively towel dry</li>
      <li>This is the new version of the Hair Fixer (shown here).</li>
      <li>Tried this product for the first time last week.</li>
      <li>Upon first application I could actually see curls forming!</li>
      <li>Anyway, the last year I&#x27;ve done a lot of lighter colors--peroxide and ammonia really rip up your hair.</li>
      <li>I got the Hair Fixed and applied it after my morning shampoo.  </li>
      <li>There is a point when you&#x27;ve abused hair so much that the only thing you can do is cut it</li>
      <li>the only stuff that really repairs your hair, that I have discovered</li>
      <li>Natural bounce.</li>
      <li>My hair is always frizzy because of my natural wave</li>
      <li>I might go as far as saying there is nothing that matches it anywhere that I have found.</li>
      <li>I really noticed the effects the next time I shampooed.</li>
      <li>This was the first product that I could put in my hair, let my  hair air dry and the natural wave and curl in my hair</li>
      <li>When you apply this, the hair feels a little coarse, but the next time you shampoo hair feels soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some very light breakage, weird frizziness only in certain places, and over all my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>by the second and third I could tell the \\&quot;weak\\&quot; hair framing my face was getting much stronger.  </li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s own Natural Match is no more, and the only other permanent ammonia-free hair color makes my hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>It has allowed me to grow out my hair for the first time in years, instead of chopping it all off due to breakage and hair coloring damage.  </li>
      <li>Using A Clairifying Shampoo OR A SIMPLE CLEAR Shampoo Will Allow It To Give The Fastest Result.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and the ends are very dry, but I have an oily scalp and absolutely have to shampoo every day.  </li>

<li> I could barely feel the dry split ends after only one application!  </li>
<li> and I wanted my hair long enough to sweep up onto my head and off my neck--</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been searching for it for a long time and finally found it on amazon.  </li>
<li> Now I color to cover grey.</li>
<li> This packaging could use some updating but if it&#x27;s been around for as long as it looks, I know why!</li>
<li> I have dry, bleached, damaged hair.  </li>
<li> This product gives reliably bouncy curls when you set your hair to air dry on rollers or on bobby pins.</li>
<li> It made my hair dry or drier than it was</li>
<li> Just used it for the first time after not using it for the past 6 months and wowwwwww!!  </li>
<li> My mother uses it after a perm, letting the hair air dry, and then applies Hair Fixer it as a setting lotion to help the perm be less damaging with longer lasting curls, and repair the hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had every color hair, bleached it from dyed black to blonde, stripped below shoulder length hair with frosting bleach and</li>
<li> Nothing else compares and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from expensive in salon treatments, to weekly deep conditioners with a heating cap, to hot oil treatments, etc.  </li>
<li> After trying lots of different products for my very dry thin hair I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this one realy works as advertised.</li>
<li> I do have an empty box of the Hair Fixer</li>
<li> It&#x27;s gotten harder to find unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was not impressed with the first use but wanted to give it some time.</li>
<li> It is not the bondo effect one man describes; that is not logical.  </li>
<li> Loreal Keraphix Ciment makes the hair slippery and slick, and flat while smoothing the hair cuticle.</li>
<li> A little pill is mixed with a small amount of solution and one application covers hair to the shoulders that is already damp.  </li>
<li> Being a guy, excessive amounts of hair in the drain is always alarming, but after using this product, I see a lot less (about 2/3 less).</li>
<li> I&#x27;m on the 3rd application and my hair is getting worse.</li>
<li> This truly is a Hair Fixer, fusing broken and weakened hair back together.</li>
<li> I might have to do a few treatments but still.</li>
<li> My hair is very thick and wavy, and has become extremely dry for some reason, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not magic, but it does gradually improve the condition of your hair over time.</li>
<li> what a waste!  </li>
<li> , A Small Reaction Occurs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product since the late 1970&#x27;s and I have found this product to be second to NONE!! I am very distressed now that L&#x27;Oreal does not produce this product. I cannot find it anywhere. Amazon seems to be the only one with the Hair Fixer. Can we continue to get more?? I MUST HAVE this product, it has strengthened my hair and I can almost sit on it now!!! THANKS to this ONE OF A KIND PRODUCT!!! I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, and I need MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU--From your Biggest Fan.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  My hair is very thick and wavy, and has become extremely dry for some reason, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I&#x27;m on the 3rd application and my hair is getting worse. I followed the directions religiously, but it seems to be frying my hair. Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> After being told by a friend about HAIR FIXER and going to two local vendors who no longer carry the product I found it on Amazon and ordered it 3 washes later and my hair is not shedding and I still have 3 more treatmenst in the box.  It works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, so I knew how it would work, but I&#x27;ve never left a review so here it is. I think this is a good solid product. It&#x27;s not magic, but it does gradually improve the condition of your hair over time. For the people who say it doesn&#x27;t work at all--yes it does. Possibly your hair was just too damaged for this to help you. There is a point when you&#x27;ve abused hair so much that the only thing you can do is cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had color treated and permed hair off and on since I was a kid. Anyway, the last year I&#x27;ve done a lot of lighter colors--peroxide and ammonia really rip up your hair. I&#x27;ve had some very light breakage, weird frizziness only in certain places, and over all my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, short of shaving my head, but I looked around online (especially Amazon) and found this product. I bought it, it shipped promptly, and I really thought it improved my hair&#x27;s condition. It probably took 3-4 applications to see the results promised. 1 application helps, but 3-4 is what it takes to truly glue hair back together at the strand level. I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued. The last seller I bought it from canceled my order with vague information that they had no idea when they&#x27;d get more from the manufacturer. So if you read this, my advice is to stock up.</li>
    <li> I started using Ineral 30 years ago and there is nothing on the market today that matches it for the price. I might go as far as saying there is nothing that matches it anywhere that I have found. This truly is a Hair Fixer, fusing broken and weakened hair back together. This product is especially good right after any chemical treatment, like coloring, perming, or straightening since it seals the hair cuticle and helps prevent breakage and frizzing from damaged ends. Other reviewers have mentioned to use a clarifying shampoo for better results, and this is true. Conditioning shampoos can block the penetration of the bonding agent. Also, the directions no longer mention not to use conditioner after shampooing, but you shouldn&#x27;t. The original instructions also told you to not excessively towel dry the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer find this product locally and I am thrilled I can still buy it through Amazon. I just wish the shipping and handling wasn&#x27;t such a gouge, or the seller offered quantity discounts. Still, I buy 6 at a time and they last me a over year as a weekly treatment. If you have breakage or weak, no body hair, try this. It works.</li>
    <li> The HAIR FIXER Is A Great Product For Damaged Hair. As Someone In Another Review Remarked It Has Been Around Since The Late 1960&#x27;s-Early 1970&#x27;s In Various Forms/Packages. Because The Product Is A Tablet That Is Mixed With A Liquid, A Small Reaction Occurs That Creates An Effect Similar To Epoxy Or Bondo For Your Hair. The Molecules Have Similar Chemical/Physical Properties As Keratin, The Protien Hair Is Made Of. The Conditioning Action Will Last Through Many Shampoos With Each Application Building On The Last. Making It Virtually Permanent.   HOWEVER- The Best Results Are Obtained On CLEAN HAIR. Using A Clairifying Shampoo OR A SIMPLE CLEAR Shampoo Will Allow It To Give The Fastest Result. (Pantene Clairifying/VO5 Split Ends/Suave)</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and really does work.  It has allowed me to grow out my hair for the first time in years, instead of chopping it all off due to breakage and hair coloring damage.  With the first use I didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but by the second and third I could tell the \\&quot;weak\\&quot; hair framing my face was getting much stronger.  Since the shipping costs about as much as the product, I order 3 boxes at a time, which lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that anything other than a haircut was going to help my split ends.  My hair is long and the ends are very dry, but I have an oily scalp and absolutely have to shampoo every day.  That doesn&#x27;t help the split ends any.  I was going on vacation and I wanted my hair long enough to sweep up onto my head and off my neck--so no haircut at that time.  I got the Hair Fixed and applied it after my morning shampoo.  I was astounded!  I could barely feel the dry split ends after only one application!  I am using this product regularly and will continue to do so.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Back in the 1970s when women wanted to color and perm their hair within the same week, this product was invented to minimize damage. A little pill is mixed with a small amount of solution and one application covers hair to the shoulders that is already damp.  My mother uses it after a perm, letting the hair air dry, and then applies Hair Fixer it as a setting lotion to help the perm be less damaging with longer lasting curls, and repair the hair. It really does bind micro-proteins to the hair shaft and close the cutilcle.  A week later, she colors her hair blonde, and it looks terrific. This product gives reliably bouncy curls when you set your hair to air dry on rollers or on bobby pins. Natural bounce. It is not the bondo effect one man describes; that is not logical.  Closest thing to this is the HaskPlacenta product, extra strength.  Loreal Keraphix Ciment makes the hair slippery and slick, and flat while smoothing the hair cuticle.</li>
    <li> I discovered this in college when I was into dyeing my hair different colors. Now I color to cover grey. Being a guy, excessive amounts of hair in the drain is always alarming, but after using this product, I see a lot less (about 2/3 less). That leads me to believe that most of what I was seeing was breakage and not fall-out. My hair, which I&#x27;m growing out while I still can (no skullet for me) also feels thicker and smoother. The effect really is durable. That said, it is getting really difficult to find this stuff locally (in NYC). One beauty supply store owner said they were revising the packaging, which looks to have been designed in the 70s or 80s, so it really is about time. I really hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued. All my favorite products seem to have succumbed to the Great Recession. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s own Natural Match is no more, and the only other permanent ammonia-free hair color makes my hair crunchy. My favorite moisturizer, which has kept my skin nearly line-free even though I&#x27;m turning 40 this month and have fair, freckled skin is no more. It seems all the stuff that really works falls by the wayside while gimmicky (and expensive) products remain on the market. To those who haven&#x27;t seen good results, I suggest that you give this time to work, and follow the directions and use a clear (non-conditioning) shampoo and allow to air-dry before treatments, and something milder and preferably sulfate-free (or just conditioner, which emulsifies excess oils) between treatments. I&#x27;m ordering some right now.</li>
    <li> I over-bleached my hair a couple days ago and I thought for sure it would take over a month to get it back in soso condition. well I tried this product right like it says on the box and I feel like my hair is in almost the same condition it was in before i bleached it. conditioners, oil treatments, protein treatments, leave in conditioners were doing nothing compared to this first application. I&#x27;ll be looking forward to my hair after the box is gone!</li>
    <li> It works great! sadly it is out of the market for unknown reason, I need it back as cheaper as it was!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find this on Amazon.com.  I used this years ago, and found that it repaired my hair from a really bad perm. It gives hair outrageous body. It&#x27;s like a new head of hair! Great stuff -- just fabolous!</li>
    <li> When you apply this, the hair feels a little coarse, but the next time you shampoo hair feels soft and healthy.  It has improve my color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> the only stuff that really repairs your hair, that I have discovered</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the first time last week. Every shampooing made my hair feel like straw (literally). I followed the directions on this product. I was not impressed with the first use but wanted to give it some time. It definitely gave my hair body. That helped keep a curl. I really noticed the effects the next time I shampooed. I could actually run a comb through it before conditioning. This packaging could use some updating but if it&#x27;s been around for as long as it looks, I know why! It works!</li>
    <li> This product absolutely works as described. It really should be more widely advertised. With each application, gives your hair more and more body, giving hair damaged by excessive processing new life. Before you decide to cut it off, give this wonderful product a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the good reviews,....what a waste!  I don&#x27;t know how this could improve anyones hair.  This is junk.  It made my hair dry or drier than it was and it took a week for it to recover.</li>
    <li> After trying lots of different products for my very dry thin hair I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this one realy works as advertised. Upon first application I could actually see curls forming! It gave my hair volume and healthy shine, without making it too crunchy. Can&#x27;t tell what long-term effect of using this product would be, but as a quick fix to ensure a \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; day it is great.</li>
    <li> loved  this  product,,buit  it&#x27;s  been  discontinuted..wish they  would  bring  it back.  i&#x27;d  buy  it  by  the  case.  i  used  it  for  yrs  and  would  continue to use  it tommorow .</li>
    <li> it works a bit to make it stronger but it wares out on about a week. It gives you enough for 6 applications so is ok for the value I guess.</li>
    <li> DO NOT pay for this product $ 99.00 dollars. Buy Advanced Haircare Color Vibrancy Root to Tip Fixer by L&#x27;Oreal and only cost $ 6.99. This is the new version of the Hair Fixer (shown here). I was looking for the Hair Fixer  everywhere and I went to L&#x27;Oreal webpage and they give me the Root to Tip Fixer as a alternative. I do have an empty box of the Hair Fixer and I compared the ingredients in both products and they are the same. I am very happy now !!! Safe your money don&#x27;t pay this price !</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been searching for it for a long time and finally found it on amazon.  Just used it for the first time after not using it for the past 6 months and wowwwwww!!  I&#x27;m blown away by how well this product works.  Nothing else compares and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from expensive in salon treatments, to weekly deep conditioners with a heating cap, to hot oil treatments, etc.  This is by far the best treatment for highlighted, relaxed, dry and/or damaged hair.  I can finally highlight my hair again since I now have my Loreal Hair Fixer!!!!!</li>
    <li> I rarely review products but this stuff is so good. I&#x27;ve had every color hair, bleached it from dyed black to blonde, stripped below shoulder length hair with frosting bleach and this stuff has always come through. I might have to do a few treatments but still. It&#x27;s gotten harder to find unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is L&#x27;oreal tests on animals still and thus I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have dry, bleached, damaged hair.  My hair is always frizzy because of my natural wave so I end up straightening it.  This was the first product that I could put in my hair, let my  hair air dry and the natural wave and curl in my hair looked great - not just friz.  I love it!</li>
