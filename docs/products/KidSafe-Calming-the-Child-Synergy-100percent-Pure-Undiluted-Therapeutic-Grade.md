<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Has a nice smell but, did&#x27;nt really work at calming my granddaughters.</li>
    <li> I love this product! We are using it with our 3.5year old son who we just adopted from China and has had difficulty adjusting to sleep. After a few nights using Calming the Child he is sleeping more soundly and calming much easier before bed. We also use the oil if he wakes in the night upset. It calms him immediately and he is able to fall asleep peacefully.</li>
    <li> A very nice scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Not that impressed, plus it was pricey for mixed oils. I&#x27;d try this brand again if I could get a better deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my adhd child. I mixed it with grapeseed oil for him to use, and it did make a difference for him somewhat. I also tried it for me, if I use it before bedtime, I can sleep all night without a sleeping aid. I have been having sleep trouble, and this helps a lot</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with all the oils I have purchased from Plant Therapy. This oil has helped keep my son calm.</li>
    <li> Great for adults. I use it at night and sleep so well! Make sure you get a full 8 hours of sleep or you will have a hard time &amp;#34;wanting&amp;#34; to wake up.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my kids.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my son&#x27;s bedtime routine. I was hoping it would help him calm down. It didn&#x27;t make a difference at all. Matter of fact, it makes him mad because he knows why we&#x27;re using it. I do like the smell though!</li>
    <li> I have 3 rowdy, hyper boys age 8 and 4 yr old twins. This didn&#x27;t help to calm them; however, it does have a pleasant scent. I burned it all day long and by the end of the day my throat was a little scratchy/sore. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Better than smelly sock filled bedroom right?</li>
    <li> This is heaven in a bottle. By far my favorite EO I have tried/smell. I am diffusing for the holidays and I have to say I am not as tense and my little one isn&#x27;t having tantrums. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about this blend.</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift to a friend for her baby and she uses it in her oil diffuser. She loves the product &amp; I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness...this stuff is a miracle in a bottle!! Works on my 9 month old and my 2 1/2 year old. I even use it on myself!! The smell is so nice and my oldest even says, &amp;#34;Smells good mommy.&amp;#34; I mix 5 drops of this with 1 tsp of coconut oil (my favorite for the smell and makes skin so soft) in a small glass container. I only use a little bit on the back of their necks and sometimes even on their feet (cover with socks after applying.) The results are awesome!! Next I will be trying it with my new diffuser!!</li>
    <li> The only brand of EO&#x27;s I buy now.  Works well on my ADHD daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself. Love the scent! I haven&#x27;t used it enough to rate it&#x27;s effectiveness, but I like the scent so much, I believe it will benefit me.</li>
    <li> My child is wild! Very little change with this product. Hope it works well for others</li>
    <li> This is a very nice blend.  I didn&#x27;t expect the citrus to come through so much but it is in my opinion the dominant scent.  It&#x27;s nice though, and as the blend wears the lavender comes through a bit more.  I&#x27;m using it mostly for homemade deodorant now, and it is hazardous with light colored clothes (I don&#x27;t use beeswax like some do, so I wind up with an oily deo than others but I thought I&#x27;d throw out a warning anyway) but I smell very nice.  I haven&#x27;t found it to be good for headaches or any of the physical ails associated with stress, but it is a nice smell from a company I can support.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell as much as I thought as I am a straight lavender lover. Will definitely give it a chance. It is a colored EO so it may stain if it is used on light fabrics.</li>
    <li> Does not work money wasted.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! This is not pure essential oil , also doesn&#x27;t have any calming effect.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product a zero star if I could! This supposedly \\&quot;pure essential oil\\&quot; not only didn&#x27;t make my kids calm but also make the three of us short of breath due to really bad allergy. I wrote a review for the seller and they deleted my review saying that it was not a seller review and it was a product review!!! Well, if you are claiming you have a product that suppose to calm the kids down but that&#x27;s a lie ,shouldn&#x27;t that be in seller&#x27;s review?&lt;br /&gt;Also I have used many essential oils before and if they are pure, they would not cause allergies. So to me , this is a fake product even though smells good.one of the questions when you are rating a seller is \\&quot;product as described by seller ?\\&quot;  But I guess to amazon that doesn&#x27;t mean anything!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy essential oils , buy \\&quot;NOW \\&quot; brand.</li>
    <li> This product is great. At bed time I draw a warm bath for my 6 month old and put a few drops in the water, and then put a drop in his lotion and give him a massage...give him his bottle and he sleeps all night, unlike before.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old granddaughter is convinced she needs this to help her sleep. It is calming, even for the grandmother!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  know if it is all in my head, but I swear it helps soothe colds when the first start. I put a few drops in the bath and it is amazing. I am going to buy a bunch more of this.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my (wound up) four year old granddaughter.  We both agreed it smelled wonderful.  I&#x27;m not sure it did a lot to calm her down, but it was nice.</li>
    <li> my autistic/ADHD teen girl loves just opening this and inhaling.  Smell is a big thing for her and there are some products she just cannot bear to smell, but loves this.  We dab some on her wrists for getting through the day and mix it with frankincense and clary sage for happy child and happy family :) At first bought it because chamomile is so expensive but highly recommended for the calming effect.  So glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already shared this with a friend for her 11 month old. Applying it diluted to the bottoms of his feet and big toes has certainly helped to calm his aggressiveness when he becomes fussy.  Thank you for another great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids to put on their grandkids but forget it, they can buy their own. i love this stuff. My husband takes a psychotropic to control anxiety and depression (hard childhood, poor thing).  It works mostly fine. But when he forgets to take it, the first symptom is he gets silly and loopy and inappropriatly loud. All he has to do to fix it is take his prescribed meds, but it takes maybe 5 hours for him to get normal. I used calm the child on him (he loves the oils I use cause he gets his feet rubbed!) and it worked like a charm!  I also used it on my little dog. She LOVES to hunt. Shes great for keeping the mouse population down, but the other day, i had her at a small place I was staying while I was working out of town. She must have heard, or imagined she heard a critter under the cabin and started digging the wood floors and chewiing the cabinet (which I didnt let her do once I saw it). This went on and on. It was time to go to bed and she was just shaking she wanted that mousie so bad.  I diluted 1drop of calm the child in carrier oil and put it on her paw. Within seconds she was fine!  10 minutes later tho she started panting. Its possible even the small amount I gave her was too much. It resolved and shes okay. The next time, i gave her just a tiny tiny amount and it still worked, but no panting. Shes 10#.</li>
    <li> I use this oil with my diffuser on a regular basis and love it. The smell is wonderful without being over powering. I use it for me as well as the kids. Many time I will use it while taking a bath right before bedtime! Will order more once I am out!</li>
    <li> I like this.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say for sure but it seems to calm my baby.&lt;br /&gt;Also my husband hates anything lavender (really?!?!) and this is a blend that is not overwhelming in that aspect.</li>
    <li> I put this on my son who has ADHD/Autism when he gets to worked up and it does seem to help some to calm him down.</li>
    <li> I read mixed reviews on this product and frankly, I was hesitant to buy it.  I figured buying the smaller version would be best so that we could try it out.  One of our twins has Sensory Processing Disorder and finds crowds and loud noises troublesome.  We could barely go to church for fear of her &amp;#34;losing it&amp;#34; and having a tantrum.  It took us a while to figure out she wasn&#x27;t just being a brat, but rather the loud music physically hurt her ears!  We bought this and have put it on her wrist a couple of times.  Whether it works or not, she loves the scent and feels better and more confident, yet calm, whenever she wears it.  Sometimes she even asks for it, which stops trouble before it starts.</li>
    <li> Use this in my classroom.. Works great</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the fact that my daughter is entering into her teen years soon and so she&#x27;s extra weepy over the smallest of things.  I had not used this oil until last week, nor did I tell the kids that I had it.  I wanted to test it on them without having any psychological effect.  Meaning, if they knew what it was, they might subconsciously calm down, knowing that&#x27;s what it was for.  So anyway, my daughter was crying hysterically last week.  I walked up to her, applied it to the palms of her hands and told her to inhale.  She instantly relaxed and smiled.  Her father looked at me and said, \\&quot;What did you just do?  How did you get her to stop?\\&quot;  I showed her the bottle and she read it outloud.  Her father said, \\&quot;Worth every penny!\\&quot;  Within a few minutes, she asked if she could wash the dishes!  Seriously.  She began washing the dishes.  Without this oil, she would have remained in her melting down point for at least 30 minutes.  Rather than, she was smiling, and washing dishes.  Incredible!</li>
    <li> I have a grand daughter that has been diagnosed with ADHD. She does not currently take medication. It is summer so I only used it once.  She was having a bad day and everything was going wrong. I put some on her wrists as we were not at home and after a few minutes she started to calm down.</li>
    <li> Nice scent.  I use this with a carrier oil and rub it on my kids before bed to help them calm down.  I also diffuse periodically throughout the day to sooth  my ADHD son&#x27;s outbursts</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I am very picky about smells but this one truly was calming.</li>
    <li> I add a few drops to the water in my toddler&#x27;s humidifier when she doesn&#x27;t fall asleep easily. Within minutes, she drifts into a calming, restful sleep. I buy time and time again.</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my daughter with SPD to help calm her.  We think that it helps take the edge off of her hyper behavior.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this...use it during my facial massages. Clients relax and love the smell. I havent tried it in my diffuser yet but i bet it would be great</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have been using it in my laundry (on wool dryer balls) and on a hanky in my children&#x27;s bed.  The smell is lavender but not so strong,  orange, with a hint of something else. A magical blend.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. My children love it - ages 5 &amp; 7. Hard to gauge whether the calming effect will continue after the initial wonder wears off, but there is certainly a benefit to this lovely aroma at bedtime. Very soothing, especially for a high strung 7 year old whose gears are hard to slow down for sleep. Highly recommend the GreenAir instant mist humidifier to diffuse the oil - it&#x27;s designed for this purpose and the changing lights are soothing, too.</li>
    <li> Love it. Put it on my kids feet at bedtime to help them sleep and I use it as well.</li>
    <li> I have many oils, and love some of the &amp;#34;feelings&amp;#34; blends. This one is one of my favorites now....I smiled soon as I opened the lid and smelled it deeply.</li>
    <li> I dont have a child, but I do use this oil in a diffuser for myself, when I need to have a nice calm rest, or relaxing time.  I am new to essential oil therapy, so..  for what it is worth, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Really works well, the grandkids get some on the bottoms of their feet mixed with olive oil, about 1/2 before their bed time... they go right to sleep and it is great</li>
    <li> My kids are now asking for this on their feet and spine before going to bed. They say it helps them sleep better. I mixed mine with coconut oil and keep it in a tupperware container in their room. Quick and easy</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and, when added to lotion, helps my daughter who has nightmares sleep peacefully.</li>
    <li> Been using this for my grandson for a few years now. It does work!</li>
    <li> I add a few drops of Calming the Child to about a tablespoon of olive oil for infant massage. It brings instant relaxation. She loves it! I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> calming the child is a great product.  I work in a daycare and put 3 drops in my diffuser during naptime and on most days the children go right to sleep. And if the children are extra energized I occasionally use it during playtime. I recommend this product because it works just as good as the ovoverpriced name brand essential oils</li>
    <li> My 11 year old son likes to roll it on his feet before bed, seems to help him sleep.</li>
    <li> The scent is great. The citrus notes are really noticeable when diffused. We love this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil!!!!  It smells so good, very fresh!!!  Me, my husband, and my son love to diffuse it at night to help us sleep!!!</li>
    <li> Smells floral and citrusy. I actually bought this for myself for insomnia due to RLS and back pain during pregnancy. I add it to my bath water with a carrier oil and it really helps me relax and sleep better. Also smells great in a diffuser.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this product to help my baby calm down when she was fussy.  I ended up loving the smell so much that I use it occasionally just to have a nice relaxing aroma in my bedroom.</li>
    <li> This blend smells lovely; very sweet and mild,  It does calm children down as it claims.  My little ones love it and I do too!!!</li>
    <li> Very calming scent. I blend with some coconut oil and massage onto the back of my children&#x27;s necks when they are feeling tired, upset or having a difficult time controlling their emotions (tantrums!) seems to help and smells great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to dilute into sweet almond oil for massage for my children.  We have a baby on the way as our older daughter loves it as well.  I put a drop on a cotton ball and put it in her pajama drawer so her bedtime routine every night has this soothing blend to help her sleep.  I&#x27;m considering getting her a diffuser necklace as well, maybe when she is older.  The blend is subtle and appropriate even for kids that have sensory processing issues with fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my homemade lotions &amp; etc. This was my first purchase for Essential Oils &amp; my first time using them. When I opened the bottle &amp; smelled it for the first time It was pretty strong but after making my first Lotion batch &amp; using 3 drops it was the perfect amount of scent for me :) This has been a great addition to my homemade concoctions and I&#x27;m planning on using it in many different ways in the future! :)  I would definately recommend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I use this oil daily on my son with SPD...totally helps mellow him out. I&#x27;m on my second bottle, love!</li>
    <li> This oils has been awesome for us!  It&#x27;s really helped calm my kids without making them groggy-kind of just taken the edge off of some over the top hyper/upset moments!  I dilute with Frac. Coconut Oil in a roller bottle and use on their wrists and/or bottoms of the feet a few times a day and it&#x27;s really allowed my kiddos to just be themselves and not over stimulated!  I can definatly tell a difference on the days I forget to use this!  SO BLESSED To have found this synergy and HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I massage it into my kids feet at night. They love the foot massage and it smells really good. It does seem to help them calm down and fall asleep. I used this past wkend as we stayed at an unfamiliar place and it worked well.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. I notice only mandarin. It does not calm my 4 y/o down at all though. I would call it more of a invigorating scent for morning use. I wish it was a more relaxing smell.</li>
    <li> This smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t absolutely &#x27;nothing&#x27; to calm my hyperactive 3-year old. I usually add it (generously) in his bath water and it doesn&#x27;t seem to relax him any.</li>
    <li> Will buy from again!&lt;br /&gt;Both my niece who is a baby and my husband who is not a baby (most of the time) are calmed by this.</li>
    <li> I love how it smells, it is very relaxing. I made monster spray out of it for my little boy and it helps calm him down at night :)</li>
    <li> Smells so great! I put it into a cool vaporizer that I ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is great for the morning when the kids are bouncing off the walls in my house. It seems to calm them and relax us all. Great smell and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> My favorite oil blend by my favorite oil company. I use this every night on the bottom of my kids feet.</li>
    <li> We make sure to always have some of this on hand.  We use it on a 4 year old.  There are times when they get over-tired and a little cranky and need something to calm them down.  It&#x27;s also great before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used essential oils on a child, then you will want to dilute it with a carrier oil.  My granddaughter is used to them since birth, so she can use them &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company just came out with a bunch of blends for kids, so keep your eyes out for some of their new stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, prices are good and I always enjoy doing business with this company.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I used it as a massage oil for my 18 month old who was restless and my 3 year old who wouldn&#x27;t calm down a few nights ago. They both dropped off to sleep. When my back was hurting, and I didn&#x27;t feel like another lavender scented massage, I asked my husband to add this blend to the carrier oil. The scent &amp;#34;calmed the parent&amp;#34; too. ;-)</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy!! Calming the Child is simply amazing. The smell, the way it makes you feel...everything!!</li>
    <li> I thought that this smelled bad, and my kid hates it.  It is way too heavy on the citrus.  I should have stuck with an MLM company on this one.</li>
    <li> Not a good brand. The oils are not pure. I bought 3 scents and they all gave me a nasty headache.</li>
    <li> wow, this stuff smells really calming. it smells better once it&#x27;s out of the bottle, diluted and applied though. i applied it to both myself and my son and noticed a difference. my son is pretty calm and well behaved, but everyone has their &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days, and today is one of them. i will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have a very active 2 year old. I use calming the child synergy in my diffuser during the afternoon when he so active.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for myself and my daughter! It really does help me calm down and relax! I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Gave to my babysitter to use throughout the day....works wonders with no I&#x27;ll eeffects.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Young Living&#x27;s version of this product. So glad I did. The smell is wonderful and it works great to calm my 4 year old son down to sleep.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I can&#x27;t compliment this particular blend enough! My 18 month old son started having night terrors a few months ago, but we didn&#x27;t know what they were. After several weeks of picking him up and having him scream for 2 solid hours (no exaggeration), we researched night terrors and resigned ourselves to sleepless nights once again... until our friend recommended this beautiful product. All we do is put several drops in our oil warmer for about 15 minutes before bedtime, and even if we neglect his bedtime routine, he still sleeps almost all night and sometimes even sleeps in 2 hours later than he used to! An absolute Godsend, and truly an *essential* essential oil!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Baby has been sleeping quicker and longer since we started using it. I mix a drop in his bath and then a drop with his body lotion. He also seems to like it, as inhales it in when I rub it on his chest! :)</li>
    <li> Product shipped well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent and put on my daughters favorite stuffed animal to help her get all cozy and sleep well.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work properly. But seems to work on my 2 year old. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works well for my son!</li>
    <li> First of all- I love all the plant therapy Synergy&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve tried. Germ fighter works great, as does headache relief. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe my expectations of calming the child were too high, but I don&#x27;t notice this having any effect on my kiddos. I&#x27;ve tried using in their bath and also diffusing and rubbing on their feet. Having said that, this blend smells amazing! And while it probably won&#x27;t be the first bottle I replace when it runs out, I am enjoying it  for the smell and I do appreciate this company&#x27;s efforts to provide quality oils at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> kids ask for this every night before bed.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome - not like other fake smelling balms. Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great. I tried spraying my two-year old&#x27;s pillow with it before bedtime. I&#x27;ve tried putting a few drops in his bath wash. I&#x27;ve tried mixing it in with his lotion before bedtime. While it does have a nice, relaxing smell, I can see no difference in his energy level. He is just as rambunctious as ever. Still having a hard time settling him down before bed. It was worth a shot, though. Won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil. And it seems to calm my 3 boys. I use it in a defuser in their room every night.</li>
    <li> It smelled nice but I am not sure if it made any difference at all.  I felt that I could have mixed it myself since I do have tangerine and lavender oils at hand.  Perhaps it worked for other kids but my kids didn&#x27;t care of the smell and I am not seeing any differences.</li>
    <li> My sons have a very difficult time winding down at the end of the night. I have diluted 60 drops of this in 4 oz. of the fractionated coconut oil and rub it on my 4 and 9 year old every night. They are relaxed and asleep within 15 minutes. It used to be at least an hour of yelling just to get them to be quiet!</li>
    <li> I rub a few drops on my son&#x27;s feet and shoulders at bed time. It does appear to calm him down and has a very pleasant citrus smell. For myself I probably would prefer Lavender at bed time but my 10 year old likes that fragrance.</li>
    <li> I made an ointment with this using coconut oil and shea butter. I apply it at night to my kids&#x27; chests, they call it &amp;#34;Good Dream Cream&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not totally sure it really helps but it does seem to. It smells really good at least!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my LO, maybe he&#x27;s just TOO crazy and hyper that nothing will help him calm down lol. It smelled a little funky too. I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m just saying it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> My son has ASD and never seems to sleep.  If you have a child on the spectrum you know these kids just don&#x27;t seem to ever sleep.  We use melatonin supplements and that helps somewhat but I had heard about essential oils and was willing to give it a shot if it helped end the 3 AM wake up calls and battles to go to sleep at night.  I mix this with coconut oil as a base and rub it on my son&#x27;s feet.  The scent is pleasant, although I guess that is subjective.  My son seems to like it.  I think this helps him calm down at night.  We haven&#x27;t used it very long and because it is a change to his bed time routine and he doesn&#x27;t handle change well we don&#x27;t get it on him every night.  Of the nights we have used it he only woke up one night.  For him, that is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product because it had good reviews and because it was cheaper than some other essential oils.  This was my first time using essential oils so I can&#x27;t speak as to the quality of this product as compared to other companies, but we are pleased with this product.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle substance for our son but it does seem to help him calm down at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Plant Therapy and LOVE their KidSafe line, but this one is just okay for us.  We prefer the Nighty Night synergy, which has Blue Tansy in it and a bit more pleasant smell.  Nothing bad to say about this synergy, but it doesn&#x27;t get used at our house as much as other Plant Therapy choices, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as calming to my boys.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate the scent of lavender, but this synergy I can do.  Smells more like orange with a hint of sweetness. Use it on the entire family.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and has helped keep new stretch marks from forming. I am 37 weeks pregnant and apply 5-6 drops twice a day!</li>
    <li> I am beyond pleased with this product. I dilute it with water in a small spray bottle and use it to treat my kids bedding and room (it&#x27;s our monsters go bye bye spray). Love the smell and quality of the oils. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this blend. Very soothing. Good quality. Seller ships right away. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know is it really calm my baby down. But this oil smells very good! I usually use it during bathing, just add a few drops of oil to water.</li>
    <li> This has definitely worked for my daughter. It is a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, because I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for years -- many of those in this blend, but it doesn&#x27;t not smell ANYTHING like what I anticipated a blend of these oils to smell like. It smells terrible -- like get it away from me stench. I don&#x27;t know if it is off, or their particular oils, or what, but it smells off and kind of rotten/earthy. I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because as stinky as it is, it is far from calming.</li>
    <li> I actually originally bought this to help my toddler sleep at night, I put it in a roll on with some coconut oil and I put it on her wrists and neck before bedtime, but I use it myself too.  I use a CPAP machine and I put a couple drops on a folded up paper towel and leave the paper towel near the filter of my machine and the smell of this comes into the machine and covers up any plastic smells from having to use the machine.  It has a lovely sweet orange smell that I just love.  I added some to a body spray that I made as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my restless leg syndrom, and i have to say that it does in fact help a lot. I&#x27;m pregnant and i can&#x27;t take my regular medication so i had to find other ways to deal with it and all you have to do is place about 2-3 drops on the bottom of your feet and wait about 30 seconds and the pain and tingleing goes away. It only last about 30 mins to an hour but it&#x27;s worth it. I would recomend this product for what i use it for. I heard it also works well for calming anxiety but i haven&#x27;t tried it for that purpose yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  When I try to diffuse it the smell does not permeate. I think it may not be 100% only essential oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this blend to make my own lotions, but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to that quite yet.  I did, however, use this blend in a tea-light warmer and it smells heavenly!  Very calming and relaxing. I can&#x27;t wait to make my lotion with this!</li>
    <li> you get what is pictured. there will be no disappointments with this product if you order it. it also came 2 days early!</li>
    <li> Besides being calming, this products just smells fabulous. I diluted it and put it in a spray bottle. My daughter asks for her &amp;#34;sleep spray&amp;#34; every night.</li>
    <li> This essential oil blend smells ok, but i have not noticed any calming effects on my highly anxious and irritable child.</li>
    <li> I love the top and middle notes of this oil when placed in the diffuser. When we get down to the bottom notes, however, I am much less impressed. To compensate for this, I have been using it for shorter periods of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in the bath for myself after stressful nights at work and love it!  It helps with aches and pains and relaxes mind and body.  I then follow up with a few drops of Plant Therapy Relax Synergy in my burner for a good day&#x27;s sleep :)</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and it is very calming. very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil hasn&#x27;t burned sensitive children skin, and the little boy I babysit a couple hours each week falls asleep soon after I put a drop on his wrists. Previously, he had no inclination to sleep at all. I find the smell pleasant, but my husband does not enjoy it. I suppose it depends on how much you like lavender.</li>
    <li> Great oil for children who have problems calming down!</li>
    <li> stuff is fabulous for calming them down</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but does nothing for my child to help him sleep better.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been a life saver for me. My son is teething and this helps calm him down for nap/bed time.  Another bonus is that is smells great! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles! My two year old twins are a little difficult to calm down when it&#x27;s time for nap and bed, so we put it in our diffuser and turn it on as we&#x27;re getting them changed and are reading our bedtime stories. They now go down within 5 minutes of putting them in their cribs. We usually set the diffuser for 30 minutes, and they sleep soundly through the night!</li>
    <li> The aroma was strong but not overbearing however it had no effect on his sleep/temperament. I give it one star for the smell and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and price was very reasonable</li>
    <li> My true intention was to help soothe my very fussy 8 month old. Instead I found out that it works better for my husband and I. Smells very earthy, we love it. My 8 month old is unable to feel the calming effects, but we do. He&#x27;s had a rocky beginning so far, and I just wanted him  to be somewhat happy. We are back and forth, from one hospital to the next, and I know he doesn&#x27;t understand right now.</li>
    <li> I have two rambunctious little boys (8 and 4) and things can get a little crazy around here!  I diffuse this in a little oil warmer night light (two birds, one stone!) and they love it.  It smells really good (the lavender and tangerine come through the stongest) and even if it is just a &#x27;placebo&#x27; affect they believe it works and it has become a special part of our bedtime ritual.  If you want to apply this to your kids it is probably okay to use it &#x27;neat&#x27; but I would only put it on the bottom of their feet.  All citrus oils are very photo-sensitizing (they increase your skin sensitivity to sunlight) and could produce an awful skin burn.  I love the Plant Therapy company, they are committed to providing great single and blended oils at a very affordable cost.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it is so lovely. We mix it into the EO French lavender lotion http://www.amazon.com/EO-Everyday-Lavender-8-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B001ECQ3YU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1368631058&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;eo+lavender and slather it on our son at bedtime. It is such a wonderfully calming scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t calm my son.</li>
    <li> Great for my grandkids!</li>
    <li> I use this is my childrens bath, before bed. Really nice smell. Defiantly can smell the citrus. I love it!</li>
    <li> The scent was wonderful But only lasted a few hours in the diffuser. Then it was nothing... just mist with no scent</li>
    <li> arrived early and easy to use</li>
    <li> Seems like it works.  I diluted some with apricot oil and apply it with a roller to my 3 year old sons neck and sometimes spine at bedtime.  I also use it on my neck and wrists and it helps relax me.  It might work better if applied neat, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  Not sure if this is a high grade essential oil, but it seems to work and I don&#x27;t have the money to be spending $40 for 5 ml of an essential oil with the MLM companies.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful ! My son uses it when he&#x27;s anxious. I&#x27;ve used it too! I bought it for my grandson.</li>
    <li> I have the roller of this blend and bought this one to diffuse in the morning before my son (who has attention issues) leaves for school and daycare. This blend works fantastic for him and smells great. We&#x27;ll be using this one for a long time, I think. We love Plant Therapy and their products; I am so happy they have this KidSafe line that is great for the littles.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  I have a three old son that had a difficult time calming down at bedtime and was getting up out of bed multiple times a night then enter calming the child.  My son now asks  for his &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; before bed.  It has become a night time ritual with one drop on the bottom of each foot and one drop on his back, a bedtime story and lights out. Highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what else this company has to offer.</li>
    <li> It does help my child to calm and relax at bedtime.  So far I am very happy with Plant Therapy oils.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this to help my daughter relax before bed, help sleep better. When rubbed on her neck with a carrier oil (veggie oil) she broke out so that was a thumbs down and then when I rubbed her feet it didn&#x27;t make a difference in relaxation or hours slept. Lavender oil sprayed on the linens and in her shampoo/tub worked better.</li>
    <li> Quality essential oil. Great price. Wonderful customer service - what more could one ask for!&lt;br /&gt;I put this essential oil blend on my pillow &amp; the soles of my feet and it helps me become drowsy and fall asleep.</li>
    <li> The first night I got this I put a drop on each of my children&#x27;s warm rice bags and they zonked out in minutes. I love it too. Smells way better than one called chill pill I bought at a local organic food store. It doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an Herbie smell most essential oils tend to. It smells lovely to us, by far our favorite. I pen on buying a bottle for my mom and one for my significant other.</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil in my homemade baby lotion and love it. It smells great but works even better! Calms my wild one quickly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Smells amazing and calms my two little boys</li>
    <li> This oil has a very &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; scent, but two of the ingredients are orange types so that&#x27;s to be expected. I put this in my oil diffuser and it made the house smell lovely and my dogs fall asleep. And since one of my dogs farts pure napalm, the scent masked the smell of noxious fumes emanating from her rear. We were all happy and calm.</li>
    <li> I feel sorry writting that, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. I couldn&#x27;t smell lavander, just mandarin and something else that make it smell like a product to clean a bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;My kids hated the smell...</li>
    <li> I use this on my 2 and 3 year old at night when they are having a hard time settling down and or I put it in their diffuser in their room and it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!!! I am blown away with the integrity of your company thus far.  Calming the Child is one of my favorite oils yet. It&#x27;s not just for Kids...</li>
    <li> I like this product and it seems to have calming capabilities &amp; smells great. The instructions are limited and I wish it listed more uses of this product for those of us new to using essential oils.</li>
    <li> This smell is so wonderful and indeed very calming and gentle. I really do enjoy it quite a bit. I don&#x27;t have children but that didn&#x27;t stop me from trying this essential oil. I really wanted something soothing for insomnia, migraine relief and night time relaxation. I intend to make a pillow spray and some solid perfume with it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Having used this for a while now, I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars because the citrus smell is overpowering and I prefer more of chamomile, floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blend with my 3 year old who was waking 3-5 times a night, most often with night terrors.  He sleeps with a lovey and we put a few drops on it each night (we call it the cow&#x27;s cologne) and he enjoys that routine.  Since using calming the child he wakes 0-2 times a night and when he does wake, he is much more able to communicate if he is scared, thirsty, etc when before he would just scream and cry in his bedroom unable to tell anyone what was wrong.  I will certainly be reordering this when our supply is low.</li>
    <li> I add a few drops of Calming the Child to about a tablespoon of olive oil for infant massage. It brings instant relaxation. She loves it! I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> Has a nice calming scent that my kids and I enjoy.</li>
    <li> Nice to find a line of essential oil blends that are safe for children under the age of 10. The scent is very pleasant. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it calming because it is very citrusy but it&#x27;s a lovely smell nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I have had great experiences with this company and their oils. I used their lavender for relaxation, and when I ran out I decided to get Calming the Child for both me and my baby. I put a couple drops on my pillow and it helps me sleep. Smells so good too. I put a few drops in about 1/8 cup of almond oil and massage my baby after a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend. These oils are really expensive individually. This combo is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Nice oil blend to diffuse in the afternoon or mix with Epsom salts for a bath...  Certainly doesn&#x27;t put my kid to sleep!  Ha!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this blend!</li>
    <li> This product arrived promptly and smells great. It is great used in a diffuser and as a homemade room freshener spray. I like the blend of oils already combined into one bottle.</li>
    <li> Both of my boys like the fragrance.  Have used it in bath water.  Mixed it with jojoba oil for a night time foot massage.  Both boys LOVED that and it relaxed them but they didn&#x27;t stay in bed.  Have sprinkled a couple of drops on the mattress of one boy.</li>
    <li> It smells really good, but don&#x27;t know if it does anything else.</li>
    <li> This works.... at least, on most kids. It worked on mine. For those moments when you&#x27;re children are incredibly edgy &amp; restless... calms them down without totally putting them to sleep. The house quiets down a lot. My kids hate the smell... but the smell goes away five minutes later..... great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my rambunctious 18- month old. I have not seen it calm her down yet. I will come back with another review if I observe any differences.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of the Calming Child EO. As a mom of 3 very active young boys, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for the price.  WOW!!! Not only was the smell wonderful, this EO has a calming effect as it claims.  I applied the EO to my boys&#x27; feet (then covered with socks) and then to their backs (along spine) before bedtime.  I did dilute the oil in some coconut oil first which helped in massaging the oil in better. We will be using this in our bedtime / naptime routine every day from now on! Love Plant Therapy oils.  We have several of their blends and I have been very satisfied with them - great oils at a great price!</li>
    <li> This was great!  Put in the bath time for a nice transition to bedtime.  Subtle calming smell and good price.</li>
    <li> Well I wanted it to help my son&lt;br /&gt;he has Autism...&lt;br /&gt;I used it.. and BOY he was HYPER!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I stopped and tryed a few days later and HYPER....&lt;br /&gt;I am not using it anymore.. he already missed a fun field trip he wanted to go on...&lt;br /&gt;so some if it works great.. for us no...&lt;br /&gt;Bummer</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this oil. It definitely work on my 5 month old who gets so relaxed and sleepy when I put it in the oil diffuser. The oil is pretty potent. The aroma from it is strong.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this blend. It does seem to calm down the kids.  Good product!</li>
    <li> My children can be little monsters in the car, I diffuse this in  the car and it helps everyone ;)</li>
    <li> wonderful for baby and wonderful for me</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use with students having ADD. Some of the kids liked it, but one said it smelled like gasoline. After smelling it throughout the day, it started smelling of chemicals, almost like lemon Pledge.  We&#x27;ll see if it helps my students calm down and focus. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seems to calm down my very active 4 yr old when I add it to his bath water, then a little more gets added to his body wash. Sleepy time in no time..:-)</li>
    <li> These pure oils are great. My first purchases of the pure oils for use for my bedding, my sons, and for bath time. great products that the whole family loves. I am not sure that I use it often enough on his bedding to be sure it &amp;#34;Calms the Child&amp;#34; but we enjoy the oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this to scent coconut oil, which is basically scentless.  It&#x27;s hard to buy a scent online since everyone&#x27;s perception of \\&quot;good\\&quot; is different, but to me (and my boyfriend), this scent smells like a neutral orange.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing, but not overly fruity or feminine.  We put it in the coconut oil which we use for massages, and it leaves a very subtle amount of scent afterwards, which is great since we don&#x27;t like anything too strong.  We only put a few drops in our 4 oz bottle of oil, though, so I&#x27;m sure it could be much stronger if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  Great product and reasonably priced.  I would say that we will buy again, but we used so little that I think this will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this oil. I plan to use it for animals both dogs and horses. It&#x27;s a very calming scent.</li>
    <li> First let me say how much I LOVE Plant Therapy! High quality oils that are affordable for anyone! I have over 20 of their oils, one being this one. I will admit I am not wild about the smell of this one, however it will calm down my very active 2 year old. I use this every night before bedtime and sometimes on the weekends when she is home all day with me and just being  a bit too wild. I have been using this for 3 months now and I am pleased with the results. My daughter has no issues with the smell (it isn&#x27;t bad, I just don&#x27;t like it) and while I am not a fan of the smell I am a fan of the fact that is does calm my child!</li>
    <li> This smells lovely, I don&#x27;t know that it actually does anything to calm my child but it smells nice to add to the bath at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I use this and the Plant Therapy Relax Synergy together diluted with water in a pink spray bottle.  Our family sprays the &amp;#34;Magic sleeping potion&amp;#34; on our pillows before bedtime and it really helps us relax.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my 4 month old sleep a little more sound at night.  So far it works great!</li>
    <li> It smells great and really works. Baby starts yawning right away when I massage his wrists and face with this oil mixed with lotion. Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> I use this with coconut oil on my seven month old every night as a bedtime routine. She loves her massage. The smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> All of these oils purchased separately would end up costing quite a bit. This lovely blend is truly calming, not only the child, but the full grown adult! Great value! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us.  I tried it on my 15 month old with zero success.  I tried it on myself with zero success.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> My son or daughter did not like the smell at all.  Lavender works way better for them!</li>
    <li> Just started dabbling in aromatherapy so I am not sure quite what to expect. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want something wafting around ether-like drugging my granddaughter! This has a lovely citrusy smell which seems to me would be more activating than calming, but what do I know. If you like the smell of tangerines in your house you would probably like this, but I wouldn&#x27;t get your hopes up that it will turn your children into models of propriety who sit quietly with hands folded in their laps and say, &amp;#34;Please,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Thank you.&amp;#34; That, I believe, does not come in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for home made bubble bath.  It will also make a great project for the grandchildren.  The sent is good and appears to be relaxing.</li>
    <li> This Essential Oil blend smells good.  It is citrusy and minty.  It is dark in color.  Although it smells great, I really don&#x27;t think it calmed my 11 month old at all.  So far, he acts the exact same as if it wasnt being diffused into the air.</li>
