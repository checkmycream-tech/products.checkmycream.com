      <li>arrived as promised, looks great.</li>
      <li>OPI does a great job</li>
      <li>Not too bright.</li>
      <li>Pictures can be deceiving and this color on me just didn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
      <li>Love O.P.I. polishes!</li>
      <li>Great customer service with XPRESSURSELF and the package came early (always great)</li>
      <li>This is a good quality polish that doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
      <li>Perfect for not only Fall, but all year around.</li>
      <li>I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>and I know I will love it once I apply.</li>
      <li>More red-like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this color.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite one from OPI (and I have many).</li>
      <li>I get many compliments but most of all it pleases me.</li>
      <li>Is fancy, sophisticated.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I should&#x27;ve read more reviews before ordering.</li>
      <li>This is more of a fleshy color</li>
      <li>I love all the colors.  </li>
      <li>easy application, love, love, love the color.  </li>
      <li>I love this color against my light to medium brown skin tone.</li>
      <li>The polish also chipped quite quickly even with top coat</li>
      <li>but I guess, you can use it all year round, not too red or orangy, consistency is great, and color lasts, OPI nail polishes are just great polishes!</li>
      <li>This polish is a very nice deep red/pink/brick color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique and I think it goes with all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t match the original.</li>
      <li>But OPI products in general are good, I just didn&#x27;t care for this color.</li>
      <li>OPI has great, long-lasting nail polish, but this color wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
      <li>love the color, much cheaper than in stores</li>
      <li>Really one of my all time favorite colors.</li>
      <li>Not as pictured but very pretty and cannot wait to try it out.</li>
      <li>The color of this polish is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice rich tone while still being a little playful.</li>
      <li>Thanks, OPI!</li>
      <li>They wear well, especially with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I also have gouda gouda, this looks similar, but better.</li>
      <li>This collection is just lovely, in this age of having every possible color on your nails!</li>
      <li>It would be helpful to have more pictures though, especially of it on actual nails.</li>
      <li>I am pretty conservative.</li>
      <li>I am very particular of the colors I wear.</li>
      <li>The color was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>toenails!&lt;br /&gt;Can wear with most other colors---the name cracks me up!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>These are very nice and a bit different, but subtle and go with everything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding an OPI Gel color that is a nice, muted mauve that looks good on my pale skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend O.P.I. in general to anyone who wants a high quality polish without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>This was just a dull light brick color.</li>

<li> I like it because unlike many other polishes, I can use just one coat of this as long as I lay it on a little thick.</li>
<li> I expected this to be a red color based on the pictures, but it&#x27;s actually a matte brown/tan color.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that this is one of those colors that bubbles up after you paint several coats of it.</li>
<li> although not really the fault of the seller.  </li>
<li> This is the color I expected</li>
<li> The color is a muted brick/rose/brown/terracotta color and is opaque (unlike some of the other paler color polishes).  </li>
<li> The color is spicy but not bold and goes with anything.</li>
<li> I thought it would be a coral, verging on pumpkin, with a slight gold shimmer.</li>
<li> Not very appealing at all.  </li>
<li> It is kind of boring.  </li>
<li> so it was a disappointing purchase all around,</li>

    <li> Not as pictured but very pretty and cannot wait to try it out. OPI does a great job and I know I will love it once I apply.</li>
    <li> OPI has great, long-lasting nail polish, but this color wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it would be a coral, verging on pumpkin, with a slight gold shimmer. This was just a dull light brick color.</li>
    <li> This is the color I expected and I take it to the salon when I get a pedicure. Looks awesome.  arrived as promised, looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding an OPI Gel color that is a nice, muted mauve that looks good on my pale skin tone.  This is very similar to \\&quot;Tuscan Rose\\&quot; from Revlon that I have been using for years.  The color is a muted brick/rose/brown/terracotta color and is opaque (unlike some of the other paler color polishes).  I am buying the regular polish for my next pedicure and will be wearing it for the rest of the summer and fall.  It&#x27;s also great for spring. Thanks, OPI!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color. Its my favorite one from OPI (and I have many). Is fancy, sophisticated. It suits me lol</li>
    <li> As I said above, I have never had a problem with OPI enamels.  I love all the colors.  Keep up the good work!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t match the original.</li>
    <li> I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;Been using OPI Products for over 15 years!</li>
    <li> I expected this to be a red color based on the pictures, but it&#x27;s actually a matte brown/tan color.  Not very appealing at all.  The polish also chipped quite quickly even with top coat so it was a disappointing purchase all around, although not really the fault of the seller.  It would be helpful to have more pictures though, especially of it on actual nails.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve read more reviews before ordering. This color is not even close to what&#x27;s pictured. In fact, if you search Amazon for it by name, &amp;#34;Schnapps out of it,&amp;#34; there are 2 different vendors whose pictures show vastly different colors. I was looking for something peachy or orangy for the fall. This is more of a fleshy color I&#x27;ll never wear but didn&#x27;t take the time to return. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Perfect fall orange that is on trend. Great customer service with XPRESSURSELF and the package came early (always great) this color will be on my nails all season</li>
    <li> easy application, love, love, love the color.  It&#x27;s unique and I think it goes with all skin tones.  Not too bright.</li>
    <li> Loved it! It was just what I hoped for!</li>
    <li> This collection is just lovely, in this age of having every possible color on your nails! These are very nice and a bit different, but subtle and go with everything. On the neutral side of the color range. They wear well, especially with a top coat. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This polish is a very nice deep red/pink/brick color. I like it because unlike many other polishes, I can use just one coat of this as long as I lay it on a little thick. It wears off of the ends of my nails after the second day (probably because I do not use a topcoat) but it does not chip. I would recommend O.P.I. in general to anyone who wants a high quality polish without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is very pretty.  My only complaint is that this is one of those colors that bubbles up after you paint several coats of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using OPI polishes for about 13 years and continue to be enamored with the colors and product.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality polish that doesn&#x27;t chip easily. The color is spicy but not bold and goes with anything.</li>
    <li> Pictures can be deceiving and this color on me just didn&#x27;t look good.  But OPI products in general are good, I just didn&#x27;t care for this color.</li>
    <li> used OPI products for years &amp; will continue</li>
    <li> What a GREAT fall color! Goes well on the finger nails and toenails!&lt;br /&gt;Can wear with most other colors---the name cracks me up!</li>
    <li> I am very particular of the colors I wear. I am pretty conservative. I love this color against my light to medium brown skin tone. I get many compliments but most of all it pleases me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best OPI colors I have. It has a nice rich tone while still being a little playful.</li>
    <li> The color was better than I expected. It was not as orange as I thought it was going to be. More red-like. It almost reminds me of those clay pots.</li>
    <li> Really one of my all time favorite colors. Perfect for not only Fall, but all year around. Love O.P.I. polishes!</li>
    <li> but I guess, you can use it all year round, not too red or orangy, consistency is great, and color lasts, OPI nail polishes are just great polishes! I also have gouda gouda, this looks similar, but better.</li>
    <li> Not as shiny as the picture looked.  It is kind of boring.  I put it on my toes and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Thx! Happy customer over here!</li>
    <li> love the color, much cheaper than in stores</li>
    <li> Not the same color as shown.</li>
