      <li>I ordered this for my wedding, it is so pretty!!</li>
      <li>Design is very elegant and very classy.</li>
      <li>I am excited to wear it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>forward to wearing it on my special day.</li>
      <li>Just what I need for my special day.</li>
      <li>I looked for bridal tiaras on other sites and this tiara is a great value for the quality.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty and well made.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of sparkle.</li>
      <li>The price is right compare to bridal stores prices.</li>
      <li>so it sit just right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a perfect tiara-headband to accompany a wedding veil (in fact, I took off my veil for half the night and just left the tiara!!)</li>
      <li>This headband turned out to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>This headband was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The only thing to watch out for is it is very flexible &amp; I feel like if I reshape it too many times it will snap.</li>
      <li>Only issue I had was that it did slip off pretty easily because it is so flexible, but I think that is normal with wedding headbands and you are just suppose to pin them in place.</li>
      <li>It is so much nicer than any I saw at bridal shops.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sparkly and blingy while not being too much.  </li>
      <li>It looked stunning against her dark hair and with an off-white veil.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It appears to be very high quality and looks classy.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth spending the little-bit of extra money (compared to others I saw).  </li>
      <li>The headband was well made, flexible enough to fit to any head, but sturdy enough not to fall apart.</li>
      <li>It was the perfect accessory, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
      <li>The acutal tiara gives you the right amount of sparkle, bright enough to enhance your hair and face, but not too flashy to draw all the attention to the tiara.</li>
      <li>and I was afraid this one would be a cheap copy but its just stunning.  </li>
      <li>I found this exact tiara at a local wedding store for almost double the price</li>
      <li>It really was well-made and looked much more expensive than it was.  </li>

<li> This headband looks very high quality and for less than half of the price at DB.</li>
<li> As long as it is pinned in correctly it stays.</li>
<li> It is also half the price of all of the others I looked at and looks like it was twice the price.</li>
<li> I was a little afriad that it would be bulky looking on my head</li>
<li> A little overpriced I might add.</li>
<li> One thing I didn&#x27;t expect; it is shorter than your typical headband, meaning it doesn&#x27;t run behind your ears.  </li>
<li> Some of the flowers seem to be anchored in a delicate way, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll come off.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear a head band because its painful but this one fits me well.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. The acutal tiara gives you the right amount of sparkle, bright enough to enhance your hair and face, but not too flashy to draw all the attention to the tiara. Looks much more expensive than those $15 ones out there. It&#x27;s worth the price! Another plus: the tiara headband is flexible, so you can tighten it or loosen it to fit your hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I ended up not using this for my wedding but they are cute. A little overpriced I might add.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wedding, it is so pretty!! The picture does not do it justice at all!! I have been looking for a perfect tiara and this was it!! All the ones I had seen at the mall looked so cheap, but this is simply gorgeous. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it in October for my beach wedding!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ordered this headband for my daughter.  It really was well-made and looked much more expensive than it was.  Lots of sparkle and shine!  Looked great in the wedding photos.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and was of good quality. I was completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  It was even more beautiful than we imagined.  The headband was well made, flexible enough to fit to any head, but sturdy enough not to fall apart. It looked stunning against her dark hair and with an off-white veil.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  Can be placed wherever your hairstyle desires. Has everything, pearls, crystals and sparkles without being over the top.</li>
    <li> The tiara in the picture is really nice but what you get is beautiful!  Its sparkly yet classy and matches my off-white wedding gown perfectly (Im sure if my dress was white it would look great to).  I found this exact tiara at a local wedding store for almost double the price and I was afraid this one would be a cheap copy but its just stunning.  Im so happy  to finally see how nice it looks!</li>
    <li> Went beautifully with my wedding dress! So happy I got it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wedding and got so many compliments on how well it looked and how well it matched my dress! This is a gorgeous headpiece.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the picture doesn&#x27;t even do it justice.  It&#x27;s very sparkly and blingy while not being too much.  Fits on head and stays there very nicely.  I wish I could just wear it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful head band!  One thing I didn&#x27;t expect; it is shorter than your typical headband, meaning it doesn&#x27;t run behind your ears.  It stops before it reaches the tops of my ears.  It actually works out, as I am prone to headaches when I wear headbands for too long, but not this one!  Again, so gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Loved it! It was perfect</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and well put together. It is also half the price of all of the others I looked at and looks like it was twice the price. I am very happy with this product and extremely excited to wear it on my special day!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! It&#x27;s perfect for my dress, even though the dress is ivory. I can even reuse it in the future for date nights. The only thing to watch out for is it is very flexible &amp; I feel like if I reshape it too many times it will snap.</li>
    <li> This headband was exactly what I was looking for. It was very similar to David&#x27;s Bridal&#x27;s that was $200! The jewels are beautiful, the headband is very flexible, and the gems are easily able to be adjusted on the band so you can turn a flower easily so it sit just right. This headband looks very high quality and for less than half of the price at DB. Only issue I had was that it did slip off pretty easily because it is so flexible, but I think that is normal with wedding headbands and you are just suppose to pin them in place.</li>
    <li> This piece is gorgeous! It is so much nicer than any I saw at bridal shops. It appears to be very high quality and looks classy. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this for my wedding.</li>
    <li> After looking at several more expensive headbands at Davids Bridal I knew I wanted one with the metal flowers and pearls.  This headband turned out to be exactly what I wanted.  I think it&#x27;s meant to be worn as a tiara but I didn&#x27;t want that so my hair dresser pinned it into my hair thru the loops at the end so it would stay in as a headband. It was the perfect accessory, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This really turned out perfect!!  The headband is beautiful and doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  I was a little afriad that it would be bulky looking on my head but it turned out to be the perfect proportion.  Definitely worth spending the little-bit of extra money (compared to others I saw).  It&#x27;s just a perfect tiara-headband to accompany a wedding veil (in fact, I took off my veil for half the night and just left the tiara!!)</li>
    <li> I had ordered this for my wedding and it is very beautiful! I am excited to wear it. Some of the flowers seem to be anchored in a delicate way, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll come off. It is flexible and can be molded around your hair. Seems to be well made and good quality.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Matches my wedding dress perfectly.  I definitely would recommend.  Very fair priced.</li>
    <li> Wore it on my wedding day and it was gorgeous! As long as it is pinned in correctly it stays.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this headband. I couldn&#x27;t decide on a necklace that matched my wedding dress, so I decided to put some bling in my hair instead. Works well with or without a veil.</li>
    <li> This wedding tiara is beautiful and very well made.  I looked for bridal tiaras on other sites and this tiara is a great value for the quality.</li>
    <li> This Bridal Tiara is very nice and beautiful and it fits me perfectly. I don&#x27;t usually wear a head band because its painful but this one fits me well. Design is very elegant and very classy. I&#x27;m looking forward wearing it on my wedding day. The price is right compare to bridal stores prices. I highly recommend this product. And thank you for the free crystal earrings.</li>
    <li> For the price this headband is perfect accessory to go along with the veil.</li>
