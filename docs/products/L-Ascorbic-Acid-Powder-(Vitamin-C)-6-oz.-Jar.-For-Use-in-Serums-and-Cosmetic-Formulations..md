      <li>Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>Love making my own Vit C serum!</li>
      <li>but once I mastered that it has been amazing</li>
      <li>I use this to make my own vitamin c serum.  </li>
      <li>I make my own Vit C serum</li>
      <li>All skin care experts claim this is the best for anti-aging, however very unstable.</li>
      <li>I purchased this L-Ascorbic Acid to make my own Vitamin C beauty serum for my face.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous product!</li>
      <li>The best part about this is that on the RESURRECTIONbeauty website they include recipes for several potions.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use it for a vitamin c face mask</li>
      <li>I had to purchase a pestle to grind it better for use</li>
      <li>Saving myself SO much money by making my own serums!</li>
      <li>I even tried crushing it more to make it finer, but it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Such a good buy!</li>
      <li>This is L-Ascorbic powder is not as fine as the &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; versions.</li>
      <li>In watching youtube video&#x27;s, it&#x27;s because this powder is not ground finely.  </li>
      <li>Trying to find one that is cheap.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a few brands of this and this I like best!</li>
      <li>I love to mix vitamin c in my cream, thanks.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of product in the container, such that I haven&#x27;t been able to use it up before wondering if it is still potent.  </li>
      <li>Feels more chemical than natural as I was expecting when I read how it&#x27;s advertised on Amazon website.</li>
      <li>How terrific to find cosmetic grade vitamin C to make my own solution.</li>
      <li>Price is right for the amount.  </li>
      <li>Good ones available now can cost up to $100 for just a small amount.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to combine with oils (almond and olive oil) to make my own facial moisturizer, but it is far too grainy and will not dissolve in oil.  </li>
      <li>The vitamin c powder I have added to a jar of hyaluronic acid cream, in small amounts at a time, and I have had good results on my face and arms.</li>
      <li>Very fine granules that completely dissolve in solutions such as glycerin and distiller water.  </li>
      <li>I would shop for a much finer powder rather than buying this brand again.</li>
      <li>This fixes the problem and at an reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Does not desolve very well in water.</li>
      <li>The main problems are the graininess and resistance to dissolving.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>It takes a few days to completely dissolve but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit coarse (and therefore abrasive), but it works pretty well to keep skin soft and to reduce wrinkles and other age-related skin stuff.</li>
      <li>Desolve in the water or with other costmatic very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my dark spots are starting to really show after using this to make my serum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was very difficult to dissolve.  I will not repurchase</li>
    <li> This product does not dissolve in water.</li>
    <li> I purchased this L-Ascorbic Acid to make my own Vitamin C beauty serum for my face.  Good ones available now can cost up to $100 for just a small amount.  The best part about this is that on the RESURRECTIONbeauty website they include recipes for several potions.  I used it to make a 20% Vitamin C Serum, using their recipe.  It came out great and I use it every few days on my face after showering and before using my sunscreen.  I also learned from this company that I can add their Hyaluronic Acid Powder to this serum for added benefits.  See my review for that product also.</li>
    <li> I love to mix vitamin c in my cream, thanks.</li>
    <li> Just a little pinch in facial serums, and your skin glows with this product.</li>
    <li> Such a good buy! I make my own Vit C serum so this is great.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a Vitamin C powder that wouldn&#x27;t leave a yellow stain, and this works.</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit coarse (and therefore abrasive), but it works pretty well to keep skin soft and to reduce wrinkles and other age-related skin stuff. Just give it a few extra minutes to dissolve and don&#x27;t scrub too hard with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this L-ascorbic acid. It takes forever to dissolve. I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my dark spots are starting to really show after using this to make my serum. I was wooed by the price. I will buy from Lotioncrafters next time. I would give a no star rating if I could!!</li>
    <li> This is L-Ascorbic powder is not as fine as the &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; versions.</li>
    <li> This product will not disolve no matter what I do.</li>
    <li> How terrific to find cosmetic grade vitamin C to make my own solution. All skin care experts claim this is the best for anti-aging, however very unstable. This fixes the problem and at an reasonable price. I just mix small batches to last for a week. And in just a few weeks I can see the difference in my skin. But am also using an AHA solution, hyaluronic acid and vitamin E.</li>
    <li> Price is right for the amount.  I use it for making facial serums with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Made a mix of it eith my regular night cream and i love it!</li>
    <li> There is a lot of product in the container, such that I haven&#x27;t been able to use it up before wondering if it is still potent.  The main problems are the graininess and resistance to dissolving. When I mixed a few grains with facial cleanser, or attempted to,  my complexion was left red &amp; irritated for several days. It did not dissolve in my lotion moisturuzer at all, even wetting it before mixing in. I would shop for a much finer powder rather than buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Very fine granules that completely dissolve in solutions such as glycerin and distiller water.  It takes a few days to completely dissolve but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great! Love making my own Vit C serum!</li>
    <li> Desolve in the water or with other costmatic very well. This is perfect vitamin C powder for the people who want to use for DIY skin product. Definitely I will come back for this product again!.Thank you for the quality product !</li>
    <li> It took me a while to realize that the powder needs to be dissolved in liquid Before it can be mixed with oils but once I mastered that it has been amazing and I use it every night before bed! Fabulous product! Saving myself SO much money by making my own serums!</li>
    <li> Does not desolve very well in water.</li>
    <li> I bought this to combine with oils (almond and olive oil) to make my own facial moisturizer, but it is far too grainy and will not dissolve in oil.  I even tried crushing it more to make it finer, but it didn&#x27;t work.  It probably would dissolve in water, but not oil.</li>
    <li> It wasnt what I&#x27;m looking for. Feels more chemical than natural as I was expecting when I read how it&#x27;s advertised on Amazon website.</li>
    <li> Works as described, dissolving in water.</li>
    <li> The vitamin c powder I have added to a jar of hyaluronic acid cream, in small amounts at a time, and I have had good results on my face and arms.</li>
    <li> To those who said it wont dissolve in oil:  it is water soluble and will NEVER dissolve in oil!!  It isnt supposed to.</li>
    <li> does not work for the purpose intended.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few brands of this and this I like best!</li>
    <li> This powder DOES NOT DISOLVE In water as advertised!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powder, but not ultrafine powder. Which is what I needed. I had to purchase a pestle to grind it better for use</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own vitamin c serum.  1/2 to 1 tsp distilled water to 3/4 tsp ascorbic acid power then add about a tsp of glycerin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product  excellent shipping time.  Would highly recommend and purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Too graney.  I bought to use to make face serums and I cannot get the powder to dissolve.  In watching youtube video&#x27;s, it&#x27;s because this powder is not ground finely.  It was cheaper than the brand they showed so I would assume I got what I paid for.  however to use this stuff, I will need to buy a coffee grinder.  Trying to find one that is cheap.  I was able to use it for a vitamin c face mask so it does work for that.  However you have to be carefuly to not scratch the skin or it will will burn it and cause red welts where it tore the skin wiping off.</li>
