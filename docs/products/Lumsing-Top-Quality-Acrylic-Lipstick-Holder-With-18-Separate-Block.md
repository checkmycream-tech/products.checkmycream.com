<li> I like how it has different heights and its not just flat like some</li>
<li> so i can read the labels instead of having to rely on the flat bottom to keep them standing in there, but you can&#x27;t have it all i suppose.</li>
<li> Anything taller than a regular lipstick will topple a little, so I would recommend it only for shorter items.</li>
<li> I like how it is SLIGHTLY slanted</li>
<li> The acrylic was not cheap looking you know that plastic cloudy look.</li>
<li> However I will need another one since its too small for my collection now</li>

    <li> You get what you see . It perfectly displays my lipsticks and the lipstick holder itself reflects light beautifully. I like how it has different heights and its not just flat like some I seen. Maybelline, revlon, Millani, limecrime, and Mac lipsticks couldn&#x27;t be better displayed in this. I love it . However I will need another one since its too small for my collection now but that&#x27;s ok (:</li>
    <li> good quality - just the right size on my counter</li>
    <li> Amazing quality item and at an extremely affordable price point, very happy.</li>
    <li> I wish the blocks were a little deeper because many of the lilpsticks today are longer and they tilt.  I hope they work on that.</li>
    <li> Simple, good sized and fits my lipsticks perfectly. I like how it is SLIGHTLY slanted and I can sort my lipsticks by size. I put my mini ones in the front, mini lipglosses in the middle row and lipsticks in the back row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great present for lip loving females! I got one for my sister and it&#x27;s just a great addition to our makeup stations. :D</li>
    <li> I will be repurchasing this item....The quality is awesome and I would recommend it to all my friends.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> FITS ALMOST ALL SIZES OF LIPSTICK.. BEAUTIFUL... super transparent... best best price...high quality... perfectly finished.  Great size... love it !!!</li>
    <li> I paid all of six dollars for this lipstick organizer l actually purchase (2) two at that price and was very surprised that they were very well made.The acrylic was not cheap looking you know that plastic cloudy look. They hold Mac, YSL,Lime Crime Etc.They have a small footprint which is nice because i can order two more and it would&#x27;nt take over my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;I really am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mom, for her birthday, who is a big fan of lipsticks and has a lot of them and she loved it</li>
    <li> But all my lipsticks fit. I was worried about the circumference of some. But they all fit. .I might even buy another for work storage if the price is right</li>
    <li> Cute and affordable exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> the versatility of the slot sizes to allow for all shapes and sizes takes away from the holdability a bit, but overall a great organizer. i wish it was snug enough to store the rounded lipsticks upside-down so i can read the labels instead of having to rely on the flat bottom to keep them standing in there, but you can&#x27;t have it all i suppose.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! The slots are big enough to hold almost any lipstick and I love that each row is slightly higher than the one before it which is great for seeing all your lipsticks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used to hold essential oil bottles!</li>
    <li> I love this holder; it&#x27;s durable and it&#x27;s tiered so that I can see all of my products.  Anything taller than a regular lipstick will topple a little, so I would recommend it only for shorter items.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for regular sized lipsticks and smaller balms/glosses.  The longer tubes fall out so if that&#x27;s what you have, it won&#x27;t work.  ):  The Acrylic is very strong and high quality.  I will definitely repurchase when my lipstick collection grows.</li>
    <li> Nice holder. The slots are a larger which is great for bigger lipsticks and glosses yet it still holds my smaller items. Great space saver</li>
    <li> Using for holding essential oil roll on bottles in 5mL and 10mL sizes. Works great for that purpose for a bedside holder.</li>
    <li> Love this acrylic lipStick holder. I read reviews for other ones stating that they were too small for certain lipsticks but these holes are large enough for all different brands from drugstore to high end. It&#x27;s a perfect fit for my drawer where I keep my makeup. I only wish u had a vanity to display it on.</li>
    <li> Affordable and exactly what I wanted. It helps that the three layers are tiered (like mini stadium seating). It fits all the lipsticks I have including the larger, square tubes. The only problem is that it makes me want to buy more lipsticks!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!!  Great lipstick organizer!!  Would recommend to all who has numerous lipsticks to store/display on vanity or in bathroom!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping. it&#x27;s a good product to organize all my lipsticks.</li>
    <li> All my friends call me the Queen of Clean and admittedly I function better when things are in their place.  We bought a new motorhome a year ago and I&#x27;ve been organizing for the sake of efficiency ever since.  I have one of these in my bathroom at home&lt;br /&gt;and ordered another one for the coach.  Everything is visible at a glance.  It is also good for nail polish if you put the bottle face down.</li>
