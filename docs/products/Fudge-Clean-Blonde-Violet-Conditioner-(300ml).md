<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about this product. It&#x27;s the same as other violet shampoos I tried in the past. I used twice the amount that I use with regular shampoo and waited about 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t see any big difference when drying my hair. It breaks down the yellow, but I want white, grayish, purple, and this product didn&#x27;t satisfy me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its because I&#x27;m used to Framesi&#x27;s original violet shampoo, but I can&#x27;t find it here in US.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways you might want to  give this product a try, because I&#x27;m sure that my expectations are different than somebody else&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Dark and rich shampoo, gets my blonds bright!</li>
    <li> Although the product does provide some ashing out of brassy or unwanted golden tones in blonde hair, I developed sensitive skin, eczema on my forehead close to the hairline, when I left this product on for 5 minutes.  Now I have to wait until this skin condition clears up before I can try it again. Would advise using a shower cap to contain the shampooed hair so as to not touch skin</li>
    <li> I received my shampoo bottle with a crack at the base of it. There was shampoo everywhere. Not impressed</li>
    <li> I am going gray (mousy brown) and highlight every 3 months. I have a semi permanent violet toner done when I get my hair cut in between highlighting.  Its great for eliminating brassiness that appears regardless of what color treatment (permanent color, low lighting, highlighting) you do.</li>
    <li> Loves this shampoo. Works great it does exactly what it saids it  takes the yellow and brassy right out of your hair.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for blonde hair ever! I purchased expensive products at hair salons which would not do anything and were a waste of money. This product is amazing!!!!! The result was fantastic. I got such a beautiful blonde tone to my highlighted hair and received many compliments. The delivery was from England but the item arrrived in just a week. I would highly recommend the product to everyone with ligh hair. I have dark hair which I highligh but highlights get yellow tone in a week or two. This product brings the original color back and makes it look like I just had my hair done! There is no enought I can say about the product. Just ware gloves when you use it since it might discolor your nails a bit. Also test the product and keep it in your hair for 2-3 min instead of 5 to see how it will effect your hair before you go to 5 min. 3 minutes timeframe is sufficient for me. Also the product was extremely well packaged! Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Does dry my hair out some, but I havent found any toning shampoo that doesnt. Will re-order. Shipping was from UK, so it took a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! It&#x27;s the first purple shampoo, where I&#x27;ve seen a noticable difference in my hair. I have a very cold, ashy, platinum blonde hair colour, and it completely removes the yellow tones that build up over time. I use the shampoo and conditioner once (or twice) a week, and that&#x27;s more than enough. But I wouldn&#x27;t leave it in for more than 2-3 minutes. It&#x27;s very effective, and the few times I&#x27;ve left it in longer, it&#x27;s turned my colour quite grey.</li>
    <li> I have asian colored hair with bleached highlights that tends to easily get brassy. This product is a life savior. I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair color than when using this shampoo! It completely gets rid of the warm red tones in my color and my hair looks like a million bucks.  I do not use this with every shampoo since it can be a bit drying,  but only once every two week, which seems to be working fine.  I apply a generous amount to my scalp and work it through the ends and leave it on for approximately 7 minutes, then wash out well since it can stain clothing and towels.  I also make sure to follow up with a good deep conditioner.  This product is absolutely wonderful and has saved me so much on toning treatments at the salon! I only wish that I could buy this in store or shipping didn&#x27;t take so long!</li>
    <li> Wow...This stuff works remarkably well!  I&#x27;ve used Shimmer Lights before and Fudge is most definitely a cut above.  I lathered it in and left it on for 5-10 minutes or so then washed it out, and even before my hair dried I could tell much of the yellow had turned back to white.  The effects of this toning shampoo were almost as dramatic as salon visit for me.  Yes it can leave a bit of a violet tint but nothing shockingly purple after 10-15 minutes and you need to look hard to notice it, then it fades off.  I&#x27;m definitely addicted to this product. Anyone with bleached hair that tends toward yellow easily would benefit from using this stuff.</li>
    <li> It really does work. I live in an area with hard water that turns my hair brassy. This cleans and conditions my hair perfectly. Use infrequently if you don&#x27;t want to turn your hair purple though.</li>
    <li> This is the best toning shampoo out there.  I have dark hair, but my highlights tend to turn brassy and this fixed it. On top of that it smells great, and does not test on animals...what else could you possibly ask for!</li>
    <li> This went beyond my expectations. I&#x27;m slowly lightening my hair to a silvery-grey and because I&#x27;m using the Fudge Clean Blonde shampoo everyday about half my head is already the color I want! I got expedited shipping because I would have been on vacation when it arrived with regular shipping, and it got here (Alabama) the next day! Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It takes awhile to be delivered, but well worth the wait.  As other reviewers have said, it won&#x27;t hurt to wear gloves.  I didn&#x27;t, but the color quickly washed off my hands.  With the very first shampoo, my brassiness was removed and my hair looks great.  I am trying to grow my gray in and had previously colored blonde hair that had turned orangish.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> simply amazing. If you want silver or platinum or just taking out the brassy, you wont be disappointed. I had tried Matrix and Paul Mitchell and they were both lousy compared to this. Its such a dark purple, its almost black. I used it the first time today and I feel like I&#x27;m finally getting the color I have been trying to achieve.</li>
    <li> All i have to say is the purple is almost black!!!! Soooooo it really really does work. It stains ur hands a little but i just use gloves and problem solved. Just love this brand!!!! My hair really is blonder, no yellows here!!!! I give it an A+++++++</li>
    <li> I researched some reviews on this product &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I found it. It&#x27;s been difficult to find a toning shampoo that my boyfriend likes the smell of. This one WORKS (as in it actually tones my blonde &amp; can even OVER do it if left in too long). It smells like coconut-ish? We don&#x27;t have a water softener so this stuff keeps my blonde in check until my next color appointment! :)</li>
    <li> this stuff is INTENSE, way more so than anything i&#x27;ve ever tried. But it works. Just be sure to vince extra well (I have to check in a mirror) because it will stain your scalp purple!</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo for my blonde hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and this one by far is the best! A little goes a long way. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incredible. I cannot say enough good things about the wonderful color my hair has after I use this. I use it once a week and it has made my blonde hair pop. Love it and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great for blondes to take the brassiness out in between colors.....u can use alone or mix with your favorite shampoo.  Shipping was faster then expected</li>
    <li> Its fine, does a good job conditioning. If you really want to get the violet benefit color wise use the Fudge shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  My hair is colored light blonde but starts looking brassy within a week of having it colored.  I use this stuff once a week and it does an incredible job getting rid of the brassy tones.  It looks just as good as when I get it toned at the salon!  I leave on the full 5 minutes (I set a timer).  I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff and wish I had found it sooner!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily as it doesn&#x27;t seem all that moisturizing for my dry damaged hair, but once a week should be good for keeping the brassy color away.  I use goldwell purple shampoo and conditioner for my daily hair product.</li>
    <li> Better than any other purple shampoo I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than Silver Lights. VERY pigmented, so use sparingly and follow directions on bottle. Worth every penny, and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  It&#x27;s as drying as its competitors and it&#x27;s too concentrated.  Even mixing it with a neutral shampoo left too much dull residue on the hair.    What&#x27;s more, it takes a while to receive (shipped from Sweden) and it&#x27;s overpriced to boot.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve probably tried every one out there. Does seem to dry my hair a bit, but I feel like they all do. What I sometimes do is either mix it with whatever other shampoo I&#x27;m using at the time or wash once with a moisturizing shampoo and then wash with this. It will turn your hands purple but it comes out, really not a big deal. Might leave a purple tint on light blonds, but on my highlights it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best toning shampoo I&#x27;ve used by far.  I use it about once every 5-7 days and it works wonderfully to remove any brassy tones in my hair. One bottle lasted about 10 months for me - my hair usually ranges somewhere between chin and shoulder length. It is a very deep purple and will stain your hands slightly but I find that by the end of my shower my hands are usually back to normal.  In my opinion it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> If you are trying to maintain silver hair, THIS is the shampoo you are looking for. I&#x27;ve tried everything from demi toners (Manic Panic) to silver-maintaining shampoos (Pantene) to rinses (Roux) and this is the CLEAR standout. Be warned that they are dead serious about staining (I keep dish soap in the shower to wash the walls and bathtub) as it will stain everything from your hands to your forehead, but it leaves the most gorgeous pale lavender/silver cast. It also leaves hair feeling soft and not dried out, even when it&#x27;s been bleached to bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is meh -- I use a leave-in to preserve the color from another rinse -- but this is now my very favorite shampoo, and worth looking for on UK sites that ship worldwide.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my hair now if you are wanting a 100% no yellow silvery white hair this is THE product &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;toning&amp;#34; shampoo!  I like to leave it in for 10 min. for the best effect.  However, this works just as well as adding Manic Panic Ultra Violet to regular white conditioner and leave in hair for 1 hr. or longer... and it&#x27;s WAY cheaper!</li>
    <li> Took out my brassiness better than anything tried before ! Didn&#x27;t take as long to get here as I thought it would!</li>
    <li> The packaging is different but it&#x27;s still the product. If you have blonde hair this is the most perfect product for getting rid of brassy, nasty orange colour. I have dyed silver hair and this is the only product I use to keep my colour beautiful.</li>
    <li> My highlighted hair had a tinge of yellow - until I used this! It took out the brassiness and left my hair soft and manageable, really wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner. Might seem pricey but it&#x27;s a really big tube which will last ages.</li>
    <li> I have dark blonde hair , and I color (medium ash blonde) and highlight it.  I left the highlight on too long (fell asleep) and had ugly yellow/brassy results.  My salon pro suggested violet toner, but I was too afraid to make one mishap into two.  I was trolling Amazon, and found this product and ordered.  I had to play around with just how best to use it - leaving on for 5 min. caused my hair to be dry.  I ended up mixing 50/50 with my normal shampoo, and leave on for only 3 min; then follow with conditioner.  This seems to be the winning combination.  Very, very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I was prepared to send this back, because I mistakenly ordered it.  I wind up keeping it when I heard what it would cost to return.  However, the product seems fine, though, I have only used it once.  A little too pricey.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and can&#x27;t get enough of it! The purple is almost black it&#x27;s so dark, and I&#x27;ve never found another shampoo that works quite as well as Fudge. I ran out once and picked up a tube of Loreal Colour Correct Toning Shampoo to hold me over until I could get more of the Fudge Clean Blonde Violet, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly the same at all. You can use this as a regular shampoo if you&#x27;re just trying to get rid of some of the yellow tones in your hair, or you can apply it to your hair and leave it in to work its magic for ~5 minutes and you&#x27;ll have ashy/silvery hair with some pale lavender streaks in it, which is what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re trying to decide whether or not to spend the extra money on this product, DO IT. It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. better than shimmer lights in my opinion- well worth the extra bucks. The first time I ordered this (in the U.S.) it took almost a month to arrive, this time I received it in about 2 weeks (or less) which is great for international shipping. The packaging was newer than the pale purple I&#x27;m used to seeing but I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in formula (smells the same, same consistency)  I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open though. I have pastel purple ombre hair so this keeps it from looking brassy since my natural hair is asian/black and the minerals in water bring out the yucky orange hue. However, If you don&#x27;t bleach your hair light enough, it won&#x27;t do much for you since there are no lifting/bleaching properties in this product.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep you platinum hair color longer, this is the product for you. It is amazing and the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. As most Fudge products, when I open the last one I order another because of the length of time it takes to arrive. I usually have 2 on hand. Won&#x27;t be without it. Fantastic shampoo for those of us with platinum, grey or white hair to keep the color longer and stop all brassiness. So worth the money and doesn&#x27;t require a lot for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> this toning shampoo completely took all the brassiness out of my bleached hair. It was like a life changer. I highly recommend this to anyone who has bleached their hair and has stubborn hair color brassiness.</li>
    <li> This stuff is some serious business! I usually use the clairol one everyone else used for toning blonde hair but, man, I could REALLY tell a huge difference with this one. I left it on as I do with the clairol and it almost worked TOO well! My hair was super ashy. I love that you can control the intensity based on how long you leave it in. Much more dramatic than tbe clairol in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about. Didn&#x27;t noticed a difference except the time I left it on a little longer than I should have and my hair was straight up purple. The purple washed out after 2 more washes so don&#x27;t leave it on your hair too long.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and toning shampoo. It works exceptionally well on salt and pepper hair color.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  My daughter uses it on her hair to achieve a light violet color.  She gets compliments on the color and  everywhere she goes people ask her what she did to get her hair that color.  Very happy we discovered this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless blue shampoos.... this stuff is the best. I recently went to a nice salon- but must&#x27;ve booked with a gal on her first day because i left with YELLOW hair. She did the absolute worst bleach job on me Ive ever seen. The manager apologized- but she had put my hair through so many processes that day that fixing it would have damaged my hair terribly. After about 3 washes with this stuff- it has pulled out so much of the yellow, i may not even have to go back in to get this fixed!  It turned my Patty Mayonayse hair into a Marilyn-esque blonde! I am floored.</li>
    <li> Really gets the gold tones out of my hair. Saw a change after the first wash.  I will definitely buy this stuff again.</li>
    <li> sorry poor results after washing daily fudge clean !!!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for blonde hair....</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, granted your hair is not too yellow or orange. If toning platinum hair is what you&#x27;re after, the shampoo does it&#x27;s job. It smells good, it&#x27;s not too drying...it&#x27;s very, very purple. The delivery to Canada was incredibly fast even during the holiday season. I will buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> The most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used for instant results. After the first wash my hair was so much cooler and by the second use it was as ashy as I could have ever hoped for. I never write reviews but this one deserves it</li>
    <li> This is the best purple shampoo I have ever used.  I will use this product for many years, Im sure!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have naturally dark hair and have lots of blonde hi lights and I leave this product in for about 5 to 6 mins and rinse my hair. After conditioning my hair  its is instantly more ashy. Love it and highly recommend this product to any blonde.I love the lathering too! If you like light violet tones then use this product by its self if not then just use a regular shampoo after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had every shade of blonde hair you can imagine and thus have basically tried every purple toning shampoo. I&#x27;ve used those that most people swear by, and none gave me more than \\&quot;meh\\&quot; results as far as the color goes. They all pretty much either dried my hair out or weren&#x27;t spectacular shampoos in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THIS STUFF is great. It&#x27;s the best. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me so long to find it and that it doesn&#x27;t have some huge cult following amongst the online beauty community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tones so well, and yes it WILL leave light blonde hair with a lavender cast if you leave it on too long. My hair is currently a more golden blonde (which I&#x27;m sick of) and it toned it down to more ash blonde, closer to medium (which I wanted). The tone also lasts a while, even if you shampoo with a different shampoo in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other huge benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that dry, matte cast that a lot of other toning shampoos leave your hair with. It is actually a fantastic (not sulfate free) shampoo, which balances out my oily scalp and dry ends and leaves my hair silky and shiny. I find I have to shampoo less when I use it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this stuff gets more popularity and becomes more widely available in the US! Though I do have to say, shipping was super fast and convenient anyway.</li>
    <li> Arrived way sooner than I expected. Great shipping and even better product. Leaves my hair grey white as I like. Hate yellow in my hair</li>
    <li> I have never been able to get my hair beyond a somewhat brassy blonde because I have a lot of yellow undertones in my hair. Unfortunately, this ruins the &amp;#34;blonde experience&amp;#34; for me because I have olive colored skin, so my skin and hair always seem the same tone. So anyways, my most recent adventure into blondness was a little better because I was using a really great salon, but I was still getting some brass that was washing me out. I decided to try this because of the excellent reviews, and I must say I&#x27;m blown away by how wonderful my hair looks. After 2 uses, I finally have that gorgeous ashy blonde I&#x27;ve always wanted. I did find this product to be a little bit drying. To counter act the drying effect, I just did a deep conditioner with a shower cap for 10 minutes after using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works to turn your hair silver colored and it works better than the others like Shimmer Lights it is really strongly tinted.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair either</li>
    <li> It worked for me the way I expect it to. Took the bronze out of my hair &amp; gave me a nice ash color. Over all I&#x27;m happy with my results!</li>
    <li> this is super concentrated so watch out.  it does the trick and pulls out the orange.  just wear gloves to put it on.</li>
    <li> Never buying a different purple shampoo again. This shampoo makes my hair so soft and healthy too! I don&#x27;t know why this product can&#x27;t exist in the U.S or Canada. Oh well, thank god for Amazon. Took a long time for this product to arrive (about a month). I&#x27;m going to make sure I order it well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is very potent stuff, it definitely makes my hair less brassy. Careful though, it can stain your hands and scalp. First purple shampoo to actually give me good results and I love the smell. I haven&#x27;t come close to a similar product in North America. I&#x27;ve purchase AG, Aveda, Clairol, John Frida, Bed Head, Jhirmack and other brands.</li>
    <li> Effectively eliminates golden/brassiness from my hair. This stuff is PURPLE like nobody&#x27;s business, it looks like paint. Works fabulously. The container is huge and will last a long time - worth the $!</li>
    <li> This is  amazing shampoo! It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I  usually bleach my hair every 6 wks,  stylist bleaches my hair and uses glaze to tone it, but i still have  some brassiness so i go home and use this shampoo  and it does wonders!! I will recommend using gloves as this shampoo is very dark purple and will color your fingers. I usually use this product 4-6 times/month. If you have platinum blond don&#x27;tkeep this shampoo on for &amp;#62;2 min as your hair might turn purple. I have light/medium blonde and I usually keep shampoo in for 4-5 min and wash it out afterwards. Smells good and does not dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping to philadelphia is slow, takes 2 wks on average.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve recently run into the issue of hairdressers not wanting to tone my hair - they seem to think the color doesn&#x27;t need it, but I always get home and cringe looking at my hair in more natural light. Figuring I could tackle the problem myself, I tried several different purple shampoo brands - Paul Mitchell (did not work, left my hair feeling awful) Regis (ehhhh...helped, but not a lot, still made my texture weird) and a few others. This one is hands down the best so far. My blonde is no longer yellow and my auburn lowlights actually are even less brassy. Some of my blonde does look a tad lighter, but my hair is not white and it did not stain to purple after leaving on for a few minutes. (By a few, I mean three-ish. I have not had the courage to try longer, yet.) It does deposit color as it can stain hands and it rinses an obvious purple color going down the drain. I did not order from amazon, but a UK website, which means I waited about two weeks, but this stuff has been well worth it. I no longer hate my most recent dye job. :)</li>
    <li> First of all this smells good, or at least not bad.  I tried Shimmer Lights and it smelled so bad my husband asked me not to use it anymore.  Both me and my daughter tried this Fudge shampoo.  She has naturally medium to dark blond hair that has been lightened to very light blond.  I have naturally dark brown hair that I tried to lighten to light brown and of course it went orange.  Here are our results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blond hair - My daughter&#x27;s hair turned a white/silvery blond.  She left some in extra long to make a purple streak but it washed out in a day or 2.  She didn&#x27;t like the way her hair looked however.  She said at school everyone was asking her why her hair had a greyish purple tint.  Her hair returned to normal in a day or 2.  I thought her hair looked very pretty and I think she had the look people buy this kind of shampoo to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown/Orange hair - I was hoping to neutralize some of the orange in my recently dyed light brown hair but I didn&#x27;t see a result after trying this several times.  I put a ton in and let it sit for 10 minutes and I still didn&#x27;t see a change.  I guess that&#x27;s why the shampoo says its for blonds it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipping takes quite a while (over a month).</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the softest toning shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and its so purple its nearly a blue colour.  I will buy this product again and recommend it to any blonds</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to put this in your hair, I promise it does not come out purple.  This takes the edge off my hair, and it keeps for a few days so I don&#x27;t use it every day.  I have fine, thin, color treated (read: dead inside) hair.  My platinum comes out really nice and icy and the less platinum areas are a cool ash blonde.  I&#x27;m a fan.  Wish it would ship faster so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about running out when the time comes!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see too much of a difference. HOWEVER...my stylist has told me that I have the most difficult hair she has ever had to deal with. Even the other girls in salon have gotten involved in my color!</li>
    <li> This is a powerful blueing agent.  It does what it is supposed to do, which is take some brassiness out of my blonde hair.  I wish it was a bit thicker in consistency though, because it just goes everywhere when I apply it to my hair.  I washed my hair in the sink the first time I used it, and when I looked up, I had blue goo spatters everywhere.  It looked like a crime scene in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This Fudge Clean Blonde Violet shampoo wasn&#x27;t as I had hoped. It cleans well, left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t do much to help the brassy tones in my hair. I will continue to try it and will update if anything changes</li>
    <li> I got wonderful results! If you want an intense ashy- ash blonde color go for this shampoo. It is incredible compared to the lamo shiny silver shampoo, and others. This shampoo is almost like a dye. It&#x27;s much stronger than a tint. I used it and left it on for 5 minutes as recommended and it came out very very ash, almost purpleish. it stained my hair (Which I&#x27;m glad of) and continued to look bright and ashy at the next shampoo. This shampoo works and I am very happy with the results. Yay!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite purple shampoo. If you want to tone down your gold, buy this. Leave it on for five to six minutes on the really stubborn areas. It won&#x27;t get rid of all the gold, but it tones better than any other shampoo!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for keeping out the yellow or brassiness associated with high lighted hair.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best violet shampoo ive ever used.. it really does the job in getting rid of the orange tones..</li>
