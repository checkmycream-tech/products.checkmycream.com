      <li>I was happy for two reasons.</li>
      <li>Great for both my post menopausal acne and</li>
      <li>Happy to have found it a litle cheaper then where i bought it before.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>it smells great</li>
      <li>LOVE this!!</li>
      <li>Very effective.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>, it makes my skin feel awesome, and i love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looked good, so I bought it.</li>
      <li>The sprayer seems to work good.</li>
      <li>Well, not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start off with the good.</li>
      <li>Its that good.</li>
      <li>Good thing I bought 2.</li>
      <li>So we now use Cerave foaming cleanser (available at any drugstore) - the best and cheapest of what we found out there in cleansers.</li>
      <li>Of course the special spray bottle is the best part-gets everywhere you need it to go!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I tried my favorite nevea lotion which works great</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>, Murad is too pricey for &#x27;nice&#x27; in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It has a nice tingly feeling when you put it on &amp; the salicylic acid continues to work throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>It sprayed nicely - it sprays a lot at once -</li>
      <li>Time will tell if it&#x27;s actually effective for me.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s really nice</li>
      <li>Plus this is a great price, original retail is about $45.</li>
      <li>this spray is the best  real light and not heavy  </li>
      <li>I will order more for sure!</li>
      <li>Any woman know that most tops have some kind of scoop or v-neck...</li>
      <li>, we apply PRID (a homeopathic salve available at most drugstores - inexpensive) which almost always brings the pimple to a head (good for boils, too, by the way).</li>
      <li>5 stars I love this product and will definetly buy more when I run out.    </li>
      <li>I love that you can spray it from any angle</li>
      <li>You will literally notice an improvement within 24 hours &amp; more benefits with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>However, many of the products did not work.</li>
      <li>and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;helps</li>
      <li>atleast once more when this bottle runs out.  </li>
      <li>and I just bought 2 bottles to make sure i always have some with me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as drying as some sprays, which allows me to use it more often.</li>
      <li>I have been using the glytone spray for 10 days now, and all the light acne I had on my body is GONE!</li>
      <li>This is the best product for your back!</li>
      <li>I am confident it will be mostly gone in another 4 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and you won&#x27;t regret</li>
      <li>Sooo worth the money!!</li>
      <li>A bit costly but worth it!!</li>
      <li>This is a nice product, in the sense that it made my skin feel very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>If you get acne on your back this is the best stuff - it sprays on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Easy spray nozzle.</li>
      <li>The trick is start easy.</li>
      <li>This product makes it easy.  </li>
      <li>Still going strong.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best product ever made.    </li>
      <li>Been using for about three weeks now and not super impressed with results.  </li>
      <li>I received the product on time and the packaging was fine, but the bottle does not spray.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine- sort of the equivalent of using a salicylic acid toner.</li>
      <li>I found the washes to be more useful for treating existing acne rather than preventing it.  </li>
      <li>I love the minty fresh feeling it leaves after you put it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried prescription topicals, medicated body washes, and oral treatments and this is by far the most effective product out of all of them.</li>
      <li>Tingly and refreshing, it cleared me up right away.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>Even though the spray can be made from different angles, having someone else insures a successful spray.</li>
      <li>About the same price as a dermatologist copay, which ended up being WAY more effective.</li>
      <li>It does have a &#x27;cool&#x27; feeling on the skin</li>
      <li>Nice but not super effective.</li>
      <li>have also noticed that my skin has gotten softer &amp; smoother, which I haven&#x27;t experienced from any other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came quickly and undamaged.</li>
      <li>But it quickly dissipates and you can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ve found some great body washes &amp; body scrubs for treating body blemishes/breakouts since those are used IN the shower, you are washing away the medicine &amp; it can only do so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle and the results keep getting better and better.</li>
      <li>skin reacts better to salicylic acid then benzoyl peroxide - so I had high hopes for this clarifying body spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works good but takes a while to dry on your body</li>
      <li>Works very well!!</li>
      <li>This is the first product that truly worked for me and I will continue to use it!</li>
      <li>But in all fairness to the product, I had a pretty severe case of shoulder acne with significant hyperpigmentation.  </li>
      <li>This level might actually be better for people with sensitive skin, but if you often use 2% or higher sylical acid, then this product is over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have been using it for 2 months with no improvement!</li>
      <li>It was truly amazing, and I only need to use it about twice a week to keep blemishes under control.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results on my back after jut 2 weeks of using it.</li>
      <li>I do have to say that the cooling sensation wins me over.</li>
      <li>but worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth every dime, buy it.</li>
      <li>Used it for 6 weeks, did not really make my backne better, but also not worst</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Only nice thing is how you can use it at an angle.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh scent, which refreshes my skin at every use.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty quick.</li>
      <li>The spray can be used upside down and comes out in a nice fine mist.</li>
      <li>right now I haven&#x27;t found any.</li>
      <li>beautiful sleek, olive skin comes at a price and that is occasional back breakouts ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect on the body, especially if you work out and wear your hair down (dancing, performing, etc.)  </li>
      <li>As much as I love the Murad &amp; Peter Thomas Acne body scrubs/washes &amp; they have definitely helped, nothing has been able to completely resolve my body acne, till this!  </li>
      <li>The 360 degree spray ability really comes in handy when trying to spray your back.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is so convenient to use and it works, for me.  But, when I stop using it, my blemishes came back less than a month after. So I am back on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years! Happy to have found it a litle cheaper then where i bought it before. This is the only product that can clear up my back and keep it clear as well!! Sooo worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my back is 95% better. No more giant blemishes. All that remains is a dark spots from previous acne, but even those are fading with time. This is the first product that truly worked for me and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hundreds of products to cure by back acne for several years.  This is hands down the best product ever made.    If you&#x27;re trying to cure your back acne, don&#x27;t even look around for more.  This is the best product for your back!</li>
    <li> I bought this spray after reading raving reviews of how it helped others clear bacne and/or fade bacne scars.&lt;br /&gt;My skin reacts better to salicylic acid then benzoyl peroxide - so I had high hopes for this clarifying body spray.&lt;br /&gt;I get occasional breakouts on my shoulder blades, so I thought this would help clear it ALL up --- but I found it did not do wonders for me.  It actually did not even help fade any bacne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was used up within a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll just stick to Neutrogena acne body wash.</li>
    <li> With Murad Acne Clarifying Body Spray, I have seen some improvement with my skin. I appreciate the smell and how it feels on my body. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is much easier when you have someone else spray it on your body though. Even though the spray can be made from different angles, having someone else insures a successful spray. I did not want to waste any of it.</li>
    <li> Found it at amazom way cheaper than Ulta. For me this spray has worked excellent. A little history, all of a sudden I started getting pimples on my back and shoulders. For a woman my age this is very embarrasing, and uncomfortable. Did some research on the internet and this product kept on coming up. Tried it and was amazed. It took 4-5 days for everything to clear up. The blemishes I had were big and painful, and also had many blackheads. (sorry if it sounds gross) and this made them go away. The trick is start easy. Spray once a day, if its too irritating then every other day. Work yourself up to twice and if you need it three times a day. I know that not all products work well for everyone, but this spray worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now.  While I&#x27;ve found some great body washes &amp; body scrubs for treating body blemishes/breakouts since those are used IN the shower, you are washing away the medicine &amp; it can only do so much.  I found the washes to be more useful for treating existing acne rather than preventing it.  As much as I love the Murad &amp; Peter Thomas Acne body scrubs/washes &amp; they have definitely helped, nothing has been able to completely resolve my body acne, till this!  Even my dermatologist had gotten to the point of wanting to put me on Acutane.  Thankfully I just kept looking at products &amp; found this before having to try Acutane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This product is a liquid, so you have great coverage, sprays upside down as well, which is useful for applying to your back area and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  It has a nice tingly feeling when you put it on &amp; the salicylic acid continues to work throughout the day.  You will literally notice an improvement within 24 hours &amp; more benefits with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my skin has gotten softer &amp; smoother, which I haven&#x27;t experienced from any other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Little high maintenance because you have to wait 5+ minutes for it to dry before getting dressed.  So hopefully you can roam your house in the nude for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it (about 6 months ago) I would apply it daily to my chest &amp; back after showering.  So I was originally going through a bottle every 1 1/2 months which was a little pricey.  But after using it for about 3 months, I now only need to use it about once a week!  If you&#x27;ve ever had problematic skin, you get to a point where you don&#x27;t really care what something costs, as long as it works.  So while this was more of a hassle to me to have to order a lot, I can see it seeming expensive to some.</li>
    <li> As an adult, I&#x27;ve always suffered from back acne and chest breakouts. I got this a few weeks ago, have been using it once a day in the morning, and i&#x27;ve noticed my skin by end of day still being &#x27;dry&#x27; to the touch and no longer &#x27;oily and sticky&#x27;. Haven&#x27;t had any large pimples at all, but still get a few whiteheads - however,volume has significantly decreased. The smell is like any astringent, and the initial tingly feeling actual feels nice. Of course the special spray bottle is the best part-gets everywhere you need it to go! Amazon had it at the cheapest price at $29.99, so I bought 2 bottles.Drugstore.com was at $37! Sephora I believe was at $33. Worth every dime, buy it.</li>
    <li> I used to use Avon Bacne spray treatment, but it got discontinued. I tried this product for the first time and it was even better than my previous Avon product. The 360 degree spray ability really comes in handy when trying to spray your back. And the product works really well for treating blemishes. The only thing is I feel like it has a weird smell, but nothing thats really noticable to others. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wants better skin in large areas, like your back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with [[ASIN:B000ULR3TK Murad Acne Body Wash (8.5 oz)]] for about a year and it&#x27;s really cleared up my back. I can go a couple days without using the spray, like when on vacation, without new break outs. Hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, and I use it daily. I would definitely recommend getting and using both! Worth the price. I&#x27;ve been able to find it cheaper on amazon than at beauty stores and other online sites.</li>
    <li> this spray is the best  real light and not heavy  it works well on your back in the summer when it sweats</li>
    <li> I saw a review of it on youtube a month ago. I thought $33 was a little pricey for a skin care product but decided to give it a try. I got it a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results on my back after jut 2 weeks of using it. I noticed I was missing a spot in my back that would still break out and when I started applying it there too the acne stopped. Its that good. I am still to see results on my chest acne.  I use it everyday with the Panoxyl 10% benzoyl peroxide soap bar. I wash my body and then I use the spray. I love the minty fresh feeling it leaves after you put it on. Shipping was pretty quick. 5 stars I love this product and will definetly buy more when I run out.    *update** Im on my 4th month of using this product and I just bought 2 bottles to make sure i always have some with me. My back has improved sooo much. If you have backne this is a must have.</li>
    <li> i used to suffer from back acne that was worsened by dry and irritated skin i would scratch all the time, the dirt from my hands and finger nails would just make my sensitive skin break out more.  I tried my favorite nevea lotion which works great every where else but not so great on my back especially since it can be hard to reach. Murad not only clears up all the acne but leaves my skin moisturized and soft. Although the bottle is plastic it works like a aerosol can so you can spray it even when its upside down allowing you to spray hard to reach places.  i recommend it to every one! Plus this is a great price, original retail is about $45. I recommend drowning your skin in it when you first use it 3 times a day until the skin clears up for fast results, for me it takes a week or two for a bad break out, going through a bottle a week, so buy 2 or 3 bottles. After that just keep one on hand to use every 1 to 3 days to maintain clear skin.</li>
    <li> It works well for treating existing breakouts but doesn&#x27;t eliminate them from returning</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months and I see no change. At least it didn&#x27;t get worse....not buying this again</li>
    <li> or other hard to reach places that tend to break out.  It really works if you use it consistently after bathing</li>
    <li> I had really severe backacne. And I am not paid to do this. I just want someone to get rid of the same problem. I tried the oxyderm I think that what its called it was an orange little bottle which was 7 bucks. It made it worst and spread my acne to the lower back which at first i had no issue. So I left a bad review on that one, you guys can go back and see it. But, anyways, this product work miracles for me and hope it does for you. Pro: it sprays upside down and feels fresh cool feeling when sprayed. Con: it only .5 %, but still work!!! Good luck!</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this.  It made my skin worse.  It dried it out even when I tried using it 1-2 per week.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Tingly and refreshing, it cleared me up right away. I have been using it for about 3 months and I think i&#x27;m just running out now, so it lasts for a little while!</li>
    <li> Used it for a few days now and I&#x27;m indifferent. It has a very noticeable cooling feeling when applied, and it sprays decently well. It came quickly and undamaged.</li>
    <li> This is really sad, this produce stop working for me. I don&#x27;t know why but I&#x27;m back to the same amount of back acne like I had before. I&#x27;m searching for a new product to reduce my blemishes and right now I haven&#x27;t found any. I&#x27;m still working on it. (Age:16)</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to reduce the amount of acne I would get on my back and chest since I never assumed anything could completely rid me of the problem.  I am grateful for having discovered the Murad Acne clarifying spray because it&#x27;s no longer an issue for me as long as I continue using it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> used for a month along with murad&#x27;s body wash, so no change or improvement in my problem areas :( kinda sad.</li>
    <li> Just got this and a few comments... The sprayer seems to work good. The smell is very medicinal... It feels metholated.. Doesn&#x27;t burn but feels very tingly on the skin... i have noticed some improvement in my skin and haves been using for just a few days... Will follow up in a few weeks and let you know how it progresses....</li>
    <li> Works good but takes a while to dry on your body</li>
    <li> Works very well!! Cleaned up all of my body acne in a number of days.</li>
    <li> I have had back me for most of my life. It is only in my late 40s I am finding a solution that does not completely clear the problem but mostly clears it. This is a product that has to be used faithfully and will take up to a couple of months before you see real results. I use this with Murad&#x27;s body wash scrub, since it also has salicylic acid. If you were going to use this on your back, I advise you to get something like a lotion applicator, sprayed on the surface of that and use it to spread evenly on your back.</li>
    <li> I had bad back acne and nothing ever worked. I went to the dermatologist and she had me try a whole heck of a lot of things that made it worst including chemical burn in my back. This product with a sulfur cleanse helped my back acne and now I am still using it as maintenance to keep my acne at bay. The bottle&#x27;s sprayer is nice since you can turn in everyday and product would still disperse</li>
    <li> Nothing works better for the acne on my back. I use this whenever I get out of the shower. No sticky residue, no dying clothes. I love it. Works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. I have been using for years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no improvement. My acne is small, but stubborn...and spreading. At least the neutrogena products I was previously using kept it contained. This just made it worse, if possible. I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because of the product design...the liquid comes out in a large mist no matter which way you hold the bottle. It was a little bit of a difficult switch from the neutrogena body spray (which comes out in a more controlled, smaller spray) but this covers a larger area of skin in a small amount of time. I&#x27;m giving up on this and am moving onto the other spray everybody has been raving about. Hopefully it&#x27;s a miracle worker because this product was useless.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. Have not seen any results in two months. Takes forever to dry when you spray it on. Only nice thing is how you can use it at an angle.</li>
    <li> If you get acne on your back this is the best stuff - it sprays on easily and dries quickly.  I also use it regularly on my chest for preventitive treatment (I like wearing V necks) - I never get pimples when I have been using this stuff on my chest.  Pricey yes but worth it.</li>
    <li> I suddenly broke out on my back and needed something to cover it up. this spray is convenient to use and does not leave any marks on your clothes. the reason I gave it 4 stars is that, it takes time to show results.</li>
    <li> I CrossFit in the Louisiana heat -this stuff keeps my back clean and clear!</li>
    <li> I use this religiously after showering and have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. It is easy to apply to my back with no help from my husband. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and the results keep getting better and better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all and I used it religiously 2x a day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Time will tell if it&#x27;s actually effective for me. It seems to be helping. I do have to say that the cooling sensation wins me over. It soothes any skin irritation. The somewhat minty smell isn&#x27;t strong enough to linger on the skin for long. I was worried it might smell like icy hot but it does not. I have no complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! It sprays upside down for hard to reach on back. Thats the only place i have breakouts in summer. Cleared it up in 3 days. I will order more for sure!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products....I highly recommend it for everyone of all ages!</li>
    <li> Great for both my post menopausal acne and my daughter&#x27;s pubescent acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have both been to three dermatologists thus far - who all recommended antibiotics that cause yeast infections and don&#x27;t seem to work or meds that are so expensive I would have to eat bologna five times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began to investigate how to treat acne. Exfoliation to keep the dead skin cells/oil out of the pores seems key. Benzoyl peroxide wash was too harsh for both of us. So we now use Cerave foaming cleanser (available at any drugstore) - the best and cheapest of what we found out there in cleansers. Then we spray on this salicylic acid spray on our back/upper arm acne and dab murad salicylic acid flesh colored stick onto the facial acne. We spray our faces with water after that (keep skin moist). At night we use the salicylic acid spray and stick again and cover with a retinol (retinoids made our faces too flaky). This seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we get a pus filled painful pimple, rather than popping it and causing scarring, we apply PRID (a homeopathic salve available at most drugstores - inexpensive) which almost always brings the pimple to a head (good for boils, too, by the way). I also use Kiehls dead sea mud mask once a month.</li>
    <li> Spray nozzle is great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It soothes and gradually reduces boday acne scars and prevents new break outs as well. It is expensive, but worth the expense.</li>
    <li> In the warmer months my back kept breaking out due to sweating and the leather in my car, as soon as I got onto this product it cleared it right up! And nothing to date has ever done that! The only issue I see is that you do need to keep using it to sustain no breakouts, it runs out fast and is expensive. BUT IT WORKS. Very happy.</li>
    <li> this really works for me, in controlling body acne. the only problem is it&#x27;s a little bit expensive to use regularly. one bottle doesn&#x27;t really last long.</li>
    <li> This product was fantastic, not too harsh.  Women, use at night with your old tee shirts, it will destroy your bras!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it has really started working. When I first used it, it made me break out WORSE actually but from my experience with other acne products I know this is a common thing. I use it almost everyday and I can now see a real difference. I don&#x27;t think its a miracle worker by any means but it has helped.</li>
    <li> Used it for 6 weeks, did not really make my backne better, but also not worst so maybe that says something. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy again. Got the same results as the Neutrogena spray in the orange bottle and that one had similar ingredients at half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne on my back for many years.  It&#x27;s such a hard place to clean well.  This product makes it easy.  It&#x27;s easy to spray in the hard to reach places.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I am very pleased with the results.  I am thankful for finding out about this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> terrible product didnt do anything will not buy at all...wasted my money ...dont buy this product ...i had no change in my skin condition it felt like i was applying water on my body no action or reaction... poor didnt work for me... my opinion..</li>
    <li> I got this item and the spray did not work...it squirted instead of sprayed. It would squirt in a single line like a water gun. It was definitely not mist like. Wasted my money..</li>
    <li> I did notice it seems to help a little bit but not as much as I was looking for.  I do like the fact it is not harsh or dries out my skin.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product in combination with Butt Acne Clearing Lotion for butt &amp; body breakouts that I experience.  It really helps keep body breakouts at bay.</li>
    <li> I have used several products to help with my back acne. However, many of the products did not work. I used this together with the Neutrogena Grapefruit Body wash. The combination seems to be helping. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my breakouts have virtually stopped. The only problem is that the bottle is almost done. Good thing I bought 2. I suggest you do the same thing as well.</li>
    <li> The spray has worked quite well. It&#x27;s not as drying as some sprays, which allows me to use it more often. The spray can be used upside down and comes out in a nice fine mist. It doesn&#x27;t burn your nostrils as much as other body sprays (like the Glytone, which has a higher salicylic percentage). Recommended and will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> one of the best products out today!  it smells great, it makes my skin feel awesome, and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;oh and the shipping is CRAZY FAST!</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray, combined with their body wash, for years now. A friendly warning - using both products together will dry out your skin so only use together for severe breakouts and skin problems ... try to slowly ween yourself off to just using one or the other or alternating between the two, as I do there days.&lt;br /&gt;My beautiful sleek, olive skin comes at a price and that is occasional back breakouts .. this has gone on for years, ever since I was a teenager. Thankfully, these two products exist as they save me from embarrassing spots and black heads - over time, I think the health of my skin actually improved as I find myself using them less and less often. As I said, I alternate between the two and either use the wash or the spray - writing this review made me realize that my skin is actually much clearer and I no longer need to use both together. They are both pricey but I now buy each about every six months and use very little ... so not a bad investment for a beautiful back skin.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years or so on an off and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;helps control breakouts and prevent future ones.</li>
    <li> I use this once a day after I take a shower in the morning and it is seriously the only product that has ever cleared up the acne on my back. I&#x27;ve tried prescription topicals, medicated body washes, and oral treatments and this is by far the most effective product out of all of them. Also, the 360 spray is helpful in reaching my back. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Some people have reviewed this as working for their skin, but I think its too basic and week.&lt;br /&gt;The acid level is only 0.5%. This level might actually be better for people with sensitive skin, but if you often use 2% or higher sylical acid, then this product is over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have been using it for 2 months with no improvement!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for just a week and I see results already. It has a fresh scent, which refreshes my skin at every use. I definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically take the time to leave reviews for products, but this one deserves it.  For the past few years I&#x27;ve been getting a little acne here and there on my back.  That was tolerable.  Then the past year I started getting a rash /acne type of breakout on my chest.  Can you say gross, horrible, and frustrating.  Any woman know that most tops have some kind of scoop or v-neck... ugh!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything from scrubs to cleansers and even the osculating scrub brushes.  Nothing worked.  Then I went to Orlando on vacation and oh boy the humidity did my chest in.  I don&#x27;t  know if it was a rash or acne but it was awful.  So I continued my search and came across this product. My face typically gets a dry rash if I use any kind of Salicylic Acid but at this point I was willing to try anything. OMG!! My chest is all but cleared up and I have zero breakouts on my back.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks!!!  I spray this on each and every morning without fail.  It does have a medicinal scent to it upon first spraying it on.  But it quickly dissipates and you can&#x27;t smell it at all. I don&#x27;t find it drying either.  This may be because my chest and back may be slightly more oily.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this miracle spray. I will be buying this as soon as it runs out.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and you won&#x27;t regret it believe me! Probably one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Bought this to treat some back breakouts. It&#x27;s fine- sort of the equivalent of using a salicylic acid toner. Nice but not super effective. The upside down pump is definitely a plus, making it easier to apply. It did last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Murad is too pricey for &#x27;nice&#x27; in my opinion. About the same price as a dermatologist copay, which ended up being WAY more effective.</li>
    <li> Sealed well. I usually get this at Sephora but it&#x27;s much cheaper on here for the same product. Really helps to keep my cystic back acne at bay. Must use every day though. Easy spray nozzle. Doesn&#x27;t clog often.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have tried everything under the sun, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that after using this once a day for a week, I saw dramatic results.  It was truly amazing, and I only need to use it about twice a week to keep blemishes under control.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It helped clear up acne on the first 2 weeks. But I noticed new break-out after the first 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Been using for about three weeks now and not super impressed with results.  But in all fairness to the product, I had a pretty severe case of shoulder acne with significant hyperpigmentation.  One thing I did notice is that skin is noticeably smoother.  I will definitely continue to use and purchase atleast once more when this bottle runs out.  Now if only I could find something to diminish these dark spots.  *sighs*</li>
    <li> My life saver to back &amp; chest acne since 2011. Still going strong. I use it once daily in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love that you can spray it from any angle and it doesn&#x27;t mess up, especially when trying to get your back.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, in the sense that it made my skin feel very fresh and clean. That being said, I saw no difference whatsoever in my acne.</li>
    <li> I have tried several remedies for acne on the back of my legs. Never heard of anyone else with this problem.... this stuff really works.  It took about 4 weeks, but its about 60% better,and I will continue using it. I am confident it will be mostly gone in another 4 weeks.  A bit costly but worth it!!</li>
    <li> It works great!!! I saw results within a few days.</li>
    <li> The seal on this bottle was broken, and the bottle looked cheap and filthy like it was sitting on the shelf for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray was no more effective than locally bought at the grocery store with the same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle could spray upside down, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing about this overpriced medicine I can think of.</li>
    <li> It all started about a month ago. I was bored, browsing youtube. Somehow I started watching videos on how to get rid of acne. Eventually I stumbled across a video that described this murad spray as basically a miracle. I was a bit skeptical then I came here and checked out the reviews. I was happy for two reasons. One, a lot of reviews say they bought this for 40-50 bucks, and I bought it for $25. Second, everyone said it works! Well, not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start off with the good. The bottle is a miracle in itself. You can spray at any angle, and unlike other sprays, it really works upside down and doesn&#x27;t start getting leaky and losing pressure. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, you can breath. Some products gives you a burning sensation but this one doesn&#x27;t. This one actually makes me feel a cooling sensation, so that&#x27;s interesting, however since it&#x27;s winter, it makes me colder. But let me say this. The product didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me. I think the only thing it did was lighten up my face a little MAYBE (I sprayed my face 2 times with this). Did absolutely nothing for my back and chest. I did spray a lot, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin at all. The product is pretty much empty, and combined I&#x27;ve used it for probably 10-15 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, had I not bought this, I would not have found out about another product. I came here to write a review a while ago, then read another users review, that basically wrote how I felt. It doesn&#x27;t work. The user said he used &#x27;Glytone&#x27; and I looked it up. It looked good, so I bought it. I have been using the glytone spray for 10 days now, and all the light acne I had on my body is GONE! The acne that has been on my body for 2 years, GONE in only 10 days!! a miracle. The darker acne on my body is starting to lighten up, and I&#x27;m sure it will be gone within another 10 days, and by the next 20 days, i&#x27;m sure my body will be spotless. I do use a lot of it though, 10 days and I&#x27;m left with 1/4 of a bottle. However, the spray is the same price as this Murad one, and has twice as much liquid in it, and is 4x as powerful. I couldn&#x27;t recommend that product any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck in your acne battleice as this Murad one, and has twice as much liquid in it, and is 4x as powerful. I couldn&#x27;t recommend that product any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck in your acne battle</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be some miracle spray that will make all of your body blemishes vanish instantly. I will say that it definitely did help the existing blemishes to heal and prevent new ones from forming, but it&#x27;s still not 100% gone. This treatment slowly but surely is helping my skin. It&#x27;s a larger dose of salicylic acid and will have a cooling sensation on your skin. It is trying to repair your skin so whatever you do, do NOT fuss/pick at any of the blemishes or it will become very irritated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: It&#x27;s been almost 6 months since I&#x27;ve used this product (every other day right after I shower). I&#x27;m on my second bottle because I have to admit that my back is pretty much CLEAR now and has been for that past few months... I will never stop using this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and I break out all over quite a bit. This stuff made me break out twice as bad, it was terrible. It sprayed nicely - it sprays a lot at once - but it was just bad for my skin.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the ingredient salicylic acid. The product aids in drying up acne break outs and prevents reoccurrence.  Be careful not to use too much because it caused peeling, Used in moderation, the product does what it promises, clears and prevents blemishes and skin breakouts.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this spray. I had a problem with back acne and this cleared it right up. I have tried body washes, spot treatments, and many other things, but this stuff finally did the trick.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this instead of the Glytone 2% Back Acne Spray. It doesn&#x27;t work on me, but I&#x27;ll keep it for an astringent.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy the Glytone. . .that clears up my back acne right away.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time and the packaging was fine, but the bottle does not spray. It does not work and I am unable to open to poor into another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have moderate to severe back/body acne. I&#x27;ve used this product as directed, starting off with one application and working it up to 2-3 times daily but haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. It does have a &#x27;cool&#x27; feeling on the skin that&#x27;s really nice but it has done nothing for my acne problem. Not a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for years. It&#x27;s perfect on the body, especially if you work out and wear your hair down (dancing, performing, etc.)  You can spray this on your back to avoid possible break outs caused by hair products or creams mixing with &#x27;workout sweat&#x27;. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you can spray this upside down to reach the back easily, but i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping.  It&#x27;s not making it worse, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
</ol>
