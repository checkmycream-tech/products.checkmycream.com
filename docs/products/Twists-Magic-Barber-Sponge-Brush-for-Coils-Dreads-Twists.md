      <li>This sponge have their hair really curly with many twists in it right away.</li>
      <li>And worked very well!!</li>
      <li>I bought this sponge to hopefully give a better twist or curl to the section on 4C hair, however,  this sponge literally took OUT my natural curls and made the hair strait!</li>

      <li>cool and exactly as in the description</li>

      <li>Thanks for the reasonable price/free shipping!!</li>
      <li>My three sons use this more than they used to brush their hair with a regular brush.</li>
      <li>It works and looks exactly like it is on the picture.</li>
      <li>It broke apart within the first week of use.</li>
      <li>It works for the first couple of uses, after that the material deteriorates and falls in your hair.</li>
      <li>This product came seven days earlier than expected , which is great.</li>
      <li>This company shipping was really fast and their sponges are more affordable than the actual beauty supply store</li>
      <li>Kinky/Curly hair is simply too fine per strand to adhere to the holes in order to twist.</li>
      <li>The sponge holes are deep enough for longer hair which I love!</li>
      <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>and I really recommend it to anyone who wants lil twist in there head</li>
      <li>The sponge really does work.</li>
      <li>Because I use it gently over my head, I probably won&#x27;t need a new one for a while.</li>
      <li>maybe the more expensive ones hold up better</li>
      <li>cost doesn&#x27;t live up to the life expectancy of the product.</li>
      <li>It works, I need to reorder a new one.</li>
      <li>Might have to order a new one in maybe another 4 or 5 months.</li>
      <li>I usually describe my hair to people as something similar to a dandelion; it&#x27;s thick but blows so freely in the wind that you would think it&#x27;s gonna fly off like when you blow the fuzz off a dandelion)</li>
      <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; and I live this for our natural hair (3c  and 4a4b texture</li>
      <li>One has a small Afro, high top fad, and low haircut</li>
      <li>My 15 year old loves this sponge.</li>
      <li>Worked alright so far.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what&#x27;s expected</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t last long and wasn&#x27;t used very much.  </li>
      <li>I am not saying that this product does not work &#x27;in general&#x27; but because it claims to work on ALL hair types, but doesn&#x27;t...</li>

    <li> My son love this product</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; and I live this for our natural hair (3c  and 4a4b texture) we use it with kinky kurly custard</li>

    <li> Product works well.  Simple to use.</li>
    <li> Very nice product ! Worked as advertised !</li>
    <li> Great curls.  It does works.</li>
    <li> Who knew my son could get stylish twists for his flattop.  Shipping and purchase process was as expected.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  Product is great.</li>
    <li> I love the sponge. It works very well. I would purchase again. Good price too</li>
    <li> Very reasonable, should come with instructions but u tube helped with that.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what&#x27;s expected</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shipped really fast. Better than nudred!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered the Sponges for my son who is doing the twist curl look. The sponge holes are deep enough for longer hair which I love! This company shipping was really fast and their sponges are more affordable than the actual beauty supply store so I brought two. Sponges were vacuum packed so they won&#x27;t lose shape. Thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered for my son he loves it.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old loves this sponge. He uses it after showing and it twist his hair just the way he likes it.</li>
    <li> Good product, if used with the right styling products.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use!!</li>
    <li> They claim that this works on ALL hair types but this is NOT true. I have a really soft (thick in volume but thin in texture), kinky/curky 3C/4A natural hair that is too soft to usually hold curls (my hair may actually be closer to wavy than curly at the the roots but I can comb or finger roll the ends at the 3C sections; the crown is a very frizzy 4A that does not curl as easily and puffs at the sign of even the most minute amount of moisture) I bought this sponge to hopefully give a better twist or curl to the section on 4C hair, however,  this sponge literally took OUT my natural curls and made the hair strait! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is SOooOo soft, it was basically impossible for the holes to even capture the hair in order to twist it because the hair moves to easily (if in afro form I usually describe my hair to people as something similar to a dandelion; it&#x27;s thick but blows so freely in the wind that you would think it&#x27;s gonna fly off like when you blow the fuzz off a dandelion) I can only assume that this sponge works primarily and most effectively on on kinky/COILY hair. Kinky/Curly hair is simply too fine per strand to adhere to the holes in order to twist. I am not saying that this product does not work &#x27;in general&#x27; but because it claims to work on ALL hair types, but doesn&#x27;t... my 1 star is a result of false advertising</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected!!! And worked very well!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. My three sons use this more than they used to brush their hair with a regular brush. This sponge have their hair really curly with many twists in it right away. One has a small Afro, high top fad, and low haircut and this works good on all of their hairstyles. My husband asked if they got a S curl they had so many twists and curls from this sponge brush. This is a life saver.</li>
    <li> It works and looks exactly like it is on the picture.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not way I thought it was going to do from seeing YouTube but it fun to play with but it pulled out some of my hair.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for my biracial son&#x27;s hair. He was disappointed and so was I.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. Nice, easy way to start dreads or twist.</li>
    <li> Does just what I expected it to do!</li>
    <li> Need to try original one.</li>
    <li> its really big but works like a charm A++</li>
    <li> this is dope. Got it on time and it works great!</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected... I love it and I really recommend it to anyone who wants lil twist in there head</li>
    <li> a little too big for the normal size hand but works well</li>
    <li> Thanks loved the purchase.</li>
    <li> I saw a You Tube video of this product and I knew it would be perfect for my grandson, I was right. This sponge works just the way it says and he loves it.  Great tool for short natural hair and great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Worked alright so far.</li>
    <li> works pretty good for the price. maybe the more expensive ones hold up better but I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for the past couple weeks and it started falling apart. after use I&#x27;ve noticed that there&#x27;s always tiny pieces of sponge in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. Hope this stays available for longer so I can order another one if/when my new one gets worn in a few months. Because I use it gently over my head, I probably won&#x27;t need a new one for a while. Thanks for the reasonable price/free shipping!!</li>
    <li> This product came seven days earlier than expected , which is great. The reason I put four is because it gives you a little dread type twist instead of a curl</li>
    <li> very satisfied with purchase and is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> cost doesn&#x27;t live up to the life expectancy of the product.</li>
    <li> The only thing we didnt like is as youre twisting, there are little particles from the brush everywhere. Other than that my son loves it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and work fine</li>
    <li> Works just like it supposed to!!!</li>
    <li> Works great my wife love the look it gives mi</li>
    <li> Good sponge, and yes it does kinda fall apart but it&#x27;s a sponge and I do realize it doesn&#x27;t last forever. However, my son is still using his and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> A waste of anyone&#x27;s money</li>
    <li> does an excellent job on my sons hair. It didn&#x27;t last long and wasn&#x27;t used very much.  We had to purchase a second one locally. This one less expensive than the one at a local store.  it does the job, but if you are going to use it everyday you may want to purchase 2.  We didn&#x27;t use it often and it wore out quickly.</li>
    <li> Ummm, I don&#x27;t know that I would ever buy this again. I bought it for my husband after he saw it on you-tube. He followed the directions, he surfed through videos, and attempted this multiple times and did not get the same effect that he was seeing with other people. He wasn&#x27;t completely dissatisfied, but wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with it either.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect I thought the sponge was gonna be a little bigger but it&#x27;s not a problem it still curls my hair perfectly and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This did not work as described on my hair.</li>
    <li> The sponge really does work. My hair gets twisted up, but is not knappy. I love it!</li>
    <li> works just like it say&#x27;s Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for a 4C TWA but if your hair is just a little but long you will not get the defined curls you are looking for. I have a tapered cut so I like to use it for my hair in the back.</li>
    <li> If your looking for thicker twists in your hair this is definitely the brush for you! They are thick but look good for most people with African(Afro) style hair! If your looking for thinner twist get the tornado coiler but it takes longer to twist up your hair I recommend this because it gets the job done faster</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It curls my long and short hair. So awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Not as exspensive as the ones for sale in beauty supply stores and works just as good.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my hair . I ended up selling it to a barbershop</li>
    <li> I love my coils I look so good each and every day</li>
    <li> Not thes best product, have used better sponge brushes!</li>
    <li> This product did not work. It broke apart within the first week of use.</li>
    <li> cool and exactly as in the description</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Makes the perfect size coils.</li>
    <li> It works, I need to reorder a new one. My son loves it</li>
    <li> Works very well, I use this on my son and fiance&#x27;s hair and they love it as well. They get compliments on how nice their hair looks all the time. You have to rub the sponge in circular motion around the head for best results.</li>
    <li> It works for the first couple of uses, after that the material deteriorates and falls in your hair. What a mess! You get what you pay for--a cheap knockoff product. I will have to bite the bullet and INVEST in the original Nudred.</li>
    <li> Works well. Twist look amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great, shipped fast &amp; works! However, it didn&#x27;t have the TWISTS logo on it &amp; seems to be deteriorating little by little. Might have to order a new one in maybe another 4 or 5 months.</li>
