    <li> On a whim I tried it in my hair.  I&#x27;ve always done a wave, and always wound up with an itchy scalp or flakes from other products.  This does double duty as a moisturizer and a styling product- with the added bonus of being far cheaper than either.  Less messy.  Fewer flakes.  Great hold.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry elbows and hands too.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with I love it.</li>
    <li> Soft Shea Butter. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> my order seem to be muchie not hard when i got my order it had a crack in  the container so im not happy with that i was hoping for more of</li>
    <li> Been using shea butter for over 10 years for myself, my children and grand children.  I love how it makes my skin feel moist and healthy.  We use it not just on our skin as a moisturizer but also on cuts and scrapes, eczema and hair.  This shea butter has been filtered so you won&#x27;t find any bark or shell pieces in the shea butter.  Great for naturally helping to get rid of old scars and to keep fresh scrapes and cuts heal faster.  Shea butter does not clog your pours and is good people who have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use regular lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter you may need to mix shea butter with something else to make it last the entire day. Otherwise you will find that you need to apply shea butter a few times during the winter.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,excellent prices,prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Nice to have a place to order this product.</li>
    <li> Best product used and the price is very appropriate and I used ..mund I notice the difference on my skin from the freshness and smoothness</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE GREATEST! I love Shea butter for the winter months.  I mix mine with equal parts coconut oil and apricot oil. This concoction helps keep my skin moist over the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> the prodect seep in the carton</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s so smooth and I sent it to my dad who uses for his hair, hands and horse saddle.</li>
    <li> I love shea butter. I use it for my whole body. I recommend this product for anyone who need a butter lotion or even a better leave-in conditioner. Sometimes the smell annoys me but I look pass that. The price is very good,too.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Exactly what I needed :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this product online for the 1st time and I was pleased. It arrived in about a week in good condition and the smell and consistency was exactly what I wanted. I plan to order a larger quantity on my next order. This seller is better than the locals I have purchased Shea butter from. I hope they continue on with good customer service.</li>
    <li> Love it with my hair or my body</li>
    <li> Good texture smells great and makes skin soft</li>
    <li> I love it!! I will buy it again and again!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product ever sixe I had my baby. The African Shea Butter was like a magic eraser go fading my stretch marks...</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Great I been looking for this size at an affordable price and now I did n love it</li>
    <li> The product is as listed and it was what I had ordered. Although I am upset at the fact that the container was shattered in several places. I took the tub out of the box it came in which had some packing peanuts to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; the container. The bottom part of the plastic container was shattered and upon taking off the lid the lip shattered as well. I am going to transfer the shea butter to my own container because this is obviously a very cheap plastic. The plastic pieces were not hard to pick out and the shea butter is still usable. I am just disappointed in the packaging. USPS can get rough with some stuff so products should be better protected.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture and how I imagined. Will do business more business.</li>
    <li> I love the african shea butter i just wish i was able to buy it by the gallons</li>
    <li> Its not as smooth and creamy as I would like. Its &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;. Not sure if I would recommend. If it were for the price I would definitely do but not so sure for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Okay product, buy smells bad</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product often from various vendors. This one meets my needs and appears to work as well as any others that I&#x27;ve ordered. One of the things that I highly recommend it for - women - after shaving legs, underarms, bikini area - apply and eliminate all irritation - no razor bumps, no itching and no irritation. It works for me. Plus, it&#x27;s natural - no unsafe, harmful materials.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it. The shea butter was just as described soft and smooth. I got the product earlier than expected. I will be purchasing from them again.I forgot to mention how awesome the price is.</li>
    <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
