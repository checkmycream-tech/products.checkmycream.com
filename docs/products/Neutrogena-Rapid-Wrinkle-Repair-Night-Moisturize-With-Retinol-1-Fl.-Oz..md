<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great stuff, not greasy</li>
    <li> This is one of only a few over-the-counter wrinkle moisturizers that contain retinol (which helps repair wrinkles). Have used this for years. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel smooth</li>
    <li> At first it stings, make sure to use it sparingly while your skin gets used to it. But after just a few weeks of use it makes wrinkles disappear!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking refreshed. I&#x27;ve started the daytime Neutrogena companion this week and love that also.</li>
    <li> cheaper than walgreens! great effect both on me and my mother.</li>
    <li> Have seen great results with this product! I am 60+ years old and just LOVE it! Anyone who has doubts should give it a try ... the price will astound you!</li>
    <li> Retinol that works, in a nice smooth formula, and without over-drying your skin. I love both the day (with SPF)  and night products, and use both. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34, so am using this primarily for discoloration and marks. I toggle between this and the &amp;#34;Rapid Tone Corrector.&amp;#34; Both are good moisturizers and absorb nicely. After about 2.5 months of use, I see some slight fading of freckles and a nice evening of skin tone. (4 stars as opposed to 5 because the freckles on my nose haven&#x27;t faded completely despite regular use; freckles, I think, are very hard to get rid of.) Acne marks vanish fairly quickly when using this product. For wrinkles, I&#x27;m primarily using this as a preventative product (along with Lubriderm SPF 15 moisturizing lotion), so I can&#x27;t comment too much on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t be certain about the results, if any.  However, it isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts a long time.  When I awaken in the morning, I don&#x27;[t glow or look moisturized, but I notice that under the eye area, there is less lines and no puffiness.  The price is fantastic and since it contains sufficient retinol, will stick with it for a few more months.</li>
    <li> This gave me a rash and burned my skin terribly.  I use lots of their products but this was awful.</li>
    <li> I really like Neutrogena products but I am particularly impressed with this one. It has a very nice scent to it and it absorbs very fast. I have actually noticed reduced forehead lines. I am an anti-aging junkie but am very careful with how much money I spend on them.   I am very satisfied with this one. I am going to buy the Day one which has spf 30. :)</li>
    <li> This product works well as a retinol product to use 1-3 times a week.  The packaging is stable, and the price isn&#x27;t too crazy, at least compared to the Department store stuff, and compared to similar formulations at the drugstore.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and see some brightening in my complexion. While I don&#x27;t recommend using any lotion thinking that it will perform miracles, studies have shown that retinol does actually have an effect on skin&#x27;s appearance, and everything I&#x27;ve read suggest using a retinol product once a week.  This is a good one.</li>
    <li> Works almost as well as Retin-A but does not require a prescription. Contains retinol (Vitamin A) as the active ingredient. No irritation of any significance. I highly recommend this product, it costs much less than an appointment at a dermatologist, and works.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I&#x27;m sensitive to everything and I didn&#x27;t break out, smells great, and not greasy. Will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, will buy more.You cannot beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, applies easily with no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but I can&#x27;t say I noticed a difference in wrinkles, but I like it enough to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it says &#x27;night&#x27;, I also like to wear it under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May still have wrinkles, but my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
    <li> With a name like Rapid Wrinkle Repair, I expected to notice results in 8 - 12 weeks. I didn&#x27;t notice any change. :(</li>
    <li> I feel naked if I don&#x27;t have it on when I go to bed.  I believe it works great!</li>
    <li> fast service. and I liked the product.</li>
    <li> I tend to have somewhat sensitive skin so was cautious about using this at first in case it gave me a rash.  I&#x27;m pleased to say it did not, but it DID give me dewy-looking skin with a very mild scent.  I like the pump for its hygienic dispensing of the cream, but wish the bottle were clear so I could see how much I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got pretty good skin for a 55-year old but figured if this product could help at all with my expression lines I&#x27;d be thrilled.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made much of a difference with lines, but my skin does look fresher looking.  I think for an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product it&#x27;s reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will consider purchasing when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004D2C4Q4 Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night, 1 ounce]] makes me look younger, and when I look younger I feel younger. The only problem is that it is pricey. As a result I&#x27;ll get more wrinkles from worrying about the cost, and I&#x27;ll need more product.     According to the description 100% of the women who used it had improvement in wrinkles. Count me in that group.    The bottle is attractive and the spray works well. The company is trustworthy. If I can save enough money, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bottle of this special night repair formula.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks, hoping to make sure I use it continuously before I determine if it seemed to work.  I have been using it on the crows feet area, with my darker skin, I have a few lines.  And, now, they seem to be filled in and/or so very faint.  That tells me the product is working.  I am now concentrating on the under eye area.  An ingredient that makes it work is Retinol SA.      The smell is clean, the cream goes on smooth.  But since I have a few age spots, I have been focusing the cream on that area too.  I have not noticed too much disappearing, but will work on that area more extensively.     The small bottle is a pump action, therefore you cannot overuse it.  It works well under makeup too.  I have applied it mostly during the day, free of makeup.  At night I used it too, but never consistently at night.      This is excellent!   Rizzo</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve also bought the day cream with sunscreen and the eye cream. Thoses 3 products are all I need. My skin is firmer - especially my neck. No more \\&quot;Turkey Neck\\&quot;!!Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After seeing commerical after commercial about this product, and using Loreal Products for years, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  First thing was the packaging.  There is almost 2 inches of unnecessary packaging with the box which makes it look like it is a bigger producct than it is.  Then, you see a glass bottle of THICK glass which again, makes it seem like there is alot of product.  However, when I emptied the bottle just to see how much was in there, there was less than a palm full of product.  I decided then and there I was not going to pay $20 for less than a palm full of product.  But I wanted to try it, so I filled the bottle up with lotion and and tried the product in my palm so I could see what it does in the 7 days.  Well, I am only 40 years old and have very minimal wrinkles but crows feet around my eyes and the longer wrinkle around my jowls, and I have used this product for 12 days now and do not see any difference at all.  I took before pics and have been taking daily after pics to see any difference and there is absolutely none. It has a nice texture and smell, but that isn&#x27;t what I paid $20 bucks for.  I want results!  Obviously this product isn&#x27;t going to give them to me, so I am going back to my Loreal products where I get my money&#x27;s worth.  I was duped with the packaging and I was duped with the product.  So I am returning the bottle to the store where I bought it at.  I am disgusted with such a product that promises to reduce fine lines and wrinkles in 7 days and it does absolutely nothing after almost 2 weeks.  Not worth the price!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice night time moisturizer, just not great - at least for me.  My skin is combination and doesn&#x27;t do well with many products out there...even make up is a problem.  I normally use another national brand (they brag about low price and good benefit) which doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin.  Definitely add a star if you like Neutrogena products and they have worked well for yourself in the past.  This product smells nice, and makes the skin feel smooth.  Hey, moisture is always good when it comes to skin!</li>
    <li> I was very prepared to be skeptical of this product, but I must admit I did notice a positive difference in my skin within seven days.  I like the little pump bottle that dispenses just the right amount of lotion, but dislike the inability to see how much is left in the bottle.  As others observed, it also seems as if the bottle is designed to appear as if it contains more than an ounce of lotion.  I also found the lotion to be slightly irritating if used on a daily basis, but this resolved when using it on alternating days.  All in all, I was satisfied with this and may seek out the day lotion to accompany it.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my partner (because of course I don&#x27;t have any lines, ha ha) and found that it greatly reduced the appearance (depth) of the lines on his forehead immediately.  Not sure that the effect is cumulative after multiple applications - my theory is that the way it works is it just \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; the lines with a clear micro substance that makes the lines appear shallower and thus less visible to the human eye.  It has a pleasant scent and while not inexpensive, does what it says.  Will you look 20 again?  No, but you&#x27;ll look \\&quot;good for your age\\&quot; with this cream.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night product made my skin flake!  I have normal, but a bit sensitive skin, and I am pale and have always had good, clean skin (barely any acne ever)...I used this product for 3 days (applying as directed in the evenings), and on the 4rth day, a good sized area of skin became really dry and flaky!  I was moisturing like normal (morning and evening), so this was a bit of a surprise: I stopped using the product and a few days afterwards (with lots of care and moisturizer), the red, irritated/flaky area healed.  I waited about 7 weeks then gave the product another try, with the same exact result!  After about 6 days of using the product (applying 3 times, every other night), it caused a DIFFERENT area of my skin to get all dry and flaky.  I stopped using the product at this point; I hadn&#x27;t seen any amazing results in the small chunks of time before the product caused the issues, and the unhappy skin areas were just not worth going through to get the minimal results I read about from other&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the skinny: this stuff smells nice, I like the consistency, and the tingling after using the product makes you feel it&#x27;s doing something, but this product is just NOT good for those with sensitive skin: it may work for others, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I received this item and it came broken. The pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and did notice a difference in using it for a couple of weeks. It wasn&#x27;t noticeable but for close examination, but I believe there was a difference. The feel of the product is very nice and luxurious, as is the smell. The one problem that I experienced was that my skin felt a little dryer than normal and broke out a bit. This could just be living in a dry climate and my skin adapting. Despite the dryness, I did like how my skin felt in waking up the next day. This is a nice product!</li>
    <li> After four months, I have seen no results whatsoever...really dissappointed; used the product morning and night, but not seeing any results, not even slight ones. Expected more from the Neutrogena folks.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have lived in the Caribbean for the past six years, so am quite concerned about sun damage and wrinkles. I regularly use Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin line (day cream with spf, night cream, and eye cream) which contains some retinol and is easy to find in the few drug stores on island.    I did really like the Rapid Wrinkle Repair night formula. It was lightweight and smelled pleasant. The first few nights I had a bit of irritation, but nothing scary.     Now I don&#x27;t love this enough to make a special ordeal of getting it. The Healthy Skin products work as well for normal use. However, I do plan to buy this when I am back living in NY.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really works, and quickly! I was concerned about possible redness and peeling, but since I began using it every other day and only switched to everyday use after a week, my skin didn&#x27;t suffer any problems... unless younger-looking skin is a problem, that is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve jumped around from night cream to night cream, and decided to give this a try.  I have to say, I am impressed with the results nearly 2 months after my first use (I&#x27;m still using the original bottle!).  My forehead looks youthful and almost wrinkle free, my skin looks more even and well rested.  This product feels a little bit greasy when you first put it on, but I got over this quickly.  I plan to purchase another bottle when this one runs out.  The one thing I&#x27;m not sure of is that another age spot appeared while using this product, whether it&#x27;s the product or just my skin, I don&#x27;t know.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This didnt do anything for me. Saw no change, not after a week, not after two, not after a month.</li>
    <li> Oh my, I recently lost 40 lbs and all of a sudden, I have laugh lines!  It&#x27;s no laughing matter but I guess that is what happens when there&#x27;s no fat to fill in the skin.  So I decided to try this night cream to see if it would help me out.   So far, so good.  I feel like they are less visible, granted, they are not very deep.  There is a slight scent which I found very pleasant.  The downside is that the bottle is a bit small.  Also this product does contain Retinol so make sure you are using sunscreen daily and be careful not to use in areas that you will wax.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels and I it has made a difference with the wrinkles under my eyes and forehead</li>
    <li> When I first used this product my skin felt great until the next morning my face and neck were peeling and  my sensitive skin really irritated so I waited a few days and tried it again, as the package said to do. It felt like a chemical peel and burned quite a bit but I had to hang in there to see if this would really work. I used it every other day and now it&#x27;s up to every day. I love Neutrogena products but this surprised me. My skin is very sensitive and it had to go through a major &#x27;exfoliation process&#x27; before this product really started working. So just be aware if your skin is sensitive you may have a similar reaction but it really does make my skin look younger and softer. I hope you don&#x27;t have the same pre-experience I did but it could have been from products that I used prior to this one not sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year old female and most people think I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m lucky considering the amount of tanning I did!). With that being said I have done very significant sun damage to my chest, it&#x27;s very upsetting when I see what I have done to myself with regard to tanning. This is the one and only product I can say has made a huge difference. In using it about 5 times on my chest, the results are astounding! it made a 100% difference in my skin. I use it on my face at night as well (I never tanned my face thank God!) and I have to say it makes your skin feel like silk, fine lines diminish and skin looks amazing. It&#x27;s worth a try, IMO it is really the only skin product I can say really does work.</li>
    <li> I noticed a slight stinging on my skin, but it does leave my skin smooth in the morning. I am not normally liking Retinol, but this is a decent cream if your skin is not highly sensitive, as mine is.</li>
    <li> I prefer &amp;#34;neutrogenia Oil free moisture.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not sticky like this one, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. The other also Works as sunblock in daytime, and has highest rating for moisturizers by consumer reports.</li>
    <li> I was using the Regenerist Serum and ran out so I decided to give this product a try.  I noticed the difference in my skin much more quickly than when I used the Regenerist serum.  My skin is a lot softer.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to do something baout my face.  This stuff is wonderful.  I&#x27;ll keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I am giving the product 3 stars because I have only used it 3 weeks.  I see absolutely no difference in any fine lines but I do like the way my face feels, the best that I can describe that is smooth and moisturized.  Maybe with time I will see some of the results that others have posted.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took Neutrogena so long to come out with their line of anti-aging, and age repair lotions, it&#x27;s only a natural that they should! I have been using this product every night after cleaning, for about a year, and I love it!</li>
    <li> I like this so much.  I have it on auto-ship, and hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  It smells somewhat of sunscreen, but I like it.  It is smooth, lightweight and the pump bottle is my favorite type of dispenser.  Does it remove wrinkles?  Well, unless you can turn back the clock, I&#x27;m not sure anything does, really.  But one can hope!</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product on Amazon  ( it was on sale at my local .Savon and I bought three bottles.)  I have many lines and a few deep wrinkles. I do not expect miracles but do expect  some softening  of the lines and wrinkles  even just a 1% improvement.. I got nothing. I asked a dear friend of similar vintage to give it a try. She is a dermatologist  and  said  that if she found some improvement  she would happily  recommend  it to her  patients who did not want to try any cosmetic procedure.  Her results were the same as mine.  She gave a bottle to her receptionist  who is also in the low 60s.  Her results were the same as ours, i.e. there were NO results.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old with slight wrinkles and very dry skin.  The past few years I have noticed wrinkles developing above my upper lip and tiny wrinkles under my eyes.  I hit the wrinkle creams to begin treatment on these areas while they were still small problems.  I have been loyal to Olay Regenerist, mainly because of its moisturizing qualities and the smell of the creams- I love them!  When Neutrogena came out with their \\&quot;see results in 1 week\\&quot; claim, I decided to give Neutrogena a try. I have been using the rapid repair for about a month and have noticed a burning sensation on my face each time I apply it, and the burning sensation lasts for an hour or more after application.  I am not sure if it is the retinol itself or if it is the glycolic acid or some other agent but it is uncomfortable enough that I decided not to use it any longer. Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is good procuct</li>
    <li> Worked great in the beginning however two weeks later I had a tight dry feel to my face and it looked sunburned! I still love Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to rate it</li>
    <li> I am his wife here, we use the same account. Well I am 30 years old and do not really have lots of wrinkles, but have some fine wrinkles. Moreover my skin is not as tight as it used to be, so i read some reviews and bought this product. Its been over a month since i am using this and i would say my skin doesn&#x27;t look dull and looks better and regaining its elasticity. About the wrinkles, well mine were very fine and i can not even notice them now. What more i can ask for.</li>
    <li> As a night cream, this retinol-based lotion is a good choice, goes on well (I don&#x27;t notice the scent), and my face feels very moisturized but not oily in the am.  It does seem to fade early wrinkles a bit, which is nice for those of us who&#x27;d like to minimize them as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin&#x27;s needs have definitely changed from a decade ago-- even five years ago, I may not have been able to use this cream often (active/oily skin).  Now that my skin is not so oily (Ok, probably it qualifies as \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin now), this cream is nice and performs well.  If you&#x27;re not able to afford, say, Remede (works well, but very pricey), this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This is the first cream I&#x27;ve found since an old one I used was discontinued that actually makes my skin appear rejuvenated. I am mid-30&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the fine wrinkles under my eyes which tempted me to give it only 4 stars, but my overall skin is more smooth and more youthful. I have very sensitive skin, so I use this every other night. I alternate it with Say Yes to Blueberries. At first, I tried using it nightly and it irritated my face, but every other night is fine. I stopped using it on my neck because it didn&#x27;t work the same as on my face. On my face, especially at first, it&#x27;s like it was exfoliating it, but my neck wasn&#x27;t doing this evenly and was irritated. I think the skin on our neck is different that on our face. I also noticed my pink rosacea-like skin tone is less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;I wear nothing less than 30spf sunscreen if I think I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a decent amount of time which isn&#x27;t too often. Otherwise, my make up is spf 17, which I hope is enough when I&#x27;m mostly indoors. I almost feel like I don&#x27;t have to wear make up anymore if it wasn&#x27;t for my dark circles. I choose to use the night cream instead of the day cream because the type of sunscreen in the day cream is usually very irritating to my skin. I only use natural sunscreen. I have noticed my skin to be a bit more oily since I started using this and the occasional tiny pimple. I would think it would do the opposite, but maybe because the dead skin is not sitting on top of the pores...don&#x27;t know. I hope this just means my skin thinks it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s teens again..I can hope right! I have now been using it for about two and a half months. Regardless of your skin type, I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot due to the reasonable price. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue it.</li>
    <li> burnt my skin to strong for this old lady</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see results with this and it really was just a good moisturizer.  I have used retinol products before and I am familiar with how my skin reacts to them.  From what I can tell there is very little active ingredients.  I compared it Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-wrinkle Deep Wrinkle and I liked the Ageless Intensives better.</li>
    <li> love this product!!!!  the claims are true - - it does remove fine lines!</li>
    <li> I purchased this online after reading the other positive reviews.  The little metal container is nice and solid, the cap twists to prevent lotion from leaking into your makeup bag.  The cream is light and spreads nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel a bit heavy.  The cream is unscented, with no unpleasant odors.  I find two squirts to be a nice amount to cover face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be very effective, in just a week I had smoother feeling skin, just as promised on the packaging.  Yet I did not have any redness, irritation, or tingling.  This is a new addition to my daily beauty routine, and I am delighted with the product and results.</li>
    <li> I like the product, makes my face feel real smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and I really feel it has made a difference around my the area of my mouth (smoker) and around my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t require much, you probably only need 1-2 pumps and it goes on nicely, no smell. It makes my skin feel very smooth and no irritation at night at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and am very happy with the product, because I don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> The directions state that redness, burning, and flaking are supposed to happen as a sign of working, and well, that did happen to me. I did as was stated and stopped using the product every consecutive night, until this went away, and it did. Ive noticed a lightening of my dark circles, but i&#x27;m not too sure that my under eye wrinkles have diminished. I will continue it&#x27;s use, but probably wont be purchasing again once i run out</li>
    <li> I gave this product the ultimate test: my face.  I do not normally use night cream.  In fact I have not used any cosmetics for at least thirty years.  So I took before pictures, used as directed for a week, and then took more pictures.  No, I am not going to share them.  But I did check both sets of photos and found no noticeable changes.  And then I stopped for a week and again, no noticeable change.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side my skin did feel softer.  And maybe if I were not in my mid-sixties, this cream could have had an effect.  But it is not a miracle cure for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that some people have an immediate reaction to this product: a red blush that then fades.  According to the directions, this shows that the cream is working.  My friend (same demographic, fairer complexion) whose face flushed did not have any loss of wrinkles either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been a coincidence but I felt that my skin was thinner and more fragile while using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way to prevent wrinkles is to stay out of the sun and to use lots of sun block.  Oh, and come from a family that does not wrinkle.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are trying this new product from Neutrogena.  Both of us are in or mid forties with wrinkles starting to sprout here and there.  After using them for a week (which is the suggested amount of time to see the results), we both have noticed considerable improvements.  Those crow feet are much less noticeable, even the creases just below the eyeballs are now less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her improvement is more dramatic, although she seems to notice some dryness on her skin.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t see any side effects on me.  Overall, we are very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer great for Normal to Dry skin!     (Husband notes that since wife was more likely to use this than husband, husband gave product to wife for review)    I am 50 years old with Normal to Oily skin.  Moisturizers that do not give me white-heads, are difficult to find.  It felt great going on and was not greasy at all.  The smell was fresh but not \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;.  It actually made my skin glow.  BUT day 5 arrived and so did the white-heads.  I was very disappointed because it felt so good on my skin.  If you have normal or normal to dry skin, you will probably love this product.    4 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed California esthetician and I typically buy only salon/spa type products for my skin. I had read some reviews on other sites about this new product and since it was an inexpensive Retinol product, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very deep lines around my neck, even as a kid. As I age (I&#x27;m now 40) I am now battling lines on my chest, forehead and my smile lines around my mouth and eyes. I thought, sure, I&#x27;ll try this for the two weeks most people said where they saw the difference. I didn&#x27;t expect much but thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just tell this story; I was at a party last night talking to a woman in her 30s and at one point she mentioned that she kept meeting young people in their 20s and wanted to make older friends too. I said I had the same problem but I&#x27;m also more comfortable knowing who I am in my 40s. She stopped and her jaw dropped and she said, \\&quot;WHAT? I thought you were 25?\\&quot; I started laughing and yelled for my friend from across the room to make her repeat it! And that is when I went home and looked, and YES, this product is making a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck lines are much smaller and less deep. My forehead lines have almost completely vanished and my chest skin looks tight and soft. I can&#x27;t believe it! In just two weeks! I put this on at night so I wasn&#x27;t paying attention but I wish I&#x27;d taken a before and after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice and can be turned to close off which is great for travel and it&#x27;s sturdy enough to handle being thrown into an overnight bag or purse. The cream smells really nice, very mild scent and not perfumey, and it spreads well and absorbs well into my skin. I don&#x27;t feel oily or sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used glycolics so my skin is used to these types of products so I haven&#x27;t felt any tingling or itchiness which is normal. If you do, just mix it with a small amount of your regular night cream without an exfoliant or acid and use it that way. Or just every other night too. I use it every night on my face, neck and chest. I think I just might be addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only written one other review for a skin care product before so this isn&#x27;t my usual thing but I HAD to write this because it really works and the price is nice and it&#x27;s just an overall great product. I&#x27;m very impressed. Good job Neutrogena!night too. I use it every night on my face, neck and chest. I think I just might be addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only written one other review for a skin care product before so this isn&#x27;t my usual thing but I HAD to write this because it really works and the price is nice and it&#x27;s just an overall great product. I&#x27;m very impressed. Good job Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> Just like the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum this burned for the first few weeks I used it and made all my skin peel off.  According to the directions and reviews this is normal.  Thus far I have not seen a big difference except I have clearer skin.  We&#x27;ll see how it does long term.  Jury is still out on this product</li>
    <li> This product says I will work in 7 days. I have very fine wrinkles. I gave the Neutrogena Rapid wrinkle repair two weeks to improve my wrinkles. After two weeks I saw no improvement. It does smell nice and is a nic lotion, but there was no wrinkle repair. I would not recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> The guys in my family have been cursed by crow&#x27;s feet.  My brother is only a year older than me, and already his eyes are surrounded by crags and valleys.  I have decided to do battle against my own eyes before I reach that stage. So even though everything in this \\&quot;Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer\\&quot; talks about the ladies, I figured I would give it a go.     The only thing that really matters in a product like this is \\&quot;Does it work?\\&quot;  And the only answer I can give is \\&quot;It seems to be working.\\&quot;  I have been dutifully applying it every night, and I have noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  Of course, it isn&#x27;t magic. And I think the term \\&quot;rapid\\&quot; in the title might just be clever marketing.  I haven&#x27;t been instantly transported back to pre-wrinkle days, but it does seem to be fading out some lines and holding the fort against the advancement of new ones.      The application system is easy, just a few pumps a night and apply.  The bottle is small, but I am only using it on an isolated area so I think it will last for awhile.  I like the fact that it is color and odor-free.    I can&#x27;t promise any miracles, but it definitely works well enough that I want to keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for the last three weeks and as of today have not noticed any positive changes in the laugh lines/crows feet around my eyes.  I do however notice that my skin is much dryer and has these weird bumps which I have never had before.  While this lotion does have a very pleasant smell which I like, little to no results make me want to discontinue its use.  I&#x27;ve been using my regular moisturizer during the day and yet I still feel like my skin is being dried out and tortured while I use this product.  I would recommend the Oil of Olay product line instead, I&#x27;ve been using their products for a number of years and I&#x27;ve never had any adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not using it daily like I should, I still am loving the results. My skin seems softer, makeup applies nicer and one of my friends asked what I was doing to my skin because it looked so nice. :) Hadn&#x27;t seen her in almost a year, so it was a nice confirmation.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product now for several weeks.  I&#x27;ve noticed clearer smoother skin.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and looking to prevent wrinkles.  Previously I had been using Olay Pro-X night cream, but I like this much better.  However, if my skin is really dry I switch to a more moisturizing night cream like Olay.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and pleased to see that it started working pretty quickly. The fine lines under my eyes and not-so-fine lines on my forehead lessened within a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;One-two pumps per night will make the bottle last for about four months, by the way.</li>
    <li> Favorite skin product.  Does not cause break outs and not greasy.  Gentle, no burning or flaking of skin.</li>
    <li> Great product and great scent.</li>
    <li> Discontinued item and my pet peeve is sellers take advantage of that fact....</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see any results, so I&#x27;m not sure if i used it long enough or not, but i finished one bottle and decided not to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and have some sun damage/acne scars and big smile lines b/c I smile when nervous/happy/upset, etc. I have sensitive and acne prone combination skin (dry and oily at the same time!) with big pores. So unfortunate, right? I tried this I only use a thin layer. It absorbs quickly. I didn&#x27;t break out or get redness. I only use this at night but it says you can layer makeup on top. I am used to using more expensive products from Sephora and this is my first try with something less pricey. I was impressed. There is no bad smell or anything like many products have. It smells pretty good and what fragrance there is goes away in a few seconds. It doesn&#x27;t feel filmy on my skin and it seems to have improved the texture in less than a week. So far, the change isn&#x27;t drastic, I just look more rested and awake. My skin looks like I had a facial. I was suprised it didn&#x27;t make me break out and so far it hasn&#x27;t caused any dry patches. I am careful to moisturize in the morning after I wash it off and I only use a thin layer at night. Love this product so far. It&#x27;s better than expected.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and my skin does not look dull after using this product.  Been using for 3 weeks now.  The age spot on my cheek still looks the same.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s totally awesome.  I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and I&#x27;ve started to develop lines around my eyes and I had a deep line on my forehead.  Well, the deep line I had on my forehead is GONE!!!!!  And the lines around my eyes are still there, just less noticeable.  It&#x27;s better than that other Neutrogena product.  The other Neutrogena retinol product burn me so bad.  This is less intense and more effective.  Instead of burning me, it&#x27;s a nice, pleasant warm feeling.  A lot more of your skin would shed, tho.  Lots of skin shedding/peeling.  But it&#x27;s so warm, it actually feels so good.  Feels like a luxury to me.  It feels out of this world.  And my skin is evening out.  I don&#x27;t mind that I still have lines around my eyes.  It being less noticeable is the best thing I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the skin shedding/peeling is to exfoliate your skin to get rid of dead skin faster for a younger look.  So if you&#x27;re deciding between Neutrogena Ageless Intensive line, Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle line, or this line.  Try this one, because the burning isn&#x27;t so bad.  The others made me cry non-stop, this one is very pleasant.  I hope somebody finds this helpful.</li>
    <li> Listen dudes, I&#x27;m a guy and this was my first attempt to reduce crows feet and be totally metro.  It went on smooth for the first couple of days. I had to hide in the bathroom to put it on so the wife didn&#x27;t see.  About the 4th night time use it started to burn.  I read the bottle, it says it was normal and it means it&#x27;s working.  Well, it dried my skin out pretty good and I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use it. Wife was like, \\&quot;what is wrong with skin, it&#x27;s so red around your eyes\\&quot; Busted, So much for the hell women go through.  I&#x27;ll take crows feet over this. I think it&#x27;s back to the good Ol&#x27; Olay.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I have used both the day and the night repair, the day one has good sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve used both for probably 10 years and now I don&#x27;t know how wrinkly I&#x27;d be if I hadn&#x27;t...but think they do a good job.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night. This did something to my skin...and it made it look wonderful! I am so delighted! It&#x27;s lightly scented, goes on very smooth, and one of the very few skin creams that actually produces favorable results. I prefer to use it as my main moisturizer now.     Within the first week I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Wrinkle Repair once a day, I noticed that my skin began to look better. It was brighter and smoother. I didn&#x27;t notice too much difference in the light wrinkles on my lower eyelids, but everywhere else began to look wonderful! For that reason I give it high marks. I just loved what was happening to my skin even if I couldn&#x27;t pinpoint what it was that made it look better.     Skeptic as I was, I check the reviews on Amazon to see if others were getting the same results that I did. I wondered if a change in diet or something else I was doing may have had an effect. But when I saw the reviews that closely matched the results I got, I knew then that I was dealing with a genuine product with genuine results.     The only drawback is that I have oily skin. After a couple of hours or overnight, my skin gets that oily shine across the t-zone area. Not very pretty, so I need to keep extra attention to it to keep the shine under control. A small bother in exchange for better looking skin. Thankfully, it&#x27;s not causing my skin to break out or I would have stopped using it.    Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Wrinkle Repair is worth trying. One of the few products out there that actually delivers results and it&#x27;s not as expensive to buy. I&#x27;m very thankful to have had the opportunity to try it, for now I know what I want to buy on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> All they say about it is true.  Really good for a night cream.  Not greasy and absorbs on the skin but still lets the skin fel moist.</li>
    <li> Love this product it seems gentle enough for reg skin maybe not sensitive but had noticeable results I am 40 btw !</li>
    <li> My wife will gladly be a spokesperson for this product. After 3 weeks of use her skin is soft, wrinkles have disappeared, and it has taken on a glowing quality.  People have stopped her and commented how good her skin looks. I agree 200%!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading all these reviews in here, and apparently, this product seems to be most effective on those in their late 40s and up. I&#x27;m 32, and I actually look a lot younger than my age. However, there are some fine lines on my forehead shock I would like to diminish. I also know how important preventative care is for the rest of the face. But let me be completely HONEST about this product.. Why is it so darn perfume-y???? Who in the world wants to smell their night cream all night?? The scent makes me sick! However, I still wanted to give this cream a fair shot.. So I continued using it for a while longer.. But wow oh wow, it sure did make me breakout! It made me realize that I think i&#x27;d actually rather have wrinkles than pimples! People, just to give y&#x27;all a heads up, this is NOT made with acne prone skin in mind! I&#x27;m now going to try Roc or Olay.. Bye Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and I am not a girly girl. I don&#x27;t think about my skin nails etc. My skin care routine has consisted of washing my face and using sun screen. I&#x27;m fair and have sensitive skin.  I noticed lately I was developing fine lines and dark circles under my eyes. I decided I&#x27;d try to do something. I purchased Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair night and started using it about 2 weeks ago. In two weeks I&#x27;ve gotten three compliments on how young I look. I use this after washing my face each night and I&#x27;ve also used it on my fine lines under sunscreen and make up during the day. Even with my sensitive skin I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation at all. The smell is nice as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product, so far is about 2.5 weeks I am using I feel my skin look different, My skin type is combination and I did not get any flakiness effect of using this. I read that for retinal products you should give at least 8 weeks to see the result so I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Saw a review on television and decided to try it,really like it and not greasy,so great to sleep without worrying about it dirtying your pillow cases.</li>
    <li> Great skin care cream.  Wonderful service from Amazon</li>
    <li> This cream feels great, smells great, and it glides over my skin. I love the results - I can definitely tell a difference when I use it. There are fewer lines, and my skins looks more supple, over all. I have had zero problems with skin irritation from this product.</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer and the fine wrinkles have faded.  Didn&#x27;t do much for the deeper wrinkles</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product were awesome. I have been trying to find something to get rid of my forehead wrinkles. I wasn&#x27;t as happy with this cream as I was hoping to be. It helped with the creases between my eyebrows but did nothing for my forehead wrinkles except make my skin burn a bit and dry out. It could just be my skin, so it may work for you!</li>
    <li> I had a facial about 3 months ago and was severely admonished by the aesthetician for not using a night serum.  (You&#x27;re old, we live in a desert, you have sun damage, blah blah blah).  Well, all those things are true.&lt;br /&gt;I stead of the 60$/ oz product she recommended (eg. tried to sell me) I turned to Neutrogena, by go to in skin care.  I&#x27;ve been very happy, and yes, my skin is less dry, moister, and with evener skin tone.  In addition, I have not noticed any increase in blackheads or pimples.&lt;br /&gt;YMMV, but this works great for me and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I am still in my 20s, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start integrating retinol into my night-time routine. In fact, several sources suggest starting them in your 20s! Anyway, I use this product only at night because retinol can increase the negative effect of UV exposure. I started about a week ago, and even though my results are miniscule, my skin is starting to glow. I also use a moisturizer (Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream) before I apply the retinol so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too dehydrated. Overall, I think that the price for this product is reasonable, but I wish that there was more of it!</li>
    <li> I began having problems with breakouts as I entered my 40s and was incredibly frustrated. I began using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night for minor wrinkles and within a few weeks my skin problems quickly faded. It does really help with minor wrinkles and some lines that we starting before I began using this product are all but gone. I highly recommend the product not just because it really does what it says but also because it cleared up my skin (the best bonus they I would never have expected!).</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is medium in tone.  I tan easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed simple directions and had a severe skin burning reaction.  My face actually hurt.  Waited two days then three days between applications.  Same thing happened to my skin. Everything I used to try to soothe the burned skin made the condition worse.</li>
    <li> There is no exaggeration here. THIS PRODUCT WORKS.</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old, and I recently returned to work after being unemployed for over a year. Most of my coworkers are half my age (or even less). I needed something to make me look and feel brighter and fresher, and this very effective and pleasant skin treatment was just what I needed. The scent and texture of the lotion are both very light and soothing. My \\&quot;frownies\\&quot; are much less noticeable. With continued usage, my skin will not be an indicator of my upcoming 53rd birthday!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of other similar products and this one seems to work, i am not impressed with it or very thrilled about it , it is fine for the money and if you alternate it with other products, and my one concern is that it doesnt even have a cap cover and therefore there is constant build-up on the pump because it is exposed to air at all times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and lately I&#x27;ve been unhappy at seeing some fine lines on my face that I never had in college. I picked this up because it&#x27;s cheaper than other products and I thought why not give it a try? I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised at the noticeable results in such a short time. After just the first night of using it my skin looked brighter (particularly under my eyes). After a week the fine lines next to my eyes were less visible. The skin around my mouth looked younger. So far the lines on my forehead do not appear to much different, but I still have hopes they&#x27;ll improve with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical of such a small bottle, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much and it is still effective. I put a dab (one pump) on my finger and smooth it all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer smells very nice and fresh. It does tingle on my face, but only for a minute or two right after I put it on. During the first week of use I also had some flaking of skin next to my eyes, but this has since gone away. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> In defense of this product, I do notice a little bit of difference.  I am quite young, however, and am using it to reverse a small amount of aging on my eyes and forehead and in the hopes of preventing future issues.  It definitely has a scent, though.  Not a terrible or overtly strong scent, but definitely the scent of anti aging cream.</li>
    <li> I was for my mom and it created an allergic reaction on her ..Unfortunately she can&#x27;t use this type of products</li>
    <li> Well product (night cream wrinkle repair) does work but it makes you break out pretty good too. I noticed a difference in wrinkles after 2 days of use. It has a light pleasant scent to it and is a light weight cream. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne but my face is sensitive to certain types of lotions, moisturizers and such, in that they clog my pores making me break out from suffocation. I do not have oily skin so it has to be what they use in their product. Also, it does have a peak point where it does not help your wrinkles any more. I&#x27;m bummed that I have to quit using it because of the break outs though because it does work. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It did all I expected. I have received several compliments from people who can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 67. It only took about two weeks before I saw results.</li>
    <li> I have only recently started wearing Neutrogena products, and am really enjoying them. No irritation. they make my skin look soft and dewy without being greasy. They aren&#x27;t harsh, and don&#x27;t dry my skin. They don&#x27;t make my skin red, or break out. They are affordable. Other than the &amp;#34;miracle&#x27; that we are all looking for in an anti aging product, this is pretty good. I am noticing softer lines than before. I know all skin types are different, but this is pretty good.</li>
    <li> All this cosmetic stuff. I can&#x27;t tell if I look better, worse or the same. Since I see myself in the mirror every day..I&#x27;m still in my 40s(which was about 30 years ago). The stuff feels good when it goes on, sinks in nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy. More than that, who knows!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, quick shipment</li>
    <li> This wrinkle repair cream is fabulous!!! No really.&lt;br /&gt;From Neutrogena! Of course, Neutrogena has always been my go-to brand when the bank balance hits month end, They&#x27;re always reliable.&lt;br /&gt;There is a daytme version of this, which contains SPF 30, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;MY skin is fair and I&#x27;m gettin&#x27; a bit older and even though I have a bit more at the end of the month I won&#x27;t switch to a far more expensive brand. After 2 weeks even my family all noticed. The Rapid Repair Night Cream is my new favorite retinol type formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that using the night formula and the day formula at the same time was too much. If your skin is sensitive keep it to the night cream. It&#x27;s plenty and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have found that has lived up to its claim. The brown spots on my face have lightened considerably. I don&#x27;t think they will disappear completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair line for about two years.  The Night Repair is an excellent product, and it works for me.  I am in my late sixties and am very happy with the results.  I recommend you use the day and the night creams.  Neutrogena is a well respected company with products that suit most everyone&#x27;s needs and skin types.  The Rapid Wrinkle Repair line is another outstanding product from this well known company.</li>
    <li> This product presumably interacted with something I got on my face during a dental cleaning.  I&#x27;ve been with this dentist and his staff for over two years and no cleaning has ever caused this reaction prior to my use of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night.&lt;br /&gt;The interaction caused the worst distress to my complexion that I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Raised red patches of thickened skin began to peel the next day and looked absolutely gross.  My face remained a fiery red the whole time the skin was peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;I stayed home for four days with this catastrophe and only resolved it by using Bach Flowers skin remedy.&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is sensitive at all, think twice about using this product !!&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena states on the bottle that it might cause a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to get my money back although I threw the box away.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is what I wanted</li>
    <li> Absorbs very quick, nice scent too, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> this works, give it time</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product</li>
    <li> I have used and loved this in the past. Then I got lazy and stopped using it. When I started again a few months later, I was blown away again with how fast I looked younger. It&#x27;s practically overnight. Just amazing!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena seems to put the best product on the market for the price.  I have used the RWR Night and Day for about a year and my skin is wonderful.  Only one flaw- the night and day are in identical bottles except for a really hard to read label indicating which is which.  It would be a real positive if the company placed the day in a white bottle and the night in the grey bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it. My skin in the morning feels just wonderful and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
    <li> Here is my thorough review of this product.  This is coming from a woman who has sensitive, combination, multiple-ethnicity skin, who lives in varying climates.  My skin demands much of my attention, so I try tons of products to see what I&#x27;m allergic to and not.  My skin is also dry yet oily, endures dry, cold Colorado weather and hot, humid Georgia climates.  I have the fragile, pale delicacy of Japanese skin, with the large pores and wrinkle prone American side thrown in.  Now let&#x27;s get to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Night Serum claims to fight wrinkles by helping to moisturize and infusing your skin with retinol.  Now I&#x27;m still a young woman, so I bought this mostly to prevent future wrinkles, fight the fine lines I currently have from all the sun and winter winds I deal with daily, to help balance my combination skin, and to even out my skin tone since every flaw shows up on my light complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- decent sized bottle for the price (use nightly for up to 2 months)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use pump (a single pump is enough for one night&#x27;s use)&lt;br /&gt;- almost no scent&lt;br /&gt;- goes on smooth and even&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t cause acne (as long as you blend evenly)&lt;br /&gt;- perfectly safe for my skin (which is allergic to pretty much everything)&lt;br /&gt;- keeps my face moisturized all night&lt;br /&gt;- mixes well with serums without reacting (such as 100% hyalauric acid or vitamin c)&lt;br /&gt;- the retinol is a nice addition to your nightly moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;- safe to use close to your eyes/on your eyelids without causing a reaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- bottle warns you will feel a warm, tingling sensation (yes, yes you will, because it feels like a 30 second sunburn that slowly ebbs and turns your skin flush red)&lt;br /&gt;- haven&#x27;t seen permanent differences in my fine wrinkles over time, but in the mornings my face is brighter, clearer, and more plump than when I go without&lt;br /&gt;- leaves my skin oily the next morning until I wash it, so I highly recommend using it at night only and never as a daytime serum under makeup&lt;br /&gt;- is a little intense in humid weather, and will cause acne if you don&#x27;t blend thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;- is a little too dry in windy and cold weather, and needs an additional face cream on top to prevent drying over the course of the night&lt;br /&gt;- not entirely a con, but the serum has pearlescent sparkles (it won&#x27;t fall into your eyes or irritate your contact lens, but it will make your black towels/robe/pajamas a little sparkly over time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful to use alone, but I like using it as part of my 5-Step Japanese Skincare Routine (foam cleanser, toner, serum, eye cream, face cream or lotion).  I only use it at night as instructed, simply because it does make my face red and tingly and would make me look sunburned during the daytime.  This tingling isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling, but the bottle claims it means this is working.  I don&#x27;t know to trust that, or assume it&#x27;s a coverup for some flaw in the recipe.  But I have yet to see a downside to using this as a longterm preventative for fine wrinkles.  It&#x27;s suitable for people of different ethnicities, with sensitive skin, in different climates.g it at night only and never as a daytime serum under makeup&lt;br /&gt;- is a little intense in humid weather, and will cause acne if you don&#x27;t blend thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;- is a little too dry in windy and cold weather, and needs an additional face cream on top to prevent drying over the course of the night&lt;br /&gt;- not entirely a con, but the serum has pearlescent sparkles (it won&#x27;t fall into your eyes or irritate your contact lens, but it will make your black towels/robe/pajamas a little sparkly over time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.

    <li> This stuff works. Like, it WORKS WELL. I&#x27;m surprised, and happy about how much improvement I&#x27;ve been seeing in texture and clarity of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it, especially around my eye area. Even the skin on my sometimes-oily cheeks is looking younger and healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for a month and a half and I&#x27;m actually seeing results. My skin tone is brighter and the overall texture is younger-looking and more refined. I have normal/combination skin and no sensitivities. It&#x27;s not a miracle or anything. No one is mistaking me for 20. But skin creams so rarely work that I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because some results are better than no results at all. I use this at night in conjunction with a daily moisturizer with SPF. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, which is good. There is a slight tingling which imagine would be worse if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results/repair. No ill effects</li>
    <li> I like the Neutrogena brand.  Works well!</li>
    <li> Good night cream, but don&#x27;t put too much on. Just one or two squirts and blot on face, don&#x27;t rub.</li>
    <li> The very best I have ever used and I have used some that cost over $100. for a very small amount.  The wrinkles in the corners of my eyes are gone.  Did not believe the ad but it is true.  Never want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> Bad news, peeled my skin immediately.  Called Neutrogena and received a refund-apparently, I may have a reaction to it&#x27;s main ingredient....as do many others!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times.  I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and am just beginning to see some fine lines.  I have used this product for some time and get compliments of my skin.  It was a while ago, but I research pretty thoroughly before making a purchase and this seemed like the biggest bang for you buck for a retinol cream.  While there are warnings that it can dry out and irritate skin, I have never experienced a problem.  In fact, it makes my skin feel silky and smooth.  My go-to facial cream.</li>
    <li> I like it better than ROC night time wrinkle repair</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about wrinkle repair part, but people think I look much younger than age. I just love this because it&#x27;s light and container is small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a few weeks and don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> have finished one bottle.  it&#x27;s too soon to tell any real improvements</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works any better or faster than similar products but it applies easily and feels good on my skin so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good product and it does keep the skin moisturized and exfoliated. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have spent a small fortune on face creams.  I have very nice, but sensitive, skin and am well into middle age, warding off lines and wrinkles.  Most of the products that I&#x27;ve used regularly have been very expensive.  I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper stuff - namely, Olay - but found that it left residue on my skin, so that I was greasy, not glowing, and felt covered with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, having read great reviews of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, I gave it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week, but already see a difference.  My skin is clear, and as clean and healthy looking as when I use the $250 La Prairie retinol product.  My skin is tighter and the lines are less apparent (still there, but there is no \\&quot;withered\\&quot; look around the lips, if you know what I mean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just stocked up on the night and day creams and ordered the serum and eye treatments.  These products are going to leave my skin looking great, while saving me a ton of money.  I don&#x27;t know how Neutrogena did this for $24 - less on Amazon - but Neutrogena did.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost two years and I really notice a difference on how my face looks and feels.  I love all Neutrogena products and would buy this again.  Great price and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> It did well on the fine lines but not so well on deep wrinkles. There was some redness on my face but quickly went away.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works really well. I use with either the ageless intensive tone correcting or anti wrinkle. Smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and work very quickly. I&#x27;m only 30, with 3 forehead lines and laugh lines, about a week after I started using this they slowly started to fade away. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion&#x27;s texture.  Now I am waiting to see if it measures up to the commericials!  We will see.</li>
    <li> I have a few lines on my face.  They&#x27;re not deep and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  To try to get rid of the lines, I tried this product.  It&#x27;s okay but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  If you&#x27;re looking at this, you probably have a few lines, too.  I recommend using Oil of Olay in the morning and evening.  About an hour before you go to bed, use the Oil of Olay and cover it with a thin layer of vaseline.  I know it sounds weird, but it helps to hold the moisture in and works a lot better than this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while, very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and I will get another to see if I get some lasting results. I tend to overdo my creams so I ran out kind of fast. I&#x27;m going to start derma rolling and I think the cream will be even better when I do that. I think for the money this product might become part of my regular routine.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly what it claims!!! I am a firm supporter and user of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night, although I use it morning and night! The price is reasonable....worth every penny! I am constantly mistaken to be 10 to 15 years younger than my age!!!!</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and it did not do anything for me.  I still have the wrinkles.  I will buy a different product.</li>
    <li> seems like a good product</li>
    <li> I have used it twice a day fro 4 weeks and I have not noticed a change at all other then better moisture</li>
    <li> makes my face breakout in areas where applied, it may just be me :(</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about trying this product. My face was in terrible shape. I had a lot of acne around my chin and cheeks. I went to the dermatologist and even prescriptions were not working. I have been using this product for four months and I have no acne. I am assuming it is the retinol in the product that has helped. It did dry my skin out at first and I had to back off and use it only every other day. Now I use it every night and use the daytime rapid wrinkle repair that has spf in it every morning. My face is so much brighter and clear. I am amazed. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this and would not be without it.It really works.</li>
    <li> Really works. My skin is smoother and more resilient after using this product for a few weeks. It gave me better results than the expensive stuff I used to buy at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure how I feel about this stuff. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles just a few super fine lines around my eyes from squinting so I&#x27;m really not seeing a big change if any at all. But like I said, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t write a review, because everything I could &amp; would say about the product has been written in many different ways....so, it&#x27;s all true. I also used expensive brand name products, as well as doctor prescription strength retinols &amp; mostiurizers. I just noticed my cabinet &amp; drawers, once filled with tons of various creams, tubes of this &amp; that, always buying the next &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; thing....were dwindling as I only needed this. Because it works. Case &amp; Point: I get Botox 3 times a year from a plastic surgeon. My last appointment I asked  what else he could do for wrinkles. He laughed &amp; said, &amp;#34; what wrinkles?&amp;#34; handing me a mirror. As I looked, I realized just how well it had worked! He said, &amp;#34;you are just now seeing some tiny laugh lines, they tend to increase when you are in your early forties. We&#x27;ll talk in about 10 years&amp;#34;. Guess he didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m 44!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if this product actually helps the wrinkle situation. It DOES make my face breakout though, sooooo</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several weeks and have seen an improvement in skin tone - though not in &amp;#34;one week&amp;#34; as commercials say.</li>
    <li> I have combination, sensitive skin and I used this in the morning as my daily moisturizer.  It worked great. I started noticing a difference in my skin after a few weeks.  People who didn&#x27;t know I started using this started commenting on my skin about a month after I started using.  This product also, didn&#x27;t cause me any break outs.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really works...if I can remember to put it on! It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but the scent dissipates quickly. I would definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> The best wrinkle serum on earth! I love it. Every morning I notice my skin is fully plumped since day one I started using it. Women, don&#x27;t waste your money on any expensive product that doesn&#x27;t do it job,  but use this Neutrogena instead!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!!!!!  It does what it claims and more.  I would recommend it to everyone because it works.&lt;br /&gt;Since I been using it, people think I am 10 years younger than my real age. By the way, my husband also uses&lt;br /&gt;it and his skin looks great, so it&#x27;s not just for women.</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old and am using this as a preventative measure. I can already start to see potential problem spots (around my mouth and forehead). Because I have a history of sensitive skin, I eased into the application by applying the cream every other night before applying every night. To my surprise my skin did not peel or burn which is common with retinol; however I did experience break outs and my face RARELY breaks out. So maybe this is the retinol &amp;#34;reaction&amp;#34;? After seeing this, I&#x27;ve reduced usage to 3 times a week. As for results, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll really see true results until later in my life (i.e. visible wrinkles showing up much later than expected) but I am definitely open to other creams.</li>
    <li> Love this product.Try it I saw results on crows feet &amp; upper lip within 5 days.This &amp; night cream &amp; hydro boost water gel are now my new skin&lt;br /&gt;care program.I am now retired but I use to be an Aesthetician so I&#x27;ve seen my share of products</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  She was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is helping my wrinkles; however, the fine wrinkles around my mouth appear less.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic product. Apply both at day and night. It&#x27;s not cheap but far less than others that don&#x27;t work as well. A must buy</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and feel it does a great job.  I replaced a much more expensive cream with it and feel this gives better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, nightly, and I&#x27;ve seen a real improvement in my skin. Pretty inexpensive, considering that you get a fair amount of product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other wrinkle cream that I gave used. It has a light feeling in the skin and does not cause breakouts like other creams.</li>
    <li> About 1/2 tsp. of the product leaked out of the container into the box. The fragrance is overpowering, can&#x27;t use it at night because of allergies. Haven&#x27;t got around to trying it during the day because of the fragrance. I rubbed a  tiny bit of it on my habd to see how long the fragrance lasted, it was still noticeable after a shower.</li>
    <li> I used this for almost 2 weeks, then discontinued. It was helping me with acne.  I felt like it cleared up my acne that is why gave a 3 star. But it made the skin very dry, i found it made more of the wrinkles visible around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;So started with olay regenerist night cream... It was good until they changed the formula... Which started breaking out my skin... So again started looking for night cream... And this one was lying in my shelf... So wanted to give it another try.... The same happened again the skin around eyes started having more lines... Might be this was drying up that area more... So I tried it without putting it around eye area.. And it is perfecting fine... I noticed skin more youthful, reduced lines in forehead... The olay was just ok in making the lines invisible but still I felt my skin was looking mature... But now after using neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair night cream I just started feeling i am looking younger :)). Still looking for a good eye cream....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have skin that&#x27;s in fair condition, my main issues being a few minor wrinkles (but a deepening one between my eyebrows), slight lines on forehead, under eyes, etc. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week along with a hyaluronic acid serum, wanting to improve the overall look of my skin and soften a few wrinkles. Using both products has softened the look of the wrinkles a bit, so that&#x27;s good. These aren&#x27;t fillers or surgery, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle - just some improvement. Also, the appearance of the large pores I&#x27;ve always had on my cheeks has diminished quite a bit. I should also note that I have moderately sensitive skin - I don&#x27;t break out in hives or anything, but I do have minor reactions at times. This product has caused me no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best side effect of the Neutrogena product so far, which I noticed after the first couple of uses - before I added the hyaluronic acid serum, so I know it&#x27;s the Neutrogena - is that my skin doesn&#x27;t get very oily anymore! I would usually get oily in my T-zone as the day wore on, and I found myself blotting throughout the day to get rid of the shine. When I use the Neutrogena in the morning (works great under your regular makeup), I notice that I no longer get that shine. That alone is worth it to me! I will definitely continue using this as a replacement for my old moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s helped smooth out some of my wrinkles. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. It goes on your skin nicely and smells good, but doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup. Gives me an oily sheen. But if you use it at night, no problem. I like Neutrogena products and would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this product I saw results.  Even more surprising is that the product continues to improve my skin.  Although I&#x27;ve tried a few other products in the interim when the price fluctuates too high, this is the BEST skin product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Feels good when applied. My face has not broken out from using it which is a problem I frequently have when I switch skincare products. Not greasy and a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and brand new, as expected!</li>
    <li> ok did not notice a big difference the bottle is glass so I could not keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I was considering a prescription Retin-A cream, but liked the &amp;#34;difference in 1 week&amp;#34; claims from this product, as well as the price. So I thought I&#x27;d take this gentle approach first before getting an Rx. I truly feel that in 1 week, my skin&#x27;s surface was absolutely improved. I am 28. I would describe my &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; skin as ruddy, marked with dark spots left from acne, and sun spots starting to surface from 2 summers at the beach. In general, it just felt rough and I felt the need for a lot of makeup. The first 2 nights using this lotion, it didn&#x27;t feel like anything, On the 3rd night however, I did start to feel just a bit of warmth and tingling, as the directions warn can happen (but is a sign it&#x27;s working). I had just a slight bit of flaking near my nose. But this was easily remedied by my morning ritual of cleansing with baking soda. It&#x27;s been two weeks now and my skin feels like silk and has a glow to it that several people have commented on. My expression lines have eased up and there was one in particular near my mouth that has completely gone away. I am now making my husband use this stuff so we can age at the same rate!! I want to use it on my entire body! I love the way my face looks and feels, and I will probably be using this stuff for the rest of my life. Wish I started it when I was 25.</li>
    <li> Love this product.This is my third bottle of it, and my &amp;#34;little line&amp;#34; around my lips and eyes really are less. One warning.....when the bottle is empty, it IS EMPTY!! No holding the bottle upside down for the last couple of drops. It is done! I am going to keep track now and start ordering a week early. Other than that, I really like this product, and yes, I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; that were a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is very early in the process, but I am please with the results to date!</li>
    <li> My wife is using this so stay tuned - thus  will define for you rapid and repair in wrinkle terminology</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Does exactly what it says it will - I was able to see the difference in my skin within a week.  Also great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this product.  It is not a miracle wrinkle remover--that&#x27;s not going to happen.  What I do like about it is my skin feels nice and silky after I apply it.  Have I noticed any change since using it?  Probably not.  But I like it enough as a face cream that I plan to continue buying and using it.  It has a nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it.  So, I&#x27;m happy with it.  Just don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles to disappear!</li>
    <li> You know when your mother tells you to buy wrinkle cream that it&#x27;s time to start using it! I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for any product but had seen this one on TV and thought I&#x27;d try it. I use it every night and I am as shocked as the next person to say that it really does work. The fine lines are finer and the overall appearance of my skin is better. I am going to buy the day one now too!</li>
    <li> nice night cream. it hydrates.</li>
    <li> this is the best product ever, if u keep using it, it really works, been using it for a while cant believe it actually gets rid of wrinlkes</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was not compatible with my sensitive skin and the fragrance was too intense.</li>
    <li> This is a good product except for the smell.  It smells awful.  Considering it is a drugstore product though, it is quite effective.  My problem is brown/age spots and they have faded considerably using this product.</li>
    <li> Good OTC retin A product!</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products and this was no exception!!  Cream goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.  My skin has been more luminous. Can&#x27;t really say yet if my wrinkles are diminishing, but skin does look better.  I have only been using for a week!  I really like it!!!</li>
    <li> I look forward to using this product each evening because I do feel it has made a difference in my skin tone, elasticity, and appearance when I awake in the morning.  It&#x27;s not very greasy, it goes on very smoothly, and it leaves a pleasant feeling on the skin.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I am 30 yrs old, so no deep wrinkles yet.  However, I had very fine lines around my mouth, slight dark circles/bags under my eyes, and my skin has been looking dry and rough -- all adding together to generally make me look older.  I started using the product about 2 weeks ago, and I have noticed significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  My skin feels and looks smoother with no dryness, looks clear and healthier in general.  My under-eye bag/circle has also disappeared.  I can still see the lines around my mouth, but they are not that noticeable.  This is not a miracle cream and I didn&#x27;t expect to look like an 18 yo again.  However, the results are significantly better than what I expected and it&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> this did nothing for me</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light moisturizer.  It has not completely rehabilitated my 57 year old face; but I do think the texture has improved and the fine lines seem less noticable and I like the way my face feels in the morning.  If you have extremely dry skin you might feel like you need a heavier product over this to lock in moisture.  Several reveiwers mentioned the scent, it is nice and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump, it seems to dispense just the right amount of product.  I understand why the container is opaque, but it would be nice to have some idea of how much product is left.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> So far, I am quite pleased with this product.  My skin appears renewed and fresh.  In the past, I have had some skin sensitivity issues with other night creams (rosacea-type rash) but not with this product.  Age: 52.</li>
    <li> I get this online because it is much cheaper than at the stores.  Great product, have been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> It works on small wrinkles to some extent, but I did not see a dramatic change even after a few months of use. Still better than not using it, I suppose.</li>
    <li> usually like neotrogena but this isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product.  I work night shift and although wrinkles aren&#x27;t a big problem, sallow skin, discoloration and puffiness can be sometimes. I use this it in the morning before I go to sleep (along with a couple drops of hyaluronic acid to help it absorb) and noticed benefits within 7 days: brighter skin, more even tone, improved coloration, and the skin around my eyes seems tighter.  As I said, wrinkles were not a problem for me, but my roommate used this for his wrinkles and they have helped noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, it&#x27;s a great product and will continue to use</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for the lines on my forehead and neck, works great on my forehead but not as good on my neck, however it does work some on my neck. For the price to work so well on the lines of my forehead i will continue to purchase the Neutrogena. However I need something else for the lines on my neck.</li>
    <li> Love it- have used this product for about 1 year and I must say it does seem to have improved skin and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I think I am going to like this, just really started to use it so at this time I don&#x27;t know if it really will work or not</li>
    <li> I like serums because they are lighter than other products.  This will do just fine.  Good product.  Good price.  Worth it.  I don&#x27;t believe in magic so I&#x27;m not looking for lines to disappear.</li>
    <li> Like this cream for a couple of reasons:  it glides on smoothly and comes in a pump container.  I have used other night creams in a jar, where I end up getting the back of my nails full of cream.  I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m looking older, so I&#x27;ll keep with  it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this product.  I thought neutrogena made healthy products, which means no artificial fragrance.  I&#x27;ll never know if it works, because I had to wash it off as soon as I put it on.  I can tolerate very light fragrance, but the fragrance was overpowering to me on my face.  I guess that&#x27;s $16 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see a difference.  Leaves my skin very soft and nice.  Absorbs quickly into the skin and does not have any perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin.  Would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy but not greasy formula. I saw very good results in a week. My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> What I liked about this product is:&lt;br /&gt;1) Texture - non greasy, which is rare to find in face cream.&lt;br /&gt;2) Pump - I like the distribution method where I pump it into my palm&lt;br /&gt;3) Good size and amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I didn&#x27;t like - and this might be just a bad or old batch - was the scent. My product smelled like over due perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how good this product is for my skin - I can&#x27;t really tell, but on the other hand when can you really tell?</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! This moisturizer is lightweight, yet creamy. Lessens fine lines and wrinkles in just a few weeks. I have always loved their products, but this is a fav. I also love the eyecream. This product works just as well as fancy department store brands.</li>
    <li> IF you are sensitive to synthetic fragrances, this product probably won&#x27;t be a good match.  To my nose, the scent was very strong.  (Things like fabric softeners, air fresheners, perfumes, hair sprays, cleaning products, etc all bring on a headache for me...)  Hope this helps others with the same &#x27;allergy/sensitivity&#x27; issue.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Pricing significantly lower than CVS&#x27;s usual exhorbitance. Delivered right to my door. Hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Good product but not a face lift.</li>
    <li> I use the product every other night.  I&#x27;d like to use it more often but I use it between my eyes and it burns them.  I&#x27;ve tried using this every night but the burning feeling in my eyes is so bad I have to wash it off.  I guess it must be the fragrance or vapor or something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do seem to have noticed an improvement in the areas I use it.  Hopefully it&#x27;s not just my mind playing tricks on me.</li>
    <li> Great product for a 59 year old.</li>
    <li> This product works well as a light weight lotion for everyday use. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in wrinkles or acne, as the retinol SA is supposed to help out with reducing acne. The price is too much for only being a light lotion.</li>
    <li> one week in....I like the way it works into your skin and feels good.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I found that a lot of Neutrogena products r for sensitive skin I love this product it smells really good and it leaves my face so clear by morning time...</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with a hydroquinone product (retinol helps to accelerate the process to help fade hyperpigmentation/melasma).  I had been using another retinol product, but wanted to try this one.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but must have applied too much the first night as I woke up the next morning with very flaky skin by my smile creases and on my neck creases.  And, not doing the smart thing and leaving it alone, decided to help peel off some of these flakes so they wouldn&#x27;t be visible when I put makeup on.  Bad mistake!  It left raw moist skin that makeup would not stick to.  All this to say, that it works!  But use in moderation and don&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; any flaking skin.  Your skin will feel a bit tight and might look slightly sunburned when you first start using this (if you&#x27;re not used to a retinol product).  This is part of the process.  After my skin adjusted (I, of course, stopped using it until my skin got better and then applied a thin layer), my skin looked much, much better than it had in a long time. FYI, I&#x27;m in my mid-30s but have somewhat fair skin and lots of skin damage from years spent in the California sun with no sunscreen.  I battle melasma, discoloration, and fine lines/wrinkles.  I do recommend this product, but use it with caution.  Also, I tried the sensitive version of this, and it must have a different ingredient in it as it made my cheeks break out with cystic acne/pimples which I never get there!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Have been using it for some time and would not want to go without it.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of all over the counter remedies/skin treatments.  Because I&#x27;ve recently been troubled by the decolettage (sp?) wrinkles on my upper chest - from sun damage - I started researching treatments that people have deemed effective.  This seemed to be one of them, and I thought that the fact it contains retinol is a plus, so I decided to splurge, despite my skepticism.&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream on the area on my chest (about 4&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;) every night religiously until the cream was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no difference that I can see. None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multi-billion dollar cosmetics/skin cream industry continues to bulldoze us into believing their products are effective, and many of us continue to believe it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the night cream instead of the day cream but since I am not outside that much this time of year I used it as day cream anyway.  It is just as light as the day cream and works about the same.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This a a fantastic night products!  Results are more even toned skin.  Been using for about a year and my skin texture is very very nice.  The price is fantastic for  such a product.  And Im not afraid tp spend money on skin care.  Wont buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is better than any other more expensive cream...love it!</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old, live in the northeast, and have started to develop fine lines on my forehead. After only a week I definitely noticed a difference, and now after 2 months I can barely see the lines at all. What a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Of all the face creams that can be bought at a Pharmacy or Target and Walmart this is the best !!!</li>
    <li> still using it and still have sign of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Lynda</li>
    <li> Works good without the Big expense</li>
    <li> I tried high priced other brand when my skin started to irritate. I&#x27;m not sure why because I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night for many years. I started to use again after finished high priced product. I am happy for result I get and have no irritation anymore.</li>
    <li> i love this product.It keeps my face moist till morning.I wish the company will make the product double its size.It disappears&lt;br /&gt;so fast and then you have to buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I use it every night and can tell a huge difference if I skip a night.  I have very oily skin and was afraid it would make it worse, but it does not.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was given 4 and 5 stars, so I figured I would try it.  Well it really isn&#x27;t a 5 star item. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way my skin looks, except for my skin peeling off on some areas of my face.  It does however leave my skin smooth.  I have dry skin, so maybe this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I am 48 and have pretty good skin but have noticed lately that I could see some little lines under my eyes -- nothing too bad, but they bothered me.  I read a lot about different anti-wrinkle creams and this product got very high marks so I decided to give it a try.  The package said that it may cause a burning sensation, which was completely normal. Well, it really burned a lot.  It hurt to touch my skin or even just have the wind blow on it!  Worse than that, the skin under my eyes seemed to lose elasticity -- I had saggy, baggy skin that I never had before. I will not use this cream anymore because I am afraid of what it may do permanently.  I only used it 3 days; what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to downgrade my skincare and makeup routine...and by downgrade, I mean shop almost exclusively at the drugstore. I&#x27;ve managed to find wonderful drugstore alternatives to department store makeup and haircare, but skincare has been tough. I&#x27;m at the point now that, despite being able to afford more expensive items, I&#x27;m happily sticking with my bargain finds. Why spend more if you don&#x27;t have to, right? I&#x27;m more interested in how I look and feel after application, versus caring so much which brand or fancy packaging I hold in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skincare was trickier. I&#x27;ve tried a host of brands over the last few years, from Olay to Aveeno to about every other option available at drugstore prices. I&#x27;ve had negative reactions to a few, especially Olay, which caused me to break out and took my normally dry skin to oil-slick territory. Others may not have caused me any discomfort or spots, but I was simply unimpressed with the texture and appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a try because, honestly, I just did not want to spend $80 on my daily/nightly routine this time around. Plus, Neutrogena was one of the few drugstore options I hadn&#x27;t attempted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, over a week in, I am happy with this product. I spent under $40 for the day and night version of this, which is a true bargain for something so potent. It has a scent (gardenia, maybe, or lily?), but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It feels very light and sinks in quickly. I have ridiculously dry skin, the kind that develops peeling, scaly bits if left unattended. Despite only using the recommended pea-sized amount, I&#x27;ve had no dry skin issues whatsoever. My last face cream resembled pudding, and it still didn&#x27;t properly hydrate me unless I slathered it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid-30&#x27;s, shun the sun, and live a (fairly) healthy lifestyle, so I do not have many advanced signs of aging, past the typical age related areas (crinkling around the eyes, slight creases around the mouth, and the like). So, I cannot attest to how well these potions work on intense signs of aging. My main problems are with uneven skin texture, uneven coloring, and dullness. These lotions have done what creams twice and three times their cost have done--minimized these issues and made them more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the packaging. It&#x27;s simple, slim, lovely, and easy to manage. The pump has a closing feature, which works easily and does not jostle loose, so I can travel with this. Also, the packaging is so slim, it does not take up much space. A little bit really does go a long way, even with my dry skin, so I truly believe I got an excellent deal for the price. I fully intend to stick with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really happy with it. This skincare find was the last piece in my \\&quot;go budget but look and feel like I splurged\\&quot; experiment.h, and the like).

    <li> Works very well....use it at night....skin looks more healthy in the morning....</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to believe this product would do much but I bought it b/c of all the great reviews.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I am 35, have fair skin, some minor wrinkling around the eyes and forehead, and don&#x27;t have the greatest evenness of skin tone.  After using this product for about 5 nights, I noticed a minor decrease in lines (first time I&#x27;ve seen any improvement after using a wrinkle repair product) and more significantly a greater evenness in color across my face.  Like others have said, I don&#x27;t believe this is a miraculous product but I think it works well and is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used expensive brands and did not get the results I get with this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based off of the gazillions of reveiws I read. Now, I can&#x27;t speak for someone who has actual \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; or skin that&#x27;s suffered from years and years of sun damage and how this would work for them, i&#x27;m speaking as someone that&#x27;s on the cusp of 30 and has developed some noticeable expression lines across the middle of my forehead and some fine lines appearing under my eyes (trying the whole \\&quot;ounce of prevention vs. a pound of cure\\&quot; method). I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for about a month now. Even though it&#x27;s the night formula, I sometimes also use it in the day and add some moisturizer with sunscreen in it (I can&#x27;t see buying a whole other bottle for the added SPF). I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in my expression lines or the lines under my eyes. What I can say is that this has kind of evened out my skin tone (I have some blotchiness from old acne) and it makes it really smooth to the touch. I haven&#x27;t broken out from this (which happens with ALOT of other products) and I like the way it makes my skin look even if it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed for. I also don&#x27;t see where it makes my skin greasy which is pleasantly surprising for a night cream and I have very oily skin (it still gets oily but no worse than if I didn&#x27;t have any moisturizer on). I&#x27;m not sure I will repurchase because it IS a bit pricey for something that hasn&#x27;t done (for me personally)what I bought it for, but if it&#x27;s on sale, I may rebuy just because I like the way it makes my skin feel overall.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but the bottle leaves so much lotion that you can get out! I bought this &amp; the TUBE at the same time. I alternate using both ( same product) . My bottle is already not pumping right, like it&#x27;s reach the limit of lotion it can suck up. My &amp;#34;Tube&amp;#34; however is 1/2 full. I&#x27;m not going to sit there banging the bottle on my hand to get the lotion out of the bottom, yes I&#x27;ve done it many times before w/ products. The tube can be squeeze to get every drop that you paid for!! While I like the product, I will only get the tube. Save yourself $$ , time ( banging the bottle on your hand!) and buy the serum in the TUBE!!  :)</li>
    <li> But whether it did anything for wrinkles or age spots on the face, I couldn&#x27;t say. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, which is probably not enough time to judge. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I live in Alaska and have extremely dry skin.  I used to slather my face with olive oil after my shower.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years, and this is my hands-down favorite.  It&#x27;s not going to make you look younger, but it definitely hydrates without being oily.</li>
    <li> Actually l need  it for  eye but l ordered for face accidentally and l wanted to try after l got it and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;one more  thing is the seller delivered on time and l did not have to wait for it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks alot</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this lotion deserves 5-stars. I am in my early 30s, so I like using wrinkle repair as a preventative measure. This lotion most definitely made my skin feel smoother and softer. I cannot say anything to support the claim that it removes deep wrinkles, but when compared to other facial products I use, I can testify that it is superior. However, I cannot give this product 5-starts because right out of the box, I was not able to assemble the pump since it was missing a piece. So, I was never able to properly use the first bottle I got. The bottle has a very small opening and it is very difficult to get the lotion out without the pump. The second problem with the packaging is that it is made out of glass. When I was traveling, I took it with me and it fell off of the edge of the sink and shattered. I hope these design flaws will be fixed in the future. Otherwise, I highly recommend the lotion.</li>
    <li> This is amazing cream!  I only use the night formula, didn&#x27;t like the day stuff.  It feels &amp; smells amazing and has really helped with my skin tone &amp; fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, only apply it in the morning, and I won&#x27;t switch to anything else.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or anything and make-up applies over it perfectly.  I&#x27;m 42 &amp; it&#x27;s a must-have!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night (NRWRN). I have tried lots of products like this, but most of them are too harsh. I have a few allergies to some ingredients in these type of products and they cause a rash or breakout. NRWRN does it&#x27;s job without any side effects on my sensitive skin. The first week or so, there was some redness and a bit of flaking, but I use a bit less now and won&#x27;t go to bed without applying it. I can see that my skin looks smoother and clearer and renewed. I have it on subscribe so I will never run out!</li>
    <li> but this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t deliver the promises.  I have been using it for about a month and have not noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am just glad it didn&#x27;t cost me a fortune to discover this.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> I love it and will purchase again</li>
    <li> The change in my forehead has been so dramatic that I was compelled to write a review. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and take decent care of my combination skin, but had been noticing two horizontal wrinkles across my forehead and a vertical one between my eyebrows. These wrinkles were becoming alarmingly prominent and I tried this product with a restrained optimism. I am thrilled with the results in just a month and noticed a significant difference after a week. Wish I&#x27;d taken before and after photos, but you can be assured that this product works and works quickly. Highl recommended!</li>
    <li> I received the product in a good amount of time, and used it for the first time last night.  It felt nice, smelled nice and did not affect my skin in any negative way at all, which I&#x27;ve read that some people have that problem.  I had been using a different one for sensitive skin for a few months before getting this, so maybe that helped.  I am very excited to use this product and hope to see some excellent results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not really been bothered by wrinkles, particularly since I use sunscreen every day. However, I just turned 55 and started noticing deeper wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck. I bought a bottle of Rapid Wrinkle Repair (night) and although it took longer than a week (I&#x27;d say 3-4 weeks), I have really noticed what I might call dramatic results in my skin tone. The wrinkles are significantly less defined, and my skin tone is tighter and younger-looking. Just last week someone told me they thought I was in my early forties and were surprised that I was 55. That&#x27;s worth my money anyday! This product (Day and Night varieties) are now both on my beauty staples list.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome! every woman should have it. you see the reuslt next day you wake up! the skin becomes more even and wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much but you have to use it every night to keep it going.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t wipe away decades, BUT it does ease the finer lines and wrinkles.  I look more rested.  I&#x27;ve used alot of creams and can see a visible difference with this.  I noticed it after a couple of nights... recommend using it every night after cleansing face and neck areas.  I&#x27;m running low on this and am about to re-order now.</li>
    <li> The scent of the product overwhelmed any good it could have done me.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s impossible. And I know that 3 days is not allowing nearly enough time to pass. But on this day, I woke up with tighter skin. I could feel it.... but THEN I looked in the mirror... and I swear it looks like 5 years is gone. The broken capillaries are still there... some patches of discoloration still there... but my entire face feels and looks LIFTED and smooth and rosy.&lt;br /&gt;I am a smoker. I hate my addiction ... hate cigarettes... but at this moment in time I can&#x27;t seem to kick the habit. My skin is starting to show the evidence of the habit. I am 38.&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks ago I started a regimen of daily juicing... excercise and detoxing herbal teas.... preparing my body for quitting cigarettes... so I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the difference in my skin today was kick-started by my detoxing.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... I do know its working from the tell-tale retin-a like beginnings of dry skin (sloughing off the old skin)... I do not have dry skin EVER. I can see the faintest flakes forming. I expect that this day of beauty and youth will last no longer than today... I expect that tomorrow my face will start to crumble off (peel)LOL.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use retin A and remember well this certain feeling. And then I expect to not look my best for a month.&lt;br /&gt;I think this stuff works. Totally reminds me in&lt;br /&gt;almost every way (thus far) of retin-a!&lt;br /&gt;update: well... I did some research and it turns out the \\&quot;rapid\\&quot; effect is not due to retinol sa in this formulation. It is due to the hyralaunic acid. From what I understand hylaraunic acid is all the rave these days because it has been found to significantly reduce the appearance of wrinkles within a weeks time of using it daily. The only thing is... The effect is created because  of moisture... And does not last..  It does not do anything for building collagen or repairing damage. The effects onky last as long as you are regularly using hylaraunic acid. AHA! No wonder I saw something of a miracle in just three days.</li>
    <li> Im an anti aging junkie who has acne, dry, and overly sensitive skin.  Everything and its brother irritates and will break out my skin. I can to this day ONLY wash my face with baby soap. I&#x27;m turning 30 in a couple years and very paranoid about looking older as I age. I&#x27;ve been using anti wrinkle creams of all sorts for the past 7 years. I have a bit of knowledge on what will work and why it will or why it won&#x27;t, for my skin anyways. As for ALL anti wrinkle products, you need to realize these are LONG TERM products, expect this to become as routine in your entire life as is brushing your teeth. If your older than 40, and you just started worrying about your wrinkles, its not going to be magic, its going to probably take a good year of consistant use, for YOU, your own worst critic, to start seeing results. However, starting in your early 20&#x27;s , with a good working product, will more quickly and somewhat permanently maintan that smooth skin. I was a HUGE ROC product fan. Until I really discovered what retinol does for you. With this neutrogena product it contains a rapid retinol, which means that the retinol within the product contains an accelerator to help it do what its suppose to faster. Retinol itself is very slow to work. So neutrogena figured out a way to accelerate its ability to help make us happier, a little faster. It is NOT a marketing ploy that they say its rapid, as some other reviews stated. So far, I love this product, it isn&#x27;t breaking out my skin, and like the box says, within a week 100% of women, including myself noticed results. It&#x27;s fragrence is much lighter than other scented products I&#x27;ve used and my face hasn&#x27;t been to irritated. Though i will admit, I didn&#x27;t slowly jump into this product like suggested for sensitive skin. I used this day and night everyday. I did get a little sensitive around the eye area, but this is truly probably only because of overuse. I was just so excited about how well this has been doing that I &#x27;just can&#x27;t get enough&#x27;. I do believe I have found a new love. I had very few wrinkles on ny face to begin with, but the few i did, were deep frown lines and two forehead lines. So far in just a couple weeks, they are definatly not so pronounced. And this is only a couple weeks, they say it takes about 3 months to notice \\&quot;real\\&quot; results. My face is so smooth and my blotchy uneven acne scarred face is finally becoming &#x27;uniform&#x27;. My makeup goes on so much nicer. My friend whom I see a lot said the other day after not having seen me for a week, wow, your face has REaLLY cleared up and looks so smooth. She doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m using any products either. So while we are are harshest critic, and may not think its working as good as we were hoping or think it is. Having someone else validate it, truly is proof.h&#x27;.

    <li> I am 33 and recently noticed some small lines around my mouth. I was looking for a nighttime product and this one got really good reviews. I have only used it a handful of times because it seems to dry out my skin a little bit. I have noticed the lines fading but I also notice it is brightening my skin tone and evening out dark spots so I only have to wear a tinted moisturizer. I am a loyal Olay customer and have only used the daily facials and lotion so I was a little unsure about trying this product but it&#x27;s great. I love the smell of it too.</li>
    <li> I used this product 3 or 4 nights in a row and everything seemed fine until my skin started flaking and I noticed extreme dry spots under my eyes and around my mouth. I also had a burning sensation around the eyes. I stopped using this product for a few nights, assuming it \\&quot;was working\\&quot;, as indicated on the box, but it&#x27;s been almost a week and my skin is still flaking and the skin under my eyes is still dry and red, and seems to have lost elasticty?!?  I bought this at ULTA so I am going to return it and get my money back!</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t see results yet.  I am going to give it more time and write back either excellent or hate it</li>
    <li> My wife really didn&#x27;t like how there wasn&#x27;t any information on what age group this wrinkle cream is for. She looked high and low, unable to find anything. Despite this, she reluctantly gave it a try; my wife had a very bad reaction to it, in which she described as a burning feeling and promptly stopped using it after a few attempts. I don&#x27;t think a burning sensation is such a great reaction also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this night cream to my mom and she shared with me her bad experience with a Neutrogena product. She mentioned that in about a month of using the cream, she got more wrinkles as the product was not for her age group. At the very least, Neutrogena should clearly state what age group this is for and what can happen to those that use it that are younger.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and love the texture and fragrance. I would however like to know the concentration of retinol. Is it a therapeutic dose? If I know the dose and tolerate it, I would move up to a stronger dose. Called Neutrogena and they would not provide me information. I will switch to SkinCeuticals.</li>
    <li> THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product on Wednesday night, July 18, 2012. The first thing I noticed was the pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has an open and close setting.  Also this product feels light and fresh on the skin.  It is not greasy or oily at all.  It does take a few minuntes after application to fully integrate into the pores but that is all; in my experience.  You don&#x27;t need to worry about getting the product on your pillow either.  By the time I actually went to bed my skin felt normal and dry;  the product fully absorbed at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any irritation or redness to contend with in the days following its use.  I am seeing a noticeable improvement in the appearance of my skin as the days pass.  It is noticeably clearer, smoother and healthier looking in general.  I see a healthier looking glow to my skin.  Also friends and family members have commented on how good my skin looks and have asked me what I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is not bad either. I have spent way more for product that really didn&#x27;t do much at all.  I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD&lt;br /&gt;The type on the instructions to use are so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to read them.  This was annoying.  Would love to see maybe a printed insert in the box with readable size print regarding instructions for use.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about four months now and see no noticeable difference in wrinkles, fine lines, skin texture, anything.  If anything, it&#x27;s a little harsh for my skin and I sometimes get bumps/redness from it (so I only use it every other day, so maybe that&#x27;s affecting its effectiveness).  Meh, still searching for a good wrinkle cream...</li>
    <li> The product matches the description.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product made me break out a rash! I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t recall another time this has ever happened with any other product. I love the Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Serum but this lotion was BAD NEWS for me!</li>
    <li> funny my family all got together over the holiday and some of my relatives hadn&#x27;t seen me for a year and they all noticed a huge change in my face.  I had recently lost ten to 15 pounds combine with this product has been awesome!  Erased 10 years off my age thank you!</li>
    <li> This product feels nice on the skin, and is easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, Not all its cracked up to be!&lt;br /&gt;Certainly does not help 60 yr old wrinkles !!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle contains Teflon! ( PTFE ).  Yuck!  Not safe to cook with and wouldn&#x27;t want it on my skin.  Who knows the long term effects?  Better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> So far this is not working. Mine came with no seal on the bottle or the box. I wonder if I have the right product in this bottle. It says there may be a mild tingling or redness as it works--nope, nothing. It seems like it is only a good moisturizer. Which is also strange because the box says it may cause flaky skin which a natural part of the anti-aging of the product. No flaky skin, no redness, no tingling, and no wrinkle reduction in a box with no seal and no instruction insert.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this every other night for a few weeks but it seems nice. I am not noticing a huge difference in lines on my face but I will keep watching.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  I have used Mary Kay for many years, and decided to try something new.  This has a little more fragrance than I&#x27;d like in a night cream, but it replaces the 3 step MK process quite nicely!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Katie Couric show and the claims made sounded pretty good and at a good price so I wanted to try it.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and while it is probably too soon to say overall I do believe it is helping.  If nothing else it is definitely a great night time moisturizer without spending $75 to $100 or more.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The rapid wrinkle cream works well and I noticed a difference in my skin after a couple of weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Received this item on time and the price was good. I use this every night and it&#x27;s really gentle. Not greasy. It works well. It lasts more than a month.</li>
    <li> Be careful of this product. Very painful burning of the skin with even the minimum application. Yes, it exfoliates, but in a very painful manner!</li>
    <li> I had run out of my Retinol cream and needed somthing to tide me over until I was able to repurchase. I did some research and discovered this product. I have used it for two weeks and found it to be a good temporary replacement for my Retinol cream. It would be very useful for anyone with sensitive skin who can&#x27;t handle a stronger product.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product, you can&#x27;t beat the results. My skin was brighter, and I can best describe it as looking like I had more rest (Although, unfortunately, I did not.) I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Cream. I work over night so my sleep is not always so complete. Therefore, my sleepiness is evident on my face. However, with the use of this cream I have even gotten comments on how rested I look. I put one pearl drop under each eye and another around my mouth area. Then I spread it all around my face until absorbed. I do this just before I go to work and I notice the difference. I have lost all sense of sleepiness from my eyes and my minor facial wrinkles are disappearing as well. I am a 59 year old man and I think that this product is great for both women and men.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this one star because there is no option for giving it less.  Although I did not have any of the irritation problems  others commented on it does not do anything it is supposed to.  It feels unpleasantly slimy, the smell is overwhelming and awful.  It smells like canteloupe while it&#x27;s wet.  After it dries it smells like a dirty ash tray.  I consider this a waste of money and will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> It really works.  I see an improvement after only one week.  It&#x27;s not a facelift or an eye job, but it definitely makes you look better.</li>
    <li> Gave up the expensive stuff for this - it works!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  First time to use this product.  Already seeing some results.  Would tell anyone about it.</li>
    <li> Love the texture (and not-too-perfumed smell) of the product. Feels like it&#x27;s hydrating at least as well as the expensive department store stuff. Is it diminishing fine lines/wrinkles? Doubtful, but it feels good and the price is right. My great-aunt said that the only real treatment for wrinkles -- up to a certain age -- is some meat on your bones and good genes!</li>
    <li> I used Obagi in the past but found it cost prohibitive. Now I use only Neutrogena products. At night I wash with&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser with my MIA I, then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night. Before I go to bed I use Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration, Night.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning rinse and wash my face gently. I only use the Mia at night.&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30, for daytime use. Sometimes I use the toner before applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a prescription for Tentinon (retinol) cream then you would use this at night mixing it with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night</li>
    <li> It burns, skin flakes off.. used it for weeks now every other night before bed. I started out using it every night but when the burning didn&#x27;t stop I went to every other day as Neutrogena suggested. It didn&#x27;t work. Skin peels and burns just touching with my fingertips. It&#x27;s been 4 days since I&#x27;ve used it and my skin still stings when I touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; :( and it made my wrinkles worse. I regret using it.</li>
    <li> purchased as present for relative, no complaints, assuming it was good, i am a guy, what the hell do i know about cosmetics?</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Wrinkle repair day time formula with the SPF 30 and love that product (used it for years), so I decided to give this a try...not a good idea. I have a tan complexion and pretty tough skin - do not have many reactions to lotions. I tried this product on my neck area because I am starting to get some fine wrinkles from age/sun damage (I am in my 40&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck broke out in large red rash which I am currently combating right now with moisturizer and a mild steroid cream to stop the inflammation. It is itchy and the skin is dry and flaky and appears to be sun burnt - I also have a burning sensation on my throat from the rash. I&#x27;ve used Retinol products before without problems so this is a surprise to me. This product was not cheap but I&#x27;ll have to throw it away as I can&#x27;t recommend or give this product away to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I love that this cream leaves my skin noticeable smoother.  I even use it in my eye area without any irritation.  I used to use Retin-A which can be very drying but it proven to reduce wrinkles, in comparison, this is definitely not as strong or drying, but I think it does a great job given the price and is good enough to use nightly. I&#x27;ve used it a few months and I think my skin looks quite good and my complexion has even out a bit, so for that it&#x27;s a yes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting with this product as I have never used a wrinkle-reducing product before, but I am seriously impressed!  I have very fair, sensitive skin and I was worried this would cause a lot of irritation but aside from a slight tingle when I apply, nothing.  No redness, no burning!  It truly does live up to its own hype as well, my skin felt amazing the next day and I saw improvements in discoloration and fine wrinkles within a week.  I use it nearly every night (unless I forget) in combination with either Simple cleansing wipes or my own cleansing oil mix (castor oil with avocado oil and a dash of tea tree oil if I&#x27;m breaking out) and it does the same great job no matter which method I use for cleansing.  I&#x27;m super happy with this product and I&#x27;ll definitely rebuy.  However, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent even using this five nights a week for over a month so I don&#x27;t anticipate needing to repurchase for quite a while.  I&#x27;m so happily shocked that something this affordable lived up to its claims.</li>
    <li> Love it. I saw result the first week</li>
    <li> My skin did not like this and I broke out really bad. It felt extremely greasy. I guess I just don&#x27;t have the skin type for it. I&#x27;d suggest you try to find a way to get a sample first to see if it works with your skin type before you shell out for a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I saw almost an immediate improvement in my skin. My skin was softer, moisturized, and I could see less fine lines. I would definitely recommend. I use it every night. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I absolute love this product and I will buy more and more :)</li>
    <li> Decent hydration, but it made me break out within a few days of use. I have fairly sensitive skin, but I guess I am more sensitive than I thought.  It was not what I was looking for as it provided me hydration, but gave me pimples.. Stopped,and they were gone.  Tried again a week later and like clockwork, I broke out again.  Stopped using it and haven&#x27;t had problems since.  Maybe it is just me, but be careful.</li>
    <li> My dermatology technician recommended it for night moisturizer.  Use it daily and like the results.  This is second bottle I ordered.  Price is 20% less than in store.</li>
    <li> Oh my God this stuff is awful.  I am a 35 year old male. I have a nice clean face blonde hair blue eyes. I still get carded for beer regularly.  I used it last night and woke up with pockmarks on both sides of my face. I was HORRIFIED!  I have never had acne in my life.  I just used this to stop any crows feet around my eyes and I woke up with pockmarks and redness on my face. It better not be permanent. They are lucky they don&#x27;t get sued.  Run far and fast!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, like all the Neutrogena products I have used.  Am able to apply and use on my sensitive skin, and I do feel that my skin is smoother since starting to use this.  I alternate days with Oil of Olay Total Effects.</li>
    <li> More than 3 weeks to receive this product. I would expect faster shipment. Product is OK but I did not see difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by this OTC wrinkle cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and my skin looks better than it has in a long time. I&#x27;ve used various strengths of Retina A over the years so I did not experience and stinging or peeling. I would recommend those with sensitive skin to start using every other day to see how their skin tolerates retinols. Very happy and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and sensitive, i had a reaction after the second day using this product. My skin literally peel off, i will spend more money trying to get my soft skin back, now i feel my skin like a cactus (SUPER DUPER DRY)....so sad</li>
    <li> This product was actually delivered to me by mistake, as it was the Rapid Tone Repair I had ordered. But, this is product is the best ever...so happy they made a mistake. I have been using this product for the past 2 weeks and it has done wonders for my skin, it is ever good in evening my skin tone even better than the actual Tone corrector, and it makes my skin so smooth and clear. In the mornings when I wake up my face looks so fresh. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles and I&#x27;m close to hitting 30 so this product is a great start for me to maintain my young healthy looking skin. I strongly recomment it, I will soon be ordering two more to ensure I don&#x27;t ran out!</li>
    <li> I have used used this line of products ( wrinkle repair serum, night, tone corrector and eye repair) consistently every night for over a year.  I have not noticed any noticeable results that other reviewers have mentioned.  I have used eye cream and moisturizer since I was 15 years old so I really don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles except for the lines around my mouth ( I am a smoker).  My best advice is to use a good moisturizer and the amazing Derma Wand (available on Amazon) for truly remarkable results.  I have been using this device for 3 months and I look at least 10 years younger!  The lines around my mouth have diminished to an astonishing degree.  I use this wand consistently every day and can honestly recommend the results.  By the way, I am in my 60&#x27;s and people guess me to be in my early 40&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s real smooth going on have seen some changes but not drastic with continue using I use the daytime moisturizer for neutrogena during the day so i&#x27;m not sure which one is working but i think there working together great product</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re over 40 and are trying to slow the signs of aging, you should be using retinol. I have used many different and expensive products and this one is just as good as those more pricey retinol products. i recommend as part of a anti aging regiment.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I wouldn&#x27;t go to bed without it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Not sure if it actually does what it claims, but I do like how soft my face feels afterwards, and that softness is still there in the morning. I like the smell too, it&#x27;s not strong like the Olay products I have. After a few uses, you do get some stinging and dryness which the box states is normal and I&#x27;m guessing is &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin being rebuilt (like a sunburnt), I get it around the temples and under the eyes for some reason. Anyway, does make your skin very soft and smooth though.</li>
    <li> OMG I think im allergic to this product! When i started using it, each day my face will create a huge pimple... Now, cant even look at myself! It was a disaster! And pimples consistently stay and eventually darken and leave mark on my face! I regret using this! My skin wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Just wanted to look healthier, younger and clearer but all i got are pimples!!!! Very disappointing! I grew up with neutrogena, but when i reached my 30s their products are not working anymore to me!</li>
    <li> It came in 2 days and I love it.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth lines without irritating my skin. A staple for my nightly skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of previous reviewers - for a drugstore product this item is very effective. Definitely see a clearing, smoothing effect on my skin after a month or so of use. Because it is a retinol, and fairly drying, I rotate it out every other night with my wonderfully moisturizing Algenist night cream. Mildly scented, but not unpleasantly so, and the scent fades quickly.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and was hoping that it was not an exaggeration. Well after about 3 weeks I have noticed some difference, but&lt;br /&gt;not the miracle cream that others have posted.  It is okay, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs which is a major plus for me.  (I have sensitive skin, and every lotion I have tried has irritated my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t.  Hopefully I will keep seeing a difference the more I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not too heavy for my oily, aging skin. Great price here.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Wonderful, light consistency yet somehow very hydrating.  Because of some of the reviews on here, I was worried about the &amp;#34;overpowering&amp;#34; smell but it is not a heavy smell at all. Very light and fruity. I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all. I was using the other Neutrogena Retinol product &amp;#34;Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream - Night&amp;#34; but this one is so much better.  Well worth the few extra bucks.  I love the pump too so much better than the tube on the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the important stuff:  the wrinkles.  I seriously feel like I have less wrinkles now but that may also be because my use of this product happened to coincide with my skin suddenly decided to turn all pubescent on me (for the record, I am 36 years old).  This happened BEFORE I started using this so you don&#x27;t have to worry it will have this effect on you:) Anyway, I now have incredibly oily and pimply skin with little whiteheads everywhere.  Luckily, the whiteheads have been disappearing now that I am using the same skin care regimen millions of 12-year olds use (benzoyl peroxide 10% and salicylic acid astringent applied afterwards) but my skin is still very oily.  Given the amount of inner oils I now have, I cannot imagine a wrinkle ever being able to form so I guess there is an upside to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am not so sure what is doing it but I will keep using this cream just in case ;)</li>
    <li> This takes longer than you think to work. Use it every other night until your skin becomes used to it. Put face oil or night cream over it to seal in moisture. After 3 months, my skin is more radiant and I need less make up. A great bargain for a retinol without having to get a prescription for one!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I&#x27;ve been using satisfied with the results! Will keep using this one, coz I noticed when I ran out on my first one and I used my regular moisturizer, my skin looked dull. Fortunately my second order came in on the third day after I ran out. Will be using this for a long time!</li>
    <li> I am using this product (Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer SPF 30) during the day, alternating with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 30 during the day also and using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night at night. After more than two weeks (the ad claims one week), I see some improvement but nothing to jump up and down. I will continue to use all three products and give these products more time to work on my face. I will report back after one month. The good thing about these products is the price. They are reasonable to buy all three. I will report back after one month. At this point, I give three stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell. I gave it to a friend who likes it.</li>
    <li> First reaction on my skin was slight reddening and puffiness. Both responses do subside after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is the &amp;#34;puffiness&amp;#34; that sort of helps &amp;#34;lift up&amp;#34; some facial wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes heavily. I recommend washing your face well in the mornings. ( I have been using it at night, as per product name). Strangely enough, after cleansing your face, it feels dry and a bit tight. So I apply a different moisturizer before applying make up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, even though it does not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; wrinkles, there seems to be some sort of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;i will certainly continue to use it. The price is right as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to moisturize well and perhaps reduce fine lines (I haven&#x27;t been using it regularly enough to fairly say). But the scent is just too strong for me and I often opt not to wear it. It makes my eyes water a bit and is really not the last lingering smell I want as I drift off to asleep. I will keep using it until the bottle is empty but then switch to another Neutrogena night cream.</li>
    <li> Nice and light for nightime.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again didn&#x27;t see any real change, though</li>
    <li> I have been using this nightly for well over 2 months. I am 30 and wanted to take some steps to help my skin out. In the past I never used a moisturizer at night.  I did notice that my skin needed to be exfoliated maybe once or twice a week when I started using this product, it really does turn over the skin cells. I had a few &amp;#34;white bump breakouts&amp;#34; that I read about in the reviews, but those went away with consistent use of the product. I have sensitive skin and this product does not sting or burn when applied. Also it smells nice and is in a heavy duty container that you can lock after use. Will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, I have a deep set frown in the middle of my forehead and I do not see NO difference yet so I do not think I will recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many wrinkle creams and serums and for the price this has given me the best results. Many people comment and say I have beautiful skin, and I definitely think it&#x27;s because of this night cream. I use the night serum and it does tend to dry out your skin like any retinol product so you must use a good moisturizer. I use Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle cream during the day. This serum is a very good alternative to Retin-A.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Can&#x27;t say it reduced wrinkles, but my skin looks nice.</li>
    <li> First time to use and I&#x27;ve had it less than a month.  It wont work miracles on an 85 year old!</li>
    <li> I really could tell after a week, my small lines were almost gone!! Even the dark circles looked better, I don&#x27;t have bad dark circles. One thing, I started getting flaky skin under my eyes, it was peeling, it does say it can happen, then to put it on every other day, what I was doing, I was putting it on twice a day lol.. I know it says once but wanted to see if it worked faster lol.. The flaky skin only lasted like 3 days, I had stopped using it, and it was gone. Now I just do it every other day or so. It really did work, I really wasn&#x27;t thinking it would work, I always think, if it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot, it isn&#x27;t going to work, but this stuff work great! I just looked younger, looked well rested.. I definitely will buy more when I run out! It is worth a try!! I know everyone&#x27;s skin will respond different, but I would give it a try, especially if you&#x27;ve been using expensive stuff!</li>
    <li> Noticed a big improvement in skin texture and less fine lines. Fragrance is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, the daytime one, for four days and it has improved a lot of my wrinkles! Some of them have completely disappeared! I&#x27;m 68 years old and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I just began using the night time one last night. I have had no adverse reactions to the product.</li>
    <li> Got this with other Neutrogena facial products because the price is way better then buying it in a store, and ....it works and has been for all the years I&#x27;ve been using their products.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market! I use this every day and night. The bonus points: my adult acne cleared up along with the fading of fine lines. I sincerely hope that Neutrogena never stops making rapid wrinkle repair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this neutragena rapid wrinkle repair from an outside source and I love it.  It does what it say! Period .  I wanted more dramatic results and I purchased retinol in 1% and 2%.  Well it cleared up my cystic acne but left me irritated.  After 30 days I did not look youthful.  I went back to neutragena after 2 days my youthful appearance returned.  I will never stray from this product again. It works, and it works fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. My skin seems smoother and clearer but am not noticing much with the wrinkles lessening. I don&#x27;t&#x27; know, I thought that it was going to do more.</li>
    <li> It does take consistent use for a week but eventually it does remove the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Botox and this. Wondering if this works. Feels good</li>
    <li> Love this product, moisturizes without making my skin break out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked that it actually does what it says it does. Very good product. Highly recommend, and you WILL see results in one week.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for the fragrance-free</li>
    <li> it does have a strong fragrance but that is its only downside. I&#x27;m 44 with typical skin for a 44 yr old guy who uses facial products, if you get my drift and for $15 this really delivers! Noticeable SMALLER PORES, EVEN TONE, BRIGHTER, PLUMPER AROUND THE DELICATE EYE AREA. My skin DOES look better and several friends, in only two weeks have made the comment everyone wants to hear, \\&quot;your skin looks great, what are you doing?\\&quot; SOLD!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom (she likes to try new products) and she used the phrase &amp;#34;very impressed&amp;#34; several times.  She wouldn&#x27;t say it if she didn&#x27;t mean it.</li>
    <li> I really love it. I&#x27;ve read some reviews not so favorable but to me it&#x27;s really working. I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many night creams over the years but Rapid Wrinkle Repair is one that really makes my skin appear smoother without the redness that some retinol creams can cause.  Not too harsh and a very nice creamy moisturizer.  Great for aging skin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkles yet..!</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> After reading the favorable reviews on here I decided to try this product. I have to say, their 100% of people seeing results seems like BS to me. I have been using this product for about a month and I am not seeing any results. At all. I am 28 and have a couple of very fine lines forming on my forehead. After tracking my skin with photos since I stated, I am 100% sure that nothing has changed with my skin.</li>
    <li> it has showed evidence of working within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Still using it. Will need to update after use for a month.</li>
    <li> The product may work, but the smell is perfumy and overpowering. I use the other Neutrogena retinol night cream and it works great. It has no scent or a very subtle one. This one gives me an instant headache. Hopefully I can return it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel and look like I&#x27;m 2 years old! Was skeptical at first till I tried this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin so I can use it every night.  I can see a slight improvement in lines.</li>
    <li> Really like this product but it seemed as though there was very little lotion in the bottle for it did not last long as most bottles I have purchased in a store.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a month and have seen a reduction in the lines around my eyes.  Look forward to more improvement as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Flaking, peeling, red skin.  After one use my face looked and felt horrible.  I tried another retinol product in the past and had the same results.  Even using it once makes my skin angry. Oh yeah, pimples too.  Concluded I&#x27;m just allergic to retinol. That&#x27;s why I gave it three stars.  I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s effective but not for hypersensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> You really see a difference in fine lines.</li>
    <li> I am 22 but I live in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details about my skin:&lt;br /&gt;Caucasian. Light skin. Though I&#x27;m inside most of the time, I don&#x27;t burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;Oily in the T zone.&lt;br /&gt;In my teens I had one or two blemishes ALL the time. Nothing severe.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use the Neutrogena exfoliating gel cleanser at night and in the morning... I still break out during that time of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last 2 years my skin has gone down hill... Not in breakouts... It just got dull and I started getting forehead wrinkles. This cream fell into my hands and I LOVE it! I&#x27;ve used it for a week and my wrinkles are faded. My skin glows. Literally... it glows. I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to the cream and I plan to keep using it.  LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months at a remote arctic work camp, applying to my face and neck once each evening.  I would describe the scent as pleasant, and an excellent cover-up for diesel odors. Last week a 17 year old siberian yupik boy at the nearby fishcamp offered me a baleen ring as a token of his affections. His family tried to tell him I was 30, but he insisted that I wasn&#x27;t any older than 22, and that he was \\&quot;old enough\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week has involved a lot of uncomfortable cougar jokes and awkward eye contact.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I am 51 years old and thrilled to report that my skin looks brighter, firmer and just plain younger. I noticed results in about a week and even more after a month. And the price is great. Try it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena products and this is no exception</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and Neutrogena works perfectly for my skin. I definitely recommend this product. It is a good option and pretty affordable.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair is one of those products that you buy seriously hoping that it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do: erase fine lines, make skin bright, supple and soft. I bought it and the first night I put it on it did burn/sting a little bit, though I did not see any redness. I decided to use it three times a week to give my skin some time to get used to it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and not only does my skin look good, but it feels divine; so soft and silky, not a blemish in sight. The fine creases on my forehead are a lot less \\&quot;deep\\&quot; as well. I definitely recommend this product and not because I am a fembot ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.d. I love the fragrance as well, and one little dime sized drop goes a longggggg way!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work.  I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of face creams that don&#x27;t seem to work, but this one does, it can be a little harsh.</li>
    <li> After reading the fabulous reviews, I was skeptical about the effectiveness of this product. I can honestly tell you that it has made the deeper wrinkles in my forehead less noticeable along with the fine lines around my eyes smoother! I have been using this cream for about a month and started seeing results after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommended this product!</li>
    <li> im very happy with this product, theres just a few days using it and i can see the difference, im using it around my eyes and the lines are so soft now, finally a good product that works for me :)</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product, but quickly became disappointed when my skin became red, dry and started flaking off.  I pulled back to every other night, but that did little to help.  After I stopped using it took my skin a full week of very intense moisturizing to recover.  Couldn&#x27;t return fast enough!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do any good wrinkle reduction- and is terrines for sensitive skin, actually caused burning, redness and peeling</li>
    <li> I love this cream, alternating it with Ageless Essentials Hydration Night Cream.  This cream absorbs into my skin effortlessly and feels light and so non-greasy.  My skin is looking good and I do believe I have some wrinkle reduction by using the Neurtrogena range.</li>
    <li> The rapid wrinkle repair is okay.  I expected more from it, but it moisturized well.  This is not a product I foresee buying frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old. So why am I using this stuff? Well, I have some freckles from sun damage in my youth (ok, i&#x27;m still in my youth, but you get the point), also the sun has also given me some fine lines on my forehead ( due to oily skin and breakouts on forehead, i wouldn&#x27;t put sunscreen on my forehead or anywhere but my cheeks, which were prone to freckling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months in, and my freckles are almost all gone. Skin is smoother almost immediately, but other than that, this hasn&#x27;t really done much else. My fine lines are untouched.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks with no noticeable improvement. Granted, my skin is kind of trashed from all those summers with no sunscreen, but I was expecting to see something. So far, it doesn&#x27;t demonstrate any advantages over any other moisturizer. I bought two bottles, so I&#x27;m curious to see whether it has any effect after having used both (at this point, I&#x27;m skeptical).</li>
    <li> Do not see much affects.</li>
    <li> I am an older woman and I live in Arizona (not easy on the skin) but this product is improving some wrinkled areas. I will continue to use it - it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Blends smoothly and easily and really seems to leave your face soft and mosturized.  Best wrinkle repair product I have used so far.</li>
    <li> Ok this is some really potent stuff. I followed the directions and started slowly. Applied at night and woke up looking like a freshly boiled lobster! Not the look I was aiming for. Not to be detered I scaled back to once a week, that did not work for me either. My face turned into a raw peeling mess. This product may work for others but the process is too much for my skin. Proceed with caution.</li>
</ol>
