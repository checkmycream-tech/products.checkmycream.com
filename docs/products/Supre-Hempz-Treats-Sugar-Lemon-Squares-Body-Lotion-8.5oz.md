      <li>I keep this size in my purse (for touch ups on hands and such throughout the day) and a large one (for body and such) at home.</li>
      <li>This brand of lotion has a thick creamy texture, yet spreads easily on the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Aaaaaaaah. This lotion is unbelievably refreshing for dry skin and the smell is SOOOO good. I am a hand-lotion connoisseur - I have hand eczema and put on lotion every time I wash my hands. The moisturized feeling really lasts with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this lotion as a treat for my skin and fell in love! the smell is so sweet and inviting, it reminds me of the holidays! It leaves the skin soft without being greasy as with so many others lotions. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brand of body lotion is so creamy, it&#x27;s like applying whipped cream.  This particular scent doesn&#x27;t really smell like lemon, like many of the other reviews said.  However it is still a mild, sweet, more like a vanilla cookie scent.  I also have tried the strawberry cheesecake scent- great, and I also have the cherry one.  Also good.  This selection is still my favorite one. This brand of lotion has a thick creamy texture, yet spreads easily on the skin. A nice moisturizer, though I don&#x27;t use it on my face, just the arms and legs.  The smell is not overpowering so you&#x27;re not sorry you put it on, like some of those stronger smelling lotions from those mall fragrance/lotion/ soap stores. Pricy, but worth it.  I&#x27;m anxious to try the Vanilla Crème Brulee.  It would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> The smell is unbelievable, and the product is very moisturising. Great for tightening and keeping the skin supple.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED this LOTION. I was given this for a gift by my Hair Stylist in November. I&#x27;ve used the complete bottle before Christmas. I knew the minute I applied it to my skin that the scent was WONDERFUL and my skin felt INCREDIBLY soft. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles from Amazon. This Sugar Lemon Squares Lotion is something no other Body Lotion can compare to. I wish I knew where I could buy this lotion other than Amazon. I would buy this Lotion by the Gallon IF I Could!! Anyone who has not tried this Sugar Lemon Squares should put this on their &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34; List. Anybody who tries it will love the feel of their skin after applying it.</li>
    <li> It feels good on the skin and smells wonderful. It does not smell like &amp;#34;lemons&amp;#34; but rather like a lemon baked good. Like cookies, vanilla, cake, and some lemon. It has turned into one of my favorite smells. Its kinda expensive, but totally worth it to splurge on something nice for yourself. I keep this size in my purse (for touch ups on hands and such throughout the day) and a large one (for body and such) at home. Its thick, nut not too thick... thinner than a body butter thicker than a lotion.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this lotion smells of fresh lemon cookies so much so that if I&#x27;m hungry and I put in on my tummy starts growling. The cream is nice thick but lays on smooth and my skin feels like buttttahhh, smh at the price of this lotion on amazon T.J maxx has it for 6.00 dollars and will continue to buy it from there.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this body lotion.  Product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, but it doen&#x27;t last very long.  The moisturizer  is  fabulous.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin, and you love the smell of lemon baked anything, (lemon cupcakes, tarts, custard, anything involving cream butter sugar flour and lemon) then this lotion is for you.</li>
    <li> Out of the three I have tried, this is my least favorite (sugar lemon squares) I am a big lemon fan and was hoping for more of a lemon smell.. It&#x27;s smell is the weakest and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the others I have tried. I still like it and loves these lotions.. Was just hoping for a little more out of this one.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, but it&#x27;s too expensive for me to continue buying it!  This is for a gift for my sister!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have always had very dry skin.  This is my second bottle.  Because I used it this winter I had none of my usual skin problems.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!It is like smoothing a lemon Oreo on your body!! Well worth the money. Delivery was fast!!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes me feel very soft, but the scent just isn&#x27;t there. Perhaps I was just expecting something stronger. Good product overall though</li>
    <li> I love this. Starts my day off happy....just such a good smell.  I also have eczema and this is a nice thick lotion that&#x27;s not over scented, so it doesn&#x27;t make me itchier.</li>
    <li> My niece loves this product so much that I have to order it for her every birthday and Christmas.  Smells like freshly baked Lemon Bars......mmmmm!!</li>
    <li> This is the most delicious soft lotion I have ever smelled. It really does smell like something you would eat. I would recommend wearing it for your boyfriend lol, it drives my boyfriend crazy. Got it at Tj maxx for $6, but I will definitely spend the extra money to buy it here if I have to.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent for anytime but I particularly like it for warmer weather. Lotion is so thick and spreads so nicely. So nice smelling you can imagine the lemon squares. Refreshing!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for fresh and tangy citrus scent - don&#x27;t buy this product!!!  There is absolutely no trace of citrus - lemon or otherwise.  If you like sugar cookies or vanilla scent then this product is for you. Nothing wrong with vanilla - but it should be labeled as such.  VERY disappointed in this purchase and will not buy this line again.</li>
