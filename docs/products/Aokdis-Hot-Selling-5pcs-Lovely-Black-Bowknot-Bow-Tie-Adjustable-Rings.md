    <li> These rings are cute and you do get 5 of them which is cool for gift bags or Christmas stocking stuffers. These rings were described as being having rhinestones on them and the rings that I got definitely were not rhinestones. It was plastic, in fact the whole ring was plastic. No rhinestones at all. Very misleading! I just wanted others who may be interested in purchasing these what you are in fact getting.</li>
