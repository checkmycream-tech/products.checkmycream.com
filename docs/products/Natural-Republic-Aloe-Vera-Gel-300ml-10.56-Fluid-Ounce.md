<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is very moisturizing, non-greasy, no stimulation of taste, well absorbed! After bathing rub the hair with good results!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, probably authentic, not as cheap as the ones I bought in hong kong. I use it for NuFace</li>
    <li> Love it! It feels so fresh and natural</li>
    <li> Love, we&#x27;re all very fond of.Mom and dad love, my wife love it too.I&#x27;ll tell my friend</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it meets the expectation. However, this dries very fast, gets very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I apply constantly and massage into the skin. Hydration is medium. I often use this product with other masks.</li>
    <li> I have combination, acne-prone skin. The products I use to control my acne tend to dry out my face, especially around the mouth and jawline. I feel gross using moisturizers because they&#x27;re either too greasy or irritating. I can use this gel day and night on my whole face after cleansing and it doesn&#x27;t make me greasy or break me out or irritate my skin. It feels sooooo nice tbh. I mean, gels always feel nice, but this becomes kinda sticky before drying? Idk. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have an issue with the alcohol content, but I must say that it&#x27;s not amazing at moisturization. If I apply it after cleansing and nothing else, my mouth area will start to get flaky after about 20 minutes. So I usually apply it all over, then follow with Hada Labo gokujyun lotion (more of a toner, but it locks in moisture), and basic makeup primer. No greasy face and no dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel gross. That&#x27;s a big thing for me. Honestly I probably owe my lack of dryness to the primer and lack of grease to my powder, but this is the only actual moisturizer product I use, so it&#x27;s still essential to my routine. PLUS, this tub is huge. I got it in early August and it&#x27;s now the end of December, and there&#x27;s about a third left. So that&#x27;s like 4.5 months per ⅔ product. So like, uhh, this should last you about 6.75 months if you use it twice daily. Haha math lmao.</li>
    <li> So  so so so NICE!!!! The best experience I ever had online, pile of samples and products are so good. Try it and you will love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Good for $$. I use it everyday and also for using any in home medical device, like MDPen (needle) and LED lights. Fantastic results.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. You get a lot of product for the low price. The scent is very lovely and fresh. Heals and soothes burns as well!</li>
    <li> It is soo cool and soothing when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;its a great cream to have because you can remove scars and also any itching sense on any part of the body..&lt;br /&gt;Another use which I recently found but did not try yet is it can be used on hair too..</li>
    <li> It feels amazing on the skin, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I use it twice everyday, once in the morning, layered under an spf moisturizer, and once before I go to bed. This product is light enough to layer under any of my other moisturizers and overall, very soothing. It makes my skin feel very refreshed, and does not clog my pores or break me out.  Sometimes I use it on my body on hotter days when I want to be moisturized, but not weighed down by heavier lotions. I&#x27;ve even used this as a soothing gel for my friend&#x27;s burn and it helped alot haha. This product is definitely worth the price as the container holds a lot of product. A little goes a long way, so it will definitely last me for a while. I love this product, and will definitely buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> After applying this, my face feels refreshed and has a cooling sensation. I use this as a base before I put on any product. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is just aloe Vera, basically.  That said, I use it to make my own lotions with all the little leftover products, less than perfect products, and as a substitute for more expensive gert products by adding glycerin to it and shaking it up.  Makes a great oil-free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived today a wonderful moisturizer for the face I advise you to purchase it.</li>
    <li> An amazing product which really hydrate your skin!!</li>
    <li> i used this one when i lived in Korea and i moved to US i was looking for this item cause&lt;br /&gt;it is perfect for mt dry skin before i go to bed i just apply this as much as i want and place this&lt;br /&gt;about 15min and gently massage my face and it helps my skin moisturize</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! its very natural and smooth!! My skin feels moisturized!! its my second time purchase it already!! :D</li>
    <li> i really love this. i have really dry skin after i shower &amp; this helps alot &amp; hydrates your skin quickly</li>
    <li> It is good for my skin. And really help my skin better</li>
    <li> It hasnt been a week yet, but i&#x27;ve been using it, and it&#x27;s pretty good. I had a bug bite, and I just put a tiny dab and rubbed it around, it solved the problem really. I put it in the fridge to cool. When I&#x27;m done cleansing I use it a moisterizer at night, it soaks in really well, and it&#x27;s super refreshing on your face. When you wake up your face is super soft and squishy, I will buy again. A little goes a long way~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great :) will definitely order again !</li>
    <li> So awesome! I can see why this would be a best seller. It feels like a lighter aloe gel that smells good. I put it on my body all over after showering. I&#x27;ve also put it on my cheeks initially but decided it is better for dry body areas. It will be perfect in the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> You can use it for your skin, your hair, moisturized base makeup when used as makeup base mixing 2:1, as soothing eye pack, for irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is jus amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is really great, it does what it states to do. &amp;#34;Moisturize and soothing&amp;#34;. I got it within two days because of Amazon&#x27;s Prime Free two day shipping. The only downside for me was that my local shippers had thrown the package over my gate because it was locked and probably didn&#x27;t want to get out of the truck to slip it in between the gate. So when i opened the package, the jar was cracked and luckily, only a tiny bit of gel leaked out.</li>
    <li> The skin feels radiant, soft and not sticky...better than lotion with a great smell...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is true aloe Vera! Loved the product because it locks water in your skin and there&#x27;s no sticky feeling at all. I use it for my face as well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for dry and sensitive skin. I can see my skin has been improved after several times of use. I used it as a bed time mask, and it turned out to be good.</li>
    <li> I have to say， I think maybe it is not real Natural republic alone Vera gel because last time my aunt went to Korea and bought a natural repubulic Aloe Vera Gel different from it, and about the smell like a washing power, so bad .</li>
    <li> To much alcohol can actually darken and sensitize your skin, so be careful when using this. Don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and has a consistency more gelatinous than most American &amp;#34;aloe gel&amp;#34; products. The first ingredient here is &amp;#34;Aloe Barbadensis leaf extract (92%)&amp;#34; (followed by alcohol, vg, pg, a host of fragrances, etc), while most American gel contains more water &amp; alcohol than aloe (in one big chain brand I happen to have on hand, &amp;#34;aloe vera powder&amp;#34; [powder?] is the LAST ingredient, so it&#x27;s really more &amp;#34;water gel scented with aloe&amp;#34; than anything else).  At least it seems here you&#x27;re getting mostly real aloe, though I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday as the alcohol could irritate the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t fully absorb; gets sticky after about 30 minutes and you have to wipe it off with water. However, it does leave the skin pleasantly soft &amp; moisturized, and when done at night before bed, I wake up the next day with my complexion noticeably clearer (the aforementioned big-brand American gel didn&#x27;t have the desired &amp;#34;next morning&amp;#34; effect, hence I came to Amazon looking for something with more aloe and less water/alcohol). Though I may continue looking for a product specifically designed for the face (less alcohol, more vitamin e additives, etc), I would definitely recommend trying this and may well buy it again - for the price, this certainly can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Girls don&#x27;t buy it. I&#x27;d would actually give it 0 star!</li>
    <li> I like the gel and feel cool and moisturized when I put it on.  :)</li>
    <li> just received it, it looks so useful ,lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really  really like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable after using it :)</li>
    <li> I like it, it absorbs really fast.  But it does have a tacky feel if you apply too much on.  It can be used all over the body.  I think really handy if I get sun burn or burn myself from cooking.  No scent, so I like that a lot.  If you are lucky enough to have a Natural Republic store near you (there&#x27;s one in Flushing, NY), it&#x27;s on sale for $6.50.</li>
    <li> The product comes in this big jar ( will last for a long time) and the product it self is effective</li>
    <li> I use it everywhere on my body. I usually have sensitive, combination skin with a lot of breakouts. I use this for my irritated skin after applying my acne medication and it really helps. My skin gets soft and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face moist and no residue. Feels like thicker water</li>
    <li> Reduces skin irritation after shaving&lt;br /&gt;Wet bad</li>
    <li> it cause me a rash !! :(</li>
    <li> Life saver! I have eczema and its been so hard for me to moisturize my hands often cuz I hate the feeling of lotion but whenever I apply this aloe it feels soothing and it kept my hands moisturized</li>
    <li> I have been searching leaps and bounds for a product just like this and I can relax now that I&#x27;ve found it! This is a fantastic product. At night when I put a facial moisturizer on the smell usually sends me off to sleep with a headache. But this product has such a natural smell to it that it does not bother me! This is 92% aloe vera. If you use 100% aloe vera it will never ever dry on your skin (I&#x27;ve had experience). Many people say this product has an alcohol smell to it but I disagree. The smell is very faint and without the alcohol you would be wearing a mask. This has improved my skin greatly, moisturizing and leaving it feeling very fresh. This is a top-notch product that I recommend to anyone like me who can no longer stand generic facial moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product on my face before I go to bed,  such nice feeling on the skin.</li>
    <li> keeping moisture!!!!!like it</li>
    <li> Not the best as far as quality and effectiveness goes but this is still good.</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ real great and the smell is nice</li>
    <li> Great price, great product. I got it for $8.99 and was a little nervous but so far I like it. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and I love the smell. It&#x27;s a great summer moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Soothing and cooling when I put it on my feet--They look much better also.</li>
    <li> Why? Because it actually works! Not only is it a great moisturizer for my skin but also helps get rid of my break outs. One time I had a huge zit on my cheeks and I put this on before I went to sleep and the next morning, that zit was smaller that it normally was. It pretty much calmed down the inflammation and redness. It soothes my skin well and for the price, it&#x27;s really affordable than the rest. It also last for a long time, Like 4-5 months for me. I think it&#x27;s a magical product and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and very moisturizing, without being greasy or making my face shiny. Will be buying again once this huge container finally runs out.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have in my morning and evening skin care routine! This is my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34;. It makes my skin soft and moisturized. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s great .</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day or every other day for over a month on my face and neck, and have definitely noticed a difference; my skin is smoother and more supple! Aloe vera is really good for skin and elasticity, and the gel when applied has a lovely light scent. It dries quickly and feels nice and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe vera can be used as eyeshadow primer as well; I apply a tiny bit of gel to my eyelids and brow bone before applying eye shadow! Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Its tacky after I put it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product! one of my top 3 that i will never stop buying! I rub this all over my face and i have definitely noticed my lines fading! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is MAGIC. I apply this morning and night after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face and it has done WONDERS for my skin. It makes my skin feel refreshed and soft. After using this, I rarely get any breakouts now and my skin is practically clear. This is an amazing product, and is the only thing I use as part of my skincare routine. Some reviews say that it&#x27;s a bit drying, which I notice mainly in the winter months but I just follow up with moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> It clears the pores in my skin &amp; makes my hair manageable &amp; shiny!!!!</li>
    <li> Superb, great smelling gel for your face or body!  perfect for summer moisturizing! After a shower.  Leaves a cooling sensation.  Best aloe gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is just so so , can not be used as day time moisturizer. Just not moisturizing enough . I use this after I use my serum and before I use my moisturizer. It&#x27;s just an average product . Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin better or worse . The quantity of this product is insane around 300 ml but just I don&#x27;t seem to get the quality out of this product . :(</li>
    <li> I love this especially in the summer, it&#x27;s not oily like lotions so you won&#x27;t feel greasy during the hot months</li>
    <li> Excellent！This product is full of high quality. It is a better choice to select the similar products from this seller.</li>
    <li> Realy love it so cool on my skin smell good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this until I had used it for a while. I suffer from a lot of redness in my face, and my skin is very very dry. I was wary of this product because of the alcohol content, but I have been using it for about 2 or so weeks every morning after my skin care regimen. It has helped cut down a lot of redness in my face, and helped slowly heal my acne scars on my face. It dissolves into the skin and it very light so you can use it as a morning moisturizer or sleeping pack if you felt your skin was sensitive lately/etc. I really like it, and you only need a pea size amount to cover your entire face (at least for me) and my skin has never felt softer. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and skin just to test it out and my skin stayed soft and didn&#x27;t dry out for almost the entire day which was a relief and a change from the dry skin I suffer from 24/7. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin and redness if their face, I can&#x27;t get over how much I love it, I will be buying it again and again, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be running out of product any time soon since you don&#x27;t need much. Love this product!</li>
    <li> very gentle to use on my face. good price. also works good on my body too. keep my skin moisture in dry season.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing! even after one use, my chicken skin is super smooth!</li>
    <li> First of all this product as the consistency of hair gel. When applied yes, it it cooling and refreshing, but it&#x27;s VERY similar to wearing an aloe Vera gel, stickiness included. However once the product dries on your skin then the stickiness goes away and it does make your skin feel very soft...but still dry. I feel like I still need a lotion...so...back to using my Shea butter it is.</li>
    <li> I just got this product yesterday and it&#x27;s already the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. Let me tell you something about my skin: I have sensitive combination/oily skin, which is quite possibly one of the worst skin combinations. I have a hard time with sebum control. After I got this product, I immediately went online to double check if it was the real deal (which I HIGHLY recommend, seeing as how popular this product is) I immediately opened it and put it on my face. It was a bit hard to open up the plastic separator (there&#x27;s A LOT of product--well worth your money). It took a few minutes to dry, but when it did it was very matte. I kept waiting during the day for my face to turn incredibly oily like it normally does, but it never came. My face stayed mostly matte, maybe slightly shiny on my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it came in WAYYYY earlier than expected. The estimated delivery said it wouldn&#x27;t be here until the middle of next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the bonderline of getting this product, please just buy it. It&#x27;s relatively cheap, especially compared to how much product you get (a giant tub thats the size of about half my face).  There&#x27;s so many other uses for this too. It&#x27;s a great buy and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great on burns too</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, oily combination skin which can be considered one of the worse skin types ever. Most moisturizers I used left my skin shiny and oily after 2-3 hours, especially in the T-zone area under makeup. When I found the seaweed line at the Body shop, I thought it was the best one to use, however, my skin broke out after two months. I was disappointed and on a search for better moisturizer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of seeking, I found this baby and let me tell you, this is the best of the best. I have used this day and night for over 5 months now and my skin has improved dramatically. In the morning, after putting on other fce serum, eye cream and sunscreen, I use this on top to moisturize my skin, lock in all other skincare products as well as a face primer. This helps control oil on my face and keeps my BB cream/foundation last all day. There has been no oily face during the day since I started using this gel. At night, I use it along with other retinol product and my skin feels so soft n smooth in the morning. This aloe vera gel feels really nice with the cooling effect when you first apply; it absorbs to the skin quickly and has the freshest scent ever. The HUGEEE container with tons of product will last you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this gel.</li>
    <li> The smell of this aloe is really catering to the female.  Strong perfume odor.  Works well though.  I would not purchase again due to the smell.</li>
    <li> I have moderate adult acne and my acne medication left my skin extremely dry and flaky. This product saved my skin! I liked it even before I knew it could help with my flakiness because of its immediate cooling/soothing effect. I first used Cure Natural Aqua Gel to exfoliate and get rid of dead skin then applied this on. After just a few days using it at night, the flakiness was gone! Now I only have to use Cure Natural Aqua Gel once every two weeks while still apply this gel on every night and my face remains smooth and soft. Even the smell is incredibly refreshing. Now some people might think why they put alcohol in it. Have you ever tried going to sleep with fresh aloe vera on your face? Well, your pillow will hate you if you do! The alcohol acts at a drying agent that would help shield the aloe vera gel into your face. The first min after you put this on, you will get the feeling similar to putting alcohol on to your face (without any burning sensation AT ALL), but that feeling will immediately fade away as the gel absolve into your skin. I already recommended this to all my friends and family and they too, love it!</li>
    <li> After reading such a lot of great reviews for this Aloe Vera Gel I ordered TWO. What a BIG disappointment. This gel has too much alcohol in it, (U can smell the alcohol). It is more drying than moisturizing. I would not recommend this brand nor would I purchase it again. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like how it absorbs really fast and it is very comfortable to use it, but it&#x27;s smell is very strong and a little bit fake....</li>
    <li> Good product, very smooth and moisture is worth it.... Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Keep in the fridge for a cooling, soothing treat after a shower or day in the sun.  Not going to vouch for moisturizer effects but it does feel good and soothing after heat exposure.  I don&#x27;t know about burns because I think pure Aloe would be better myself.</li>
    <li> I do like how it absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin. I only use it on my legs and arms though. I wouldn&#x27;t advise putting it on your face at all. Probably because I don&#x27;t really like the artificial smell on my face. I don&#x27;t like that this contains parabens and propylene glycol though! :( It would have been nice if the product had avoided those ingredients!</li>
    <li> I will always order this product.  I put it in my hair and on my skin.  It works wonders</li>
    <li> Love it. Skin gets moist without oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Love it!.  So many different uses!</li>
    <li> I bought this gel after reading the rave reviews. I have been using it for a while but I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin. I have very sensitive skin acne prone oily and dry depending on my monthlies. This doesn&#x27;t hydrate or nourish the skin. It sticks on like a mask giving that stretchy feeling all day. It made my skin look dull than it already is. My face looked shiny oily which made my pores look exponentially noticiable. Won&#x27;t be buying again. Time to look elsewhere. I was really hoping it would work for me like it did for others :(</li>
    <li> Took this on a family trip to Cancun. It&#x27;s kind of a lot for traveling, but we used more than I though we would and it really was a lifesaver! We all got sunburned and I put it on immediately afterward and re-applied before bed. The next day there was no sign of any burns! My husband put it on his mosquito bites and swore that they stopped bothering him after that too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for light moisturizing, not for winter</li>
    <li> Love it i never  get tire of using this my skin its so soft after this</li>
    <li> I put it in the refrigerator ~~~</li>
    <li> can use it to care my face, my hair and even my hand! perfect product from Korea, and I recommend my mother to buy one also~</li>
    <li> my face feel very comfortable to use it as a mask~</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get this product online, It&#x27;s only sold in stores. That being said, the ones that are being sold are fakes. One indication is the smell of it. It shouldn&#x27;t smell like hair gel, and the one I bought did. It&#x27;s really sticky and gross. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> overall experience 4 stars</li>
    <li> thanks for the sample sent and though I like the aloe mask, the bad thing is cover was cracked and dropped.</li>
    <li> This gel is huge! I only use as sleep mask before I go to bed.  (Aloe material should better not use in sunshine day in daytime. )although u can&#x27;t feel it made of 92percent aloe gel, it&#x27;s works good.  The next morning use cleanser foam to wash it or just use water , u will feel its much better and gentle than the skin care stuff u buy in the mall, u save a lot! And I have a baby, do I should use soap wash my hands all the time, it&#x27;s repair my hand! I love it!</li>
    <li> Tender, moist, not so sticky. When this is dried, your face will feel a little compact. This works well after sun burns. All in all, this product is awesome at this low price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. I like it so much.</li>
    <li> Help control my acnes very effective</li>
    <li> I use it regularly as a facial mask. Calms my skin very quickly and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews.  I bought it to use on my breast to counteract the side effects from radiation therapy for breast cancer.  I actually looked at the very tiny label tonight and saw a whole bunch of chemicals!!!  The kicker for me was &amp;#34;triethanolamine.&amp;#34;  This is what I found out with some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine is considered a moderate hazard ingredient by the Cosmetics Database, which notes as concerns. According to Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics, and the U.S. National Library of Medicine, there is strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant. One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at very low doses, especially when used around the mouth, eyes and lips, and one or more in vitro tests on mammalian cells show positive mutation results. It has been shown to cause bladder and liver cancer, as well as changes in testicles. According to OrganicConsumers.org, Triethanolamine can cause allergic reactions including eye problems, dryness of hair and skin, and could be toxic if absorbed into the body over a long period of time. It can cause itching, burning, scaling, hives, and blistering of skin, all symptoms which may increase with higher concentrations (The Green Beauty Guide).Triethanolamine &amp;#34;should not be used in products containing N-nitrosating agents to prevent the formation of possibly carcinogenic nitosamines.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I stopped researching when I got this product, threw this product in the trash and I will be buying an aloe vera plant tomorrow.  This chemical is not for skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it after going to the pool. It feels great on and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. It also smells great! I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Nuface microcurrent.  Works great and feels more natural then the more expensive gel that comes with the Nuface system.  Minimal to no smell. Also can leave on to moisturize since it is mostly aloe vera.  Very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> it feels fresh,makes your skin soft, and smells so nice, it reduces redness and makes rashes go away, but it does not moisturize the skin that much.. i used it for my hair too, helped to make it a little less fizzy.</li>
    <li> Nice and cooling, and a very big amount for the price!</li>
    <li> I dont think this should be a face moisturizer or anything like that because i just for fun put it in my body not knowing anything , i woke up the next day feeling my body that its so soft , not even dry specially my legs and it just hydrates my body i feel amazing when i have this as my body lotion. the big tub of this is the solution to all my skin problems.</li>
    <li> Helping heal dry skin.  Great facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like the coolness on my face and the fact that I have a product that is not greasy. I also use it around my hairline. I also like the fact that it is a large container so that it will last longer. I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> Needless to say, i&#x27;d love this item. As you know well, it couldn&#x27;t be better always... ^^&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to the others.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product. I have tried many other cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been very good to my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing feeling and the skin absorbed smoothly and easily</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than fresh aloe, but it&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff!  Refreshing, moisturizing, and comes in a HUGE container.  A little goes a long way.  I saw a significant improvement in my skin tone and my breakouts did not seem as raised and red when I applied this.  My skin is typically oily combination and acne prone.  I use this day and night under my SPF lotion and heavier night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i love it i buy it for my mother and i try it with her its really good and its cold</li>
    <li> It does its job, pretty moisturize and does not caused oily. I do not use it on face because it smells like alcohol, some people think the smell is aloe but I can tell it is alcohol. I have very sensitive skin and I just tried it on a little spot of my face, I feel a little bit pain like a bit burning and my skin turns red, so now I just use it on legs.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great smell. I think it helped my skin get smoother.</li>
    <li> When i got severe sunburn this helped to heal it very well.</li>
    <li> Not very effective, and not natural, so please think carefully before you buy this stuff, but the quantity is very large.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. Excellent for the skin. After shaving. After have been exposed to the sun. I love it.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer, but I find it it takes forever to sink in your skin and very gel-like substance. I have to reapply it multiplies times and it does make your skin soft. The best time to use it after you take a shower to get best results. The only reason i gave a three stars because I have dry skin so I need more powerful moisturizer than this one.</li>
    <li> Feels cooling and is not sticky. Definitely absorbs quickly and relieves redness of sunburn.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! You get a lot of product for the price you pay. Not only that but the product smells good and soaks into your skin right away. (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> The rave of this product is indeed true. It is moisturizing while absorbing quickly in the skin. It helps soothe irritation and it has also helped my pores a bit. Not to mention the smell which is heavenly. Also the tub is huge! I absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> This is very lightweight and I love using it in the summer. I bought this because I thought it would help my acne. I&#x27;m not sure if it made a huge difference, but I like how this gel felt on my face. I also found it easy for the container to get messy and gross. Maybe if the container were in a pump instead, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and it is very simple to use. It is not very sticky and dries smooth, but I don&#x27;t think it is extremely hydrating. Another thing is that it contains some &amp;#34;parabens&amp;#34; so just an FYI to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to use products with that in there. It is refreshing, but I can&#x27;t say it has any drastic benefits for skin.</li>
    <li> It feels cool on your skin but feels a bit thick.</li>
    <li> I bought it to my 15 year old boy has acne. I can see his face became less red and more clean after 3 days applied. It is good for oily skin with acne. The price was a little high compare the one in the shop.</li>
    <li> this product you can use it everywhere including face, hand and also body! also you can use this one as sleep cream and next day you will feel your face like a baby face. if you get sun hurt, you can also try this one. i tried this one and recovered.</li>
    <li> This very good product for the high sensitive skin its use for many ways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. burn place on the skin&lt;br /&gt;2. shaving&lt;br /&gt;3. put on circle cotton then on the eye&lt;br /&gt;4. moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and many</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand all the hype about this product. It makes you face feel kind of sticky and just didn&#x27;t reach my expectations since everybody made it seemed like it was amazing.  I was pretty let down. I not use it on my hair as I see no differences. It does feel really nice if it&#x27;s cold, especially putting it on after being out in the sun for a long time.</li>
    <li> it is nice. The gel make my face feel so cool and smooth.</li>
    <li> I just receive in 3 days and using only 3 days I see is really different on my skin is moisture, I will reorder it again! Love It!</li>
    <li> Not as &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; as other aloe veras I have used!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. I used it after I got some sun burned. It&#x27;s gentle to my sensitive skin, relief the skin and make the skin soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of aloe vera. Simply amazing. The gel feels so good on your skin. One thing I am slightly disappointed is that it doesn&#x27;t really work for sun-burn. I know this product has many uses. I&#x27;m still in the process of testing out this moisturizing gel. So far I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with what I bought.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother who has skin problems due to allergies. She likes it because it is soothing, and nice and cool if kept in the refrigerator. Great moisturizer for people who cant have thick, or oily creams on their skin.</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love the neat, clean, scent which is so subtle! It smells like the inside of a 1st class plane (when you first enter and it&#x27;s all sanitized) LOL.. I know it&#x27;s a weird scent but we all know it&#x27;s due to the alcohol. 😆 I don&#x27;t mind it since the aloe in it gets the job done. I have Keratosis pilaris (KP) &amp; I am using Amlactin but it ended up irritating my skin. I had red rashes due to all scratching night and day + the chemicals in Amlactin exfoliated the living daylights out of my skin. Anyway I tried moisturizing my skin with shea butter, regular mousturizers, oils, etc. but nothing helped. I then tried this aloe gel which was acted like an oasis in the dessert. OMG it felt so cool on my irritated &amp; bumpy skin. For the first time, I was not scratching/ itching. I may have to reapply it soon but the BIG tub would last me a while. It is cheap as well which is a huge plus. I am not sure if I would give up my cocoa butter for this one for my face though. It&#x27;s not THAT hydrating but like I said it&#x27;s good to relieve itchiness if your skin is irritated. I don&#x27;t shave (I epilate/wax) so I don&#x27;t know if it would burn. It didn&#x27;t burn on my epilated arms &amp; legs at all. It didn&#x27;t relieve those red bumps or my KP but still, I love it! 😄</li>
    <li> Feels good, smell is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like but it feels good, doesn&#x27;t stay sticky.</li>
    <li> I decided to add this to my wish list after seeing so many great reviews (and I won&#x27;t lie, seeing EXO advertise it also peaked my interest...I&#x27;m not ashamed...well maybe a bit). When I received it as a gift, I was so impressed with both the size and the quality of this product. The container is HUGE and the gel absorbs so quickly, leaving your skin super soft and moisturized. The smell is refreshing and light, sort of melon-like. I&#x27;m so excited to experiment with it- so far I&#x27;ve used it on my eyelids (on a gauze pad) as an eye pack, on my hands and on my face as a light moisturizer after I shower. Love it! Will definitely repurchase when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Great for your arms and legs, but too strong for the face. I keep it around for sunburns.</li>
    <li> highly fragranced!! I don&#x27;t suggest putting this on your face</li>
    <li> 1. It irritates&lt;br /&gt;2. It peels&lt;br /&gt;3. Drys out quickly&lt;br /&gt;4. Fake scent&lt;br /&gt;5. Not moisturized at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it based on the good reviews. One of the reviews says she uses it as foundation then put on bb cream whatever and she looks perfect. I did that and my co-worker said to me : &#x27;Oh no, your skin is too dry, you are peeling off.&#x27;  Then I realized it is the gel, it drys out like a glue. I don&#x27;t know what to do with it, I start to treat it as my night time moisture. Hell no, wake up next day, my face looks so dry, my pores are no obvious. Now it is in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> Good quality moisturizer for oily/combination skin. It does take atleast a week to 10 days to see a difference in the smoothness and firmness of the skin. It worked great on regular and acne scars, only took a week for the scar marks on my hands to go away and about 10 days for the acne scars on my face. I havn&#x27;t seen any difference on my stretch marks tho, but consistence is key while using this product. I use it both in the mornings (right after i wash my face/take a shower) and at night (right before bed). But if you have really dry skin, i would suggest using another moisturizer along with this product. Works great with the Nature Republic Soothing &amp; Moisture Aloe Vera 80% Cleansing Gel Foam and lasts for a really long time since you only need a little bit every time.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. My only issues is that like any aloe product it is a little sticky until it fully absorbs. The smell is very light and it did not irritate my eczema.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and works well. I had a rough spot on my leg from scratching and accidently putting certain lotion over it which made it look bad. After putting this on it, my leg lost its dark rough touch from the reaction.</li>
    <li> I love this product a lot; it helps my skin is  smooth and my hair is silky.</li>
    <li> It works so great! I don&#x27;t use any cream after I bought this one. I love it!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve just received it. supper fast shipping, well packed.&lt;br /&gt;it smell good, similar to the cucumber of Dove&lt;br /&gt;i will update my feedback after i use it for a week or so. the package is big, but since my skin is dried out, let&#x27;s see how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;so far, so good. it&#x27;s not sticky at all, feels like fresh cool water.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the service is amazing!! The gel smells very nice and I hope it&#x27;s gonna keep my skin hydrated. Will come back soon for a deeper product review. :)    Updated Review: 2/18/15  I&#x27;ve only used the gel for under 5 times because I am afraid that it might harm my skin. It&#x27;s not as hydrating as I heard from other reviews and isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; product I expected. The smell is definitely great, but it also contains this alcoholic scent with essence added for sure. It is a gigantic bottle, and I would say the volume does worth the price; however, I don&#x27;t think it would be too much of a nice product to be used for facial care on a daily basis. To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, unless to those who&#x27;ve used it before and have seen working results from it.</li>
    <li> Its ok. It has refreshing feeling an doesnt make me break out. I feel like it sinks in to quickly though. Im more used to cream than gel. My man use for it now is dabbing a cotton scrub pad in it and using it to get all the dirt off my face.</li>
    <li> Really great product. It does its job well: moisture my skin. I use this mask like almost everyday for around 5-10 minute. It smells good and i really like the jelly texture. I feel my skin super moisture after washing the mask off. It is only 10 dollars and I think it works better than Origins hydrate mask.</li>
    <li> I liked it buuut there are the alcohol;  I found after daily use it became a tad drying.  Wish I could continue to use it on the daily because it feels so good rubbing it on; it feels like you are still showering - it is indeed refreshing ! With that said, I still use it after being in the sun because it has been the best for soothing your heated flesh and yes even my hair likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it is still worth being under your sink :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for summer when I want a light moisturizer for my skin. However, I do wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t quite as strong.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and I glad I purchased it. I use it on my sun tanned skin to help heal and moisturize. Also, my hair and face.  Very cool feeling!</li>
    <li> Got it at first as a gift. I have very dry skin and no lotion helps. Yet this product works wonders. So, I have ordered 2; 1 for myself and 1 for mom.</li>
    <li> Great for greasy skin, acne prone I believe that is why have alcohol. not recommendable for dry skin. but awesome for greasy ones.. Also this can be use on your hair.</li>
    <li> Helps relieve my skin after sunburn. Nice product.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and doctor advised me to use aloe vera as cure for pimples and in general for soothing. I bought this product thinking it will be a soothing one for my skin but guess what? it turned out to be a complete disappointment. It makes you skin dry and there is no soothing or moisturizing effect. I think it doesn&#x27;t even contain aloe vera. I applied it to my hair to check whether it works but nope!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear NO NO!!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. Gets my face a lots moister feeling.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be for me, and it does moisten your skin--and my dad liked it so much he kinda took it.... Anyways, it&#x27;s cool to the skin and feels kinda jelly so you have to leave it on your face until your skin absorbs it all.</li>
    <li> It is so good. It smells amazing. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is most pure Aloe I could find anywhere. I did not want any alcohol and most have 2 different kinds and burned the area I was using it on. The Nature Republic Aloe does not burn is soothing. Next best thing to the Aloe Plant itself.</li>
    <li> It lasts 2 years. Very watery, but pretty good for face and body.</li>
    <li> This works so great! I put a lot before i sleep and sleep face up until it dries and i feel really soothed and relaxed!!!</li>
    <li> so great for sensitive skin.  I am using it everyday now and have bought 4 at one time</li>
    <li> love this after some sun</li>
    <li> Caused break outs on my face so I use it for body sometimes.</li>
    <li> This is a great soothing gel for facial massage, but it has a very &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; like smell to it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as natural as it is marketed.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, at first it&#x27;s watery then gets completely absored into the skin leaving it nice and comfterable. Less itching and really nice, after receiving a 2nd one from the seller as a gift I have one to my aunt and she loved it, she recommends this as her favorite to anybody she talks to. A really nice buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing good for hair and Skin</li>
    <li> This is my go to moisturizer in the summer, because I have oily-combination skin and everything else just feels too heavy. In the fall and winter, this does not provide enough moisture. This is the fourth step after cleansing, toning, and balancing and it always helps to clear up my skin whenever I&#x27;m breaking out. Aloe really is a miracle ingredient! Love it.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. It moisturizes and is very soothing. Plus, it really comes in handy when ever skin becomes irritated from sun burn, allergic reactions, and things like that.</li>
    <li> is very nice，i like it</li>
    <li> Very good for your skin</li>
    <li> This definitely smells like aloe and is a heavy gel.  It leaves behind a sticky texture on your skin but works amazing since it is 92% aloe vera.  Because of the texture I only use this on very chapped skin but it is a good product to own and keep.  Also since I don&#x27;t use it all the time the 300mL/10.56 FL oz tub is more than enough to last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> i love this so much&lt;br /&gt;help my skin and gave me recovery feeling&lt;br /&gt; I was suffering from a severe drought in the hands and peel disturbing&lt;br /&gt;And i used many of the products and the result was temporary but when i use Aloe vera gel it&#x27;s help my skin  i&#x27;m really happy and thankful !!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling refreshed</li>
    <li> Overall I like this item. Smells and moisturizes my hair, I do wish it moisturized my skin a little more. I do love that it is light-weight, cooling.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this product but unfortunately did not meet my expectations. It would&#x27;ve been the perfect moisturizer for my extremely sensitive and dry skin if the (awful) scent wasn&#x27;t so strong. I had to wash my face after putting it on.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend-- it works wonders on my oily t-zone and dry chin. It leaves me skin feeling soft and refreshed, unlike other moisturizers that leave me shiny or oily. It is a fairly large jar and will last a long time. It also has a very light and fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using on my hair after showering instead of my other mousse products, and although it may vary with hair type, my thick wavy hair is left feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
    <li> Although I love the product but broken cover sucks</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes your skin soft. I like the scent. Surprising how inexpensive it is!</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s portion! I&#x27;m using it after laser treatment and after day out under sun!&lt;br /&gt;It is very jelly feeling and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe helps healing and make skin young and cool down the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is great to use after face laser treatment.</li>
    <li> I love it. it is good for your hair and skin</li>
    <li> very moisturing and no irritation at all. great for anyone of any ages to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over one and half years and still have over half of the canister left. I started religiously using it a month ago as a cleanser to great results. No real acne, definitely has been healing my sun damaged forehead which has plagued me for years. I was thinking about getting an aloe plant once this runs out to eat and use but I&#x27;m not sure this will ever run out. A lot goes a long way, plus this is so easy to use. Maybe I&#x27;ll get the plant just to eat/drink the aloe. It&#x27;s great on sun burn, for healing damaged skin, not great for getting rid of dry skin. My choice for a cleanser/moisturizer in the summer. If you get an oily T-zone like me in the summer try this, just put it on before you go to bed and wash it off in the shower in the morning. It helps. I&#x27;ll be buying another canister once I run out and maybe a plant too.</li>
    <li> Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered it on April 5, 2015. It arrived on April 25, 2015. It took about 2 weeks to arrive here.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really nice. It came in a small box with foam paper to keep it from breaking. It also came with three small samples of Nature Republic products.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is pretty big. It was full all the way to the top. It can last for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Usage: I have had acne problems for more then a year. It was horrible. I tried using over the counter products but nothing helped. I saw this Nature Republic commercial on TV and it showed this. I decided to do research on it for about a month. I finally made a decision of buying it.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 months since I started using it and can I say I have noticed the difference on my skin. It motorizes it very nicely. It gives a nice glow to the skin. It gets absorbed really fast. And it smells really good. I also have noticed that it help heal cuts on my arms and hands. My acne has slowly disappeared. I recommend you use it daily for better results!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but not work for pimples</li>
    <li> The outside box is broken and i think it was broken during the deliver process. The product is good. i like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20yo and I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect lotion/gel/moisturizer since i was around 13yr old and i still haven&#x27;t found it. I was hoping this would hit home run but it only made it to first base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What its like on your face:&lt;br /&gt;The product smells amazing imo and it looks really cool. Its a bouncy gel and is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;Its really really light on your face (WHICH I LOVE) and it keeps the oil at bay for around 3-5 hours for me depending on if I&#x27;m wearing makeup or not.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a cooling sensation on your face (also love) and spreads really easily. It takes a while to dry but i don&#x27;t really mind that.&lt;br /&gt;Its great before makeup because it doesn&#x27;t mess with what you&#x27;re gonna put on your face at all because it dries really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 2 months:&lt;br /&gt;My face feels hydrated but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Some redness has improved but it hasn&#x27;t helped with breakouts whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really work for me as a spot treatment like it does for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I love the price for the amount of product you get. Its amazing and i may repurchase on that fact alone.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t help acne but doesn&#x27;t make it worse either.&lt;br /&gt;Good hydration without being heavy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps oil at bay for how long i need it to (3-5hr)&lt;br /&gt;The smell may be to much for some people but i really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a jar which some people may find unsanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided whether to repurchase or not but its overall a good product but not a great one.</li>
    <li> Good product. Hate the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use this right after i shower, and for a moisturizer, the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it, it kind of leaves my hands sticky afterwards. Other than that i love this, it makes me feel refreshed and my skin look healthy.</li>
    <li> First it has lots of Chemicals in it and how it&#x27;s advertised is as if its natural and skin drinks 60% of what you put on it from there it goes into your bloodstream so this isn&#x27;t a good product to use in anyway I thought this was a natural Aloe Vera Gel but it&#x27;s very far from that because even tho it has Aloe Vera in it it also has lots of chemicals so defeats the purpose completely I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> good product and low price. i do really love it.</li>
    <li> Pros: cheap, does do the moisturize, cooling effect&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smell too strong to put on the face, too much alcohol, it s not good for your skin in the long run. after putting it on before i went to bed, it feel dry. But the next morning it makes me oily. Now i just use it for my legs</li>
    <li> i have the most sensitive,oily,acne prone skin. this made me break out very badly right after first time. when i washed it off it comes off like a creamy chemical stuff. i dont think its natural.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with price. one of best gell cream i used . I love it  try once you will thank you for what you put on your face and body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be soothing and moisturizing. However after the first time I used it my face felt dry and red, I suspect allergy. My skin is not that sensitive at all. Think twice before you buy.</li>
    <li> This is good for itchiness skin but not that moist as face lotion. this product smell very good &amp; fresh, love it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the texture. I love it when applying to my face. It makes my face hydrating. Plus this gel can use for multiple task</li>
    <li> Nice product!~ I bought this after seeing all the great reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It leaves a hydrated, silky smooth feeling to your face. I use it before I go to bed, and in the morning my skin feels great and doesn&#x27;t feel gross. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not horrible, and with the large amount in the tub - Great skincare item.</li>
    <li> Like it.  Leave your skin smooth</li>
    <li> this is the real deal! authentic</li>
    <li> Very nice product leave my skin very healthy and very smooth. it look natural as88%&lt;br /&gt;I put befor I wear makeup veery nice and I put it all day my ;)))))you must try it it&#x27;s amazing :))))</li>
    <li> there is a tiny black stuff in my gel seems like a died bug.</li>
    <li> Its a big container for the price and a little goes along way. I have oily skin and I notice it goes very good with it and im pleased and it have a nice little scent. It last a long soo time I have been using it everyday for like 5 or 6 months and I still have a long lefted. It very refreshing and cooling and I dont even feel it on me. I noticed my skin looks alot better since I been using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I use it as a daily moisturizer for my entire body (including my face). After using it for a few days, I saw an improvement in dryness and even redness. You also get a great amount for the price. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me this and when I got burned I applied on my burned skin and I was  surprised, i didn&#x27;t get any blister and the burned spot didn&#x27;t hurt much. I love this product. I will try to use on my face and on my body.</li>
    <li> I just love the feeling using it, especially for my very-dry skin. I would definitely recommend it to my friends like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products with aloe vera and this is the best one.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain other chemical ingredients just to &amp;#34;make feel&amp;#34; cool and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;(many other products, even organic ones, contain lots of menthol and alcohol to add more soothing sensation, but they may be irritant to sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt; I can really feel the real aloe vera.</li>
    <li> yea yea 92% maybe i just need to buy the plant - i do not think aloe and alcohol go very well together - this is also very sticky on face does not absorb as well as id like it too but DOES work to soothe and smells like heaven !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisture, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> love this one....so moist. to put at night time</li>
    <li> Does wonders on my skin. I really love the water-like texture once I apply it on my skin. it absorbs into my skin quickly and feels moisturized. I finished the whole thing in a month, that tells you how much I was in love with it. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> My skin absorbs it quickly. know this product by watching an ad of EXO (my favorite K-Pop band)~</li>
    <li> I love this especially now that winter is here. It really helps my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 6/9/2015: I have been using this for a couple weeks now and WOW.  I think this is a new favorite!  I was pretty happy with my previous gel moisturizer (by Mizon), but this stuff is so much better.  It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave my T zone oily but also keeps my dry patches moisturized.  Not to mention i feel like the aloe has a healing affect whenever i happen to have a pimple (it goes away and heals much more quickly now.) I am in love with this stuff.  I am still considering trying a more pure aloe moisturizer in the future, but you can&#x27;t beat this price for the quality and quantity provided.   Pro: Great for combination/oily skin. Great for sensitive skin. SO MUCH PRODUCT, I was expecting a fourth of the amount I received. No scent. Quick absorption  Con: This might not work for dry skin. But you could always apply it twice . No SPF Good for daytime wear but i&#x27;d add an oil to it for night time use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Just use it and you will know. You only need to use small amount to get moisturized.</li>
    <li> The aloe vera gel is too good,I love it. It is moisturizing and so cooling for your skin. Usually my skin gets all red when ever i apply a moisturizer but this one is amazing..my redness doesnt show up, cools my skin and moisturizes too.. Good job Natural Republic!</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t an add-on item. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is good. You get a lot for your money. I like to use it if I get a sun burn. It really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product! It made my skin feel comfortable!</li>
    <li> I use it after shower because my face tends to dehydrate a lot after shower.  I have both day cream and night cream but I am looking for some moisturizer that does not act too strongly.  Aloe gel kept your skin moisturized in several hours and it is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for!  I go to bed before washing my face with facial cleanser, and at the time that i go to bed the moisturizer is already absorbed by my skin.  Also, this is a very BIG jar!  Much bigger than i expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I love this!! The price is appropriate and i have been using this for a while, it works very well!!</li>
    <li> I am happy I brought it, its good and soothing my face, and It is really aloe !!! I like it.</li>
    <li> It works good enough. I like how soothing it is on my skin. It calms my redness from acne overnight. My only problem with this product is that it will get peely, so only apply 1-2 layers of it at a time or it will not dry and will get peely. Otherwise, it moistens the skin and feels nice.</li>
    <li> after wearing it, I realized it was irritating my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But it&#x27;s probably a good product to use for burnt skin, dry skin (that&#x27;s no on the face), make up remover etc. Just don&#x27;t put this on your face.</li>
    <li> Really awesome! Its really moisturizing. But I found out the hard way not to put it on with makeup. When I tried to wear it under or over makeup it would always kinda ball up. So I use it purely for skin care. I put on alot like a goopy mask and wait for it to absorb then with my fingers I just massage my skin and I feel like the left over gross dead skin and stuff is getting stuck in the balls. And then I wash my face and tada! Dry flakes are gone.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It just so good for hair! It makes my hair soft and shiny! Also works great on my face and body! The container has a lot of gel and its so inexpensive! Im going to repurchase it just to have a second one around!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year, using it nightly, and it is not empty yet. I love this stuff. I have oily skin and it causes me problems. Especially because I live in a place that is humid year round.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it is 90% aloe, no oils, very hydrating, and you can use it anywhere you want added moisture. If you want to pack on moisture, you can just layer it or, you can always layer a different product. I also like this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. You can always store it in the refrigerator and use it cooled, it feels amazing in the morning to wake you up.</li>
    <li> This is the best Aloe gel I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve tried maybe 10 different brands from local markets and drug stores to the well known sun tan product maker. It absorbs into the skin leaving no residue-most others do leave a sticky feeling-this one doesn&#x27;t. You should try this-its good with a nice scent-not girly or manly-just right my wife thinks.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how to describe the performance of this item. i have to say i do see any advanced benefits on my skin improvement</li>
    <li> I have bought This item 5 times and The quality decrease more and more. Before it was a real gel but now it is very watery. I have a hard time putting it on my face because it meltdown. I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed at this time. Probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Just good . Very moisture, and nice smells.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin because I use a lot of topical gels for my skin so I thought this product would work great for my skin and because my cousin has this product so I tried a little bit and thought it felt nice but when I got it and first put it on it felt very slightly sticky on my face? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or if it&#x27;s suppose to be like that or whatever but the next day when I woke up I started breaking out but I thought it would actually help my skin so I kept using it with the aloe toner and the cleanser but it broke me out even more! I get pretty bad breakouts when I try a product that irritates me so it took a while before I maintained my regular skin. I would say that I would reccomend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t get easily irritated and someone with oily skin, however I would not repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> ... it has too much alcohol in it. The first ingredient is obviously aloe but the second is alcohol and you can clearly smell it in the product. I thought this would be good as a soothing pack and as a moisturizer post-shaving but it really burned my legs when I applied it after shaving. When I&#x27;ve used this in the past on my face it felt very cooling but not very moisturizing as a pack so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth using anymore. If you are very ingredient conscious this will definitely bother you but if not than I&#x27;d say try it out. It&#x27;s cheap for the price. I got mine in NYC Chinatown for only $5.50 but I&#x27;ve also gotten it from amazon and the price is good considering its a big container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s a shame that it has alcohol but it&#x27;s useful for removing makeup and soothing redness.</li>
    <li> Great i have used that for a year, i will let my friends know and come to buy it. &#x60;~</li>
    <li> Awesome. I don&#x27;t even use this every day on my face and I can already notice a difference. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks. Like everyone else says, this tub is huge and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last a very long time. I think I&#x27;ve found my moisturizer of choice!</li>
    <li> Greatest thing ever! Love using this as a night moisturizer. Doesnt settle in the skin real quick but just give it a minute or 2. Super light weight and you can see a difference in your skin after time.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The smell is quite strong and it&#x27;s sticky after you apply but after a few minutes the smell goes away and your skin becomes super soft! I love it. Definitely a repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> Very good, it is very good for my skin, and let my skin better.</li>
    <li> I have oily-combination skin that&#x27;s prone to adult acne and I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers. I&#x27;ve been looking for one that will moisturize enough so that I don&#x27;t get random dry patches but won&#x27;t moisturize too much so that I&#x27;m even more oily. I tried this product on a whim since my usual moisturizer ([[ASIN:B00C2QROVS Origins GinZing Energy boosting moisturizer, 1.7 fl oz]]) had run out and I needed another one quick (also, I saw that EXO was promoting it so I thought, why not? haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Kyungsoo from EXO was definitely right when he said \\&quot;it makes my hands feel like water.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a clear gel that feels like a liquid when it goes on your skin. A little definitely goes a *long* way with this product especially because the container it comes in is HUGE. It&#x27;s so big that I had to put some in a smaller travel-size container for daily use. When it dries on your skin, it creates an extremely thin film. I was using this on my face for a while and I thought it was fine but I couldn&#x27;t stand it on my body because the film feels a bit stiff. The scent is not very strong in my opinion, unlike what many of the other reviewers said. It smells like the typical cucumber-melon scent (the scent that used to be all the rage for body wash) but I can only smell it slightly when the container is open. I can&#x27;t smell it at all even when it&#x27;s on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a very light moisturizer. If you have very dry skin then I don&#x27;t recommend this because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be strong enough. This is the perfect moisturizer for preventing dry skin in the milder seasons and especially during summertime due to its refreshing nature.</li>
    <li> I was actually so surprised at how large the container is, it&#x27;s great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening it, I do really like the smell, it&#x27;s a very nice consistency and goes on so smooth and your skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time with dry skin and this seems to be working great.</li>
    <li> After living under heating in the whole winter, my skin become very dry and even the night cream cannot make it better. But my skin is sensitive .So I look for a hydrating mask which is as nature as possible. My face feel good after using this !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s feel cool to put on face after sun. But alcohol smell is so strong. Well, everything is good, just don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> i heard so many reviews on this gel and i HAD to get one. So soothing and makes my skin feel soft. there can be feeling of stickiness but give it a while and it gets soft!</li>
    <li> I really have sensitive facial skin. It gets really red,itchy, and dry! I bought this and it help my skin relax a little. It feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> When you apply it on the skin it just absorbs it like water, which I really like and its pretty cheap since the container is pretty huge.</li>
    <li> very good product with raisonable price.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! It&#x27;s soothing and gives you an instant refreshing feeling. My normal moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it so I added this to my skin care regimen. I use it after toner and serum, and before my regular moisturizer. This definitely helped with my dryness and made my skin softer. Now, I don&#x27;t think this by itself would be moisturizing enough for normal skin types, but it&#x27;s a great addition to any skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love using this product in place of my regular body lotion, especially after shaving. I get razor burn very easily and my legs always get especially itchy. I find that the aloe really helps to relieve the burning/itchiness and does a better job of soothing my skin than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Very good. I like it. Very soft. Moisture. So good. So nice. Smooth. Gel type. Aloe soothing gel.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are so many ways to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;It came so fast, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It moisturizes and I fell like it helps soothe and heal my sensitive skin. Since I started using it at night my redness has calmed down and it has help keep my skin happy.</li>
    <li> its feels good on the skin. but i still need something to clear up my skin. not make it glow.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. So happy Amazon now sells it. It&#x27;s very light, smells great and you can use it on your skin and hair. Sinks into your pours without leaving a sticky residue. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the service I received on this product but as it relate to the actual product it too early to say if it does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Very usefull on burning! Smooth texture on the skin, doesn&#x27;t make your skin kinda green like other Aloe gel, it&#x27;s very clear. I really like it! ^^</li>
    <li> helps my dry skin heals</li>
    <li> It works the best when I apply it on dry skin after washing or bathing, then follow by a layer of lotion or cream or sunscreen. You may wonder why I am doing that because this way it provides the best hydration effect. I have ever seen a lotion or cream itself can really keep hydrating the skin for more than few hours.</li>
    <li> Had to look it up in Amazon and there it is. Best moisturizer I have used over the past few years!</li>
    <li> THAT IS NOT REAL NATURE REPUBLIC ALOE GEL!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not typically a aloe get, kind of facial mask, but is still very good!</li>
    <li> really good, after i ues it i feel fresh and smell really good</li>
    <li> Its light, gets rid of redness and refreshes your skin. Not to mention I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I use this product to soothe my skin when it&#x27;s irritated, whether it be allergies or sun damage. It&#x27;s very light and very fragrant. It&#x27;s not enough for me to use as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve found it very useful. I don&#x27;t see this as a staple to my skincare regimen as it is not necessary.</li>
    <li> very light after application, overall happy with this product</li>
    <li> great one and I love it!!</li>
    <li> It may seem a bit expensive for aloe vera gel, but it&#x27;s one of the most amazing body products I&#x27;ve ever bought. It&#x27;s great for keeping my skin hydrated and really helps with sunburn. I tend to be allergic to most products I put on my face, but this is gentle enough to use on my face. I recommend it for anyone to have, and a little bit of it goes a long way, so ends up being very economic in the long run.</li>
    <li> used it as sleep mask and it went perfectly!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this face and skin gel i put in my hair after a shower and i is a good alternative to lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have extremely sensitive skin and tends to dry out very fast. This locked in moisture and was very soothing too. It works for your hair too, adding an extra shine to it and since its technically a gel, it&#x27;ll help style your hair to an extent. I use this on basically everything, hands, feet, arms, hair, face, point is it&#x27;s great. I used every single ounce in that jar till it was dry. Just be sure to use a spatula to scope the gel out of you want to avoid contaminating the batch with outside bacteria. It&#x27;s most effective as a cooling agent if stored in the fridge.</li>
    <li> Good price, moisturizes, and helps with redness. Might buy it agin!</li>
    <li> great moisturizer that doesnt leave your skin feeling oily after application. only downside for me is the inconvenience of having it in a jar instead of tube.</li>
    <li> I keep it in frige and use it every night, it really helps my skin relax after the sunshine during day time! Thank you! I will order it again.</li>
    <li> The product not only smells good, but has the cooling moisturizing properties I look for. Having oily skin during the summertime I want a moisturizer that is in a gel form so I don&#x27;t feel all greasy, this does the job with it drying quickly and it toning down redness I have in my face.</li>
    <li> It comes with a very good container, and I only used it once as face mask. When I first applied on my face, it has that nice cooling feeling, and after I wash my face, i was surprised to notice that my face feels so moisturized and smooth!</li>
    <li> Smells like aloe!!! I personally love the smell of cucumber and other fresh fruit smell. I used it for sleeping mask!!! SUPER GOOD SKIN CARE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought this tub from a Nature Republic store near my area. It&#x27;s actually cheaper to buy this in person instead of online because I got mine for $6. I&#x27;ve read online about a fake Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel, and they&#x27;ve warned their costumers about this problem as well. It&#x27;s best to buy it in person and I&#x27;m pretty sure there are other Nature Republic stores in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this lovely green tub of goodness is HUGE. They say that this is a multipurpose gel that can be used for your hair and nails, a make up base, moisturizer, and much more which is probably why the tub is big. Seriously, $6 for this? Not a bad deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this as a summer moisturizer and to set my skin care products. My skin is oily and because summer is still here, it&#x27;s a huge problem for my face. This gel has the perfect, watery consistency that not only absorbs quickly, but it also feels cool and refreshing. It does have a sticky residue after applying, but it doesn&#x27;t last forever because it&#x27;s quickly absorbed. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or greasy like cream/lotion base moisturizers. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this gel as a solo winter moisturizer because it&#x27;s very watery... But who knows, maybe it might work (I&#x27;ll update this review when cold season is here). The gel smells like a fresh, clean scent so for those who aren&#x27;t fond of scented skin products this might not make you happy. Because all of the product is in a tub, I suggest using a little spatula to scoop it out. Or find a pump bottle that is clean and scoop the gel in there for easier dispense. I&#x27;ve been using this for only 2 days and it helps soothe those pesky red pimple bumps. My face doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of oil ever since I&#x27;ve used this product, so it&#x27;s a plus as well. As for acne, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements yet... But I&#x27;ll continue using and see if there are any results for it.</li>
    <li> This has a very light and pleasant fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it in place of a cream and it seems to work quite well. Since it&#x27;s a gel it absorbs very easily rather than a oily cream which sits on your face. It&#x27;s very refreshing and soothing even though I haven&#x27;t put it in the fridge. I&#x27;ve also used it on cotton pads to put on my eyes when they feel strained.</li>
    <li> great, very soothing for burns and abrasions</li>
    <li> Smells like alcohol and feels sticky.</li>
    <li> I put this on everywhere and including my face every night. Soothes any redness and acne.</li>
    <li> Love the product! My skin got smoother and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!!love it!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used! It doesnt irritate my skin at all!</li>
    <li> Love it. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shipping fast and good quality!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen better and pure Aloe anywhere in a container until now.  Cooling and perfect for skin on the face.</li>
    <li> This Aloe Vera Gel does kill my acnes and keep my skin really moisturized. I will keep using them as my daily application. My acnes were stubborn for 10+ years and this really help to improve my skin a lot.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of product in the tub and I expect it to last a long time! I apply this every morning before going out and before I go to bed and this really hydrates my skins. My face usually gets dry during the cold winters or even the hot summers and no other moisturizer or lotion helps keep my skin from feeling ashy.I just dab my finger in the product and it&#x27;s enough to cover my face. The product gives off a light, refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me. My skin type is between oil and normal. Most of Aloe Vera Gel will make my tears down, but this one doesn&#x27;t! I don&#x27;t want to cry when enjoying Aloe Vera Mask. :-) It really works well, specially during dry winter. I usually use right after washing my face, and let it stay for about 15 minutes or until it drys then wash it, then my regular routine for night skin care. So far I have bought my third one....</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive, acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using various hypoallergenic and biological brands, but most of them all left me with a red, itchy burning face, or simply didn&#x27;t hydrate the way they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEEL&lt;br /&gt;This feels very light, and cools your skin down immediately the first few minutes after applying.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. (Wouldn&#x27;t knwo if it actually has perfume in it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFECT&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works for me.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face feel hydrated and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the impression it improves the equality of your skin colour, as for me it did, and I even got commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE&lt;br /&gt;The product works wonderfully, and the price is just great.&lt;br /&gt;The container has enough in it to last months, if not maybe even a year as not much gel is needed to have a moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a day and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes the gel sinked into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky, looking shiny or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;And I can go out without a red, irritated itching face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product from BeautyNetkorea.&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly recommend this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was very neat.&lt;br /&gt;Free samples of various brands were included.&lt;br /&gt;(In my case Lotions, Cream and BB Cream samples)&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was reasonably fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(04/02/2015)&lt;br /&gt;You can sign up for an account on their original site,&lt;br /&gt;and temporarily you get $3 off on your first order AND 10% OFF all products.&lt;br /&gt;The shop also allows to buy samples for a good price to try out some of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The best ever. I have a very sensitive skin that hurts even with weather mild pollution time to time. This product relieved me....</li>
    <li> I love it. The gel stays on my skin like it&#x27;s not even there, my face feels light, smooth and refreshing after application. I also apply it on my arms and neck. I would love to continue using it!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an aloe Vera product for my irritated and itchy skin. The application is soothing and the consistency is a jelly-like.  Once applied the skin is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue as compared to other aloe vera products used before. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin retains moisture and looks healthy. The smell is crisp and fresh similar to cucumbers. Considering the price, it is affordable and the amount of product suffices for about several months for an average daily use. There isn&#x27;t any need to use a lot of product. This would be the only go-to aloe Vera product I would use and will continue to purchase..</li>
    <li> The Nature Republic Soothing and Moisture Aloe Vera 92% Gel is amazinggg! I tried it on my brother&#x27;s sunburned face and I asked him how it feels or if it cured his face and he said that his face feels great and restored c:</li>
