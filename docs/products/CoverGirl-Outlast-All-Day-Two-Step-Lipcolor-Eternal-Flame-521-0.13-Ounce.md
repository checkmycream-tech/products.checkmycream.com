      <li>It looks nice, not over-done.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked this product.</li>
      <li>Although I liked the #524 much better.</li>
      <li>I sure hope everyone knows by now how amazing</li>
      <li>I love it, this is all my buying for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>and I plan to buy more</li>
      <li>Love the Metallic Touch</li>
      <li>So I ran out of this and was bummed until I was able to get some more.</li>
      <li>many colors to  choose.  </li>
      <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Favorite lipcolor.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned when I thought this was dicontinued but was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My favorite lipstick.</li>
      <li>Lasts for many hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this color works well for all skin types, it would probably be especially pretty on someone with a darker complexion.</li>
      <li>For whatever reason, people love this lip color.</li>
      <li>I am sure the manufacturer has changed the formula so you have to buy more of it.  </li>
      <li>It was the perfect shade of red without being violet or orange.</li>
      <li>Reds rarely look good on me, so I decided to take a chance on this one, and</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for sometimes. :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I have using outlast forever and love the fact I don&#x27;t have to reapply.  </li>
      <li>I love bright red lipstick, what I don&#x27;t love is a two toned mouth after a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>but really overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>the color and clear moisturizer are good.</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I would buy more CoverGirl lip products but not this exact one.  </li>
      <li>but that is true with any lip color.</li>
      <li>The product is good, however I give it only four stars because I was expecting a more vibrant colour.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing several of these at such a great price!</li>
      <li>I received it through Influenster complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>And it really is &amp;#34;Outlast&amp;#34; lasts almost ALL day~!</li>
      <li>And for SPECIFIC reasons, I love CoverGirl</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for years as of now most all of my female friends and family use it.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I have finally found a product that really does what it says it will.</li>
      <li>it looks natural, but a bit MORE than natural.</li>
      <li>I love the long wear and the color, and I received a 2-pack (4 items - 2 colors, 2 balms).  </li>
      <li>Being a fair-skinned blonde with a tendency toward ruddiness, I was skeptical when I read on another site that this color is the perfect red for fair skin, withouut being too red.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t quite understand the negative reviews on this  lip color because everyone that I know that used loved it.</li>
      <li>but this color seems lightish red and fades to a nice pinky red as your day goes.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use only the moisturizer stick provided and no other lip balms or the color</li>
      <li>It would probably be a gorgeous Saturday-night red if you had medium to dark skin.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s really no way to ever accurately know what a color will be till it&#x27;s on your lips</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>but it looks natural.</li>
      <li>For me I apply in morning on way to work and it will last the whole eight hours without reapplying.</li>
      <li>when everyone else looks washed, and are busily applying lipstick, you will look</li>
      <li>This is my third try at ordering a true red stay on lipstick/gloss and third time is it for me.</li>
      <li>so reds are never &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; on me, they&#x27;re fuchsia or hot pink</li>
      <li>Love it with only one complaint...</li>
      <li>There is some general fading</li>
      <li>Love this product but the gloss part of the duo was broken.</li>
      <li>I cannot stand having to reapply my color throughout the day, and this particular product doesn&#x27;t come off until you use petroleum jelly or some other oil based product to take it off.</li>

<li> I have even applied it in the morning, and find it still there the next morning if I didn&#x27;t intentionally take it off, now that is long lasting!</li>
<li> Actually a long lasting, transfer resistant lipstick.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lighter colors and they don&#x27;t seem as long lasting.</li>
<li> Cannot believe that it last so very long.</li>
<li> IT DOSEN&#x27;T LAST VERY LONG.</li>
<li> I have used it for some time and if you put it on and let it dry well before using the lip moisturizer it will last a long time.</li>

<li> This is not, I repeat NOT a true red</li>
<li> Two coats left to dry before using the moisturizer stick will last at least 8 hours.</li>
<li> No thanks.</li>
<li> I expected it not to work well</li>
<li> Eternal Flame is blue/violet based red, which works well with pale skin</li>
<li> I am not aware of any specific directions to apply it, but should read instructions before a negative review.</li>
<li> I was totally shocked to find Colorstay lipstick for that cheap.</li>
<li> Darker ones are just too dark.</li>
<li> , I got it on amazon for half the price.</li>
<li> I am a very pale girl and my skin has pink undertones</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t have to be re-applied throughout the day, but toward the even it does start breaking up a little.</li>
<li> and if you skip the lip gloss it starts breaking up a little.</li>
<li> I look like a little girl playing with stripper make-up.</li>

    <li> I love this lipstick. I cannot stand having to reapply my color throughout the day, and this particular product doesn&#x27;t come off until you use petroleum jelly or some other oil based product to take it off. I have even applied it in the morning, and find it still there the next morning if I didn&#x27;t intentionally take it off, now that is long lasting!</li>
    <li> This color looks great on my lips and I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing several of these at such a great price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect this lipstick to last all day, as it does not.  I remember years ago, I used to buy this product and it did last all day. I am sure the manufacturer has changed the formula so you have to buy more of it.  You get what you pay for sometimes. :)</li>
    <li> So I ran out of this and was bummed until I was able to get some more. I love it so much! For me I apply in morning on way to work and it will last the whole eight hours without reapplying. It is a miracle lipstick! I am glad that I have finally found a product that really does what it says it will. I will be trying other colors in the near future! A+++</li>
    <li> I was totally shocked to find Colorstay lipstick for that cheap. I expected it not to work well that works fantastically I absolutely love it and I plan to buy more</li>
    <li> Love the color! The lipstick lasts quite well and moisturizing topcoat feels good.</li>
    <li> The product is good, however I give it only four stars because I was expecting a more vibrant colour.</li>
    <li> Being a fair-skinned blonde with a tendency toward ruddiness, I was skeptical when I read on another site that this color is the perfect red for fair skin, withouut being too red.  I am please to say it is!  I love the long wear and the color, and I received a 2-pack (4 items - 2 colors, 2 balms).  AWESOME.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Although I liked the #524 much better. Do you have it?</li>
    <li> IT DOSEN&#x27;T LAST VERY LONG. VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT FALLS APART. IT CRUMBLES.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe that it last so very long.</li>
    <li> Love the Metallic Touch</li>
    <li> Outlast does a good job.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no way to ever accurately know what a color will be till it&#x27;s on your lips but that is true with any lip color.</li>
    <li> This is not, I repeat NOT a true red so if that is what you are looking for don&#x27;t order this color!  I wish they would show swatches or take the tube out of the box in order for us to determine the color. This is my third try at ordering a true red stay on lipstick/gloss and third time is it for me. Back to shopping at the drug store!</li>
    <li> My favorite lipstick. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have no desire to go back to other lipsticks. I put it on and it last throughout the day or evening, with only an occasional touchup after eating.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is GREAT! It stays on for 4-5 hours and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. The color is great also it&#x27;s just a few shades darker than my lips, so it looks natural, but a bit MORE than natural. They keep threatening to discontinue this color/product -- but I beg them not to!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t eat anything oily or this will come off faster. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t leave lipstick on baby heads or water bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and I LOVE it!!!!! It actually stays on ALL DAY+ !! That is through eating also!! Unless it&#x27;s something especially greasy, I may need just a bit of a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s it! LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> Tried and true product and a good transaction!</li>
    <li> Kinda OK, nothing great</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, people love this lip color. And for SPECIFIC reasons, I love CoverGirl Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;I put Outlast on in the morning. It stays on all day, even through several cups of coffee, lunch, snacks and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;This means, after lunch when everyone else looks washed, and are busily applying lipstick, you will look good!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lighter colors and they don&#x27;t seem as long lasting. Darker ones are just too dark. As Goldilocks would say, this one is &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Lasts for many hours.</li>
    <li> Been searching for years for a pigmented, non sticky or dry 24 hour lip color and I have finally found it! I am SUPER picky and this lip color is perfect. I went out all day to an event and it stayed on after eating and drinking all day. I love it, this is all my buying for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Favorite lipcolor.  Lasts all day.  Warning...don&#x27;t fall asleep with it on cause you&#x27;ll wake up ready to go LOL!</li>
    <li> Actually a long lasting, transfer resistant lipstick. Loved it!</li>
    <li> This is a great color and I ended up finding it at my local CVS for $12, I got it on amazon for half the price. I sure hope everyone knows by now how amazing this Outlast lipstick is, yes, yes, yes, it stays on until you take it off. There is some general fading but it looks natural. I am a very pale girl and my skin has pink undertones so reds are never &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; on me, they&#x27;re fuchsia or hot pink and they look garish - I look like a little girl playing with stripper make-up. No thanks. Eternal Flame is blue/violet based red, which works well with pale skin but this isn&#x27;t as red as I hoped, I am forever looking for pin-up girl red...but this color seems lightish red and fades to a nice pinky red as your day goes. It looks nice, not over-done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this color works well for all skin types, it would probably be especially pretty on someone with a darker complexion. It would probably be a gorgeous Saturday-night red if you had medium to dark skin.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when I thought this was dicontinued but was able to find it on Amazon.  I have used it for some time and if you put it on and let it dry well before using the lip moisturizer it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This works great... I get tons of compliments and questions about how I can eat lunch and my lipstick doesn&#x27;t budge! Love it with only one complaint...it is impossible to use all of the product to the end. The applicator can&#x27;t reach the bottom corners so about 25% stays in the tube when discarded. Tried lots of tricks to get it all and gave up...it&#x27;s not as expensive as cosmetic counter lipsticks so even with the product loss it&#x27;s still a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the color and clear moisturizer are good. Two coats left to dry before using the moisturizer stick will last at least 8 hours. Make sure you use only the moisturizer stick provided and no other lip balms or the color will flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A makeup kit staple!</li>
    <li> Love this product but the gloss part of the duo was broken.</li>
    <li> Reds rarely look good on me, so I decided to take a chance on this one, and wow! It was the perfect shade of red without being violet or orange. And it really is &amp;#34;Outlast&amp;#34; lasts almost ALL day~!</li>
    <li> I love bright red lipstick, what I don&#x27;t love is a two toned mouth after a couple of hours.  The color of this product is great and I have followed the directions to a tee but after about 3 hours, the lipstick wears off in the center and leaves you with a really awful ring around your lips.  I would buy more CoverGirl lip products but not this exact one.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite lipstick!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years as of now most all of my female friends and family use it.  You put it on, and it stays.  This is a drying product on your lips. And I do have to touch up hours later.  I don&#x27;t quite understand the negative reviews on this  lip color because everyone that I know that used loved it. many colors to  choose.  I would say take it back if you don&#x27;t like it.  I am not aware of any specific directions to apply it, but should read instructions before a negative review.</li>
    <li> Color  was too red.Could not use it.</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot. it doesn&#x27;t have to be re-applied throughout the day, but toward the even it does start breaking up a little. and if you skip the lip gloss it starts breaking up a little. but really overall it&#x27;s great. great color.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. I received it through Influenster complimentary for testing purposes. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product because it stays on for a really long time. At the end of the day I found it hard to get off. So if that&#x27;s what you want this is the product for only once a day application. It lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> I have using outlast forever and love the fact I don&#x27;t have to reapply.  It does not transfer.  You only have to use the gloss to re-moisten it.</li>
