<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the number one lotion in my book. Me and my wife are extremely health contentious and over protective. My daughter was a very healthy baby girl, in her 3rd week she developed a form of infant eczema that is normal. I was told by my pediatric to use Hydro-cortisone cream, I am not fond of that specific cream because it is a form of steroid. Steroids stay in your body forever and I did not want to introduce them at such a young age. I used this lotion even though I created my own it uses the chamomile essential oil which is an amazing ingredient. My daughter cleared up without any harsh products naturally without the hydrocortisone. I have other products from this company including the olive oil lotion and shampoo and I will continue to buy this lotion. I paid for this myself out of my own pocket I am not rich and I did not get paid for this review this is my own personal experience. I hope that you buy this for your child you will love the smell.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Love the clean scent! Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing and I love that its not full of chemicals.  My only complaint which others have also said is that it is a thicker lotion and it is difficult to get it out half the time.  Usually I just take the lid off though to get it out.</li>
    <li> We love this cream. In fact our baby loves it so much, she eats it. We now have to keep the bottle way up and out of her reach.  It smells fantastic and worked great to address her excema.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion itself, but the pump is awful. I ended up taking it off and squeezing the product out. Annoying.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great, however upon receiving the bottle, the pump was already broken. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my toddler&#x27;s super dry skin within two uses!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, more like a body cream. It&#x27;s thick, creamy, absorbs well, ultra-moisturizing and it smells heavenly. It&#x27;s more expensive than a cheap bottle of lotion, but with natural, simple ingredients and a cream that spreads well and stays  (a little goes a loooong way, so the bottle lasts a long while), it&#x27;s more than worth the money. I usually make my own body cream for the family, but this is a staple now. I won&#x27;t be buying any other lotions. We also use the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; version of the same scent, which is perfect for winter!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion for my baby, but I do not love the pump!  Only a tiny bit of lotion comes out with each pump.  It is very frustrating. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective pump or all bottles do this.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s pretty gentle on my skin, I&#x27;m very sensitive to most skin creams this is does the job with out irritating my skin, I&#x27;m currently have quite some sun damage due to antibiotics treatment and I have develop squasmos skin cancer,  Although the only thing that works better is the savila plant, I think is the aloe plant, All you have to do is cut in small portions and used that liquid that comes out is very thick, but it&#x27;s the best thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> The Shea Moisture Raw Shea Chamomile &amp; Argan Oil Baby Healing Lotion is wonderful for kids (and adults) with very dry skin and I think it works much better than the typical Johnson&#x27;s product or store brands.  I also like the story behind the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the lotion out of the container with the pump because it&#x27;s so thick and it sticks to the sides of the container.  I have to cut the top of the container off with a knife and store it in a quart-sized ziplock bag and then dig it out with my hands.  Unscrewing the pump and turning the container upside down and banging it will only get a little bit out.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes you!!! Great for winter  for summer you will probably feel hot. Get a lighter lotion in the in the summer. This one is thick. I like</li>
    <li> I use it for face moisturizer and my next use is to make my own foundation using it. I found the recipes through Wellness Mama. I love it as a face moisturizer. It is creamy and nourishing. One thing is it is so thick that if your house is cold, it is hard to get it out. But not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I have recently fallen in love with shea butter and was excited to find a natural \\&quot;baby product\\&quot; with it. Unfortunately, the smell of this lotion is so overpowering I can&#x27;t stand it. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t put it on my baby. I didn&#x27;t notice that it said scented with frankincense and myrrh. I honestly didn&#x27;t even know what that smelled like but do now! If that&#x27;s your thing, you&#x27;ll be okay. If you are looking for a low-fragrance product, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it looked so thick in the bottle, it seems unlikely it will come out of the pump easily as the product gets low. Raw shea butter really is meant to be in a tub.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a very natural lotion without harmful chemicals, it smells absolutely delicious! It&#x27;s very rich, so I tend to put it on wet skin after showering, but that makes it last even longer, so it&#x27;s a plus really. The smell is hard to describe....it&#x27;s so delicious, I want to eat it! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my soon to arrive niece after testing it in a store because it smells absolutely amazing. I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my arm all day and didn&#x27;t even want to wash my arm that evening. I will be buying another for myself, if it&#x27;s good enough for a baby then it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells wonderful. Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle with the pump. The pump works but the lotion is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t flow. Maybe it got too cold or is old? This hasn&#x27;t happened before but the consistency is definitely thicker.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this lotion and I really like it a lot. Great light smell and a nice thick lotion for everyday use or after bathtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the pump bottle. Once the lotion level gets low, it&#x27;s so thick it won&#x27;t move up the tube. I wish it came in a squeeze tube instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy. I haven&#x27;t found anything I like better and don&#x27;t see myself switching to anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> My grandchildren used this when they were babies...I love it so much I use it myself now. Great feeling- not sticky and great smell-and no harmful additives. Don&#x27;t think you have to have a baby around to use this!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion for my little one. If you or your little one is sensitive to fragrance then you might want to skip this. Otherwise, this smells so good. It kept my baby&#x27;s skin moisturize but I still have to test it during winter. I wished they have a better packaging for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like most reviews here, it&#x27;s so hard to dispense this lotion out. Which is both good and bad, good because baby can&#x27;t pump it by themselves so it&#x27;s safer but it&#x27;s also bad because you can&#x27;t pump it either :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I didn&#x27;t purchase this from amazon.</li>
    <li> While visiting relatives over the Christmas holiday my wife tried this moisturizer. She liked it so much she had me order a bottle for her. Some of the other reviews mention getting it at other sites for less, but when I look at the T-a-r-g-e-t website, they are selling a 12oz bottle, not a 13oz bottle. It still works out a little cheaper per ounce, but not enough to matter to me.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product for the price that it sells for on Amazon. We moved last year and I was concerned I would not be able to find some of the products I was used to using in the new area. I use this and I wish I could find an air freshener or body spray that matches the aroma. It&#x27;s lovely. A great product, that smells great, has a wonderful texture on the skin and one is able to tell an immediate difference after using.</li>
    <li> My newborn had very severe baby acne which then turned into very dry chapped skin.  I was using aveeno baby products and aquafor--neither of which were producting results.  I decided to take a leap and try this stuff out (I also bought it at Target for a better price) and it worked wonders.  It&#x27;s a nontraditional scent for baby but it smells lovely.  It worked almost instantly on healing up his poor skin.  I saw a difference within 24 hours of use.  SO I decided to try the wash as well and ditched the aveeno and all his dry rash like areas on his body disappeared within a day of use.  I HIGHLY recommend this product and the wash.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I had to return this product because it was so thick that it was a solid mass and could not be pumped or squeezed out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I use it on my daughter everyday. Leaves her dry skin moisturized and I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!  All natural, safe, smells great, feels great!  I use it as a hand and body lotion on myself even though it&#x27;s meant for babies.  I figure if it&#x27;s safe for them, it&#x27;s safe for me!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived before time and product is as good as expected</li>
    <li> I bought this on a lark when I visited a popular chain drugstore.  Fortunate for me, they had a sale going on all Shea Moisture brands, including the baby products.  Most of the baby products was gone, except for the lone lotion and I picked up something from the Shea Moisture body care line.  When I applied this lotion, I was blown away by the fragrance, but in a good way.  The best way I can describe the scent is that to me it smells like cream soda suckers by Dum-Dums.  To add, it kind of reminds me of old fashion cream soda or dare I say a softer version of Root Beer.  I know I might not be accurate but to me and on my body (due to the body chemistry) it smells like cream soda candy.  Usually I am not the one to get excited about gourmand scents but this one I can definitely get behind.  Also I feel that this scent is pretty unisex so if your significant other accidentally uses it, he might be reluctant to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the fact that a little goes a long way.  I bought my bottle almost three months ago and I have about one-fourth to a third left, and that is basically using it every other day.  I do tend to switch it up because I want to switch it up and I don&#x27;t have perfumes compliments it.  The only con for me is that it is kind of pricey but the good thing is that I can catch it on sale.  That is the prime time to stock up.  In short, I would totally recommend this to a friend, and maybe \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; from her.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Works well for baby eczema. Poor packaging as the lotion is too thick to pump. Ended up cutting bottle open and transferring to a different container. Will buy again as the actual product is excellent, just will be ready to transfer to a container that gives better ease of use!</li>
    <li> I decided to go with a baby lotion due to sensitivity with my skin. The ingredients are organic and very soothing to the skin. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feels nice and thick going on . I use it daily on my twins and it&#x27;s helped both their eczema and keratosis pilaris. It&#x27;s pricey (IMO) but absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit overwhelming and &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; for a baby product, but it is moisturizing....</li>
    <li> Why does it have so much aroma. I know how she butter smells, this has smell like perfume, not crazy about it when applying it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wtf how can you pump out this thick butter? I can&#x27;t even scoop it out to put it on</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the soap and we all love it♡♡♡ its so nice,  the smell is delectable, the lotion feels amazing, and her skin the next day is amazing♡♡♡</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this, super fast shipping and a great price!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great, especially the ingredients. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the pump dispenser for it stopped working (maybe because its a thick lotion?) and there&#x27;s still over half the bottle left. I also had this same issue with Shea Moisture conditioner that I bought.</li>
    <li> love the smell and its softening properties</li>
    <li> The lotion is so thick that the pump doesn&#x27;t pump anything out.  I&#x27;m returning this product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Richly moisturizing non-greasy. Very engaging scent.</li>
    <li> In a word: PHENOMENAL. I use this lotion before bed (No, it&#x27;s not just for babies) and have found it not only is a rich, healing moisturizer for my skin, but it also relaxes and soothes my body. And if you have some swelling issues, tight legs, etc like I sometimes do, it will help lower inflammation and swelling.  Oh--and did I mention the smell--soft, mildly sweet, and subtly intoxicating. Try this--you are in for a treat!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my daughter used it and I liked the scent.  It was so thick, the pump dispenser wouldn&#x27;t work and I had to scoop it out with the pump tube.  I sent a note to the manufacturer and got back a message that I could warm the container before using it.  Also, that they make small batches and it is hard to control the outcome.  Hmmmmm.  Not a very encouraging response.  It has been on my shelf for 8 or 9 months now and every once in a while, I&#x27;d try to use it.  Today, I noticed it is turning black at the top.  I can only assume it is mold / mildew.  I love the developers story on their label, but, hey folks, get professional.  If it is too thick to use and I can&#x27;t use it fast enough so that it molds, something isn&#x27;t right.  And, this is Vermont, not exactly the heat and humidity capital of the US.</li>
    <li> Actually it deserves 4.5 stars.  Half a star reduced for the highly inappropriate container.  Very good moisturizer with a pleasing odor.  It does not have any offensive or chemical odor.  It has almost not-so-spreadable butter consistency.  This is only with reference to its look and texture.  Once rubbed onto the skin, it spreads well (Do not except the chemical-laden spreading consistency that disappears into the skin).  My little son does not complain of any itch even after several hours of application even during harsh winter.  I have also used it a few times when I ran out of my moisturizer.  I HAD TO cut the bottle in half with a knife and transfer the contents to a wide-mouth bottle like a jam jar and use a little wooden ice cream stick to &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; the moisturizer.  The pump attachment is a piece of joke. Wonder why they did not pay any attention to the container part of it.  Has a rating of 1 on EWG database which is one of the reasons I bought it.  The ingredient list is satisfactory.  The price is affordable and it is easily available. I got mine from the local Walmart.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my baby and have since she was born. It is awesome! She has fair and sensitive skin. But, I buy it at Target for less than $10 for the same size listed here. I&#x27;m disappointed that the price is so high here because I love the option of ordering and having items delivered to my house. The price difference makes a trip to Target totally worth it! The rating on the actual item is five stars for me, the price is a one star.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Our baby had really dry legs in the winter, two applications of this made her skin baby soft again.  Really like the smell too.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! The smell is so refreshing. I bought this to use on my dog, her skin gets very dry in the harsh winter weather where we live. I am always looking natural products that I can use on her. She loves when she gets a rub down with this lotion, only licks it a little bit. The smell is fantastic! Makes my pup smell fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works great for the kids myself and my husband. Soaks into the skin does not stay on top and smells great</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been a baby for a long time but I absolutely love this product.  I purchased it for the natural ingredients and will continue to purchase it for many reasons.  First of all it&#x27;s more like a butter than a lotion, very creamy but also very light and easily absorbed.  It does have a smell but not a fragrance like a perfume.  It smells like a natural food type product, not readily identifiable and the smell  goes away immediately.  I apply it after a shower from my face to my feet.  It  makes my skin soft and smooth, it&#x27;s never irritating even on shaved or waxed skin,  and I don&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed or put shoes on, it soaks in right away. ETA:  I deducted a star because as I got down to the last third of product, the pump became useless.  The product is too thick and doesn&#x27;t back fill so there&#x27;s gaps in what&#x27;s left of the product and the pump can&#x27;t adequately pump it out.  I have to remove the pump apparatus and try and shake out the creamy lotion/butter. It&#x27;s time consuming and not very efficient.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have had! (And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.) I use this every day, and already I&#x27;m planning on ordering up more. It really does help me keep my skin moisturized. And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> We love the lotion but you don&#x27;t get a lot of product vs the cost.  This is compounded by the fact that the lotion comes in a pump bottle that doesn&#x27;t come close to being able to extract all the lotion therein. Unscrewing the pump and shaking out the rest as needed is a must!!</li>
    <li> I love the lotion! The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that the lotion is so thick that it wouldn&#x27;t come up through the pump,  Even when  I took the pump off the bottle and tried to shake some of the lotion on to my palm, I couldn&#x27;t get it to come out.  I ended up giving it to my sister and let her take a crack at it.</li>
    <li> I love my Shea moisture lotion, it smells just like the soap and I think it&#x27;s my baby&#x27;s signature smell now. It&#x27;s very moisturizing for his skin and mines as well, I sometimes put it in his hair.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;She is just the softest baby!&amp;#34; Is what I heAr very frequently. I believe it is because of this lotion! All the ingredients are completely natural. I feel confident when I&#x27;m rubbing this into my baby&#x27;s skin, I know that there is nothing toxic. Also, there is 0 alcohol. I think that&#x27;s what makes this lotion so great. Beware, the formula is very thick. You probably won&#x27;t be able to get it out through the pump. I squeeze it out the top. I do wish it came in a different container, a squeeze bottle or even jar. But even that doesn&#x27;t take away from the 5 star rating. It&#x27;s just THAT amazing.</li>
    <li> definitely my favorite lotion. I have a sensitive skin and have always use baby lotion. This is the bomb. Smells great. I just miss the thickness of the original when they were doing promotions at T@rget. I suppose it&#x27;s easier to pump out now.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the lotion, I&#x27;ve used the ointment and loved it so I gave the lotion a try. Pros: thick for dry skin, smoothes on skin, best use after baths, smells great. Cons: doesn&#x27;t pump out lotion (maybe since its thick or pump is defective), had to screw off top to use which squeezes out too much product. I doubt if I&#x27;ll purchase again due to packaging - dispenser</li>
    <li> Best organic lotion for the money I have found!!  It has the best smell.  I use it on my little girls and myself.  Its a staple in our house!</li>
    <li> This lotion is so nice ! Very soothing to my dry skin . I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin. The smell is also nice too</li>
    <li> The smell is incredible and the feel of it on skin is calming, soothing and softening.  Recovering from a broken bone, my physical therapist used it to massage the area and it melted into the skin and provided a wonderful medium for the massage work. Oh and the smell is just so so wonderful...second purchase. and will do more.</li>
    <li> Love this and baby shampoo for our baby. Doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am overwhelmed by the fragrance - definitely would not recommend for babies.  Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Lotion was old and I returned it.  It was yellow, wouldn&#x27;t come out of the bottle and not anything close to what I have used in the past which is a very emollient and easily pumped lotion.  This was neither.</li>
    <li> Great product my skin is super dry and it&#x27;s hard to find something that makes it nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand actually.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and it&#x27;s free from harmful chemicals that are unfortunately present in a fair number of drug store moisturizers. I also use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It&#x27;s also powerful enough to use on the hands, so really a very versatile product. I must say that although Shea Moisture isn&#x27;t a perfect brand (some of their other products contain iffy ingredients or overpowering perfumes) this particular product really hits it out of the ballpark.</li>
    <li> The lotion is thick and creamy, just the way I like for myself and kids. But it&#x27;s so thick, I have a real hard time getting it out the container. We&#x27;ve had to resort to just opening the entire top of bottle to use</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great, but it&#x27;s pretty thick so the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I often hesitate when ordering a fragranced item online but I am glad I took a chance on this lotion. It is a thicker, creamy lotion that is not greasy! It smells great! While I ordered this for our kids, I often am running into their bathroom to use it since the skin on my knuckles crack in the winter time, this works wonders on it! Will order some for myself!</li>
    <li> love the lotion but the pump on the bottle won&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for our newborn son. Had I known the smell was so stong I would have bought something else. It smells good, but I felt like it was too stong for a newborn. I waited to use it on him until he was a bit older. However, I tried it on my daughters excema, and it worked great. I had her shower and then applied it three times right before bed. When she woke up this morning the excema was almost gone. I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I should preface this review by stating that I love smells. I like essential oils, incense, scented soaps, etc. This lotion smells pretty strongly, but it smells pretty strongly of really lovely stuff. Shea and frankincense, mainly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb fully, so it can end up feeling a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on both myself and on my baby. I use it on myself because I love the smell, and on the baby because she has dry skin. This helps a lot with maintaining her skin, but if I miss an application or two I have to resort to Aquaphor to get the dryness back under control.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cream. I bought it originally from Wal-greens for my babies and I loved it so much it&#x27;s the only cream I use on them or myself.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so good! It&#x27;s also the ONLY lotion my baby can wear! The ingreadiants are top notch! This lotion is alcohol free and non drying, perfect for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I liked the scent as a wash and shampoo. The scent was faint, but as a lotion the smell is too strong for a baby. As for moisturizing, it worked better on my toddler. For my newborn, it isn&#x27;t thick enough.</li>
    <li> Just put it in a jar with a wide top.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it smells so good and is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The smell is so overwhelming that it&#x27;s hard to get past. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you whether it moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer feels very elegant and does not leave a residue after about one minute.  The ingredients are all natural without any chemicals.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Target for my 5 month old daughter who has eczema.  I don&#x27;t recommend this for clearing up an intense flare up, because it does contain fragrance, but it is amazing for preventing flare ups and healing during the dry stage of eczema. It is a very rich thick cream and has a mild musk scent which I love. I get a lot of compliments on how nice she smells. My husband uses it too on his dry elbows. My only complaint is that it is difficult to get the last 1/3 of lotion out of the bottle. It won&#x27;t come out even if you turn it upside down, you will have to cut the bottle to get the rest out, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, but it is so thick that the pump can&#x27;t do its job.  I have to dig out the product every day with a small spatula (I have bought some other Shea Moisture lotions and don&#x27;t have this problem).  It is also pretty greasy.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product! It smells AMAZING! I&#x27;m a nurse and I take it to work with me. Keeps my hands from getting too dry and everyone else comes to me for their lotion (Yes, all the other nurses put their lotions down and use mine).</li>
    <li> Once the cooler weather starts, it is guaranteed that the skin on my legs will get very dry. At times, it can get so bad that I will end up scratching the irritated skin on my shins &#x27;till it is raw. Shea Moisture for babies is a healing lotion, and it does just that. It isn&#x27;t overly perfumy, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my already damaged dry skin. This stuff is magic in a pump bottle, without the overkill of chemicals! If they say it&#x27;s OK for infants, it must be OK for adults with dry skin, as well. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it on my newborn, 5yr old and myself. It&#x27;s thick, creamy and does not leave skin feeling oily, just nicely moisturized. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this entire product line. The lotion smells amazing, absorbs right into the skin without feeling greasy or sticky. My entire family uses this all natural product.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion.  The pump bottle is hard to use.  You have to have the pump in just the right spot in order to get the lotion out.  I will buy again because the lotion is so good but I do not like the pump.</li>
    <li> Man, I love this lotion. The ingredients are excellent, no parabens, and not tested on animals. I use it on my face, it&#x27;s that mild. And the price cannot be beat. It&#x27;s my new staple product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This absolutely should not be marketed as a baby lotion! Tricking the consumer into thinking they are getting something they are not is the new way of marketing for these unscrupulous companies. Here is what they list as ONE ingredient, when this is what Vegetable Emulsifying Wax really consists of;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients for Emulsifying Wax NF are: Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 60, PEG-150 Stearate, and Steareth-20. It has the characteristics of cetyl alcohol combined with the viscosity building effect of stearyl alcohol as an effective thickener and helps form stable emulsions.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells fantastic! And my mother-in-law, who hates &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; stuff, also thinks so!  It is a bit thick and the pump only works for getting the top two-thirds of the lotion out, but the lotion is worth the extra work.  My son has dry skin and tends towards eczema and this has helped keep his body breakout free.  He had a flare up on his face and I was using all kinds of things, and some of the other lotions seemed to &amp;#34;burn,&amp;#34; but not this one.  His face has since healed up since I started using it there and I have continued to use and am very happy that his face is no longer red and raw looking!!</li>
    <li> This formulation is wonderful for my two little girls that have dry exema prone skin. I like how thick it is, but the packaging sucks. You have to fight to get the pump to work. I just open it up and use the pump like a scoop.</li>
    <li> A high-quality product, the ingredients, sourcing &amp; people involved all make this product worth purchasing &amp; using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, nourished &amp; smooth. My skin (and my conscience!) feel so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars are:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is mostly nice &amp; natural, but there is one scent undertone that, although nice, is a bit strong&lt;br /&gt;2. I go through it so quickly, I would prefer to purchase it in bulk (larger containers) so that I&#x27;m creating less plastic waste. Also unsure if the container itself is bio-plastic, which would add even more awesomeness points. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My baby had very dry skin and this was the only lotion that made it baby soft again. I really love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on weird little skin issues for both my baby and me. My only complaint is that the smell is somewhat strong. It&#x27;s pleasant, but I would love this to come in an unscented version. I shudder to think what kind of chemicals are making it smell that way.</li>
    <li> Burned my daughters skin</li>
    <li> Product Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Shea Moisture Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Been applying this product to my skin by warming it up beforehand. Instantly noticed a difference on how soft and smooth my skin has become and the youthful added to it. I have a darker complexion and this product made my skin &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Will post further results in following months. Shea Moisture is a pretty good brand, this lotion leaves some room for those out there that want to add it to their mixtures.</li>
    <li> The first 3 bottles I bought from my grocery store were amazing! The product was exceptional and healed my daughter&#x27;s skin when NOTHING else would. When I went back for more, the product was completely different. It was runny, greasy, smelled funky, and didn&#x27;t work. After some investigating, I discovered the good stuff had ingredients that matched the ones on the website. The cruddy stuff had vegetable emulsifying wax in it!! That is NOT a natural ingredient. Same problem when I ordered it from Amazon, and when I bought it from Walgreen&#x27;s. What&#x27;s the deal?? If you have the best lotion ever, DON&#x27;T MESS WITH IT!! I have been communicating with the company, so we&#x27;ll see what transpires. Until then, I am stuck with products that don&#x27;t even come close to measuring up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SM products for my hair for a few years and absolutely love them.  I&#x27;ve recently expanded to the baby products with the expansion of my family!  The non-functioning pump has been a consistent issue with ALL of the products, but I recently contacted customer service and have been assured that they are finally addressing the issue.  I&#x27;m sure looking forward to that!</li>
    <li> its alright...nothing special. I&#x27;d rather just make my own moisturizer with essential oils and a carrier oil</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product on my baby&#x27;s skin. He has very dry patchy skin. I loved that this product isn&#x27;t full of all the fragrances and additives; however, it caused my baby&#x27;s skin to break out into a rash. Within minutes of rubbing it on his skin, he became very irritable and I noticed a rash covering his legs. I&#x27;m sure if your baby&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, it would work great. Try it on a small spot if your unsure before lathering it on.</li>
    <li> I really want to love Shea Moisture. I&#x27;ve tried another lotion and the fragrance was way too intense. Thought I&#x27;d luck out on getting a milder scent with their baby line, but the scent is so overpowering! Don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on my baby (or myself).  Shea Moisture gets an A+ for texture and a D for fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It feels great and smells really good and fresh.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Organic too.</li>
    <li> Great baby lotion.  Smells amazing and moisturizes without that oily feeling.  I started buying this for my baby and now I use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came leaking out but I absolutely love the lotion so I dealt with it.  If it keeps happening I will definitely say something but it was an isolated incident.  They just should have used more bubble wrap or something to keep it from flying around the box.</li>
    <li> Smells great but the pump broke on both bottles I bought</li>
    <li> fav lotion!  I have used so many natural lotions for my toddler, this by far the best.  It&#x27;s thick but absorbs nicely and the smell is the best!  like vanilla cupcake!  I will only buy this now</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best lotion I, and I stress &amp;#34;I&amp;#34;, have ever used. It goes on smooth and leaves a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> My son is Korean and Black and has super duper dry skin but a few pumps of this liquid gold every morning and he&#x27;s good to go,</li>
    <li> This is nice think lotion but it absorbs quickly.  I like that it&#x27;s shea butter as it&#x27;s good for evening out skin tone.  I use this on my daughter every day and based on how well it works, ordered the adult version of the lotion for myself.  Only complaint is the container, which now that I&#x27;m getting towards the bottom 1/3 of the product is starting to require me to shake it down to meet the pump.  Will probably be really annoying once it&#x27;s almost gone, but not enough to stop using it, I&#x27;ve already ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE IT! love the smell, how it feels - and is ORGANIC/&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free!!!</li>
    <li> My youngest has dry and sensitive skin. This irritated her skin and the smell is incredibly overpowering. Her older sister uses it now after baths. The smell is almost like red licorice but super strong. I liked it at first now it gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Simply Lovely lotion. Rich moisture with nice fragrance. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Felt greasy when I first put it on then within an hour skin no longer felt moisturized. Did nothing for my daughters eczema either. Also it says it does not contain fragrance but I cannot believe that. The smell was very strong and did not smell natural at all.</li>
    <li> Pleasant ...easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> I really like the lotion, but I don&#x27;t know why they have it in this kind of container. The lotion is too thick to pump out; so you&#x27;re left unscrewing the cap and trying to scoop out the lotion with the stick the pump is connected to. This has to be a problem for everyone. Why not put this in a container that makes sense?</li>
    <li> Love Love this lotion I use this on my face at night it is great. Also on my grand baby&#x27;s when they come over is gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It comes out of the pump easily and it smells wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.</li>
    <li> This says raw shea butter, but if you blow up the picture really big you&#x27;ll see at the very bottom the description that it has frankincense and myrrh in it. Well, unfortunately, I did not see this part when I ordered it for use on my baby. Holy cow, the smell is overwhelming to the point of gagging me. Additionally, the lotion is more like a thick cream and is difficult to pump out of the bottle and spread. I would not recommend anyone use this on their baby. If they are going to market this for babies then lose the frankincense and myrrh.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sons eczema, but it is so strongly scented he broke out in a rash from it. Fortunately I can use it, and I do love the smell, but it&#x27;s actually not that moisturizing. I have very dry skin and after putting this on it barely feels like I put lotion on. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> smells so goood!  I use it more than my baby</li>
    <li> lots of moisture :) I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked using baby lotion, powder etc for myself. Shea moisture works wonderfully for dry skin and has an amazing aroma. I just love it!  It&#x27;s great for kids and adults alike.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells great and is light!</li>
    <li> well packaged and great stuff! The only weird thing is that this lotion is stark white compared to my other bottle (a softer yellow), but the packaging says that color variations may occur due to it being a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped alleviate eczema symptoms both my husband and father suffered from that turned out to be a skin allergy to methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update, this really is a 5 star product in a 2 star package actually....the lotion is so thick that it the pump is rendered useless a third of the way through use. I put a squeeze top on it from my other shea moisutre baby shampoo bottles, but the lotion is so thick it doesn&#x27;t ever shift to the top when I leave it propped upside down! dunno what the best thing to do is here now!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I know it says baby lotion, but I bought it for myself. It is smooth and creamy. It absorbs right into your skin and leaves it really soft it smells really good too! I am always looking for lotions that don&#x27;t have petro products snd I will deffinately be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> In my 20s, I developed early-onset rosacea and I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin that reacts to problematic ingredients in a BAD way.  Most recently, I noticed a sunburn-like rash on my nose that looked like very dry skin.  I was using a moisturizer from Whole Foods for at least a year and realize it was this lotion that had been consistently used so I needed a replacement that would both sooth my dry skin and not irritate my rosacea further.  I noticed this lotion on the shelf in the store and was intrigued because it contains all natural ingredients - including chamomile which soothes redness.  It does not contain anything I know I&#x27;m allergic to - such as gluten or corn.  It was a decent price (less than $8 for a bottle) so I decided to give it a go.  I started using it last night and I can usually tell within 24-48 hours whether my skin will react to it and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem so far.  My skin feels soft and silky, which is wonderful as it has not felt this way in a LONG time.  I must say that I was worried about the argan oil because, even though it is good for skin, it makes my face feel greasy when the actual oil is used.  However, this does not occur with the lotion.  What has yet to be seen is whether my skin will build up an allergy to it after using it for a long time.  Hopefully, that will not happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this product for several months, I still love it.  My skin, which is very sensitive, has not reacted badly to it at all.  I have bought several more bottles because I use it twice a day (morning and bedtime).  I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd UPDATE: After using this product continuously, my skin seems to have built up a resistance to it.  It no longer soothes dry skin and my rosacea has gotten worse.  In fact, sometimes, it appears my face is more red after using it than before.  I have discontinued this lotion and moved on to something else.</li>
    <li> I use this on my Adult self - although labeled for baby. Smells refreshing &amp; light. Very healing and Moisturizing for my aging skin. This is my 3rd bottle, each one has lasted approx 3 mos. Use daily.</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion smells and it is rich and seems to keep my baby&#x27;s skin soft. Occasionally I have come across a bottle of this stuff where the lotion seemed a bit more watery than usual but it worked just as well.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells really nice and i like the texture once applied to skin. However its extremely difficult to actually get it out of the pump. The lotion seems to be like a solid chunk inside the container. Its very frustrating. I considered a return but dont want to go through the hassle just for lotion. Will definitely not order again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I had used a different variety of this lotion (same brand, different ingredients/scent). It had a very nice light scent. I assumed it was because it was for babies. When I went to buy more, the type I bought earlier wasn&#x27;t available so I bought the same brand but the chamomile/shea/argan type instead.&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t smell this lotion before purchasing it. When I got it home I took a pea-sized amount and rubbed it into my hands. The scent was so horribly strong I had to wash it off. And it still smelled. I could never put this on my face and could never use a quantity necessary to moisturize my hands or arms.  The scent would knock me out. I&#x27;d think it would bother people around me as well.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t think this product should be used on babies.  I think it would be irritating to their noses and eyes. I do not recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t like very strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;  I wasn&#x27;t able to use enough to review it&#x27;s moisturizing qualities.</li>
    <li> I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s lotion and then I learned about all of the preservatives and synthetic things in it. In fact I have to go update my review here shortly. I was given this lotion by a friend for my dry shoulders. The scent is powerful but fades to a light airy one within about 15 minutes. This product is cruelty - free and has no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil or sythetics. I was excited that I could read and know what each ingredient is. It is certified organic. For a family embarking on a journey to limit synthetic toxins this is a stepping stone from our other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how much a small dob covers. My skin and baby&#x27;s skin drinks it in. If you would like a healthier alternative for baby go with Shea Moisture products. I feel better and so does my skin!</li>
    <li> I DID NOT purchase this from this site, and by looking at the price I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  I purchased mine at a T-A-R-G-E-T store for nine dollars and ninety-nine cents.  It&#x27;s on their site for the same price.  This lotion is not greasy and makes my skin silky.  My husband loves using it too.  If you have really dry skin, however, I don&#x27;t think it will work.  It&#x27;s a very light, and wonderful smelling lotion.  The Shea Moisture baby wash is also great.  I use it on my face, because it&#x27;s great at removing make-up, oil etc.  For me, it is slightly drying if I use it daily.  So, I use it a few times a week.  My skin feels really clean afterwards. T-A-R-G-E-T sells this in the store and online also for the same nine dollar price.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky and smells GREAT. Got a lot of people hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lotion! Great moisture, fresh scent, and so soothing!</li>
    <li> My son has eczema, he broke out with a bad rash on his legs, red and pimply. I went to target to purchase this, the soap and \\&quot;butter\\&quot; therapy. After a few days the bumps went from red to skin tone,size diminished. And probably within a week, they were gone. His skin is soo dry, even using oils, his skin would drink them in and leave him dry once again. I use the lotion ( all over), then the butter therapy( tub not the tube) only over flared up areas. His skin is completely moisturized and left moisturized! I was worried the scent would bother his allergies, but it hasn&#x27;t, he really likes it. Seems strong but mellows out. Kinda of like a light vanilla. Just awesome stuff and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, I&#x27;m sure he is too. It&#x27;s been about a month now, and he hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I use this for myself.  It smells so good and the scent doesn&#x27;t just fade away, it will last...at least on me.  When I saw that this product contains frankincense &amp; myrrh, I decided to buy it to try it out.  This is my first product I have purchased from Shea Moisture and since I like it so, I&#x27;ll definitely try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very softening and smells so nice.  Everyone comments on the scent and it doesn&#x27;t annoy my sensitive nose like the flowery ones.  It has a really great aroma.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, smells amazing too! However if you, ahem... your baby, has really dry or eczema prone skin, try the Baby Eczema therapy one - it fixes the dry patchy areas in 1 use. I will try this again on him in the summer as his skin isn&#x27;t as dry, but I have been using this on myself, its awesome &amp; did I mention it smells fantastic?!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, we use for adults and children alike in the house. When you look at the label you also see that it contains more naturally derived products and less artificial chemicals; and it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> lots of moisture :) I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but it came with the top plastic dispenser broken and though I have many extra dispenseres none of them work. I opted not to send it back for a refund. If you have exta that would be good otherwise I just pour it out!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent of this lotion... it absorbs quickly and is so soothing for my skin (dry and aging). Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Used this since my now 3 year old daughter was born and it is excellent.  The lotion as I know it I would give 4.5 stars taking only a half point away because the pump is too short for the bottle so when you are about 2/3 through the bottle you have to remove the pump to get the lotion.  The time around I ordered online and I don&#x27;t know if it was an old batch or what but both bottles (I used it this time around on my son also) congealed to some thick clump that could not pass through the pump.  They were both fine initially and then after about two weeks and not even 1/4 through the bottle, the clump...  I will use again but will not order online.</li>
    <li> My kid when he was 10 weeks his skin broke into very bad baby acne. And then turned out to be Eczema .. I kept applying Aquaphor layers and layers well it worked but was very slow.It took nearly 10 days but yet there is still some roughness on his skin. I worried if i can ever see my baby&#x60;s soft skin again .. One day i grabbed a butter stick from the refregerator warmed it a bit and then massaged gently on my baby and washed him off .. But then i still had to use Aquaphor ..so greasy and my babies clothes are spoiled so easily with those greasy marks.. One day i was at Target and looked at this product.Thought to try it out and see . Well turned out that my babie&#x60;s skin turned smooth and silky in 1 day ..I was surprised .. it worked really great in summer but when winter started in texas this product din&#x60;t show much positive effect i had to go back to Aquaphor greasy stuff. But well good that it turned my kids skin smooth .. I would recommend it to try and see how it works on ur baby ..</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Non greasy, works well, smells great!</li>
    <li> We love this brand!  No toxins on your skin...just natural moisturizers! I use it on my children and for myself.  I also use the shampoos and hair products!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific and safe product for your baby that will leave their skin silky smooth without the greasy feeling and you will absolutely just love the smell. I always look forward to holding my baby as I put her to sleep right after her bath and just taking in the terrific smell of this lotion. Awesome!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Original review follows, but I&#x27;ve concluded the emulsifiers in this are not shea butter, but something else.  I&#x27;m throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite pump lotion.  I use it for myself and baby (well 2 year old).  I really like the ingredients.  Much better than other major drug store brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it is not really a liquid or cream; it&#x27;s closer to a paste and doesn&#x27;t come up well through the pump.  Quickly develops air pockets and won&#x27;t pump.  This is easily remedied by pouring a little cold pressed essential oil into it.  I have shea butter oil, argon oil, almond oil that I use, but quite a few, even the kitchen olive oil will do fine.  Don&#x27;t put in baby oil which is just mineral oil or lanolin products.  Other good candidates are Grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil, cocoa oil, castor oil, etc.  Since this is so easy to do, I give it positive rating and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love the thickness and the smell of this lotion.  My only recomendation would be that because it is so thick, it should be in a jar not a jar with a pump. I can&#x27;t get it to come out of the pump so I just take the pump off and squeeze it out but it is agreat product.</li>
    <li> This lotion definitely not for baby - scent is so strong that even I cannot tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;The consistence is creamy and heavy - extremly difficult to go through pump, so it constantly stucks.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Like the way it smells and feels on my skin. It is a bit thick and I had to tap it so that it would  dispense. The best part is that it has really clean ingredients. No chemicals. I can put up with it being thick!</li>
    <li> Love the cream but found the smell to be a little strong.  Took me a bit to get used to it.  The cream itself however is lovely.  I have sensitive skin and actually bought it for myself.  I also bought their avocado shea moisture and prefer the smell of that one.</li>
    <li> Why is this in a pump bottle if it is too thick to pump?! Lotion is okay, fragrance is a little too strong.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Leaked a little bit in shipping but overall good experience.</li>
    <li> This lotion is super creamy and moisturizes my children&#x27;s skin like no other lotion has so far. The smell is divine and it&#x27;s all but eliminated my daughters dry skin/eczema. The absence of harmful chemicals makes it a triple score. I use this lotion in conjunction with the matching body wash and the thick moisturizing head to toe ointment for extra dry patches. Shea Moisture&#x27;s line of products deliver top quality and zero risks for my family as opposed to many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products we&#x27;ve tried. Try it today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; qualities in it. I bought it to see if it would help my newborns acne go away. Hydrocortisone 1% ended up being the answer. Not this product- but it does smell pretty good.</li>
    <li> Another Shea Moisture product that works well and does what it says; it makes my skin look and feel wonderful, I believe in Shea Moisture Products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so thick! It actually broke the pump. Now it&#x27;s close to impossible to get the stuff out of the bottle. Due to the thickness it&#x27;s also hard to get it on my kid. Maybe with a baby it would be easier but toddlers like to move and it&#x27;s too hard to chase them while trying to rub this paste on them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for my boys and can tell you it is a great product - I use it for after bath time, and they don&#x27;t feel greasy.  The smell is great.  I have ordered more bottles for myself and to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I love the way it feels. I carry it with me, everywhere I go. The pump top comes off a little too easily to suit me, but if you&#x27;re not carrying it in a diaper bag, it&#x27;s probably fine.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever ! I use this on my 1 year old son, it makes his skin super smooth and soft. I also love that it&#x27;s so fluffy &amp; creamy, but the pump must go. It&#x27;s very difficult to get the product out. I really don&#x27;t care for the scent, but my son loves the scent so much he wants to eat the cream lol</li>
    <li> The product is just what my kids with dry skin and eczema need.  No sign of toxic ingredients, the lotion smells nice and is thick. It doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and keeps it oiled all day - no signs of dryness at the end of the day.  I wish it came in a tub. Because it is so thick, it gets impossible to pump it out of the container. I feel like I have to cut the container open eventually.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Target, I was looking for a thicker lotion than California baby - it felt too watered down. The texture of this lotion is great but it smells like perfume. Why on earth would you create such a strong scent for a baby lotion? I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Best baby lotion!! My son has sensitive skin, but this is perfect. love that it is rated a 1 on ewg.org&#x27;s skin deep database.</li>
    <li> I have searched far and wide for a product that actually worked for my baby&#x27;s very dry winter skin, and I have found it in this lotion!  I had been using all sorts of moisturisers for her skin, such as coconut oil and the regular Eucerin.  The coconut oil works, but is a bit of a pain to warm it up so I can melt it down, and it takes a long time to absorb into the skin.  Now, compared to Eucerin, the Shea Moisture baby healing lotion works just as well if not better, but has two strong points against the Eucerin healing lotion:  1.  The Shea Moisture baby healing lotion spreads very easily, Eucerin does not, and 2. The Shea Moisture baby healing lotion absorbs very quickly, Eucerin takes a long time to absorb.  One can also factor in that the Shea Moisture baby healing lotion contains a lot of natural oils that are great for the skin, while Eucerin is petroleum based and does not contain any natural oils that are good for the skin.  Oh, and this lotion smells awesome!  Not too strong, light and pleasant.  The only tiny complaint I might have about this stuff is the container.  I had a difficult time pumping the lotion from the bottle, so I ended up squeezing the lotion into a used shea moisture body scrub container I had saved for just such an occasion to make it easier to access.  This lotion should be in a squeeze tube like the ultra-sensitive shea moisture baby healing lotion (which is also great stuff by the way).  I love this stuff, and will continue to use it for my baby for as long as  possible!</li>
    <li> Love love love this cream.  It is completely out of chemicals, has a perfect soft smell, and keeps my skin moisturized without any greasy feeling. This is the only body cream I use since I am staying away from chemicals.  My skin feels like new and I might add that I am in my early 50&#x27;s!  My only complaint is the container itself.  This cream is not thin, it does not have the consistency for a pump so when you push the pump nothing comes out.  It should be sold in a container with a screw on top and a wide top.</li>
    <li> This lotion is moisturizing and has been gentle enough for my baby, but I have been using it mor for my hands and cuticles over the dry winter months. The consistency of the lotion is slightly runnier than Shea butter but very thick for what many to find as a &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; My only gripe is that because of the thick consistency, the pump does not work well and I find myself stirring the product and recapping it to pump out the lotion. Overall, it smells great and does its job.</li>
    <li> This is the richest, creamiest, most joyful, smell goodiest healing moisturizer on the market. And it&#x27;s organic! I love it. It is a balm for my skin and my soul, to know that I am putting fabulous ingredients on my body, absorbing them through my skin. Haven&#x27;t we put enough junk on our skin? Do you realize that you &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; that stuff through your skin, just as if you had breathed it or eaten it? Yes, it goes to your liver! Give your liver something good to munch on. Buy this and eat well. If you buy organic food and put crap on your body, does that really make any sense to you? This stuff is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a good, natural pre-bedtime lotion for my 18m old (ran out of &amp; couldn&#x27;t find the Earths Best chamomile sleepy time lotion, which has a great light scent, and thankfully I did finally find on amazon). This lotion scent is just way too strong though - and I would argue not even a good scent. I had to wash my hands because I couldn&#x27;t stand the lingering smell - for babies I would have to imagine this is just way too pungent. Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s moisturizing qualities because I couldn&#x27;t stand to use it more than two times.</li>
    <li> Very nicely scented natural lotion. My very sensitive skin baby does not get a rash with this. We use it often for leg massage time and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Good product but so thick it doesn&#x27;t come out. I have to scrape it out with my finger to use it...and it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
    <li> Product I received is not usable with the pump dispenser because it is way too thick.  I could only get about a teaspoon out from the pump and that&#x27;s with about 30 pumps and shaking the bottle.  The &#x27;lotion&#x27; inside has congealed to a blob, about the consistency of Crisco cooking grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate, because the product does moisturize pretty well (have to scoop out the cream with the dispenser tube).  Perhaps it would thin out at higher temperatures, but I suspect it would need to be about 90+ F.  (This time of year, it&#x27;s about 65 in our house.)</li>
    <li> Very good product. Goes on smoothly and has a wonderful smell. Definitely buying again!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Too bad the pump doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to some scents and this is one of them.  I thought since it was for babies, it would be okay, but as I was putting it on my baby, my eyes started watering and my nose started itching.  It&#x27;s terrible and VERY strong.  Even after washing my hands three times the smell is still lingering and giving me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the texture of the lotion is great and it feels very rich.  Why, why why did they choose this scent?  I really wanted to like this, but with the scent it is unusable for me.  $10 down the drain.  Even if I weren&#x27;t allergic to the scent, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good one for a baby product.  Wish I could have smelled it first.</li>
    <li> Smells very strong. Won&#x27;t get same type again. Other than that no complaints and kids seem ok with it so far</li>
    <li> I have three bottles of this lotion situated around my home and office and after trying a million other lotions, I can confidently say this is the best. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it absorbs quickly into your skin.  I love the fragrance.  I wish it came in a jar because it&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s impossible to pump out.  I usually wind up cutting the plastic jar and putting it into a small container.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  It is very thick and great for kids.  It has a nice, mild scent and has helped relieve my son&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very rich and gentle and in my experience, very good on skin that is irritated due to eczema or psoriasis.  I buy it regularly.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this for eczema control. Walgreens had a good sale so I picked this one and the avocado scent. This one is creamy and thick but the both smell absolutely amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to lotion my baby up just so I can sniff him. I&#x27;m in love. I think I&#x27;ll use it for myself too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for our toddler. The lotion has a very strong scent, much too strong for my liking. The lotion is also so thick that the pump on the bottle malfunctions every time we try to apply it. Although there is not a greasy feeling after application, I would probably not purchase again due to the scent, which is much too strong for a baby in my opinion. The lotion has helped with my daughter&#x27;s eczema, but I would prefer something that actually comes in a working bottle with half the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have used on my babies!  It has nothing bad in it (it&#x27;s so hard to find baby lotion - especially eczema lotion - with out even mineral oil in it)!  It stopped my son&#x27;s eczema within one day, even in -18F weather and it smells GREAT!  I want to buy some for myself!</li>
    <li> I opened the cover to smell this lotion and really thought it had a mild scent.  Then I applied it to my hands and I thought the smell was way too strong.  I can use it if I don&#x27;t have a headache but if I have a headache, I cannot tolerate it and can&#x27;t get the smell washed off.  There is no way I would use anything with this strong of scent on a baby.  As far as the lotion quality goes, I think it is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil previously and I feel this moisturizes better.  Hopefully the olive and marula lotion doesn&#x27;t smell so strong as I plan on trying that.  I hope it moisturises just as good.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand we use on our kids. We use the shower gel too. Smells great and it good for them. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The scent is SO divine.  Makes my babies smell good and leaves them with nice, soft skin too.  Never change it!</li>
    <li> This arrived about a week ago.  Love this stuff! My skin is very sensitive.  I&#x27;m allergic to aloe, any flower oil or ingredient.  My skin is both dry and oily! For the last two years I have been searching for a healthy face and skin lotion that I&#x27;m not allergic to AND smells good! I even tried making my own but my homemade stuff never really made my skin feel moisturized, just greasy.  My favorite thing about this lotion is that it is very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily!  Hallelujah!! I saw a bunch of people complaining about the smell and so I was worried because I cannot stand strong smells.  This has a unique smell for sure but its fairly light and not obnoxious or annoying, at least not to me. Also, since I have sensitive skin, I get rashes pretty easy.  Unfortunately the rashes take forever to completely go away.  After the second time using it, I could tell a difference.  The scaliness was lessened and every time thereafter it has been less noticeable.  VERY thick.  Some people complained that it wouldn&#x27;t come out of the pump.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that, however I would suggest when pressing the pump, press the back, wider portion instead of the narrow end portion, as this pump doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as regular grocery store lotions.  It may be more expensive than other ones out there but it&#x27;s worth it! My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t see that it comes in a larger size!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the first I have found that actually helps my daughter&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s also a reasonable price. And the smell is absolutely delicious; it&#x27;s like perfume (it smells like Angel, in my opinion). I suppose this is the one downside, in that  not sure I&#x27;d use it on a boy because the scent is so feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Love the ingredient list and love this stuff!</li>
    <li> We tried about every lotion for my sons dry skin and this is the only one that worked! It smells very nice and goes on very easily. I reccomend it for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;makes my body feel great&lt;br /&gt;and does wonders for my hands&lt;br /&gt;I massage it everywhere on my body&lt;br /&gt;and feels great&lt;br /&gt;will order more</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it for hand lotion! I don&#x27;t even have a baby! It&#x27;s just so nice and light.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller</li>
    <li> But this product is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; for about a year now, and loving it. I have found joy in removing harmful substances from our life. This being said, the last year I have made my own lotion (which is great, but can be costly and time consuming) and had recently taken to just using plain raw organic coconut oil as a moisturizer. As easy as that way, I began noticing dry patched on my forearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on a trip, I forgot my coconut oil, and ran to Walgreens of all places to find a moisturizer for my 18 month old son and myself. We just happened to find this product. Read the ingredients and was so pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This took the eczema away overnight on my arms and my son&#x27;s legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty incredible stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION though. Although I gave the product 5 stars, this price is double what you can purchase it on CVS.com, Walgreens.com, or Target.com. They typically sell this line for $9.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this wonderful product though!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for my nephews. The little guy&#x27;s have eczema so I sent the soap and the lotion to my sister for them to try. Winter shipping made it a little hard to pump out at 1st but once she used the soap and the lotion on the boy&#x27;s who are 4 and 6 year&#x27;s old she noticed a dramactic clearing of their eczema and they all love the smell. They stop icthing, which helped them to clear up. Auntie did good again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my LO smelling delicious from morning until about mid-afternoon.</li>
    <li> For about one week, this was a great product for our baby.  After one week, all of the moisture within the lotion dried out and I am now left with essentially a butter that has to be scooped out.  Because it is in a &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; style bottle, you can&#x27;t really get in there to get any of the lotion out.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The lotion feels nice and has a soothing scent.  However, I have not been able to get enough out of the bottle to actually use it.  I removed the pump and it was so thick it would&#x27;t even pour out of the bottle.  Reading other reviews, this seems to be a problem you can avoid by buying from a local store, rather than online.  But since this is my only experience with it, I can&#x27;t give it a very good rating.  It&#x27;s either a design flaw or a product with a shelf life much too short for online sales.</li>
    <li> Not a sensitive product, would not use this on a baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very heavily perfumed, tastes like chemicals - if your baby puts their lotioned body parts in their mouth they&#x27;re just getting a bunch of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not good for baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it smells like an old woman</li>
    <li> I would give this negative 5 stars. It&#x27;s heavily scented, smells like an old church lady or patchouli hippie. Immediately regretted putting this on my toddler&#x27;s skin. Sending it back.</li>
    <li> Upon first smelling this, I liked it. But when using only a bit on hand and cuticles, I could not tolerate the smell. I&#x27;m so bummed, as it has beneficial ingredients for the skin. I would NEVER use this on a child&#x27;s body. The smell is just too much. What causes the smell if all the ingredients are natural? I really wanted to like this, as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an all-natural lotion with antioxidants and oils. Any suggestions? Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great smell.  Within a week of using this lotion in combination with the oil, skin problems vanished.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Gr8 product silky smooth and gr8 fragrance</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is nice. (I bought this for personal use, since I was dealing with some sort of allergic reaction, and thus a lotion for sensitive skin was helpful.) However, the way it is bottled could use some work. The lotion is thick enough that it does not re-form to be able to be used by the pump. I am needing to take the pump out, and manually scoop out the lotion. A squeeze bottle, or a container with a twist-on lid would be more appropriate for this thickness of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 5 stars for the lotion, but the container is annoying.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever ! Love it .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream.  It smells amazing and cleared my baby&#x27;s eczema up in two days.  The packaging is awful, though.  I have to cut the bottle open with a utility knife to get it out.  If only they would put it in a wide-mouth jar it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells lovely and is all natural.  However, it contains something that gave me hives all over my arms and hands (everywhere I had put it).  Just a note to beware that it might not be as gentle as it sounds.</li>
    <li> Light and nicely scented. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I USE IT FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER ECZEMA AND IT CLEARED UP IN ONE DAY. IT ALSO SMELLS AWESOME! IT IS VERY THICK SO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY  AND WE STAY MOISTURIZED ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> This anday the body wash are great for kids with sensitive skin. My son get little bumps on his skin and when I switched to this stuff they cleared up.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy, smells great too!</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but the pump doesn&#x27;t dispense the lotion. I think the lotion is simply too thick for this type of packaging. The lotion should be in a jar not a bottle with a tiny straw and pump.</li>
    <li> It smells very very powerful...albeit a good smell. My child has semi-sensitive skin... she doesn&#x27;t break out often, but I think this was a little intense, and after a few uses, she started getting small red bumps. Once discontinued, her skin returned to normal.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff at Target for my baby &amp; myself. He started getting a mild heat rash and I used this stuff on his back and buttocks and stomach, and like two to three days later I noticed his skin clearing up. This stuff works for baby with dry skin or little heat rashes(well at least to me). I would definitely recommend this stuff. It also smells good, and it all natural.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this on my baby since he was 6 months old and he is now 16 months. I love this product. Has a lovely smell to it, extreme moisture and I have seen his skin get softer .</li>
    <li> a very nice light scent</li>
    <li> A lovely product. Delicately fragrant along with being soothing and healing. A tiny bit goes a long way. It also seems to strengthen my nails but I don&#x27;t know why. It was so nice to NOT see the long list of chemicals you usually see on a lotion. I think I have found the perfect lotion for me.  UPDATE: I am on my 4th  purchase of this wonderful product! It has far surpasses any lotions I have ever used.</li>
    <li> been buying this lotion for 2 years now yes it is pricey but it is very thick and rich a little goes a long way ! the smell is amazing on my babies warm skin after a bath it just really is almost like aromatherapy in a bottle its great for massages! I use the oil as well  for myself and my whole family its also VERY THICK almost glue like thickness but smoothe to rub on skin! love the smell</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this stuff smells so amazing!  Love using it on our little baby and on me!  Gentle on skin, doesn&#x27;t leave residue and smells divine!  Lasts a long time too!  Started using as a newborn and he is over 3 months now - won&#x27;t be switching.  I&#x27;ve used Aveeno, Burt&#x27;s Bee and a handful of other natural/sensitive products for my babies and this will be the only one I use from now one.</li>
    <li> Just started. So far it is great.</li>
    <li> It really helps with the itching on my body as my skin starts to stretch from the pregnancy, with a very subtle scent easy enough for first trimester morning sickness. Plus, I can use it on baby once they&#x27;re born. :)</li>
    <li> Lotion smells great and we like the ingredients, but the product is so thick that the pump doesn&#x27;t even dispense it.  We&#x27;ll probably end up wasting the majority of it as we can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle.  Also didn&#x27;t work all that well on our dry skin.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It really does heal your skin.  It is soft and it penetrates well.  My daughter and her son use it.  You cannot go wrong with this lotion.</li>
