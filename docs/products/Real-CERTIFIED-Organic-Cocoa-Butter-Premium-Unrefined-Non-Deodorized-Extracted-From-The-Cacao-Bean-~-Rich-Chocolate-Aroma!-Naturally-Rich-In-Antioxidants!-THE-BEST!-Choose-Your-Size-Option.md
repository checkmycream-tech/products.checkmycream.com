<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> product arrived on schedule as promised. wonderful smelling like i remember cocoa butter products that i used to buy a long time ago ! cant wait to use it in other ways besides a body lotion..</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve combined both raw cocoa butter and shea butter in a doubleb boiler to mix and pour Into wide mouth jars.  Next batch I plan on adding an essential oil for a better fragrance.  Skin feels fantastic after rubbing this in!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Have used in multiple recipes and found it worked really nicely.</li>
    <li> It came as stated, fresh and great use for the body.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in my early pregnancy and made it a ritual to rub and massage into my belly (sides and upper thigh as well) nightly.  I am now 37 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks.  I know a lot of it has to do with genetics, but I do believe the use of this product aided in the prevention.  I would buy this product again and again and recommend it to other mothers-to-be.  The product does smell like chocolate (which is expected), so it may make you crave it.  :)</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Great for people with eczema.  Leaves skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. I purchased it as an underarm deodorant, as normal store-bought deodorant is one of the leasing causes of breast cancer. It works very well, and there&#x27;s also the extra plus of smelling like milk chocolate all day ;) I Definitely suggest you all to use this product, not only as a deodorant, (I strongly recommend it though), but also for the many other benefits cocoa butter has; clears up stretch marks and scars and is also a great oil for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> melts right in your hands when rubbed together...makes my hair and skin soft! also instantly stops my itching on my 8 month prego belly :)</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it was very soapy to begin with but I had wished to. Heat it sterilize it and use it for human consumption</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Cocoa Butter.  I also purchased the raw organic Shea Butter from &#x27;Perfect Body Harmony&#x27;.  It is suitable for normal and very dry, skin, and for problem skin (psoriasis, eczema, etc.).  I just started making my own whipped face and body butters.  I live in a very dry climate, the humidity is about 20%.  I&#x27;m 72 and have extremely dry and sensitive skin.  For my first batch of whipped butter, I used a ratio of 17% Cocoa Butter, 53% Shea Butter and a combination of 30% Oils and Rosewater.   I created my recipe on a spread sheet and this ratio gives the whipped butter the consistency of a medium firm whipped butter. The recipe starts with 151 grams (5.3 ounces) and the finished net product yields about 142 grams (5.00 ounces),  the rest is stuck on the measuring spoons and blender rod.  I also keep a plate handy to rest the used spoons and blender rod with the whipped butters that get stuck to.  I don&#x27;t let it go to waste and use it up for my hands.  I whip butters and oils in the storage container.  I use an 8 ounce, wide mouthed mason jar with straight sides and a two part metal lid (ring &amp; cover) for a tight fit. I keep my Shea butter (except the Cocoa butter) and all oils in the refrigerator to keep them from getting rancid.  When ready to make the whipped butter, I&#x27;ll take all ingredients needed out of the refrigerator (usual the night before I plan to make a batch) and let them reach room temperature.  I keep my home at 70°F in the winter and at 74°F in the summer. Being afraid the butters and oils get too hot and therefor ruined, I prefer not heating them in a double boiler. The Shea butter is soft enough to mix with the oils at room temperature, about 70°F. On the morning, about an hour before I start making the whipped butter, I preheat my oven for 30-45 seconds on the lowest temperature (my oven&#x27;s lowest temperature is 170 °F). Turn the oven off after 30-45 minutes before reaching the 100° F. The temperature will still rise after the oven is shut off. Keep the oven&#x27;s light on, it helps to keep the temperature stable.  I prepare the warm oven to soften the Cocoa butter enough to be able to whip together with the oils and rosewater.   Here is my recipe for the Whipped Face &amp; Body Butter. Ingredients: Organic Raw Unrefined Cocoa Butter                       26.00 grams  17.00% Organic Raw Unrefined Shea Butter                          80.00 grams  53.00%  Organic Cold Pressed Jojoba Oil    1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons &#x3D; 25.00 grams         16.67% Organic Cold Pressed Castor Oil                  ½ teaspoon &#x3D;   2.50 grams     1.67% Rosewater                     1 tablespoons &#x3D; 15.00 grams            10.00% Vegetable Glycerine (for very dry skin)             ½ teaspoon &#x3D;  2.50 grams           1.67%  Instructions: To make about 5 ounces of the finished whipped product,  The oven needs to be off and the temperature should be about 100°F. I use a knife to shave off slivers of the room temperature cocoa butter and add 26 grams to an 8 oz, wide mouthed mason jar with straight sides.  Keep the remaining Cocoa butter in a cool place for the next batch of whipped butter.   Cover the jar with the two part metal lid.  Tighten the lid and place in the preheated 100°F oven for about one hour or until the Cocoa butter melted enough to be mixed. After about one hour, take the jar with the cocoa butter out of the warm oven and check if creamy.  I use an extra stainless steel liquid blender rod (have now two rods, one for food and one for body butters) attached to my old 5-speed KitchenAid electric hand mixer.  CAUTION: You must hold on tight to the jar when mixing, it will spin and get away from you if you let go.  Start mixing on low speed and slowly increase speed.  I can go up to speed 5 without problems.  Make sure to turn off the blender before removing the blender rod from the jar.  Mix the Cocoa butter well.  Turn the blender off and remove the rod.  Take a teaspoon and scrape the bottom of the jar to loosen parts of the cocoa butter that might be stuck and mix again. Add 80 grams of the room temperature Shea butter, in small pieces to the jar and mix well.  It is important to get the butters mixed thoroughly. Add the oils and rosewater (a total of about 45 grams or 3 tablespoons) to the jar and mix for five (5) minutes.  Start on low speed and slowly increase . When all is mixed, cover the jar with the two part lid and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to ensure the various fatty acids solidify at the same time.  If making more than one jar keep unused jars in the refrigerator until ready to use.  Keep the jar in use in a cool place and no longer than six weeks.  It is more convenient to use a plastic lid for the jar in use.  General ratio of butter to oils and when using a single butter in a product: 100% Raw Organic Cocoa Butter (ratio 50% to 70% Cocoa butter, 50% to 30% oils).  Even 70% Cocoa butter might make the product too hard.  Using 50% Cocoa butter to 50% oils for a very soft product. 100% Raw Wild Shea Butter (ratio 70% to 80% Shea butter, 20% to 30% oils).  Using 80% Shea butter &amp; 20% oils for a very soft product.</li>
    <li> Regarding Raw Cocoa Butter-Certified Organic (16oz)  from Perfect Body Harmony: I have not any other reference point on using cocoa butter, however, I am completely pleased and impressed with the quality of this product from Perfect Body Harmony. The cocoa butter seems to be fresh and appropriately fragrant--clean too. I am also pleased with the intelligent packaging of this cocoa butter as it is encased in a zip-lock bag which is then placed in an outer light blocking zip-lock pouch. Excellent. Thank you for this pleasant first experience with this type of product and this company!</li>
    <li> Made some homemade body lotion! Loving it!</li>
    <li> I agree with all 5 star reviews. Period. My grown kids were also impressed, so I cut each of them a chunk off it. Great to make your own lotions and smells fabulous on its own.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Great customer service. Great packaging. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the skin. So moisturizing and healing for dry skin! I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this would smell so good. I used 1/4 cup of this and melted it with 1/4 cup each of coconut oil, almond  oil and Shea butter. Once set I used my hand mixer to whip it and added a bit of peppermint essential oil. Most wonderful and indulgent moisturizer I have ever used. Great product!</li>
    <li> Been looking for an all-natural, solid moisturizer to use at home and when traveling. This is the answer to my prayers. I don&#x27;t mix it with anything (call me lazy, it&#x27;s okay) - just cut off a chunk and go to town on my dry skin. Fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product .... will do business again.</li>
    <li> Mmmmm smells so good. Came in excellent condition and is working wonderfully in my recipes. :)</li>
    <li> I had to return it because the smell is overwhelming. I had a recipe that used essential oils along with this, and I cannot smell anything but the chocolate. Grateful I was able to return it!</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is divine! I&#x27;m so impressed with the purity, packaging, &amp; texture. I&#x27;m ordering again and spreading the word!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it a lot(I have to use up what I have) but when I tried it, it smelled wonderful and my skin was super soft .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It leaves the skin soft and smooth, temporarily irons out wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t make your face shiny and it seems to heal surface blemishes very quickly.  I also add a table spoon full to my cereal in the morning, giving my breakfast a hint of a chocolaty taste.  It nurtures the body inside and out.  And, I love the fact that it&#x27;s high in antioxidants.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and was easy to work with. I made lip gloss and body butter and very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Only used a third of it so far and can&#x27;t wait for my next order. From the moment I opened the bag, the aroma was so rich. Using it in beauty products and it makes me feel great to know it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
    <li> First time I have ever ordered raw cocoa butter , but I picked the right company to order it from!  :). They kept me informed by sending emails when to expect my product.  It arrived in a timely manner and I am very pleased with the product.  Will definitely order again!  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect quality, I will order again. Also weighed it, perfect 1lb package.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product. I received it  in good time, and it fully met my expectations!</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  Great customer service as well.  Made wonderful lip balm.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it, won&#x27;t buy any other one from some one else. Used it in my chapsticks.</li>
    <li> I can notice a difference in the taste of this butter versus all other cacao butter I have tried. I use it for making chocolate. It melts easier, is smoother, and smells more fragrant. I bought some from Whole Foods after trying this and the taste difference was night and day. I never realized how brittle and tasteless other brands were until I tried this one.</li>
    <li> easy to use and comes in a sealable bag on the inside for easy storage. I used this to make chocolate bars.</li>
    <li> Works great for homemade lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with my purchase.  The scent is divine. The cocoa butter looks just like what is pictured.  Inside of the gold bag is a clear plastic bag that the cocoa butter is in.  The quality is wonderful.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again! Great in my body butters!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Very well packaged.</li>
    <li> Skin still dry after using this. Doesn&#x27;t deliver like Aveeno</li>
    <li> This Cocoa Butter is awesome to work with! And the results are incredible. I highly recommend this product from this company!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Already made homemade body butter!</li>
    <li> I like it. However I strongly despise the rich chocolate smell. Was very shocked when hit with the aroma after unpacking it. Does is always smell like that? How do I get rid of it? Hope I can since I have some much of it..</li>
    <li> Really nice product just too much of a cocoa scent for me. It&#x27;s really strong</li>
    <li> I used this in some body butter recipes and it&#x27;s great.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use it to make hand cream.</li>
    <li> Awesome body butter ingredient!</li>
    <li> Satisfactory texture, smooth taste, no lumps or inconsistencies. My only qualm is when I apply melted butter to my eyelids it leaves something to be desired. My first package never arrived, however Perfect Body Harmony send me a replacement bar.</li>
    <li> have not used this yet but it sure smells amazing. You can smell the chocolate as soon as you open the package.</li>
    <li> I ordered some organic raw cocoa butter for a blended face cream recipe I discovered. I really like the raw cocoa and it was delivered within just a couple days of ordering. The scent of the cocoa is a bit over-powering so I have only used it at night before bed. It is very nice for this dry weather though.</li>
    <li> I am sooo pleased with this cocoa butter, I smells amazing. I used it to make a body butter and my skin loves it! The shipping was great; it came in a resealable bag which was a plus. The company also sent me a email giving me more information about cocoa butter and how I could use and store it. I will absolutely be buying from this company again!</li>
    <li> I actually just used it yesterday to make lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lovely cocoa butter !!  The smell is so chocolaty you want to eat it.  It melted as it should.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it to be of excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Carole</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I was using coconut oil to moisturize after the shower for about a year now. I loved it, but cocoa butter is SO MUCH BETTER. It smells good and isn&#x27;t oily but leaves the skin extra soft. I use it on my face too and have already noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the best coco butter i have ever purchase it smells sooooooooo good that you want to eat it right out of the bag too bad you can&#x27;t eat it but it smells really like chocolate  it&#x27;s organic and pure remember that the skin is the largest organ of your body so you may want to put  something a 100 percent pure natural things on your body and this product is the best quality you will ever find try it you won&#x27;t regret it .</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. I ordered this to help with help soften the appearance of dark scars on my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days so i do not have results yet. I can say it feels nice on my skin..To use, you will need to shave off what you need to use and warm it with your fingers to apply. I love that it smells wonderful like fine chocolate.</li>
    <li> I got my Cocoa Butter very quickly and was very satisfied with the product.  I have made several jars of Body Butter using this ingredient.  I will order it again for Perfect Harmony.</li>
    <li> I wasted the whole container experimenting with many body butter recipes, and none of them turned out. I was left with a hard substances that smelled like cocoa, and I felt like I was walking around smelling like a chocolate bar. Not for me!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I used it to make a body lotion.  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Good enough to eat. This stuff made some amazing body butter. Love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful! Using this for lotions and lip balm with essential oils and it has a been a huge hit with friends and family! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality coco butter! Smells divine. The shipping was fast as is with prime orders. I used this to make lip balm, deodarant and skin cream. It all came out great and you can pick up the sent in the products dispite using essential oils. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high compared to suppliers (shipping is not included), but it is organic.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I melt it down with coconut oil and whip it up with mixer.  It makes a wonderful body butter without additives and preservatives.</li>
    <li> All I can say is YUMMY! I bought this cocoa butter for making soaps and skin care products, but it smells so good I want to eat it! And the great thing is I can if I want to! Wonderful cocoa butter. I&#x27;ve even taken a chunk of it and am using it at night in its pure form as a night cream. High quality and a pleasure to work with. The seller was a pleasure to work with and provides excellent communication. I will DEFINITELY order from them again as soon as I need more.</li>
    <li> Very high quality as advertised! Perfect to melt and add essential oils to make custom body rubs!</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butter, it&#x27;s great for the skin so I  use it all the time, never bought this this brand until now, and I have to say it smells amazing and my skin loves it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, and Delivery! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on schedule, packaged very well. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I am definitely satisfied with this Cocoa Butter! I mixed this with Coconut Oil and the result is amazing. I use this as my face and body moisturizer. Great as hair conditioner too! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I missed the smell of real cocoa butter. I&#x27;m so glad i got this.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells so good. It makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I dont know if its just cocoa butter in general but it has a VERY strong scent.  I used it in my body butter and even though I used essential oils the smell of the cocoa butter was overpowering.  It doesnt mean its a bad smell but it overpowers any other scents you might add.  I melted it down with other products and when my body butter set there were a lot of little chucks of this stuff that got hard so when i used the body butter it was grainy.  I havent had experience with other cocoa butters so i have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> great product and love the smell</li>
    <li> Best cocoa butter  I&#x27;ve ever use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful chocolate aroma, going to use this for personal health products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells awesome and is very hydrating for the skin.</li>
    <li> This coca butter is wonderful. I love it. It smells so good and it has worked wonders on lighten up my face and my sons skins. I would recommend every one to buy this coca butter from Perfect Body Harmony. It&#x27;s packaged well and looks like the photo.</li>
    <li> VERY DELICIOUS SMELLING AND VERY CREAMY IN BODY BUTTER</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  As soon as I received it in the mail I made a batch of body butter with coconut oil and a small amount of olive oil.  It goes on like whipped butter, melts really nicely and isn&#x27;t super greasy like some other oils.  The smell is so yummy, it&#x27;s hard to not eat it.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells this might be a little harder for you because the smell is VERY strong, unless you&#x27;re an avid chocoholic like myself :) I love that it&#x27;s organic and raw so I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals and extra junk.  My skin has been so smooth and soft, even my husband has noticed!  I will DEF be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> Love the healing of the skin that you receive from this butter. I live in Wisconsin and the winters are cold, my becomes very dry. This product tends to revive my dry skin, and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for a little over a year and I love it. The size is bigger--and less expensive--than what&#x27;s offered at Whole Foods (no surprise there, I guess!). My skin has never felt better, and I need no other moisturizers at all. If I skip a day, my skin is still soft. It feels awesome going on, and it works on every part of the body--from face to feet. When little pieces break off or grow too small to use I save them, then melt them in a double boiler and make new big pieces. The smell is incredible. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but don&#x27;t feel I need to. Would recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> This product definitely lives up to it&#x27;s description. This product arrived packaged great and there is no question if you are receiving what you pay for. When ordering products that claim to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; it is hard to determine most times if this is actually what you are receiving as the product normally arrives in unmarked packaging and does not state anything. This is not the case with this product. The product arrives packages as shown with the words organic and unrefined printed on the packaging and if this is not enough for you the packaging also has batch numbers and product number on each package. Needless to say this product lives up to it&#x27;s description and is Excellent. I would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> This has changed my skin. We use it on our kids too. It smells amazing and works wonders to soften skin. It&#x27;s great on elbows and dry patches to help stop irritation. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter tilts and mixes beautifully with Shea butter and all carrier oils. The strong sweet chocolate smell was so unexpected and it keeps that subtle smell when mixed and whipped into body butters.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream that really works. I am 47 years old and people think I am in my 30s.</li>
    <li> This product has an amazing aroma of dark chocolate and works great in DIY body creams.</li>
    <li> Great quality; ships quickly; very strong chocolate smell</li>
    <li> I have used plenty types and brands of cocoa butters and can say with certainty that this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  It smells absolutely heavenly and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. My skin was getting dry and itchy as I entered my 6th month of pregnancy. I bought this to add to an organic belly butter I&#x27;m making to moisturize and aid in the prevention of stretch marks. I will try to write a post baby review on the results.</li>
    <li> I will never use store brought lotion again!  This has by far been the best moisturizer I have ever used and it takes care of winter dried skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and it is great on my lips too. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product, texture, smell and the packaging is carefully and meticulously done, I will be reordering the product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! !!!!!!! as soon as I opened the bag a wonderful chocolate smell like came out. Really easy to work with since I used it to make a homemade lotion bars. Definitely buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter smells Soooo great!  I melted it down for use in lotions.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I use this one for making a body butter and mix it with other butters like Chea, it really smells good but my main issue is that its hard to brake and melt in order to mix it with the other ingredients.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is very good quality and packaged just the the description says.  It is hard but grates very easily to be melted down to add to soap and other products.  I made a body butter for my sister with cocoa butter as the main ingredient and added  a little shea butter and coconut oil.  It turned out well and she loves it.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love, love the smell - so ready to put this product on my skin! Amazing quality... you will not be disappointed !</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! The package was in good shape. The smell is fantastic!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for to make massage candles.</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate 😊</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Pure stuff needs to be warmed up before use or mixing.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a toxic-free makeup party I had. We used it in making lip balm.Worked great! It has a Wonderful chocolate scent.    [[ASIN:0615611168 A Heavenly Presence: A Story of Healing, Awakening, Angelic Visitation and Spiritual Discovery]]</li>
    <li> So far so good. But it is my 1st time working with a raw (cocoa) butter product.  I use this butter to make DIY body butter. Strong chocolate/cocoa  scent.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough wonderful things about this product. After the first application, my problem dry, cracked and painful skin is healing and feels normal again! The aroma is delightful too. Thanks so much, Amazon, for making this product available.</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter! It smells great and makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely delicious in terms of the aroma. My skin feels smooth and beautiful after use, not greasy. It is a large block of cocoa butter and very much worth the price for the quality and amount you are receiving. I am so glad I decided not to buy another store-bought moisturizer with questionable, potentially health-harming ingredients.  I would also like to compliment Perfect Body Harmony for their kind email letter from the Customer Happiness and Support Team. They really know how to conduct a business and cultivate a harmonious relationship with new customers such as myself. Thank you so much for your lovely product and excellent customer service. This cocoa butter is so much more special than store bought cocoa butter!  Update-Sept. 28, 2015: I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has trouble with dry, brittle, peeling fingernails. I had that problem and tried everything I could think of to improve the condition of my nails, but nothing worked.   Over the course of the past month or so since I purchased this cocoa butter, I noticed, to my amazement, that my nails started growing back again and are now the longest, strongest and healthiest they have been ever since I can remember.  I use the cocoa butter in its pure state, not mixing it with any other product. As I rubbed it into my skin all over my body, I was, unbeknownst to me, healing my fingernails in the process. Now, I make sure to rub the cocoa butter purposefully into my nails, cuticles and hands several times a day, especially after washing my hands. I hope this information helps someone who has issues with their nails. Give this product a try! I hope it works for you like it did for me.  I also stopped using nail polish and remover as I think those products were causing the dryness and peeling. I love my nails just natural now. Thank you Perfect Body Harmony!</li>
    <li> First time buying it. I love it. I use it as a blend for my home made bodycream. my skin feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is great cocoa butter. I love that it is in block form. Bought it for my daughter to help with her eczema. The smell is nice and it is helping to keep her skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I make my own lotion and have been using shea butter. It always seemed to leave gritty beads, but this cocoa butter makes my lotion smooth.....very smooth, no grit at all. I love the smell, it just makes me smile.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter was received quickly as described in one large block as shown and seller followed up with helpful suggestions for use.  It is smooth. silky, moisturizing and has a light chocolate smell. I melted a small portion and combined with organic coconut oil carry it in a small container in my purse for hand cream. Also use it at night on my feet as a moisturizer. Love. love, love this product.</li>
    <li> Love it, Great Quality.....used it for a DIY body lotion I made for gifts and personal use. Looking forward to finding other uses. Perhaps in recipes!</li>
    <li> Love it, great natural smell.</li>
    <li> Arrived on top. Package exactly as shown online. Smells amazing! Used it in my first body butter and my husband said it even smelt great! Will buy again when I need to make more. I weighed it too. Didn&#x27;t get chested!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Shea butter and fell madly in love with it... which brought me back to amazon for another purchase! This Raw Cocoa Butter is amazing! It has been doing wonders for skin! My skin feels so soft and smooth. I am so thankful that I cam across this product! It has a beautiful chocolaty scent! I am pretty sure my mouth watered when I opened up the package! I definitely recommend this product to anyone! You will fall in love with it!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product, the smell is divine!  It is a very good quality product and would recommend to anyone to buy it , you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> beautiful product.  I am using it in deodorant.  The deodorant turned out great.  I did use quite a bit of essential oil to mask the cocoa smell but the butter is so creamy.  I am anxious to use it in my next batch of lip balm.</li>
    <li> Great stuff better than anything store bought</li>
    <li> Excellent Excellent Excellent! It is a must use for my skin especially after my Lemon juice and baking soda facials! It&#x27;s also extremely affordable, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. I have not used it yet but I really like the UV bag it is stored in and it does have a real organic smell. Plan to put this to use very soon.</li>
    <li> I feel bad writing my first bad review and being the only one for this product. This cocoa butter STINKS smells nothing like cocoa, I received it all mushy and soft (some of it even leaked out of the clear plastic ziploc bag) AND found a hair in it!! Sorry would look for something else</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and it smells divine!</li>
    <li> Just opened it today-smells wonderful. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. So far I&#x27;ve made two batches with the cocoa butter as one of the ingredients for body cream. Love the fragrance and feel!</li>
    <li> This smelled so good. Great quality, packaging, and came fairly quick!  I made my own body butter using the cocoa along with the shea butter.  I added peppermint essential oil to my concoction and it was great.  I called it mint chocolate!!  Will order again!</li>
    <li> This was one of the ONLY brands to get great reviews, it was a little more but so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;So happy and I cannot wait to use it for my homemade body butter with my Young Living Essential Oils!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great to rub on rough skin or cracks on dry skin on hands.</li>
    <li> Bought this as well as the shea butter from the aame company.&lt;br /&gt;It. Smells. Amazing. I use both for lotion bars and other diy skin care products. Great qualiity and melts so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service as well! (:</li>
    <li> Grate it before eating it. Works well in smoothies or as white chocolate flakes on yogurt sundaes. When I need another batch of body lotion I will melt and mix it with shea butter, coconut oil and beeswax.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying Cocoa Butter, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but it came exactly as pictured and described.  I used it, along with the Shea Butter to make some homemade body butter and I love it!  The cocoa smell doesn&#x27;t last very long and it has done wonders for my very dry skin.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Really great quality! Huge block!</li>
    <li> Very good Cocoa butter, just a little on the hard side.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter exceeds my expectations. It smells so wonderful, like chocolate, and you can just tell it is natural and pure. I&#x27;ve been really getting into natural beauty products lately and I must say that using this as lotion is 10x better than any cocoa butter lotion you buy in stores, because this is pure cocoa butter and the other lotions have so many fillers..yuck.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was wondering now how on earth do I get this to absorb into my skin. I&#x27;ve found that since it is summer now I can just rub it in my hands and then rub it on my body, but if I&#x27;m in more of a hurry I put a chunk of the cocoa butter in my hands with a little bit of my favorite oil (sunflower or grapeseed) and use that to get it to liquify and absorb quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really love this stuff. Will be using it on my stretch marks from pregnancy, as a lotion after showers (especially on my legs after shaving), and as a general lotion for all over. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses but these are what I&#x27;m liking so far.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very creamy and smooth, and smells absolutely delicious! I use this as moisturizer for face and body. I slice off a piece that is about the size of a bar of soap and simply rub it on my skin. It is the best moisturizer -- I was paying $60 an ounce for face creams, but this is so much better!</li>
    <li> Smells and tastes awesome! I am glad i have purchased it. Used it to make an spf moisturizer. It smells so good it feels like I am putting chocolate on my face, yum :)</li>
    <li> smells divine! excellent for use in cremes.</li>
    <li> So amazing! Smells like Chocolate. We&#x27;re using it on my son and just completely blown away by how effective it has been.</li>
    <li> I am ready to use it and I have prepared shavings but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Great product, and I really enjoy it is all organic. I heat it up over hot water and have an easier time putting it on my body. Great great natural product.</li>
    <li> I combine cocoa butter, shea butter, red palm oil and beeswax (in a double boiler) to make my own dry skin moisturizer.  It is the only cream I use anymore.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described.  I use it to make my body butter, it smells like rich cocoa and feels silky on your skin, leaving your skin moisturized and glowing.  Great Seller, great product!</li>
    <li> Even when statements for this product has not been approved by the FDA, the product works as presented by the producer.  I apply the product directly over my skin, including face, arms and hands and I have notice my skin more hydrated, softer and my age spots color in my hands are diminishing.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and  just as described and shown in the picture. Right away I noticed the strong chocolate scent. Heavenly but it is strong. I had it out for a few days and pinched of pieces to use as a body moisturizer, but I&#x27;m now storing it in my refrigerator until I&#x27;m ready to make homemade body butters and scrubs. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter,  it smells really good and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Will definitely order again!!!</li>
    <li> Best cocoa butter ever!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was as specified.  Smells wonderful, just like chocolate!  I used this for my homemade lotion bars.</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter. It arrived perfectly packed, and upon opening the smell of cocoa came wafting out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to make body butter, and it works really well. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells like chocolate straight from the packaging. Very moisturizing, I made a body butter out of it. The amount that you get will last you for a long time!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to like a body butter as well as my beloved Shea butter but I do! This cocoa butter is heavenly. I apply it to my warm skin straight from the shower or bath after drying off. It melts beautifully, not greasy at all, very nice for applying makeup immediately. I can even lightly smell the wonderful cocoa on my skin hours later. The hardest part is not taking a bite out of the bar! I really love it, will definitely by this one again.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product and the follow up information and emails from Perfect Body Harmony regarding how to effectively use the cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from a friend, and was so excited to use it in body care products I make. When it arrived, I opened it, and it was a total mess. The inner bag was busted and the butter was all over the place. It got everywhere. It smells delicious, and looks like great cocoa butter, but sadly I will have to use it up quickly (and on my family, rather than in product) as I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Well, I searched high and low for the best quality and deal. This was a success. It was prime, so it got here quick. I was excited to open it because, I had read reviews where the product claimed provide a high quality item just to dupe you with something quite different. Well, look no further people, at the risk of sounding like a paid reviewer, I&#x27;m gonna go crazy here.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the exterior bag, I was hit by the smell of chocolate before even opening the inside bag. I opened the ziplock inner bag and  was pleasantly hit by even more divine smell. If I was blind, I would think I had a giant bar of chocalate in my hand. So I took it out and just  had to taste it immediately.  I got my mini shredder out and shredded about a teaspoon or so, grabbed up the pile, put it in my mouth and that&#x27;s all she wrote. I&#x27;m an instant fan. I can wait to use this to make decadent homemade chocolate. Get some now, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> love the product from the first try. I use it after shower and it works for my skin just right. Smell is good too. I would recommend it to people who is looking for organic :back to nature: products.</li>
    <li> I received my order within 5, I think it was in 3 days but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  The product is as advertised!  The quality is fantastic!  I will be ordering from Perfect Body Harmony again.  I also order the Shea Butter from them,  quality of the butter was great also.  Highly recommend!  The amount of product you get for the price is great!  The product smells wonderful and I have to admit that I tasted it and the taste was great too!  The price for raw cocoa butter in my local store is astronomical and the quality is poor.</li>
    <li> This smells AWESOME. And it leaves your skin silky. I made body butter with this, and Shea Butter , both from the same seller.  It&#x27;s solid but it wasn&#x27;t hard to break apart. This is so worth the price.</li>
    <li> Lovely ingredient for my homemade lotions and creams!</li>
    <li> smells great and makes delicious chocolate!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Excellent delivery time</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely. Melts nicely (with coconut oil) to make a lovely moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product to as one of the ingredients for whipped body butter that I make.  While I have not actually used it yet, the product looks as described and smells heavenly.  Packaging is excellent, zip locked, for storing when leftovers occur.  Other than that without having used it yet, I am in hopes that the product will measure up to the high rating, as posted from others.</li>
    <li> good quality, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> This bar of Cocoa Butter is Awesome! It is as big as a brick, arrived in one piece and will last a very long time. The smell is a wonderful aroma of Chocolate and it melts on contact with your skin. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with product and would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Truly organic cocoa butter. It keeps my skin moisturized and it smells like chocolate. The vendor has been great and truly cares that you are 100% satisfied with their product.</li>
    <li> When this stuff arrived and I opened the package, OH MY GOODNESS, it smells so good! I use this in my homemade sunscreen and it makes it smell like you are slathering yourself in whipped chocolate. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with your product, was interested in knowing if you had any type of recipes books would love to purchase or download more</li>
    <li> This is excellent cocoa butter. Very large quantity for the price. I shared 1/2 of it. They like it as well. Not able to find in stores locally. Glad to find it from you. Glad to know you have it available. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Like others have stated, the scent is that of *very strong* chocolate.</li>
    <li> When you get to be a certain age, it&#x27;s very hard to keep your skin moist all day.  Especially the legs .  This product really helps to moisturize and stop the hurt of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Nice rich ccoa smell. Company sent follow up instructions on how to use.</li>
    <li> Is a great product but is too hard. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I use it to make my own body butter.</li>
    <li> loved this thank you will order again soon</li>
    <li> I have bought this cocoa butter before and really love it. I own my own business and was looking for a organic cocoa butter for some of my products My husband and I use it in many different recipes from lip balm, soap, deodorant, and even a few baking recipes. So YUMMY! thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used my recent order of organic cocoa butter but the product looks stellar.</li>
    <li> Packed with great care. Received as described</li>
    <li> I use cocoa butter in homemade cosmetics and bath and body products a lot, and this is definitely one of the very best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s extremely high quality, the butter has a beautiful rich fragrance, and it blends perfectly. It smells so wonderful I melt it into a twist up tube to use it directly as a moisturizer! Wonderful product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter smells heavenly. I have used it in some natural lotion bar recipes and also just by itself. it melts easily in your hand and you can rub a small bar over your skin. The whole family is hooked. I would say the 1 lb size will last our family 3 months, but we seem to be using it quickly because we love it soooooo much!</li>
    <li> I love the smell!!!!  During the winter months I have very dry skin (winter itch) I add this to my bath or right after showering and problem solved. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> This butter smells ABSOLUTELY unbelievable! Smells soooo Yummy!!!! Love it! Love from first sight :) Well, I have not used it yet, its very well packed, the chunk of butter is well protected inside another plastic zipper bag. So far I love it.</li>
    <li> An extremely wonderful product,  I have used it everyday since it arrived. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful coco butter. Very easy to apply.  Love the smell. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice Cocoa Butter.  I just made my first batch of body butter and I very happy with the results.  Although I didn&#x27;t know it would have such a strong cocoa (chocolatey) scent so I&#x27;ll be experimenting with different essential oils in future body butters, soaps etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the block of butter came in its own separate ziplock bag inside of the UV resistant ziplock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: The Perfect Body Harmony Store&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely LOVING this Cocoa Butter.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it when I received it, and when I did - WOW!  The aroma is so good, it makes you want to take a bite of it!  I decided that I would use this product &amp;#34;as is,&amp;#34; not mixing it with anything else.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and all I do is rub my fingers across it and apply.  It melts just the right amount with your body temp., so you&#x27;re not getting a huge amount all over the place.  It smells wonderful and is so gentle on your skin.  I&#x27;m so impressed with this Cocoa Butter that I will more than likely order some of the Shea Butter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the Seller - This Seller, Perfect Body Harmony, is very attentive and WANTS you to love their products.  The packaging and product looks just as shown and shipping was quick.  You will not be disappointed with Perfect Body Harmony OR this product.  Now, go!  Hurry up and order some!</li>
    <li> I like each one that I bought from you. They are perfect. I shoes them it just because there rate. I thought they will be not that good, but when I use them , thy are amazing . And they came in the time as amazon tell me. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this cocoa butter. It smells exactly like chocolate. Good quality too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this cocoa butter.  I had purchased another in the past that was so hard it took forever to get out the jar.  This is just right and smells wonderful.  It comes packaged very well wrapped inside the aluminum package.  It melted beautifully for my home body butter recipe.  There are cheaper ones but I chose this one because I don&#x27;t believe in skimping on quality just to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> The first night I used it in the shower with my soap I Felt Great.. Even the next day my skin was not dry...</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  It smells sooo yummy.  Package came very quickly and just as described.  I can&#x27;t wait to make body butter out of it!</li>
    <li> OMG, this cocoa butter is amazing and I&#x27;m only on day one with it. I love the way it smells and feels. I broke some off and melted it down with some pure shea butter... my skin is glowing and I smell good enough to eat. I used the product fresh out of the shower last night and when I woke up my skin felt amazing.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as promised. Wonderful aroma, and easy to apply; I just break off a piece and rub it on my skin, body heat melts it. If I&#x27;m in a hurry I melt a bit in the microwave. I love it is JUST cocoa butter with no preservatives or color added. Great product and I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, the aroma invite you to eat it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Can&#x27;t wait to start making stuff</li>
    <li> I got this for my belly during pregnancy. I&#x27;m so glad I read all the reviews. They have been so helpful in knowing how to use this product. I knew what to expect when I got it and tips on how to use it. I love this product so so so much. Just this one bar has lasted me through my whole pregnancy. Saved me a lot of money. Especially for the quality! What worked best for me is using it after the shower by placing the whole bar directly on my skin. Then as the bar got smaller and hard to hold I broke pieces off and put it in a pot just until it melted and mixed in a little bit of coconut oil in and put the mixture into mason jar. It doesn&#x27;t get hard after that. Thank you everyone for the great tips!!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product which I do love.  I would have given it a five star rating, but this time, unlike the 1st time ordered, I received broken pieces included in the packet.  My reason for ordering this product is because it comes in one piece form, as advertised and shown.  I have trouble working w/ the broken pieces, as they are also messy and sometimes continue to fall apart when trying to use them.  I hope that when I order this product again, I don&#x27;t have small pieces included in the packet.  Overall I do love the product, minus the broken pieces.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! - Purchased as an ingredient to add to my homemade lotions bars.&lt;br /&gt;This Cocoa Butter has turned out to be the star of the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; and not simply an ingredient!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About to order more!! A++ all the way</li>
    <li> Fast delivery products as descdescribed</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate heaven! This product is perfect for homemade beauty crafts. It arrived 3 days ago and I&#x27;ve already made deodorant and lip balm. I love that it&#x27;s organic. The packaging isn&#x27;t fancy but it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> Smells Amazing! Nice when softened but no matter what I mixed it with while warm...coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, essential oils or all of them at once, it was a solid hardened lump once cooled. I was unprepared for this and am quite partial to the familiar textures of shea/mango butters. I eventually just put the sealed container in the bath with me so it was melted by the end!</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it every day and will definitely be buying more. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this raw, organic cocoa butter for use in a body butter recipe I wanted to try. The final butter had a chocolate scent that was amazing. The cocoa butter melted beautifully and the texture is very smooth and creamy. I would definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing it again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Great !!! Smells amazing</li>
    <li> Explain as description very good</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing cocoa butter so it&#x27;s hard for me to give a lot of input. It smelled wonderful and I&#x27;ve used it in combination with Shea to makie products for myself. I have also used it alone as a lip moisturizer and skin Moisturizer. The smell is very wonderful, it&#x27;s just overbearing if you want a particular scent besides Coco (for example adding essential oils unlessit&#x27;s like vanilla)  this is not thing to use.</li>
    <li> I use it to make lotion. I love the scent. great customer service</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Has a delightful chocolate smell which make my lotion smell almost edible!</li>
    <li> I love everything about it good product,  packaging, shipping. They made a good job!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade lotion and belly butter.</li>
    <li> Nothing original in my review vs other buyers...... as many have already mentioned, this stuff is GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT (but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend actually doing it!)....  The smell is DELICIOUS!  Packaging is excellent, this seller has not skimped on making sure their product arrives in perfect condition and remains that way. Very impressed.  The product itself looks and feels very fresh, no question at all about this being very high end quality.  My intent is to use as a body/facial moisturizer only and for this purpose so far it gets 10 out of 10, my skin feels and smells fab, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hands.. Lol. This came in a bar and I sliced a few pieces which whilst initially very firm quickly melted in my hands. My new daily treat.... I must also add that I have had follow up emails from the seller with tips on how and what to use the butter for.... Very impressed so I am off to see what else this seller has on offer!  UPDATE- the best way to apply this I have found is to simply slide the whole bar over the body, and for the face/neck swipe across palms and apply.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t share with anyone else..! This is now the ONLY thing I use to moisturize body/face these days, simply love it. Use it to also remove eye makeup!!</li>
    <li> Heavy chocolate smell but works well and serves its purpose. Made some body butter with it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s smells so good it stinks. I would buy it again  and again !  I have given a sample to my family and friends  because  I was so impressed. Now I have to figure out what I&#x27;d like to make with it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and it smells like the best chocolate I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and looked exactly as photographed and described. Used this product to make body butter. Love the smell (sweet/chocolate) and the way it feels when it is going on my skin. Lasts all day, even after extreme hand washing (I work in a hospital).</li>
    <li> Beautiful! The smell is enchanting, love to whip it up with shea butter!</li>
    <li> love it would buy again.</li>
    <li> Chocolate has always been my passion  ... and now I can breath in that wonderful aroma anytime with this cocoa butter. It melts deep into the skin.  It came fresh and organic, and can be used by itself, or it mixes well with other oils to make a healthy creamy body butter that smells like heaven.&lt;br /&gt;Yes ... I am in love!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. It smells good, and it also a good moisturizer for my body and hair. I  gave a jar of it to my friend, and she loves. Definitely will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality...best I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
    <li> Made homemade soap. Waiting for them to cure but smell divine.</li>
    <li> I really like this cocoa butter and will purchase it again</li>
    <li> Has a very pleasant smell very moisturing and arrived on time ,fast delivery .</li>
    <li> quick shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cocoa butter.  I used it in combination with coconut oil and Shea butter to make homemade lotions/body butters.  The cocoa butter mixed well with the other products I used and was especially nice to use whipped.  I like that it comes in a re-seal-able bag that I can store it in.  Although the block was hard, shaving off the amount I needed was easy and relatively mess free; it was also easier to melt shavings than huge chunks.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The packaging was great the producr is fresh and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I&#x27;m using it on my body and loving how soft my body feels. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Ordered to make lotion bars and it smelled so good that my daughter took a chunk to use before I could even start.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Used this to make bath melts. It&#x27;s amazing! My skin feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! Great for body butters. Smells great!</li>
    <li> loved it thanks.GREAT EXCELLENT PRODUCT, MORE THAN HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Great product as well as easy to use packaging!</li>
    <li> Love this butter, I use it in body creams it&#x27;s amazing, great product! I read the other reviews and purchased it I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Hard, crumbly, and melts in your hands. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and my skin has been much clearer with this product. The cocoa butter smells great!</li>
    <li> Nice Raw cocoa butter</li>
    <li> This has a super strong odor to it so if you are using this to make a lotion which is what I was doing do not use it all or leave it out if the smell of coco bothers you because it made my lotion so potent I could barely use it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  The smell from the raw cocoa butter hits you immediately. It smells so good. It come in a rectancular block.  It looks exactly as you see it in  the picture.  I made a whipped body butter and normally, I use essential oils for a nice scent not with this product.  The scent alone is captivativating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with the aroma and the quality of how it moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own chocolate and it is yummy!!!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as shown in picture. Will be in a block, will have to shave to use. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal... great price for a superior product. Made my body butter luxurious!</li>
    <li> Much more arrived than I expected and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love using this plain, or added to my homemade lotion. It&#x27;s so moisturizing, has a great smell, and has lasted a long time. When I run out, I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Used for making chocolate and was pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price and quality product. Will definitely order from again,</li>
    <li> Smells great however my skin remains dry and flaky after application.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any moisturizing effect at all on my skin.</li>
