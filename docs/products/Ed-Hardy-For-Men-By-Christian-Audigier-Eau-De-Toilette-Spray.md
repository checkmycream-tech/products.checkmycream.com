<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son in-law loves it</li>
    <li> Incredible smell for the price, great longevity. I would and will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> For son-in-law.  He said he liked it just fine.</li>
    <li> The perfume is good, but a little too sweet for my taste. Bought this after I&#x27;ve seen it in an ad in the Maxim magazine, will pb give it away as a gift.     :)</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite. It has a nice semi-formal spice to it with just the right amount of sweetness for my tastes. Perfect for the office, weekends, or even evening wear. I would say it&#x27;s geared more toward a mature college crowd to middle aged men. Definitely one for the collection. I currently have Lacoste Essential, Tommy Bahama(Signature, Very Cool and Set Sail South Seas), Burberry, Weekend by Burberry, and Burberry Brit. I also have Armani Code and Aqua Di Gio but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as a Christmas present.  He asked for it, I had never heard of it before this year.  He loved it and it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband for Christmas and upon opening the canister found that there was some greasy substance (maybe cologne had leaked out) that covered the glass.  The spray smelled off and rubbery when sprayed and was nothing like a sample we had brought home from another company.  Overall, I thought the smell was terrible and we were very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the cologne! We were impressed how quickly we receives it.</li>
    <li> Nice and a little musky</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the cost and how quick I received my purchase.  My son was so excited when he received this for a stocking gift.  I did good!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my stepson for Christmas.  It smells great!!!  It&#x27;s as good as any Mens Cologne at twice the price.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my boyfriend because its way cheaper than if i would have bought it at a dept. store. the wait is well worth the price. it came in well packaged (in orininal box). looked new. there was something floating in the perfume like little bits of dust. it might have been just that one bottle- who knows. when i gave the bottle to the expert he said that it smell exactly like what he has been wearing. other than that minor defect it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as Christmas gift for someone who likes Ed Hardy colognes. I can&#x27;t say if its good or not because I did not open cologne to smell it. Arrived in tidy fashion. Happy w purchase.</li>
    <li> I love cologne is a different smell to it  that&#x27;s what I like about iT I recommend to clone to anyone everybody</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2 bottles from this seller now and both bottles arrived in great shape no problems at all. Shipping was super fast. Very satisfied and will buy from this seller again and again</li>
    <li> WOW GET COMPLEMENTS FROM MEN AND LADDIES!!!</li>
    <li> This like my favorite ed hardy spray it just smell so good for all the ladies around me oh yeah I would totally buy some more of this awesome smell good spray all day baby.</li>
    <li> Poor projection, low silage and sad longevity try ed&#x27;s born wild instead of this scent and u will be happier</li>
    <li> This is the best smell i have bought... I love this spray. I did have one bottle spray stop working after 1/3 of it being used..  it wasted 2/3 of a bottle.. the spray attachment stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the only spray i can take- i get head aches form the other...&lt;br /&gt;I know it is a good scent b/c many ppl ( ladies ) say &amp;#34; i love that smell&#x27; or &amp;#34;what is that?  I want to get it for my boyfriend.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I know it is good..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big cologne user and when I tried this cologne I was very surprized by the fragrance.  It&#x27;s not to strong, but is strong enough for women to say they enjoy the scent.  That&#x27;s really all that matters, isn&#x27;t it.  I recommend it for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Would by it again and recommend it to all others who are looking for a grt product at a very good price</li>
    <li> If I had known that the package would be huge, I would have reconsidered to order the 1.0 oz spray.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the scent of the cologne, when I wear it!!</li>
    <li> Well I have a Bottle of this that I bought a while ago from a retail store, I had enough left to test both, the retail one I bought sprays different and lasts all day. This one from Amazon sprays almost as if it is watered down and doesn&#x27;t mist as much. It does not last long at all maybe 10 minutes. Amazon needs to step up and sell real cologne not this fake garbage.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore so wont to many people have this on. That&#x27;s to bad for them because I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> A renter vacationing in an apartment in the condominium where I live in the Dominican Republic gave the administrator (a woman) what was left in the bottle when he departed.  She liked the smell and started wearing it when she and the family went out, getting many compliments.  Her husband and children liked the smell, too.  Especially the children who were always urging her to wear it. She looked but couldn&#x27;t find it here so asked me to see I could order it from Amazon.  That is when she found out it is advertised as being for men; there was nothing on the bottle that indicated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took her 2 weeks to adjust, but went ahead with the order in the end.  The compliments she was getting and the obvious liking of the smell by her children were the deciding factors.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and always get complements on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> I have used several colognes in the past, but I got more complements BY FAR wearing the Ed Hardy (original).  All the EH variations are good, but the original seems to get the best response. It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy has good and woodsy smell and I enjoy it very much.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy is my all time favorite cologne.  I always get compliments on this cologne.  Great for anytime wear.  You can go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great smelling.The first scent by them and one of the best. And at a great price. This is my 5th bottle.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised .. no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Although the spray bottle is a little on the puny side, the scent definitely is NOT. Rich, spicy, the scent lasts a long time and walks into the room before YOU do.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected and got it prompt.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne from Ed Hardy for Men.  It has a pleasant, not over powering smell.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase, there was a problem with the first order as it was the wrong item, however the seller was extremely helpful when I emailed with the issue, and were quick to get back to me and send the correct item. Perfume was an excellent gift at a great price and love the fact it&#x27;s a good large size so will last longer. Would purchase again :) x</li>
    <li> Great, clean, light, fresh cologne! It&#x27;s not too strong. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Does not smell the same as the bottle that has Christian Audiger wrote on it fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long either</li>
    <li> Great Price, great product, quick delivery !!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and nice size bottle, I love fragrancenet.com! :)</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was taking a gamble because I never ordered cologne online. Heard there is a lot of fakes. I have bought this in store a couple times so i know what it smells like. Great deal and NOT a rip off product. Original at a low price, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great price and smells good. My gf loves it.</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> My son loves it!! It&#x27;s the second time I bought it and I always order two!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. As described.</li>
    <li> I think the Ed Hardy line of clothing is for Hollywood douche&#x27;s so I never even bothered smelling his cologne line. I was bored waiting for my girlfriend at a department store and happened to come across this cologne. Rolling my eyes upon seeing it, I decided to at least smell it so I could hate it. Damn if it didn&#x27;t surprise me. It actually smelled really good. It works as both a day and night cologne. Perfect blend of spice/musk and clean/fresh. My girlfriend has compared it to the Polo line of colognes. I have to admit I was a little embarrassed taking it to the registers to pay for it. The cute checkout girl saw it and said it was one of her favorite scents for guys. That helped me feel a little better about my purchase. I have since received many compliments on the cologne from co-workers and random women. If you were like me and hesitant to even smell it, give it a go. You might find it better than you thought. I haven&#x27;t had issues with it not lasting long. I think those other people were sold Tester bottles maybe? If it sits sideways too long, it does tend to leak a little though.</li>
    <li> g r e a t p e r f u m g o o d s m e l l love it</li>
    <li> Love this edition of Ed Hardy for men. Sweet scent the ladies like. My son got me a set 2 Christmases ago and I was hooked. Macy&#x27;s did not have this brand, they have other Ed Hardys but not the tiger. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift.</li>
    <li> smells awesome. great product. fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and so do I. It arrived fast and is a good value. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> smells very good very sttracted item an will buy more of edhardy cologne it very light not to strong an you will get attention wearing it.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s fragrance continues to get me compliments wherever I go, from women of all ages from 21 to 65!!!  From my wife&#x27;s friends to my moms friends!  It&#x27;s an absolute stellar purchase and a most reasonable price!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loved the smell and the price was much cheaper than the stores here plus I couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted at the local stores we have near us.  The selection on this site was much larger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years! Started using it when it was about $70.00 I believe! Amazon still has the cheapest price around!</li>
    <li> Love the price!  Love the fragrance, Thank you!  I&#x27;m so happy, it doesn&#x27;t cost seventy dollars just $24.05  really really amazing</li>
    <li> its good for price....I like ed hardy colognes.. but it doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
    <li> This ed hardy does not last long on the skin or your clothes very very disappointed...  but does not last like does not last like it</li>
    <li> Great smell, one of my husbands favorite colognes. Sweet scent and not too strong that it is overbearing. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> this item is not carried in my local stores, and couldn&#x27;t believe the price on here. this is a true deal on this stuff</li>
    <li> This was a very very good price for such a large bottle of cologn. I really like it and is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I had been looking every where for this for a friend of mine and finally found it at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped to me in about 4 days and came in a double packed box, I love that it came shipped like that.</li>
    <li> of the 3 ed hardy line of fragrances that I purchased (villain and hearts &amp; daggers) this particular fragrance is my 2nd favourite. Love the designs of all the bottles.. and this fragrance is very distinguishable. It has an air of class and mystery. would recommend this to everyone, especially at such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> This cologne smells really good, and is a spicy, woodsy version of the women&#x27;s version. There&#x27;s a hint of sweetness, like the women&#x27;s EDT.  It&#x27;s perfect for men. Ladies, if you like Ed Hardy for Women, try this: spray on some Ed Hardy for Men, and add a layer of Ed Hardy for Women.  They compliment each other perfectly, and you get a more adult version of Ed Hardy for Women.</li>
    <li> The item  arrived in about 2 weeks.  It smells just like the small sample I was given at Macy&#x27;s.  The wait was well worth it, given the money I saved!!!</li>

    <li> Bought this as a gift for my man, he loves and I love it as well. Such a stud muffin scent and the bottle is huge.</li>
