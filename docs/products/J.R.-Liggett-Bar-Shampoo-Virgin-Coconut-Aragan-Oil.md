<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Although I just started using it, I like it. And it takes a surprisingly small amount on each use, so I expect the bar to last.</li>
    <li> Have used my shampoo bar only twice, but already see a difference in the condition of my hair!  It has a healthier texture, and does not need to be washed as often.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved it, I am going to buy more soon. I use it for my beard and it works great!</li>
    <li> Tried this one but don&#x27;t like it at all. Later wash my hair is so dry. Have to wash with my shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I wished it was a little better smelling, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and cleans my hair. I also wish they didn&#x27;t put a giant expiration sticker over the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!! I can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower so I can use my new favorite. It leaves my hair soft and my scalp feeling great.</li>
    <li> the first time i used it i hated it! my hair was sooo dirty feeling afterwards! but i stuck with it &amp; after a week i liked it.</li>
    <li> Yup Great Stuff Ive been using this shampoo for years</li>
    <li> I have tried one other shampoo bar from a well-known that foamed up very well, smelled great and worked fabulously on my hair.  This one matched it perfectly at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I like this! Lathers well and will be great to use outdoors because it has no sulfates or chemicals!</li>
    <li> Never buying bottle shampoo ever again. Smells great, lathers wonderfully and leaves my hair shiny and clean. There is a sort of &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; feeling when washing and I was worried all the oils were being stripped from my hair. Not so. Just clean-ness!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost perfect. This is my second J.R. LIGGET&#x27;S shampoo bar. I actually really like these, and I&#x27;ve had problem hair/scalp for my entire life. My first was the tea tree oil shampoo bar and, while it made my curly/frizzy/thick/course hair awesome, it didn&#x27;t do quite the job I wanted it to with my dandruff. I&#x27;d later read that coconut oil can help with that problem too, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order this bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers much more easily than the other bar, it does a better job with the dandruff than the other bar, and it makes my hair feel SO soft. SO soft. However, I can&#x27;t give it a perfect score because, while my hair is soft, it doesn&#x27;t help with shape at all. Like...my curls don&#x27;t have as much shape with this bar. The one thing the other bar shined at is the one flaw with this one. It&#x27;s kinda sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be awesome for everyone else! Try it! It&#x27;s a great shampoo bar and I&#x27;m happy to order these products from this line again. I guess I just have to try more of these to find the perfect one.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! No waxy build up!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Product was exactly as described. I love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I will buy this forever for my natural AA tresses :) 4A.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Just seemed to weigh it down. Ended up just using it as shower soap. Worked great for that purpose. It disappears rather quickly. I expected a lot more from it because of the price and all the great reviews. For me it was just sort of a waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My family uses this shampoo bar and it&#x27;s wonderful! My boy&#x27;s love it because it is quick and easy and leaves their hair so soft. We suffer from skin allergies and I love how they only use pure ingredients. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but it seems a bit harsher than I thought. Use a little bit and only leave in your hair for a few seconds then rinse is the best course of action for use as far as I can see.Very light scent.....doesn&#x27;t stay. I would try a different one though.....</li>
    <li> It did not get my hair very clean. Maybe it only works on certain types of hair. My hair is very fine. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a while. I tried it for a month and could not deal with the unclean look.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo.  Fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever dyed your hair, or you use henna, don&#x27;t buy this product. It leaves this weird residue that makes your hair a lint trap. I heard that it&#x27;s your hair detoxing itself, and after a couple weeks it&#x27;ll be normal, but I stuck it out with this shampoo for a couple months &amp; it just never made my hair feel nice at all.</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes my skin soft and the ingredients are natural.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter with special needs.  She has issues with the texture of slimy shampoo running down her face when she tries to wash her hair (she is 15) and would prefer never to wash it if she could get away with it.  We usually have to help her - even at her age.  I ordered this because it occurred to me that she would prefer something that was not gooey if that makes sense. She also has professionally colored hair (it is a black/purple - that is what she wanted :), and I want her to be happy), so I wanted something without sulfates. That is a lot of specific things I was looking for and did not expect to find it - until this bar shampoo.  It lathered with no issue, was not gooey or slimy, and was extremely easy for her to manage.  Fortunately most people will not have the need that we did, but I have to say - Thanks. What a great shampoo for her.  I also think it will be great for travel in a soap dish.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about liquid, and most hotels simply do not stock sulfate free shampoo (for someone like my wife who also has colored hair and needs sulfate-free shampoo).  For many reasons, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works just like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I used this product around 7 times before I reviewed it. Initially it worked great. It made my hair feel weird at first but it certainly wasn&#x27;t oily. After first using it my hair looked and felt great. However, it didn&#x27;t stay that way. I learned that the more you use it and in frequency makes hair a lot more greasy. I shower once every 1-2 days, but that changes when I exercise. After a few days of showering after running my hair was greasy and hard to comb through. However I really like the idea of not wasting plastic, and the simple ingredients. It only works for me if I use it everyother time with some other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just finished a bar and thought I&#x27;d write a review. I didn&#x27;t experience any waxy build up on my hair strands, and didn&#x27;t use ACV. What I did experience was ongoing scalp issues (not dandruff but some other contact dermatitis). My hair was soft and beautiful and I got lots of compliments but my scalp is a mess. I&#x27;m generally super sensitive skin-wise so I&#x27;m switching to the tea tree and hemp bar and that seems like it will be a better fit. A+ on lather and cleaning power.</li>
    <li> I am always pleased with&lt;br /&gt;JR Ligget shampoo bars. Safe, non toxic, a great alternative to the chemical shampoos out there. Safe for kids too!</li>
    <li> Yoy definitely  get a squeaky clean  finish using this  bar</li>
    <li> I have natural kinky/curly textured hair and worried that this shampoo would be too drying. Much to my surprise, despite the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling it leaves, it&#x27;s not at all drying AND has &#x27;slip&#x27;. Other shampoos tangle my hair while I lather, but this one seems to make detangling much easier. Plus, whatever conditioner I use after seems to work better. This shampoo combined with my normal conditioner makes my hair feel light, look smoother, and more defined. I&#x27;ll definitely keep this shampoo in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-leaves hair clean and moisturized; lathers nicely and removes buildup effectively.&lt;br /&gt;-subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;-it lasts. a few swipes is all it takes to produce a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;-economical packaging; one less bottle to clutter bathroom or leak in luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the worst sting I&#x27;ve ever experienced when a minuscule bubble got into my eye.&lt;br /&gt;-I wish it came in a 2-pack. The bars are not large.</li>
    <li> J R Liggett&#x27;s Bar Shampoos are fantastic!  My dry and brittle hair has been revived.  All, without harsh chemicals.  These shampoos are perfect for those suffering with Alpha-Gal (the lone star tick bite allergy to all things mammals.)  My hair only has to be washed every 2-3 days.  It is soft and clean.  There is lots of body, where it was just lifeless with the shampoos in a bottle.  I highly recommend these JR Liggett Bar Shampoos.  There is a good variety of choices.  All, do to personal taste, really good stuff. (Maynard!)</li>
    <li> I just had to say that I have used solid shampoos before, so I know what to expect. BUT, when this arrived I was shocked at the size!!!!! I should have payed closer attention because it says it&#x27;s 3.5oz. But darn! This thing is smaller than a chocolate bar. And the pics make it look like a regular size bar. It was $6.04 for the shampoo and $5.48 for shipping! It isn&#x27;t worth the hassle to send it back. But I was sorely disappointed with what I got. I just hope it works well for the 2 shampoos I will probably get out of it:(</li>
    <li> we really like this shampoo. both my husband &amp; i use it. our scalps are not itchy anymore &amp; like the way my hair feels.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo today, and I am not disappointed.  It lathered very well and rinsed out well.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Loving it. Perfect for travel and at home. I use it on my body too :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo bar by far.  It rinses my hair clean (unlike a few others I have tried) and leaves it feeling soft.  I can skip a day of washing with this product and my fine, thin hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or weighted down like with more conventional shampoos.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!  this is great. my hair is so soft. Happy!!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing bar shampoo virgin coconut aragan oil from J.R. Liggett. This old-fashioned formula was all-natural safe-to-use .Its unique formula lathers and quickly cleans, leaving you hair healthy, beautiful .This sulfate-free product is safe to use on all hair and skin types with no risk of irritation.It didn&#x27;t last longer . Enjoy this old-fashioned recipe with your family.</li>
    <li> I never felt like it would rinse out and it turned my hair into a tangled mess.  I tried to stick with it to see if it would get better, but ended up throwing it out after 3 weeks of regular use.  Also, if you get it in your eyes, it stings really badly.</li>
    <li> great , makes your hair grow</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo. This met that criteria, and promised to eliminate the need for conditioner. It comes in a simple paper wrapper, the scent is very mild. I hit some bumps in using this shampoo, mostly user error. If you like using coconut oil hair masks or any other heavy duty hair treatment before you shower, note that this shampoo will not be able to completely remove the residue. It is also important to thoroughly rinse out the shampoo (I just use water, but I can see why some customers recommend an apple cider vinegar rinse). When you hair is wet after using this shampoo you might feel like your hair has an almost waxy texture. Don&#x27;t freak out! Wait for your hair to dry, the waxy texture will completely disappear. While you can use this shampoo without conditioner, doing so might prove unmanageable to those used to that super silky feeling right out of the shower. I like this little bar, I call it my \\&quot;lumberjack shampoo.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> So far so good! I really want to love this product and am excited that so far I&#x27;m pleased. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and I did a lot of research ahead of time on &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; my hair and preparing for the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; (no chemical-laden shampoo) approach. I followed up the shampoo with an apple cider vinegar rinse and I&#x27;m happy with the results - confident enough in fact to go ahead and through out all my other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking it would be as good as the original formula but it just didn&#x27;t work out well for my hair at all. It does give a good lather when used sparingly but this one left my hair more on the oily side. I&#x27;ve been using J.R. Liggetts product for awhile now so I passed the hair &amp;#34;phase&amp;#34;. The Coconut oil and Argan Oil just didn&#x27;t work out for me like I had hoped but I&#x27;ll still be purchasing the original formula.</li>
    <li> The coconut oil is a deep conditioner. This is not a wash and go product. In order to not have your hair with a greasy film you have to let the coconut oil seep in. As long as you have time to allow your hair to semi air dry before blow drying and styling this is the bar for you!</li>
    <li> I bought this product looking for a eco-friendly solution to shampooing my hair; it fullfilled my expectations. My hair feels soft, thick, and is manageable.</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo my entire family uses! No plastic bottle and no harmful chemicals. Works great and Mother Nature thanks me for saving the planet!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It produces great lather, even in hard water. It has no strong, &#x27;perfumy&#x27; fragrance and leaves my hair feeling soft, so no need for conditioner. It packs easily, being a bar and you don&#x27;t have to worry about spills. I&#x27;ve used other varieties of Liggett&#x27;s shampoo for several years, and if it&#x27;s like the others it will last 2-3 months used daily (ymmv).</li>
    <li> I bought this as backup if the TSA took my bottles at the airport. They didn&#x27;t but after I ran out of my liquid shampoo I had to use this. I was shocked. I really didn&#x27;t think it would work but it did! It takes up so little space and you don&#x27;t have to worry about spillage like you do with bottles. It lathers up quickly without having to use much of the product or much effort. My hair felt shampooed. I would not be able to easily comb my hair afterwards  without conditioner, but that is typical for my hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo since it has so many great reviews... But, this stuff just sucks. I really gave it a good go... used it almost a month (I hate to waste things). While it lathers nice, smells nice and makes my hair squeaky clean... it also leaves my hair feeling coated and dirty and SUPER staticy and frizzy. It doesnt ever ever get rid of that awful dirty hair smell, either. I have long hair and it totally dried it out. I had to use a conditioner and oil on my hair after a week because it looked and felt so horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im back to using Suave on my hair and using this bar shampoo as a body wash. Dont waste your money on this stuff if you care about your hair. Maybe its great for someone who has a buzz cut, but not for anyone with long hair!! Skip this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I had tried several natural shampoos and even the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method before trying this.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and have had great results.  I love that it&#x27;s not putting chemicals on my hair and that it produces such a small amount of waste as opposed to plastic shampoo bottles.</li>
    <li> I had never used  this product before.  It worked really great on my hair.  I really didn&#x27;t need conditioner after I used it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo bar, everyone in my family uses it. It leaves our hair soft, shiny and clean. I have ordered several times from this store and my order is always right and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have thin hair and when I use regular shampoo, it makes my hair feel even thinner by comparison to the bar shampoo. My hair feels much more thicker and fuller for days. I recommend a tiny bit of voluminous conditioner. lightly tap around  the top of your head and place the rest at the ends of your hair only if you don&#x27;t want a weighed down look. the conditioner will help you have the manageability for styling.</li>
    <li> other brand shampoo bars last way longer. I kept it closed in plastic container and it turn from bar into muddy liquid just by being in warm bathroom. I would not recommend this shampoo bar. Lush coconut shampoo bar lasts way longer and cleans better also. Sorry</li>
    <li> Truly old-fashioned with very good ingredients.  Uses sodium-hydroxide (lye) which if left on your skin begins to burn and eat your skin!  There is nothing gentle about this product, I happen to use most shampoos as shaving cream since there are similar ingredients.  This product has no similar ingredients but does clean the crap out of your hair.  Using a little Argan oil after a shampoo leaves your hair very nice.  The worst part about this is it has no discernible scent.  In the end, I think it is just way too old fashioned and will never use this product again.  Keep this away from your eyes, mouth, and any other entrance into the body.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great product. My hair feels thick and healthy after washing with this.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and people tell me that my hair is growing.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars but I feel I need to use it for a longer period of time.  So far I am satisfied with the lather and even happier with the way it rinses out leaving my hair feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with super short hair. This stuff rocks. After sorting out that most shampoos have 1 or more Group 2B carcinogens, wanted something simple.  This fits the bill: you can pronounce all the ingredients, good lather, rinses instantly, low fragrance.  Easy to travel with. Highly recommend:  clean hair, and shampoo as a bar is kinda cool.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product I have used for years!  A favorite!  So nourishing!</li>
    <li> Tryin this new product.</li>
    <li> Best soap I have ever purchased.  I use it for the shower, my face, and for a Shampoo - one product leaves skin soft and hair manageable.  This is the only soap/facial wash/shampoo I will ever buy. Exceptional.</li>
    <li> Good product and mostly/all made of stuff I can pronounce.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my scalp dryness and dandruff</li>
    <li> This is a VERY tiny little bar of soap, so be prepared.  I was shocked.  It looks like soemthing you would order for dolls.  THe photo is deceiving.  It works great so far.  I have long, blonde hair, colored and my hair looked amazing, shiny and clean and better somehow.  What I did not like is the feeling of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; in your hair.  I thought, &amp;#34;Uh, oh&amp;#34; when I was using it and expected it to dry and stiff after I got out and tangly, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I was thinking that this would be great to travel with when you fly, as it is not a liquid.  I still used a conditioner, even though it said you did not need to.  After that &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; feeling I was afraid that I would not get a comb through it.</li>
    <li> All Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars are wonderful. Don&#x27;t expect lots of lather. Use rather sparingly. It does a terrific job of cleaning hair while not removing natural oils. Best of all you do not need a conditioner. Hair is always clean and nearly tangle-free. This particular bar is one of my favorites. And the bar will last a long, long time. So it&#x27;s very cost effective. Remember you&#x27;ll save even more because you won&#x27;t need to buy conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had originally rated this 5 stars until I tried As I Am&#x27;s Coconut Cowash, which is 10x better. I liked this shampoo bar and still think it is cool. However, I am a little disappointed in it because 1) Apparently (according to the Subreddit r/hairscience) it has detergents in it :/. Makes sense as to why it lathered now. I am trying to grow my hair out. So I do not want the mechanical damage associated with detergents.  2) It worked overall, but it left a few spots of my head greasy no matter how much I worked on the areas. This doesn&#x27;t bother me like crazy, but it was a little weird.  After using As I Am&#x27;s Coconut Cowash (which is a cleansing conditioner and has no detergent or soap in it), I am pleasantly surprised at how soft and still clean it left my hair. Apparently without stripping it! My hair also looks much better and is more manageable with the co-wash. The greasiest are gone.   Still a nice product and would be good for travel. It still seemed to soften my hair and scalp. I just feel a little misled. I appreciate what they are going for. Giving this to my boyfriend to use as he keeps his hair short and trims it much more. So damage isn&#x27;t as much of an issue for him.inutes. Then I make sure to rinse verrrry well. I think the scrubbing and rinsing are key to get this product to work. I follow up by gently combing Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle through my mid-shaft to ends with a wide toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t blow dry (as I usually don&#x27;t these days), and it did take FOREVER to air dry. In fact, it&#x27;s been about 2 hours since I washed it, and my chin length hair is still not dry (might just be my hair and have nothing to do with the shampoo). However, it feels so soft and manageable! My hair does not feel dry at all. I do not feel any waxy build up as others mentioned. I also did not rinse with ACV. So I don&#x27;t know what is really different about the experience for me other than the fact that my hair was already used to going without shampoo and used to holding grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking something to use in between shampoos or to adjust to this permanently, I think it could work really well. It is really helpful in getting off your shampoo dependency. I actually think I may be able to switch to using only this and conditioner once or twice a week in the near future!</li>
    <li> What a surprise this was!  Leaves your hair... I hate to say &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; because it is so over-used, but we each agreed how smooth and silky our hair felt after using it.  And, not much was needed.  We&#x27;ll be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it NO star. I bought different kinds of JR Liggett&#x27;s Bar shampoo, and ALL of them make the hair sticky and greasy, with a weird texture like if you put honey in your hair. I had to try different ways since I thought I might be doing it wrong, but NO, still the same... and the SMELL. .... awful, I can&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...</li>
    <li> smaller than i expected but please with the outcome...couldnt have asked for a better bar...just a lil bit bigger would be ideal</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo bar!!! seriously am transitioning into natural hair and i was worrying on what shampoo will my hair love. i used vidal Sassoon before but i think it wasn&#x27;t working like i expected. so after i found this and read the good reviews about it, i decided to give it a try. when it reached me and i saw the size, i almost cried (since it was too small than i expected) but i didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a long time since i was waiting to use it. i jumped into my shower immediately i got it. and used it. it lathered more than that vidal Sassoon shampoo!! i was shocked and i could feel it doing a good job. after rinsing my hair i could feel my scalp was clean and my hair didn&#x27;t strip much. oh i was so happy the size didn&#x27;t even matter to me anymore. ! i don&#x27;t think i will ever use any other shampoo again. this shampoo bar here has won a place in my heart and in my bathroom cabinet!</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;no-shampoo&amp;#34; shampoo. It lathers but doesn&#x27;t strip your hair. It&#x27;s a nice option for people who don&#x27;t want to use shampoo yet want some kind of product to clean the hair. I&#x27;ve just started using it and I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I am giving 4 stars only because this product is NOT FOR DAILY HAIR WASHERS!  I wash and blow dry my hair every day and this product does not work for daily use since the second day is when it looks better than the first.  Now I must say I will continue using this but it will be 1-2 times a week since it does seem to do something beneficial to my hair the next day when I wash with regular shampoo.  My hair kept the body that the previous day gave from the shampoo bar.  So in an nutshell every 3 days I use the shampoo bar and the other days I use regular shampoo and conditioner.  I really like how this works for me!  Maybe another daily washer would like it better switching off from regular shampoo to shampoo bar every other day...that&#x27;s too much shampoo bar for my hair so that does not work for me.  If you are a daily hair washer I would not expect using this daily to work for you.  But I highly recommend switching off because the volume is fantastic!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a guy and trying to let my hair grow to a medium length. its almost there now and this shampoo bar is the best thing i ever bought. I am washing my hair twice a week but i always put my head under water when i shower. I just don&#x27;t wash it with anything because everyone tells me its better to wash it 2 times per week or less. this bar feels silky smooth on your hair and it lathers up like crazy, which is why it will last a long time. you only need to run it over your head once and that is more than enough</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo bar and it left my hair feeling clean, but dry and brittle.  Beware that most shampoo bars, because they are soap technically and not actually shampoo, may have this effect. The pH of shampoo bars are usually around the 9 range, while the pH of shampoos (and what is recommended for your hair and scalp) is much lower. Usually between 3-5 range. Constantly using a higher range pH may cause damage to your hair, according to some sources (others swear by these bars and other No Poo methods). Personally, I recommend this bar as a once a month or so clarifying cleanse for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people suggest using with an apple cider vinegar rinse, but ACV also makes my hair feel dry, even though many people swear by it for a natural conditioner. The ACV also brings your hair back to the lower pH range. People who have had success with these bars often follow with the vinegar rinse to balance out the pH. Some people believe that using the higher pH bars is still damaging, because raising and quickly dropping the pH is bad for your hair. I tend to agree with this, based on personal experience.  If you choose to use it, simply dilute a tablespoon or two of ACV in a cup of water, pour over your head, and rinse out. The smell will go away once your hair is dry (but may return if you get rained on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done a lot of research on No Poo and Low Poo methods, which is why I wanted to try this bar. Be aware that any No Poo method will have a &amp;#34;transition period&amp;#34; for your hair. This means as you get used to using these different products, you may have greasy or an unclean feeling. That is to be expected. I didn&#x27;t have this with my first use because I&#x27;d already been cleansing my hair with baking soda and ACV prior to using this bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since stopped using the baking soda and ACV method because I found that it was drying my hair. I&#x27;ve attributed it to the pH balance mentioned above. Even those who experience softer hair with this method often indicated breakage a year or two down the road and switch to alternative No Poo methods. Personally, I  have switched to sulfate free shampoos. I plan to use this bar once a month to deep clean because it does do a great job cleansing and clarifying hair. I recommend this product for occasional use, but not every day use. This is no fault of this particular shampoo bar, however. All shampoo bars have a high pH based on their composition. The scent is light, so if you require very good smelling hair cleansers, you may try a conditioner with it or a few drops of essential oil.s method often indicated breakage a year or two down the road and switch to alternative No Poo methods.

    <li> Smells horrible, would not buy again. I love natural hair soaps but this one has an unpleasant scent to it.</li>
    <li> I have dry curly hair, and I really like this bar. It take a few washes to get your hair used to this. It leaves my hair feeling clean even after having not washed it 5-6 days when I straighten it. My hair has been tremedously less frizzy but I think that is also due to the combination of using coconut oil as  a conditioner after this. I like that it is no fuss in my shower and last a long time and its natural and not loaded with crap.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo - I love using it and it keeps my hair super clean and it&#x27;s so easy to use!  I have tried SO many different natural shampoos on the market.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue and is also nice to pair with an apple cider vinegar rinse for super soft, clean, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> A great natural shampoo!</li>
    <li> I tried this version and the jojoba-peppermint. They are both good, but this is better for my hair. At some point I was going to give up with this product because my hair was super tangled, then I found a couple of tricks that work pretty well. First, rinse a lot! Second, it seems that if you make the lather in your hands instead of rubbing the bar on your head, the hair gets less tangles. Third, a rinse with vinegar really helps to get rid of tangles, works like a conditioner - I use 1 tablespoon in a quart of water. Most important, do not use conditioner, it will make your hair too heavy.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a bar of soap/shampoo this small..not anywhere, not anytime.  I didn&#x27;t realize this product would be what I consider sample size; if I had, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it nor would I want to pay the shipping fees I was charged.  This product arrived in a fairly large box, but since it was so light, I thought it was empty and that the company had failed to include the shampoo bar.  This is an unwise purchase in my view.</li>
    <li> What an amazing shampoo bar! I bought it as recommended by Farrah Dhukai on youtube and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m completely sold. This is my new go-to shampoo. I have very curly 3c hair. It is cleansing and moisturizing. I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner afterwards. I&#x27;m completely blown away. This is superior to the As I Am Coconut Co-Wash as well. Wow! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have any preference on choosing shampoo, but now I do.&lt;br /&gt;I loved LUSH solid shampoo so much and expected similar effect from this product.&lt;br /&gt;First, when I got this, I was surprised how small this shampoo bar is. Well, it&#x27;s partially my fault to not check the size before I make an order, so my bad. However, the real problem is, when I washed my hair with this shampoo and dried it, it made my hair so rough, thick, bulky, whatever bad conditions any hair can get. I was so shocked since I have straight, medium thick hair with very smooth texture. Every time I touched my hair after using this shampoo, I was terrified...&lt;br /&gt;So I decided not to use this shampoo bar and had to buy another shampoo which was a totally waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can return it.</li>
    <li> Cleans great and while it does have much of a smell, i like it. Makes a great lather and you can use with or without conditioner. I have long, fine hair and i find i can stretch time between washes with this.</li>
    <li> -Pushing 50 (so encroaching dispersion of gray and coarser strands)&lt;br /&gt;-Nearly waist length, semi-permanent color treated hair (yes I can still pull it off)&lt;br /&gt;-Frequent heat styler (blow dryer, flat iron)&lt;br /&gt;-Hair prone to dryness and humid weather frizz, takes forever to dry&lt;br /&gt;-Slight natural wave (when I have the patience to wait several hours for it to air dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I switched from conventional conditioners to argan oil applied to the lower 2/3 of my hair (coconut oil seems harder to control application-wise to avoid looking greasy). From this change alone, my hair seemed to feel and smell cleaner for an extra day or two, and to dry a bit more quickly. As I find the potentially endocrine-disrupting effects of many common ingredients to be fairly disturbing, and wasn&#x27;t up to playing with a box of baking soda, Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo seemed appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I personally did not have to endure any kind of transition phase (maybe due to earlier cease &amp; desist of conditioner?)&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers differently than regular shampoo (but still lathers plenty)&lt;br /&gt;- Stings my eyes a little bit (so kids may have issue)&lt;br /&gt;- Hair feels a bit crunchy when wet, but not once dry&lt;br /&gt;- I rinse with diluted Apple Cider Vinegar for Ph purposes- rinse this well so you don&#x27;t smell like salad&lt;br /&gt;- Next rub a couple drops of argan oil on hands and apply to lower portion of towel dried hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results! My hair stays clean longer, absorbs less ambient odor (smoke, etc), and has become slightly less prone to frizz in humid weather. I can only speak for myself, but the Liggett&#x27;s bar has been easier on my hair color than my former shampoo for color treated hair. I never had greasy hair, but until about five years ago, washed it daily, then every other day. I&#x27;m pretty fussy about germs and hygiene, yet have found it is only really necessary to wash my hair every 3 and sometimes 4 days, which is a real time saver on thedrying and styling end. This regimen has not further dried out my hair, nor has it miraculously given me Pantene model hair, however the texture has improved, it has more body, and I&#x27;ve actually received a few compliments on my hair from random strangers lately, for the first time in many years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I gave a bar to a friend with super-greasy hair (possibly pregnancy related), and her hair has become much less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, if you&#x27;re curious enough to read reviews, give it a shot, know what differences to expect, and use it at least 4 or 5 times before arriving at a verdict.</li>
    <li> I love bar shampoos and this is great.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this product before so I took a shot at it to see how it could help my hair. By the time I had gotten this in the mail (which only took 5 days), I had already stopped washing my hair with normal shampoo. This bar added shine, body and texture to my hair. I haven&#x27;t had to use any products in my hair of any kind and I am in love! I suggest this bar to everyone I know. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this so much more than the chemically bottled stuff I&#x27;ve used my whole life. It makes a surprising amount of lather!  My husband likes it for his beard as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning to shampoo bars for the past couple years. I didn&#x27;t like this product on the first try because I felt like iit matted my hair, but on the second try it was much better. It cleaned my hair without strippig it. The smell is clean and fresh and not overpowering. I would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair at all! If you ever had a chance to wash your hair with hard hand soap - the result of using this one is just the same! I have mid-length hair and they are sticky and unbrushable after this &#x27;shampoo&#x27;. Reviews about its conditioning effect look as an anecdote to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 2 years now and have not used any other shampoo. I have thicker hair with a bit of body, not really oily or dry. Love it and until I find the time to make my own shampoo bar, I&#x27;ll buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Found that shampoo stripped my hair color and left it dry and dull.I tried Wen but too expensive and left my hair limp too. I tried this soap and am totally in love with it. It left my hair clean, soft, and very easy to comb-no tangles. My scalp feels good too. No itching. Would highly recommend. Found the one.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar is amazing, I also used it as a body soap.  It would be ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap for shampoo indeed, even for my colored hair.  So little soap gets lot of foam, don&#x27;t really need conditioner afterward.  One bar lasts many months for me.  Great for traveling, I can even use it for face or body.  Love this product.  I recommended to my son, he loves it also for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this while planning for a trip and i wanted something solid to save room in my plastic baggie of liquids for the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It lathers well.  Some other solid shampoos don&#x27;t lather almost at all so it&#x27;s hard to know when you have enough product in your hair.  You will have no problem with this as the lather is quick and plentiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I&#x27;m only about two weeks in but there is no noticeable difference in the size of the bar so I think it will last a long time as I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  When I first started using this I had not dyed or chemically treated my hair in any way.  At that point I did not need to use any sort of conditioner with this shampoo.  After washing my hair was light and fluffy and soft with only rare tangles.  Since then I have dyed (light bleach to bring it down about 2 shades, nothing extreme) my hair and even after using multiple deep conditioning treatments I now need to use conditioner after every shampoo.  I only need a little but I would say if you use any sort of chemical process on your hair or heavily heat style you will probably need to keep your conditioner in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you are sensitive to smells at all this only has the lightest scent so I don&#x27;t think you will have a problem.  I have also tried one of their shampoos that has mint in it and you only really smell it if you hold it right up to your nose and after rinsing there is absolutely no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Regarding the &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; comments some other reviewers have posted, i have not noticed this at all.  I also make sure to open my shower curtain every morning and leave it open all day to prevent mildew in a damp shower.  I would say that if you leave it in a tray or something where it can&#x27;t fully dry each day, yeah, it will probably melt.  If you leave it on the side of a tub and allow it to get some air flow to dry in between showers you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
    <li> The bar is tiny for the price but should last as long as a bottle of shampoo. I love that it has all natural ingredients as I have allergic reactions to many synthetic ingredients in most all personal care products. It lathers just like regular shampoo. I haven&#x27;t found a natural conditioner yet, but don&#x27;t seem to need one. My hair is fine and straight, normal in oil content. I think the oils in this bar are keeping my hair from being overly dry. I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo. The ingredients are simple and my scalp and hair feel healthier.  It leaves a really, really squeaky clean feel afterward but that goes away. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and I like it more with each use. I recommend washing your hair only every other day. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this from this company though bc they took forever to ship.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  It makes my skin and hair feel so soft and now my skin and hair is not so dry.  I don&#x27;t have to mess with all those bottles in the shower.  Just using the bar of soap on my hair and skin I&#x27;m done showering so fast I can&#x27;t believe it.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much time it takes to open all those bottles.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo bar. At first I did like it. It provided nice lather. I always needed to follow it up with conditioner though, otherwise my hair felt weird. But after about two weeks of using this (occasionally...washing my hair every other day), my hair got an awful greasy, clumpy look to it. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it with baking soda, or conditioner, or even other natural shampoos. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked for me..I have very kinky natural hair and this did the job and the statement on the package is that must dont need a conditioner..I tried it without a conditioner and I was able to comb through my hair with no problem...</li>
    <li> Took my hair a while to get used to it but I like it. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is light and fluffy and definitely soft.  it is true that I didn&#x27;t need conditioner. My natural curl has a nice wave/curl pattern and is not weighed down.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, smelling good and clean.  I have used coconut shampoo soap for years and like it much better than the weird shampoos that are out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with very curly mid back length 3c hair. I just swipe it a few times at my roots and it lathers nicely when I massage my scalp.  I follow this with Pantene deep conditioner or any moisturizing conditioner. My hair detangles easily after washing with this bar. It also makes my curls clump very nicely. That&#x27;s a bonus to me but it could potentially make naturally straight hair appear stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar does make my hair feel a little squeaky right after washing but using conditioner gets rid of that issue. My hair is extremely soft and bouncy once it dries. This bar leaves my hair full of body and my curls are more defined and with a nice sheen. It makes my styling products more effective as well.  I only wash my hair every 5 days or so but could go longer if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bar does a good job of cutting through product buildup too. I add a variety of oils and butters to most of my hair products. This bar removes almost everything with no problem. Just one lather gets the job done. No need to &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34;. :) Make sure to rinse thoroughly though.</li>
    <li> Switching to bar shampoo (or any SLS-free product for your hair) will require a transition time and you should do research on how to best begin these products. You can&#x27;t expect them to feel like your regular shampoo right away, but I&#x27;ve been using JR Liggett&#x27;s products for about 4 months now and I am VERY satisfied with this one! I have long, thick hair and I don&#x27;t ever need conditioner, and it feels just as soft and silky as before. I get compliments on my hair all the time, and I&#x27;m prepping for being on the road for 6-7 months, so I have purchased a few of these to stock up. I&#x27;m SO glad I switched, and this bar in particular has the oils to bring out the best in your hair, naturally, once your wean it off the other chemicals.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a beauty tips video, I was curious to see if it would actually lather with no slr. Well it lathered..alot. The only thing don&#x27;t like is the feeling of rough hair while its still wet. Yet, when it dries, without any other product, my hair showed the most beautiful natural curls that earlier on i could only achieve with hair cream.</li>
    <li> It will leave your hair feeling waxy after you come out of the shower but as the hair dries the waxy feeling will go away ... After 4-5 washes ( 1-2 weeks ) you will start seeing the results</li>
    <li> I was super excited about this product, but after receiving it just didn&#x27;t like it too much. It dried my hair out super bad and made it feel waxy. I&#x27;m sure that after the transition period it would eventually go away but I just don&#x27;t have enough patience for it.</li>
    <li> I do like the product very much, however I think it is overpriced. I bought it for $4.00 a bar at my local health food store which is typically an expensive place. I am not sure I would buy it again at $6.25 for such a small sized bar.</li>
    <li> This was not the miracle cure to all my hair woes that some other reviewers found, but it is a good product as long as you are able to be realistic and flexible with your expectations. I wanted a sulfate-free, environmentally-friendly option and I think this fits those requirements. I&#x27;ve nearly finished the entire bar, so I&#x27;ve been living with it for a while and these are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;-It creates a nice lather and has only a very light scent&lt;br /&gt;-It DOES leave a strange, waxy texture after rinsing, which diminishes substantially once my hair is dry (this is one of those things you just have to get used to)&lt;br /&gt;-I like the feeling better when I combine with an apple cider vinegar rinse after (I dilute the vinegar with 3-4 parts water and try to limit it to a couple of times a week)&lt;br /&gt;-My hair *feels* a little bit greasy after it dries, but it does not *look* greasy the way it normally would if I went without washing it for a while (hubby can&#x27;t tell the difference by appearance between when I use it and other products)&lt;br /&gt;-The greasy feeling mainly happens when I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair&lt;br /&gt;-If I let it air-dry and wear it wavy this shampoo actually works really well to help control the style. I&#x27;ve needed significantly less curl product.&lt;br /&gt;-About every 5th wash I am still using a regular shampoo, mainly just because I miss the silky feeling it provides&lt;br /&gt;-Currently I still wash my hair pretty much every day (usually to get the styling product out), but the longer I&#x27;ve used this bar the more I feel like I could start skipping a day between washes, especially on flat-iron days. It&#x27;s producing oils a lot more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I want to try some other brands of shampoo bars, but I may very well be back if they&#x27;re not dramatically better.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so much press these days about the harsh and harmful chemicals in shampoo. We find this to be a great alternative, it lasts a long time, smells great and your hair actually FEELS clean.  It also still produces suds, unlike some natural shampoos, for those who like the sudsy shampoo experience.</li>
    <li> My hair is very clean and super soft, which is a rare find in non-chemical shampoo with my long hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good product! Still waiting to see what the end result will be for my hair. Takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> The idea of using a shampoo bar was strange at first to me- but it really lathers well, and cleans my hair without drying it so far! My hair is naturally wavy and this improves my waves even more. It seems like it will last a long time, and I am happy because it means less plastic bottles for me to deal with and it will be easy to travel with! It does not have much of a scent, but this does not both me since I moisturize my hair when dry with a bit of a scented oil or rub perfume in it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!!! My hair needed a break from using all the chemical based hair products and this soap is perfect for my hair. My hair feels clean (feels a little waxy when it&#x27;s wet but once you dry it it&#x27;s soft and light) and healthy. I use this for my body too. Wish they made this bigger.</li>
    <li> Good product . Worth investing in but I wish the company made a condertioner . Like it but be waren that it does make your hair feel waxy, but other than thet it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in over six months doing the whole no poo thing, witch I still do. But backing soda was to harsh, and sometimes honey just didn&#x27;t cut it. That&#x27;s where this comes in, the bar wont strip your hair of it&#x27;s oils but it&#x27;ll sure clean it up. It&#x27;s perfect for when I have to travel and can&#x27;t take all the steps to my hair care routine with me. I still do a vinegar rinse after I wash my hair with this to condition though all in all I love this product, sometimes I cheat on my no poo with it when I&#x27;m not supposed to because I love the suds :)</li>
    <li> Worked great. Used it in Spain when I hiked. Good for both hair and body.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner.  I have been getting lots of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Only downside, is that it melts when water hits it. So make sure you place it in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months. Definitely gives your hair a strange, waxy feeling after you rinse out the suds, but it goes away and leaves your hair silky and smooth when it dries. Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t have a scent, perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> awesome bar shampoo, as a guy i usually stick to head &amp; shoulders, but this shampoo feels a lot better and i can&#x27;t go back to using regular shampoo now.</li>
    <li> if you like a shampoo with no smell whatsoever then buy this! Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> We love this product.</li>
    <li> I am liking these bar shampoos, this is the third one I&#x27;ve tried. It cleans my hair and leaves it soft and full. I have fine hair.  It is a little tangly when wet, I do sometimes use a little detangler.  Shipping was very quick. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for travel. Wish I knew about this sooner . Smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Bar smells great but really dried out my hair.  Costs way too much.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic!  Love it!  I have used this shampoo bar before and specifically searched for it for a month long trip.  It is compact, travels well and works not only as shampoo but a wash bar too.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> works better than any other shampoo. Only need to rinse once and my hair soft than before.</li>
    <li> Works well, unscented.</li>
    <li> I recommend any of J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars. It&#x27;s nice to know you&#x27;re not putting horrible chemicals in your hair.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for these when I bought them (not from Amazon but J.R directly) because of all the great reviews but sadly it&#x27;s been the worse thing I ever put my hair through!!!! :( My hair is very frizzy and unruly and had been in hair turmoil for a pretty long time. I had tried soooo many things before that never seemed to work or last very long before my hair was all coarse and frizzy all over again. I came across this on a YouTube video and it sounded AWESOME and I really was looking to use something all natural for my hair so I decided to give it a try. Now, I live in the Caribbean where our weather is just no hair&#x27;s friend!!! I was a tad bit greedy and purchased 3 of the bars as the combinations sounded so yummy for my hair. My very first wash I was amazed as to how this little bar lathered so much better than a lot of shampoo&#x27;s but when I had to rinse WOW!!! Felt like I just pulled candle wax off my hair strands. I was so upset but decided to continue using it because my hair just prob needed to adjust! I used it for close to 2 mths before I just had to quit because the condition of my hair had gotten soooo bad!!! Felt like my hair did not belong to me and it became so much frizzier and oily!!! My hair rejected all products and just continued feeling waxy. I&#x27;m really happy for the ppl that this product works for and I really wished I could&#x27;ve been one of them but these are just not for me. If anyone is interested in the 2 that I still have that&#x27;s never been used you can contact me at pagandawn17@hotmail.com!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for both my mom and I.  My mom is very pleased with the product especially because she has a sensitive scalp.  Both her and I will be buying more of these shampoos</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It makes my hair feel healthy. The smell is very natural, its not amazing, but its not bad. I don&#x27;t like the texture it leaves my hair when I use the shampoo alone, so I follow up with a conditioner. I have heard many people use it alone though, with no problems. Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> I got this bar, hoping that it would CLEAN my hair without over drying it.  It does.  It feels a little too &amp;#34;Squeaky clean&amp;#34; in my opinion and leaves my hair feeling like straw if I don&#x27;t condition it.  However, after a quick condition and rinse, I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. I just wish it was a little more conditioning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M AN AVID LIQUID USER, THAT IS UNTIL TODAY. MAN I&#x27;VE USED SHAMPOO BUT &amp;#34;THIS&amp;#34; IS SHAMPOO. YOU GUYS&lt;br /&gt;HAVE GOT YOURSELF A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE. I DON&#x27;T EVER REMEMBER HAVING AS MUCH LATHER AS I HAD 1st&lt;br /&gt;TIME OUT.MY HAIR IS SOFTER THAN I CAN EVER REMEMBER IT BEING. ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU WON.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second bar of this good stuff</li>
    <li> it made my straight, buttocks length hair very dry, it doesn&#x27;t produce any foam, does not smell good at all, hair was over dried. I would not purchase again. I supposed it depends on your hair type.</li>
    <li> Great stuff highly reccomend</li>
    <li> Good for getting rid of scalp issues.</li>
    <li> I really love this product,  the only negative for me is I have long hair and it&#x27;s very hard to get this to lather my hair. But other than that once I&#x27;m out, I will purchase again.  It last for me longer than what I used to pick up at the health food store.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair feel so squeaky clean.  I really have begun to pay attention to ingredients in products and I&#x27;m very pleased with the ones in this.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I really like the bar soap for shampoo.  I think the JR Liggett&#x27;s is a really great brand.  You do have to find the one that matches your hair, though.  I tried the Ultra - worked GREAT on my scalp, but left my hair weighted down (I have really long hair) and it never seemed to dry because of the amount of oil.  The Coconut Aragan did not help my itchy scalp but was great for the rest of my hair.  So - I am trying the next one on the list... The bar soap really lasts a long time, and I also have to say that my hair is much stronger and curlier when I use the bar soap:  I shed a lot less hair!  I am trying a moroccan oil liquid shampoo off the shelf (I lose a lot more hair than with the bar soap), and I have to say the bar soap from JR Liggett&#x27;s is much better for my hair nfor strength and dryness (I get a lot of static - goes with long hair, and the bar soap cured the static).  For those of you trying these soaps, find the one that fits your scalp and hair needs in this line...you won&#x27;t regret the healthier, curlier and softer hair, plus a healthy scalp.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> No conditioner needed! Good quality ingredients! And it&#x27;s cheaper! No down side to this product! It lathers very well no liquid bottle for traveling! I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!!</li>
    <li> I use this bar as shampoo, body wash, and face wash. It&#x27;s amazing. It took my hair a little while to adjust it&#x27;s oil production, but now it&#x27;s very healthy and shiny. It worked wonders on my face immediately - my skin is now even toned and clear without any of the stubborn blackheads. It&#x27;s also been great for my body and I think it&#x27;s improved my keratosis pilaris (bumps on the backs of my arms and legs). And of course it makes traveling and camping very easy, it&#x27;s pretty much all I took on a 3 week camping trip in Australia. This stuff is absolutely fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this product, leaves my hair soft and so clean without any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Left my scalp itchy, not a good shampoo bar.</li>
    <li> My wife made me try this shampoo. It was my first experience with a bar type shampoo. I am know hooked. The first few times of use didn&#x27;t impress me that much, it felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t getting very clean. By the third or fourth wash I definitely changed my mind. I believe first few washing were getting all the gunk that normal liquid shampoos leave in your hair. I have been using JR Liggett&#x27;s for about 7 months and my hair (head and beard) feel cleaner, smoother, softer, and less gunkier than ever. I have relatively short thick hair and use it on my head and beard. The price threw me off initially but turns out to be cheaper than the liquids I was using prior. It took a little time to get the right amount of lather down, initially I was using a little to much. My first bar lasted 3 months of daily washing, while my second bar has lasted 4 months and counting, still have about 1/3 left. Lastly I love the fact I can pronounce all the ingredients, try looking at the back of a bottle of regular liquid shampoo; almost need a degree in chemical engineering to read the ingredients. I love this shampoo and shave my head before I go back to regular liquid shampoo. Old School is in.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received one of these shampoo bars as a gift, I haven&#x27;t used any other shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of oil, so your scalp doesn&#x27;t overproduce oil and make your hair oily.  I have thin hair, so oily-looking hair is an issue.  I also noticed that my hair had more volume with this shampoo than any other.  Having thin hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair going flat, and have used many volumizing shampoos and products.  Nothing works better than the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair a different texture; I don&#x27;t know if its leaving residue or what but my hair looks good and does not get greasy as fast as it used to.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle I have never felt so clean</li>
    <li> I bought this for the explicit purpose of having it when traveling and am trying to cut down on liquids in my carry-on.  I&#x27;m a product snob and generally use high end shampoo and conditioner (and rarely like what&#x27;s supplied in hotels, even some of the really nice ones), so wanted something I could bring with me on trips in case the hotel&#x27;s supply doesn&#x27;t cut it, but doesn&#x27;t take precious space in my 3-1-1 baggie (I&#x27;m a product junkie too).  I actually like the way this product makes my hair feel (with conditioner bar: Quinoa Hair Conditioner with Moroccan Argan Oil) enough that I&#x27;d consider using it more often... but it does take longer to get a good lather than regular shampoo in long/thick hair.  As noted, even though it has a conditioning oil in it and some people use it as a stand-alone product, I still use a conditioner bar with it for my long, thick hair to cut down on tangles.  The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
    <li> too moisturizing for my hair! Made it more frizzy. I like the original better.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Argan oil formula solid shampoo bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know you like shampoo bars, and you want one that adds extra shine and volume, this is the bar for you! I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoo bars by J.R. Liggett, and this one is by far my favorite. I have real trouble with itchy dry scalp, and my scalp responded best to this one. (Compared to original and herbal formulas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would add is that this does feel like it almost soaks into your hair and makes it feel thicker and coarser. This has been the case with other artisan shampoo bars I&#x27;ve tried, so it&#x27;s not just this. If you need to brush or comb your hair while still wet, you will need to use a conditioner after this bar. However, if you can just let it air dry, it&#x27;s fine after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will stay cleaner feeling for longer between washings with this, BUT not usually if you use a conditioner after. If you just want to lightly condition your hair without making it feel dirty as soon as a conventional shampoo would (OR you have scalp issues like I do), then I suggest keeping a bottle of raw apple cider vinegar and a mug or glass in the shower. After rinsing your hair, pour about a tablespoon of raw vinegar into a mug or glass and fill it up the rest of the way with warm water. Pour carefully over your hair to ensure good coverage of all of your scalp, but be careful not to get it into your eyes. This removed the thicker coarser sensation, plus makes it easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason to choose raw apple cider vinegar over white vinegar is that with the raw, you have a live symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast in the vinegar, which can really help if you have any seboriah or scaling on your scalp. I believe what is happening is the probiotics (good bugs) in the raw vinegar are able to out compete the bad bugs causing the scalp irritation and scaling.</li>
    <li> QUICK SHIPPING. ITEM JUST AS DESCRIBED! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my hair. I have very thick wavy hair and this just didn&#x27;t seem to get it as clean as I would like. Maybe not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have heard people talk about this soap and rave about how great it is, but sadly for me I didn&#x27;t see it. I was expecting amazing hair after using something natural that contained coconut and argan oil, maybe it is just me, but I thought my hair would feel healthier, look healthier, it didn&#x27;t feel very moisturized after I shampooed at all, I was disappointed. The company is great though, I emailed them some questions and they answered me with no problem, they are very helpful. I am going to give their peppermint and jojoba soap a try soon, because maybe I will like that one better. After all sometimes we like one thing from a product line and may not like something else they make so, hopefully that one will work out. But this may work for your hair, I just know it didn&#x27;t do nothing for me, maybe it is because I have very thick coarse hair, I don&#x27;t know that may have something to do with it!</li>
    <li> I like how after using this bar i do not need to use conditioner. Saves money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap due to hearing about it from Andrew Perlot (raw food expert, look him up!) and he&#x27;s into natural stuff. I must admit I was surprised at how small the actual bar was when it arrived, but the package instructions says it&#x27;ll probably last for 26 shampoos... so at once weekly that&#x27;s half a year! My hair is just at shoulder length so I am able to comb it through - STARTING AT THE ENDS FIRST - without major tangles. I then just blow dry it - no extra conditioner or anything!!! I live with humidity in coastal Florida and am (so far) pleased that I can go out and not come back in with a head full of fuzzy hair. I also love the squeaky-clean feel when the soap is rinsed out - it really does squeak and it reminded me of being a little girl when shampoo was only available in bars... Highly recommend this coconut and argan oil bar - have not tried any of the other Liggett bars yet - but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to do so. My hair is soft and actually &amp;#34;moves&amp;#34; instead of sitting there like a stiff dried-out toilet brush... (ugh to that image!!!!) LOL. This review left by Alan&#x27;s wife - PS - I bought a bar of the same soap for my mom too and her hair came out all nice and shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I will never use otc shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I never used a shampoo bar before, but I am so glad I found this! Will never go back to regular shampoo. Just great!</li>
    <li> I so badly wish I had better results with this. I wanted this bar to work for me. I&#x27;m trying more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo alternatives to store bought products. This price was great and item came quickly, but it just didn&#x27;t work. Lathered nicely but left a thick residue on my hair.  I have thick shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I have been transitioning to all natural products in my bathroom for the last year. I recently made the switch to &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for hair care. I tried this bar first after seeing a great review of it written by a blogger I follow. Unfortunately, I had a little more trouble with it. I have thick, semi-coarse hair and it made it feel oily. I had to wash it out really well and the next day I just ended up doing a baking soda wash to get it out. I think maybe I used too much, so I will try it out again on a day when I am not in a rush to go anywhere just in case. I did like how soft the rest of my hair felt, it was just too heavy on my roots.</li>
    <li> Used this for about month and I have seen rapid hair growth! I would really recommend them to please make a solid conditioner cuz I&#x27;m still trying to find one. Anyways,I love this product so much. Doesn&#x27;t leave ur hair dry after shampooing either</li>
    <li> the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> undecided on this one. Thought cleaned my hair kinda dried out my scalp and i found it difficult to rinse it as it made my hair very dry and felt like i was pulling out more hair when rinsing. I originally got it to try and get away from the supermarket shelf shampoos which are very damaging to the hair due to the stuff they put into it to make it lather and i wanted to slow the decline of my hairline by getting a shampoo that was natural and free of crap.</li>
    <li> Like the other bars this leaves my hair feeling heavy and oily.</li>
    <li> Someone said it lasts like as long as normal shampoo but I disagree. I&#x27;ve had it about a month and I feel it will only last about another 2 weeks. I have long hair though and wash every other day.</li>
    <li> I used this bar to travel with and will continue to use it at home. It lathers well although it leaves your hear feeling coarse when wet but after drying and styling my hear had much more body. I have very fine hair and liked the product very much for both hair and body.</li>
    <li> I actually have been using it for my hands, which in the winter get dried out.  This soap has kept them soft and clean.  I tried it as a shampoo, but it basically left a soap residue in my hair making it impossible to comb through even with my fingers and a load of conditioner.  I do love bar soap for shampoo, will keep looking :)</li>
    <li> I was so much looking forward to trying this product and wanted to love it......it lathered nicely and had a nice scent to it...but my hair never felt &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  after using it....I am using it just as a bar soap for body and it works fine for that.  It might work for some hair types but mine (natural gray and tends to frizz) , it was not what I needed.  I only bought one bar so at least I wasn&#x27;t out a lot of money for trying it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product - while it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t lather like I want it to or clean my hair that well.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first, but It then it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my hair very well and my hair constantly looked greasy and thick.</li>
    <li> I travel alot, it&#x27;s great to know that now I don&#x27;t have to pack in  two travel size shampoos and five travel size conitioners [or more if i go for more than a 5day trip].  I often compare my natural hair to Hagrid from Harry Potter, so to actually find a product that can, 1. tame it, 2. make it shine, 3. make it smooth, 4. easy to comb is... and I can&#x27;t emphasis more because there is no way to make the font bigger and change the color... AMAZING!!!!!! and when I straighten my hair it my hair is smooth and not frizzy [without any anti-freeze :p]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this for everyday use not just travel.</li>
    <li> Great soap, lots of lather!  Fast shipment!</li>
    <li> This bar creates a great lather, lasts a long time, has simple ingredients, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, travels well, and isn&#x27;t packaged in plastic. My short hair responds well to it. I&#x27;m glad to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of it at first. The concept as using a bar as your shampoo was definitely different. However, when I first tried it, I could tell my hair was clean. That squeaky clean you feel when you scrub dishes free from grease. Normal shampoos make your hair feel a bit slick because of the silicone in them. I recommend this to everyone. Plus it lasted me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband, I love the smell and the hair is so clean!!!Love it</li>
    <li> I just discovered shampoo bars and decided to give them a try. I had originally been researching the &#x27;no poo&#x27; method and saw that it could actually be very drying which is why I was leaning more toward the bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 3 washes for my hair to adjust/learn how to use it correctly.  It doesnt feel the greatest when wet, but once it dries it feels better than it ever has. It feels sooo thick, its shiny in a non greasy way, I hardly have tangles, and it just has an overall healthier look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe another review also noted that your hair will almost feel waxy when you rinse it out, it does while its wet but absolutely not once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely something you also have to adjust to, you wont have the silky soft feeling after rinsing out conditioner(while its wet), but this shampoo has done more for my hair than the most expensive conditioner masks ever have. It isn&#x27;t the most fragrant, but I use perfume so I don&#x27;t really care if my hair has a scent..as long as I smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you use hair masks like coconut oil, this will not get it out very well as it is designed to keep oils in your hair. Keep a small bottle of your regular shampoo around for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this, and give it a few washes to decide for yourself. i cant say enough good things about what it has done for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and shiney!!after just one use....No tangles just healthy hair</li>
    <li> My wife uses this after hiking.  Fits in her pocket, dries solid. A quick swish through her hair and quick rinse to ward off any ticks. Can also be used on a dog.  It&#x27;s a great size to travel with and when you need a quick refresh.  Would be very good for camping or military members. If need be, you can also brush your teeth with the soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent al around soap and shampoo</li>
    <li> Great lather and I like that there isn&#x27;t a long list of ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t give as much volume as I would like, but it is more convenient especially when traveling. I w</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome customer service !!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Newly natural and wanted to try shampoo bars. I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of lather from a small use and my hair is SOOOO soft. I still use conditioner because I have very thick hair. Luv the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripping the hair. Received the product as promised and will be ordering more from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually too lazy to write reviews but for me to write this one must really mean something.....this bar shampoo is the worst thing I have ever put in my hair. It made my hair feel soooooo dry and it made it so tangly and unmanageable . I had to put my hair in a pony tail today because I couldn&#x27;t stand my hair being down, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to come home from work and wash it with shampoo. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this please don&#x27;t it&#x27;s terrible terrible terrible for your hair!!!!!!! Wish I could put no stars...</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time today. It  is really tiny! Fit in my hand, and I have small hands so that is saying something. But since it is a solid, it should last a long tie despite its small size. the packaging says it should last as long as a normal sized bottle of shampoo. Felt a little greasy in my hair, but it lathered up well. I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner or products in my hair after the shower so I could get an accurate idea of its effect on my hair. My hair has now dried and I find it to be quite soft, as if I had used conditioner and leave in conditioner. I love it! I love that it is natural ingredients and not filled with harsh chemicals. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in a more natural hair care product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this for my hair, maybe our water here in FL is too hard, just can&#x27;t get the residue out.  That being said, it&#x27;s fantastic for my face and body as a soap.  Love it, it&#x27;s better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve had before.  I will probably use this as long as it&#x27;s out there.</li>
    <li> Actually made my hair dryer and didn&#x27;t look clean.</li>
    <li> was looking for an all natural shampoo in bar form and this fits the bill perfectly. My hair usually feels dry and damaged so the oils in this bar make it feel much softer.</li>
    <li> I use the tea tree and hemp oil  Love it!  It makes my hair fuller and shinier.. No more waxy build up from conditioners...</li>
    <li> I have been off of regular shampoo and hair products for quite a while now and my hair feels great.  This shampoo bar was wonderful.  My itchy scalp/dandruff did not bother me much at all when I was using this shampoo (I ran out recently).  It lasted a long time and smelled good but not too strong.  I love it.</li>
    <li> After I read zero waste home, I decided to buy this product because reduce waste. It is not good for Asian hair, I can not use this everyday because my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> I love it! I had fine thin frizzy hair and this rich lathering bar shampoo fixed the frizz just after one washing. Now I have tame waves after I let my hair air dry. The bar is small but it will last a long time and the smell is nice and mild. I still use a basic conditioner on my ends and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this bar. It lathers well and cleans my hair. It does have a strange texture while hair is still wet but that wears off after drying.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have to say I dislike this product A LOT! I have curly hair and so I thought I should buy something with aragan oil to make my hair smoother and nicer etc. yeaaa it DID NOT do that at all!  So maybe if you know that aragan oil works for you, use it but this was my first time using it and I also used aragan oil in another product (Shea moisture conditioner) and that also did the same thing&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER I will say that I in absolute LOVE with their original shampoo bar! Great for curly hair, I don&#x27;t even use conditioner in the shower and my is fine...I also love that this bar fits easily into the curly girl method&lt;br /&gt;Buy the ORIGINAL BAR</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but alot of it and this works well if I use it 1x a week. It will get greasy if I use it too much. Makes my hair silky:)</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo very much.  Lathers well and leaves my hair clean.  Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo bar, my hair looks just like when I get back from a week of camping...messy, oily and in need of a shampoo. However, I do like the fact that there&#x27;s no plastic bottles. But still...</li>
    <li> There weren&#x27;t very many reviews on this when I was searching so I thought I&#x27;d come back and write my piece to better help someone else who might be interested in trying it.  I am a licensed hair stylist so I know a lot about hair.  I have been trying to get away from conventional shampoo because I was not happy with how it was leaving my hair-- even the expensive stuff like Aveda, which happens to be a company I have worked for, was leaving my hair limp and greasy after just a day.  I was also struggling with dandruff.  Anyways, I started off just trying baking soda and apple cider vinegar, or &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; as it is called by all natural community.  It took about 2 weeks for my hair to &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34; but eventually I was only washing with the baking soda twice a week without experiencing too much oiliness.  Overall I wasn&#x27;t happy with the bs because I was constantly having to reformulate my bs to water ratio and I didn&#x27;t LOVE the way my hair felt.  The dandruff was gone but it would either be too greasy or too frizzy/dry for my liking.  I also read where the PH of bs isn&#x27;t good for your hair over the long term and can really ruin your hair.  So, I started making my own shampoos, but wasn&#x27;t happy with those results either.  I read about this shampoo bar after some google searching and decided to give it a try.  I was leary because it is basically all essential oils and water, that my hair would be greasy, but that hasnt been the case!  My hair is clean, shiny, and wonderful after each wash!  I absolutely love this bar.  It lathers like normal shampoo and the smell is very light. I do an ACV rinse after washing just because that is what works for my hair type (I have fine to normal hair-- not too oily but not dry either.  I am prone to fly aways also).  I apply argan oil to my hair before blow drying and the combination is amazing!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo bar.  I am washing about 2-3 times per week right now with it, but only because I work out at the gym 6 times per week.  If I weren&#x27;t constantly getting my head soaked with sweat I could probably go much longer without washing.  If you are looking for a natural cleansing option with few ingredients that won&#x27;t strip your hair of its natural oils-- this is it!e I work out at the gym 6 times per week.  If I weren&#x27;t constantly getting my head soaked with sweat I could probably go much longer without washing.  If you are looking for a natural cleansing option with few ingredients that won&#x27;t strip your hair of its natural oils-- this is it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week since I&#x27;ve used this and my hair and scalp feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and great shipping. Highly recommend, also this shampoo works great for my hair type.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, and leaves a nice shine to my hair</li>
    <li> Very good product. Love it...</li>
    <li> This bar smells really nice! J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars keep my hair very healthy  and soft.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this shampoo. Unfortunately, it left a greasy residue on my hair. I noticed that once my hair was dry, I scratched at my scalp and there was a film of this stuff left under my nails. Secondly, my hair felt like gum once this was rinsed out. Like HubbaBubba bubblegum. Gooey, sort of. When dry, my hair at the scalp was greasy and the ends were super dried out. I had no build-up on my hair prior to this shampoo bar because I have been using the baking soda no-poo. Anyways, onward ho to find the answer to simplifying my hair products.</li>
    <li> Very happy!  Works great, really good lather. After one wash I notice a difference,  my scalp is a lot less irritated then it was before so hopefully the more I use it the better it will get. I am also using apple cider vinegar as a condition</li>
    <li> as described thanks :)</li>
    <li> Great product and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I have never used a shampoo bar before and kind of missed the lathering feel of washing my hair. My fair felt waxy directly after being rinsed out and I didn&#x27;t feel the product build up on my scalp was as thoroughly removed as when using my usual shampoo.  I chose to use my regular conditioner and applied argan oil as a leave in conditioner as usual, my hair felt softer and smoother after.  My hair is very dry and somewhat curly and I felt this overall worked very well to moisturize, cleanse, and prevent frizz. I bought with plans to save space traveling and I definitely feel it was a great buy for that purpose. I&#x27;ve only used it once and am not yet sure if it will replace my regular shampoo at home.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product on time and used it as soon as I got it. In the shower I had to rub it onto my scalp to get it to lather . After my hair felt very waxy but it went away as soon as it dried. I am now on week 2 and still getting the waxy feeling. I am not using conditioner after i shampoo. It seems to help a bit</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, but I just wish the bar was bigger. It does last awhile however.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for frizzy haired people like me!  Leaves it a little bit waxy at first - takes some getting used to - but my hair looked amazing in some awful Texas humidity!!!</li>
    <li> Had I thought of it before I tried this product, I would have taken before and after shots.  My hair has been 30 inches of limp, lifeless, dry, no body, no volume, and frizzy blahness ... everything bad that you can think of, pretty much.  After just one washing ... that&#x27;s ONE washing with this bar, my hair blew up into wavy, tame tresses that are easy to style, but I don&#x27;t really HAVE to style it at all, though ...it looks great just combed and dried.  I can tell if I were to use my rollers, though, that my hair would be a thing of beauty, and I wouldn&#x27;t even need hairspray - or just a touch -  to hold the style :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a bit of trouble combing and brushing my hair after I used this the first time, though, so I decided to try a conditioner with it that contains Argan oil.  I was able then to comb through my hair easier, but I didn&#x27;t lose the fullness, body, or behavior.  I did notice that the conditioner gave me a bit more shine as well, so that was a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buying this product, along with some of the other formulations in order to determine which I like best, but I am certain that I will be happy with all of them!</li>
    <li> nothing special and it melts very quickly. i used it for like 5-6 times and it melted away. still i think its much better then other shampoos</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing an improvement in my hair since I started using it. It looks fuller and healthy. I just need to add some sort of conditioning after I shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t seem so &#x27;dry&#x27;.</li>
    <li> very nice product. A little small in size though, but works very well.</li>
    <li> No more allergies or residue in my hair.  I first bought for camping, but now I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love! I have very thin hair and I worried that a moisturizing shampoo would weigh my hair down as others have in the past. However, my hair is as light and super clean! It cleans as well as my parent&#x27;s conventional shampoo that I borrow sometimes, but way more health conscious. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product! Helped moisturize my hair, lathers well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the company because the product came before I expected.  in the other hand my hair still in transition it fells hard when i washed but the rinse with apple cider vinegar and water really  help.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo bar, it works wonders! At first I was a little skeptical because after I used it my hair had a waxy texture to it. However, after air drying my hair and brushing it out (even though it was still damp) my hair was left extremely soft and clean! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i was told about this from a good friend, she&#x27;s a naturalist too, and i have to say that this shampoo works great, it lathers, which most natural ones do not but the only thing i have to say is, after only using it once and i have coloured hair and even after using a heavy duty  conditioner, which i normally do not use, my hair was still super tangled, that just could not be tamed, it was very plasticky. NOW i have used many many natural shampoos, and most make my hair greasy. this did not do that, so really i have to just try again maybe i left it in too long !? other wise, if you  have un treated hair you will love this, as i know it will last a very long time !</li>
    <li> It did not work for my hair like I thought it would, it left my hair way too dry.  .</li>
    <li> This shampoo, like the other J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoos, is a wonderful alternative to the petroleum product shampoos that can be horrible to your hair. Cost-wise it is fairly economical, provided you use the wood shelf or an equivalent that will allow the shampoo bar to dry out between uses. Search Amazon for *J.R. Liggett&#x27;s* and the bar with the shelf will show up. Our family has run the gamut of the usual store bought liquid shampoos without finding anything we really like. But the first use of this bar set our determination to use nothing less from now on. Great shampoo, mild aroma, very much thumbs up for this wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo is great.  Lots of lather, it cleans better than liquid shampoos and it is environmentally beneficial as there is no plastic bottle.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It does a great job on my hair and because it is a bar there is less waste</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the soap yet.  But it did arrive quickly to my home.  I&#x27;m planning on making this my travel shampoo to save weight.  It is much lighter than liquid shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am sure if my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick the bar might have worked out better, but for the most part it was impossible to get all of my hair clean with it. It took me a while to lather it up in my hair. I will say that a little goes a long way though. The smell is fine, not as good as expected, because my hair didn&#x27;t really smell the way I was used to it smelling when its clean. When my boyfriend tried it, he loved it, which just confirms that this is definitely not for anything past shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. It cleans your hair so beautifully without all the harsh chemicals! It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t strip all your hairs natural oil like regular shampoo does.</li>
    <li> I love these for travel. I avoid packing liquids as much as possible and have been able to replace shampoo and shaving cream with this soap. The best way I&#x27;ve found to suds up my hair is  rub the damp bar around the crown of my head or my scalp. I have long, thick hair, so those are the two areas where I can get closest to my scalp. Then, I lather up my scalp. I don&#x27;t try to get the suds down to the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you slice the full size soap you can make a thicker version of the travel sized bar.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to remove silicone and sulfate from my hair care routine. I was worried when I first read some reviews for this and when I read the description of what it does. I thought it might not get my hair clean, especially when I don&#x27;t wash it for 3 or 4 days. I was proven wrong. My hair was squeaky clean but unlike other shampoos with sulfates it didn&#x27;t cause a lot of hair fall. Usually I clog the drain twice when I wash my hair. I barely clogged the drain once when I used this shampoo bar for the first time. My hair is naturally blonde and straight. It is also quite long and the strands themselves are thick so clogging the drain is usually par for the course for me. I do use a conditioner after this bar but that is mostly because it is winter. I believe I will be able to just use an apple cider vinegar rinse during the summer, but I don&#x27;t know yet. Overall, this is an amazing product and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a natural sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> This bar gets my hair super clean. Don&#x27;t get carried away when lathering as it can be drying. Otherwise nice product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I like the peppermint one best- it has all the same ingredients as the coconut but with peppermint which is great for my scalp!!</li>
    <li> Dont know what to make of this product. So far its been 10 days since i started using this product...  I bought a shower filter, and this shampoo bar. I also do the acv rinse. It seems to build up a weird wax like material on my hair, so it makes patches of my hair look oily. oddly enough my scalp looks nice and clean, but my ends look like they have wax. the only thing that is keeping me sane is the corn starch i use to absorb it. But then my hair feels strange. I only got it to make my hair look nice, but that was only because i clarified my hair with baking soda.... the next time i washed my hair with this, i got the waxy feeling back.  I have wavy, thin, fine hair, and i have a very oily scalp and dry ends. Anyone know any better shampoo bars???  UPDATE: I have given this soap a month, bought a shower filter, clarified with baking soda. My hair looks stringy, weighed down, and waxy. My hair has never looked more awful. I tried using the shampoo on my scalp only, on my entire hair. Although putting it on the scalp only helped, some of the shampoo does go to the ends as you wash off so there is still a bit of waxiness on my ends.  Even worse than anything else, i used to have dandruff until i started spraying vinegar on my scalp to treat my scalp. i still use vinegar and yet this shampoo bar has cause my scalp such intense itchiness, and i can feel the beginning of flaking. i used to have such bad dandruff that i would scratch and you can see it flying around.  I cant bear to go back to that, so i am giving up on this shampoo. Thankfully i applied pure tea tree to my scalp and the itchiness went away.  im trying another brand of shampoo bars. hopefully i can find something better.  anyone know any good brands for people with oily scalp and dry ends? im starting to think this bar has too much oil and not enough conditioning for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I started using this bar shampoo when I had a horrible case of contact dermatitis on my back.  The location of my rash seemed to imply that my shampoo could be the culprit, and so I wanted to eliminate as many potentially irritating chemicals as possible from my daily routine as I desperately tried to calm the skin irritation.  I admit I was not thrilled about washing my hair with bar soap, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I love this stuff and don&#x27;t plan on using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo anymore.  My hair is soft and easy to style.  I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner.  The smell is nice and clean, not too strong and neither too masculine nor feminine.  There are some shampoos that I cannot use for longer than a few days before my hair starts to look and feel funky from the buildup.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my hair is clean and there is no buildup.  And best of all, it is very gentle on my extra-sensitive skin.  (whew!)</li>
    <li> My hair loss has slowed down significantly! I still have to use conditioner but I love the way it leaves my hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product - Excellent service</li>
    <li> It really works. I keep order it for my hair.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this, never buying bottled commercial shampoo, ever!</li>
    <li> I was really apprehensive about using this product. I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it would work. I would wash my hair everyday and by the end of the day, my hair would be ridiculously oily (like I didn&#x27;t wash for days) and I was starting to lose a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some researching, I found this product. Now, initially, I was NOT happy how my hair felt after I rinsed my hair. It felt weird.. Like, kinda sticky,dry. BUT, it felt really clean.. Weird. I know. -.- after it dried, I was ok with it. Now, I wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with how my hair was.. But I read that I had to give about a week so my hair can get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a week goes by.. (It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks) And I really like it. I can&#x27;t say I love it but I really like it. My hair does not feel oily anymore and I can skip a day to wash my hair..(Which, apparently, is the thing to do..) but I usually wash my hair everyday. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it&#x27;s natural oil and I&#x27;m noticing a natural volume lift in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like this product and I would recommend it! Take your time with it, be patient, research your heart out on shampoo bars on how to&#x27;s and it&#x27;s benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the seller, I received my product quickly and it was great! :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an argon oil scent.  Plain smell up me.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this bar foamed up and cleaned my hair.  I have noticed my scalp is less itchy and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often because it doesn&#x27;t look oily for several days after washing with this shampoo.  I do still use a conditioner because I have long damaged hair, but this is far less drying than my old shampoo!  The smell is just ok, I&#x27;ve used a few different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of J.R. Liggetts and they all smell about the same.  Its a subtle clean scent but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Eh. Not enough lathering for me to really wash my medium length hair. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair, cleans it without leaving my hair too dry. Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> helps my hair with frizz.  works to really clean and all natural.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the UK and had read so many good reviews of this product that I bought it and had it shipped all the way to the UK.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it but it isn&#x27;t really doing it for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it (and only it) for nearly 3 months now but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really doing anything for my hair.  I never had a transition period while using this bar.  My hair never felt waxy, or greasy or lank, it just felt &#x27;dry&#x27; each time I used it.  I have grey hair (50/50) and the white hairs on my head just stand up straight off the top of my head.  I have to use a hair oil to flatten them.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I find it very economical to use and although I&#x27;ve used it dozens of times it&#x27;s hardly made a dent in the size of the bar.  I dare say it&#x27;s a good concept but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.  Unfortunately I ordered 2 bars so I&#x27;m going to have to be using this for a long time.  I&#x27;ve given it a good trial but I&#x27;ll be going back to regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  My hair has never been so dry.  I&#x27;ll probably use this bar as a shampoo for the time being but follow it up with a conditioner now too.  Once it&#x27;s gone I&#x27;ll go back to my regular routine of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, no lather, tangled my hair. Bar shampoo from LUSH is all i like</li>
    <li> Liggetts shampoo bars and shaving foams have become my go-to products for shaving and hair care since I began buying them in 2011.  They&#x27;re great! : )</li>
    <li> i have been using it for a little more then a month....m liking it as it gives my hair right volume ..it doesnt wash away oil treatment...and doesnt help if u have dandruff..less hairfall..ordered the 2nd bar.and i still keep other shapoos for oil treatments..</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers shockingly well and leaves my hair feeling great.  i have been using it for a few months and this point and I still love it.  i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Nice little bar of soap that moisturizes your skin and hair.</li>
    <li> needs some getting used to, but love that its all natural!</li>
    <li> I have used Liggett bar soap for a couple of years now and love it.  So, when I saw this one was a different variety for just a little more than I normally pay I thought of try it.  However today when I got it in the mail I was very disappointed.  This bar is probably a tenth the size of what I normally get from them.  Maybe it will last ten times as long but I doubt it.  I will update review if it does.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It leaves my hair clean &amp; soft - no stripping. A little goes a long way; I just rub the dry bar on my wet scalp &amp; roots, then spread the lather throughout my hair. Nice, rich lather. Saw it reviewed on youtube &amp; decided to buy it. Very happy with this shampoo bar.</li>
    <li> I like but as a male with short hair do not know how it is with long hair. In all I found it to my likind</li>
    <li> There is no words to how it makes your hair and the skin on your head feel. I can&#x27;t stand any artificial smells and this smells perfect. Just enough to complement.</li>
    <li> quite satisfactory, thanks kindly</li>
    <li> There was an adjustment period where my hair felt a little dry, but was also shiny and had good body.  I applied argan oil to the tips and ran it through my hair during this time.  This product is great, you barely need any at all and a brush helps it lather on your scalp.  Does leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; when your hair is still damp, then your follicles smooth out when your hair is COMPLETELY dry.  I&#x27;ve decided to make the switch to bar shampoo permanent.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo bar! My hair is very, very dry and frizzy. I have been trying to find a product that won&#x27;t strip all of the oils out. I think this is it! I have used it 4 times and I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> All natural, cleans hair nicely, easy on and off. I gave up expensive shampoo and will not go back.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo bar, I have been using it for years. My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner. The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims. I probably end up using 8 bars per year, I have mid length fine hair. The coconut argan kind seems to be more emollient than the regular bar, so you don&#x27;t need a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this shampoo!! It has all of the oils that are good for my hair! It&#x27;s very easy to use, I thought it was strange at first, because it&#x27;s a bar for your hair, and I wasn&#x27;t used to that. I have recently been looking for a natural option for my thinning hair, and I no longer wanted chemicals stripping my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils. The first time using this bar, my hair was so soft, and I normally let my hair air dry, then straighten because I don&#x27;t like my wavy hair, but it actually looked nice and relaxed!</li>
