<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is  a very great product..&lt;br /&gt;the seller&lt;br /&gt;Eve Hansen  is  very considerate careful and precise.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to deal with this seller  for peppermint  aromatherapy oil, and  to be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was packaged very nicely.  Easy communication with the seller.  Can use this product to help with sweating by putting a few drops in water.  Helps any actor/model who needs to stay dry on set under the lights and sometimes warm filming conditions.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The dropper makes it easy to handle. Good quality.</li>
    <li> The packaging was great - well protected product.  I have used it to control ants in my kitchen.  I sprayed it on a cotton pad and wiped my counter with it.  The ants avoided it, but I need to find the source of their entry and apply the product there.  I appreciate the other suggested uses.  I will be trying them all.</li>
    <li> Love this use it all the time for me and our pets works great</li>
    <li> Good oil. Good dropper. Good value.</li>
    <li> This is a real good product. Doesn&#x27;t take much to do what you need it for. It has many uses from just an aromatic fragrance in a closet or even through-out the home to helping to keep small critters from infesting your home such as ants, spiders and even mice. Just a drop or two on a cotton swab or....what I sometimes use....a half section of a Q-Tip. This stuff is potent, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way.</li>
    <li> Likely the least expensive for a pure, unadulterated large sized peppermint oil. The house smells lovely when I treat it and so far so good on spiders and ants! I WILL be buying more though it&#x27;ll take a while to use up 4 ounces!</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Big bottle. And potent. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s warding off spiders yet. It&#x27;s only been a few days. But I haven&#x27;t seen any so far.....So, yay!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is great and the dropper is perfect. My only complaint is that even before I opened it I could smell the peppermint very distinctly. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any leaks or oil on the outside, but when I open the cabinet--WHOOSH--peppermint in the face. Luckily it&#x27;s a pleasing smell.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Love  the oil. So many uses  I mainly needed cause I saw a mouse.  I use the cotton balls and put it everywhere.  Have not seen another mouse and hope I do not cause I almost fainted when I saw one. The sweet is better than others and it makes the house smell great.</li>
    <li> Had great reviews and a 5 star rating..waiting for it to ship..will send further details after being received and used for various uses.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast delivery. Far better quality product than I have purchased in local all natural product stores.  Very strong sent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the purity of this product but the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is definitely not the same as the Young Living brand. However you definitely get way more bang for your buck with eve Hansen</li>
    <li> Did not keep pests away as it said it would and took awhile to go into effect..</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  Very fragrant .  I bought it to sprinkle as a room freshener, and it has a clean, crisp fragrance.</li>
    <li> It has a deliciously strong smell.  It&#x27;s working just as I had hoped!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Keeps away the mice, spiders, and ants. Put it on my stoop and the neighborhood cat keeps on walking. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great on farm to control out door mice from entering, also keeps other pesty critters  out of house.spiders, fleas, ants, moths, etc.etc..</li>
    <li> I am loving this peppermint oil!!! It smells wonderful and works great!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;  young living is now my oil of choice  more expensive but top notch quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome item, very strong aroma, my house smells wonderful! Incredible seller, they really want their customers to be happy, will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this primarily to deter mice but have so enjoyed the fragrance in my home as well. It&#x27;s so refreshing. I just hope it does the job. So far so good!!</li>
    <li> i love this peppermint oil. You can tell the seller has a great product. i only use 15 drops at a time. I bought a few bottles from Michael&#x27;s (the craft store) and placed a 1/2 teaspoon of rubbing alcohol and 15 drops of this peppermint in each bottle with 3 ratan reed sticks. i made about five bottles all together and placed a couple in both my entry ways of my house and you will not believe the smell. It is invigorating!! i i bought the peppermint oil  for three reasons, entry ways, spiders and any potential rodents as it said they get rid of mice.  For the spiders, I noticed a couple of small whitish spiders hanging on my ceiling in the kitchen so I want to see if this will help while i wait for the summer to get my home sprayed/treated as i get a lot of webs in the summer. I hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes the house smell.</li>
    <li> usual fast perfect service. product exactly as represented in description.Would not hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> Best oil money can buy! Got here super fast!</li>
    <li> This is no old wives tale I bought this because everything like poison and glueboards didn&#x27;t get rid of the mice that semed to take over our house and those in our neighborhood . You can put drops around and like under our microwave are gone I also orcered the small bags of peppermint which I can use the liquis to \\&quot;recharge&#x27; them. As soon as we put them out we didn&#x27;t and haven&#x27;t seen any \\&quot;sign\\&quot; of any mice at all. The worst thing that can happen if it doessn&#x27;t rid your home of bugs and mice is your house smells great</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service..</li>
    <li> When used exactly as intended it great. Very powerful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Awesome essential oil! I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> love the oil and the customer service has been wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife since she has stomach problems and so far she is happy with it and feels that it is helping.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil was shipped very fast, and was packaged very well. This works great as head ache relief, which is what I use it for. It&#x27;s very strong and the aroma last about an hour, maybe longer if you put more than a few drops on your forehead. The bottle and dropper are of good quality, and you get a lot of peppermint oil, it should last quite a while! Over all I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> returned this item due to faulty tops/ manufacturing company took it back no problems. got my money back ASAP!! THANKS AMAZON........  Will try again</li>
    <li> I do much business with Amazon but this is the first time I have ever had a vendor follow up to ensure that I was happy with the product and that I received it timely. Kudos to you Eve Hansen. This is high quality peppermint oil that&lt;br /&gt;I use to saturate cotton balls and then place them in small containers in our sports car to deter mice over the winter as they hate the smell but the car smells very nice when we start driving it again in the spring. I highly recommend this product and vendor.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is great to rub in temples for a headache and also a great deodorizer.  You get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> Seller great, would purchase again. The peppermint oil is strong - only need a bit. I plan to look&lt;br /&gt;for other uses besides what I purchased it for (migraine relief). It should last a long time. Great addition&lt;br /&gt;to my household.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, well packaged... no complaints so far, One happy customer.</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil is as expected.  I have used it to keep out mice and also put some on a battery powered diffuser device that distributes the peppermint throughout our kitchen area at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is potent stuff as I dropped about 4 drops on a different diffuser that uses heat and about half an hour later we couldn&#x27;t walk within 25 feet of the area because your eyes would water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cottonball thing really didn&#x27;t work for me as i soaked about five of them in our basement, but never really could smell the peppermint.  I think a diffuser would work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was nice is the company sent &amp;#34;How To&#x27;s&amp;#34; on how to use the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I plan on repurchasing the oil once this one is out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful authentic product. Fantastic customer service</li>
    <li> The product is great! It arrived quickly with no leakage/smell whatsoever, and was an amazing value for the money. I contacted customer service when I did not receive the email of uses I&#x27;d read about, and asked a few additional questions. They were helpful, courteous, provided answers, and immediately sent that email - a few days earlier than scheduled. SUPERIOR customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used the product for insect control (ants and spiders) by spraying a perimeter around my pool screen enclosure, on the aluminum frame. I have used it to rid myself of many headaches (applied to forehead, temples, and back of the neck). And eased my aching muscles (massage in). I&#x27;ve cleared my sinuses (a few drops on hands, rub together, cup over nose and inhale). And it has successfully reduced my fever as I fight an infection, by adding a drop to my coffee and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not go wrong with this product from this seller!</li>
    <li> Very good quality oil</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister to use as a squirrel pest control. I haven&#x27;t heard from her if it worked, but she did say it made the house smell great. So even if it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the squirrels it will make your house smeel good.</li>
    <li> Quality with Value.  Works great, love it!</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil is absolutely wonderful. It&#x27;s pure and smells fantastic.  I have used to massage my head and hair particularly for itchy scalp during the winter. Not only it seems to help but also very soothing and relaxing.  My daughter also loves it.  I will be ordering more.  One thing to bear in mind is that since the oil is pure, it&#x27;s very strong and therefore you do not need to use too much oil at one time and make sure that it does not get into your eyes.</li>
    <li> Not effective at all. Purchased it for a mice problem. The critters run over it like it wasn&#x27;t there. Huge waste of money.  Had my suspicions when I read where you could use it as a home remedy.</li>
    <li> Great value and size option.  This will last a while.  Seems a little less potent from an aroma standpoint for use in a diffuser.  On the other hand, the wife uses this topically and the smell has bothered me at night, so for our situation the less potent aroma works in the positive.  So far topical and oral use seems to work as good as some other more expensive options.  I&#x27;m guessing it is a matter of time until I&#x27;m ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> very nice for the spa</li>
    <li> Although it does not cure my migraine, it does help with keeping the muscles from kinking up in my neck and I don&#x27;t feel so tight in my neck and upper back the next day, which helps with the migraine hangover.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It made the place smell great, but I got it because I was told it would chase away mice. NOT!! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get anymore, but it was a really great deodorizer. Apparently the mice liked it too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I utilize various natural oils for multiple purposes, everyday! The potency and viscosity of this oil is perfect. And the dropper makes it easy to apply the right amount. Because natural oils are so concentrated, often times a few drops is all you need! So this is also a VERY large supply by even an above average users needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAVORITE APPLICATIONS...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAKING&lt;br /&gt;It works great in cookie and candy recipies! I&#x27;ve used it baking shortbread, melting chocolate, or pouring hard candy with great success. For all edible applications it usually only takes 1-4 drops. One drop at a time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEVERAGES&lt;br /&gt;I like to add a drop to a cup of tea in the wintertime. It works great as a decongestant. I don&#x27;t drink, but I can only imagine it would be awesome in a frozen mixed drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN CARE&lt;br /&gt;Theres nothing better than a cool peppermint bath on a hot summer day...also your skin will thank you! Try ten drops in a full tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEST DETERRENT&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a few drops on cotton balls as a rodent deterrent. Stuff the cotton ball in the hole you saw the little sucker crawl through and he won&#x27;t come back ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s GREAT! The product is fantastic. And I can say without any hesitation that my experience with Eve Hansen&#x27;s customer service is among the best I&#x27;ve ever had. I will definitely be purchasing this (as well as their Lemon) product again!</li>
    <li> Wow,love this product!!exceptional smell</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, good quality, good price, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome. The fragrance is stong so you dont  need to use a lot. I use on my hair and love it</li>
    <li> Product is a great size and it does it&#x27;s job!!</li>
    <li> I was told that peppermint on cotton balls placed around my home would get rid of mice.  It worked!!! No more little critters and it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I had only purchased Young Living oils prior to this, but they were becoming very cost prohibitive.  It&#x27;s so hard to find a pure peppermint oil.  During my research, I found that essential oils are not regulated and therefore can claim to be pure when in fact things have been added to the oil for purposes of scent, etc.  This oil specifically states that nothing has been added or removed and that it is 100% pure.  The scent is great and doesn&#x27;t smell sweet like those with additives do.  We use peppermint oil for many things in our home... our home-made toothpaste, to treat nausea, headaches and acid reflux, etc.  I&#x27;m very happy with this oil and will definitely order more in the future.</li>
    <li> True to smell, strong mint aroma. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, best one I have bought yet.</li>
    <li> GREAT, best ever........</li>
    <li> This is the most clean pure peppermint scent that I&#x27;ve found in the various peppermint oil that I&#x27;ve tried.  Loved it so much bought a second one to be able to take into work to use in my office diffuser.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my purchase of eve&#x27;s peppermint oil.  I love the fresh fragrance and since I received it found so many more usages that my intent was to use.  The oil is awesome, fresh and the Company is a truly caring company to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Went above and beyond. Delivered it earlier than expected and wrote me an email after checking up on the status and tips on how to use it.</li>
    <li> I was asked by this company to give a review. I ordered Peppermint because of the reviews and the price. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. I currently use Young Living Oils ( no I am not a distributor) and I have such a positive therapeutic reaction, that I can only say I wish I had found out about YL oils years ago. Peppermint happens to be one of my favorites, it helps to clear the fogginess from my brain and helps me to &amp;#34;wake&amp;#34; from mid-morning slump. Love to rub on my tummy for digestion and put it in my tea. Great for headaches the rare times I get one.  I had hoped Eve Hansen oil would work, due to the price but in my case I had minimal reaction. I won&#x27;t order it again because it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately for the consumer, there is no regulation when someone says 100% Natural etc. YL oils work due to their stringent low -temperature, low- pressure distillation process. Try them and compare for yourself. You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I like this oil in my drinking water.  Only use one drop though.  Pretty strong!</li>
    <li> Great intense aroma delivered in a  drip bottle.</li>
    <li> Let me say I am writing my own review with a 100% my own opinion. No I haven&#x27;t been given this product for free I paid for it with my own money. Shipping was fast! It also arrived in great conditions considering the fact that the bottle is glass. No spills whatsoever. This peppermint oil is very strong. Don&#x27;t think that the peppermint oil is going to loose its strength just because you can smell it and feel like the fragrance is coming out. It&#x27;s just means that is that strong. No I did not use this product for keeping mice away or insects or such. Instead I used it for my scalp and hair which I mix with organic coconut oil. Just a couple of drops goes a long way. It is to keep your hair protected and also to stimulate your scalp to grow hair faster. I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple of months now so yeah I think I know it already. Keep in mind though this is my first purchase ever in peppermint oil or of.</li>
    <li> Strong scent, functioning dropper,  very high quality</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery and pleased with product</li>
    <li> Bottles are not completely airtight</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil had an overbearing chemical smell to it. Not a sweet minty scent like the kind I get at my local Savory Spice shop which is also 100% undiluted and organic. I ordered this here only b/c it was sold out at my local spice shop.</li>
    <li> I loveeeee it. Well packaged, ggreat costumer service and great smell. One drop goes a longg way</li>
    <li> At first, I was disappointed that the shipment did not come as expected but I have a change of heart after having the chance to sample the product.  I now can say I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the product and, I think, it does merit a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this size of bottle. I wish all of the oils came in this size of bottle. We use a large amount of peppermint and this is great.</li>
    <li> Really like.  Lots of ideas for household uses.</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 oz peppermint oil- I am a massage therapist and had previously always used thera-pro; howver I found this to be a better value. Also I appreciate the attractive bottle &amp; glass stem applicator is a plus. Great scent and potency- will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> i like fresh peppermint scent</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerfull, and one little bottle will last for years. 3 drops in your tea and any sinus problem will be cleared. A few drops on a napkin sitting next to your pillow will keep you clear all night. It apparently also keeps spiders and ants out of your house with a few drops by the openings to your dwelling. A wonder product.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product to try to keep mice out of my garage.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it did not get rid of the mice already in the garage.  But after catching several of the mice in the traps the mice quit coming in.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for headaches  (apply to temples) and sinuses.  Was treated to a sample of it at an expensive salon, but I found this product to be better (stronger) and much less expensive.</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil was very relaxing....</li>
    <li> Works on the mice for about 2-3 days. Have to reapply often. Nonetheless, smells incredible!</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil was exactly what I was looking for. I am very happy with my purchase. It is exactly as listed. Relaxing peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the peppermint oil! I do not think it is totally concentrated but I could be wrong. I would recommend that the top rubber piece that is connected to the stopper were firmer as I believe the oil leaks a bit between the rubber and the actual lid.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and easy. This is another great oil by Eve Hansen, her oils are great products. I use this particular oil in my hair oil, it has helped promote healthy hair growth by stimulating my scalp. You only need a little bit as this peppermint oil is very strong. Overall I am satisfied and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> wakes me up.  Permeates my house with fresh energy</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is an old fashioned remedy that is still needed in the 21st century!  Upset tummy, bad taste in mouth, tiny headache?  My beloved Grandmother would mix up peppermint water and so do I.  My order arrived in a timely manner and safely wrapped without over packaging.  Company did a great job for and made a returning customer.</li>
    <li> I like to use this oil for headaches and to keep spiders and other creepy crawly critters away. this oil also has a great scent and can be used for so many other great things.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it for almost everything.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil was received on time, with informative e mail about uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying my peppermint mocha coffee right now:)&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a perfect size too.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the peppermint oil.  At first you have to get use to the strong taste but it is pleasant and truly relieves any nausea you might have. I have my glass of water and a drop or two of peppermint oil every day before dinner to help ease the symptoms of colitis and it really seems to make a difference so far.  This vendor (Eve Hansen) gives an extraordinary support.  I truly recommend this product for any digestive problem you might have.  I will also definitely try a few drops of oil in my favorite shampoo and in my homemade cleaning product.  The bottle is quite big so will last a long time.  Thank You Eve for a great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I use it in my lotions for pain and I inhale it for my pain. It works. Also Iike to put a drop of it in my coffee.</li>
    <li> Works great for repelling ants.. After it rains we always get ants in a couple rooms of our house.  I put a few drops of this oil in a cup of water and sprayed it around where the ants were coming into the house.. the next day, no signs of ants at all.</li>
    <li> Works great in homemade toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive at first, as I am new to oils, but when this arrived, I put it in the diffuser (heated), and within moments my whole house was full of this powerful, rich, peppermint aroma.  My eyes are watering a little and my sinuses are so clear.  This oils is really wonderful, but be warned, its powerful !  Love it !</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and I am enjoying finding new ways of using it!</li>
    <li> love it will buy again thank u.</li>
    <li> Not pepperminty enough!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Concentrated and has a pure peppermint scent!  Also, the seller emailed me tips on how to get the most of the oil and provided service that I felt was above and beyond the usual seller service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first peppermint product so nothing to compare to, but I have no complaints about it. I like the i-dropper in the bottle. Would buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Very high quality extract, I bought this to repel fleas as my friends apartment is crawling with them and it seems to work well but I also tried a couple drops in some tea and it was very soothing to my stomach, in addition the company that made this cared enough to follow up my purchase with an e-mail to make sure I was satisfied with their product which is rare nowadays !</li>
    <li> Wow! What is there not to say about this extraordinary Peppermint. Came very quickly and packaged nicely. Love the taste as well as smell. Will be ordering again in the immediate. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Eve Hansen peppermint oil is the best oil I have ever used!!!!!</li>
    <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t smell or have qualities that I had hoped for. My peppermint oils from Edens Garden or DoTerra are better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with it!!! I make a nutella hot chocolate and and the peppermint essential oil to it. Pure deliciousness!!!! Great for IBS, menstrual cramps (yes, I said it), sinus isues, digestive tract... All you need is 2-3 drops- it&#x27;s very concentrated.  I love the smell and taste of peppermint. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived well packed and with a strong odor of, well, peppermint. My first thought was that it leaked, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. The included eye dropper was great. It was peppermint oil I wanted and a very good peppermint oil I got. Peppermint and other oils now in air tight rubber ringed jar, all in one place and a great melange fragrance when opening.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling oil!  Mine was leaking a little around the rubber dropper but it was very pleasant to open the package as a result!</li>
    <li> OMG, this product is HEAVEN in a bottle! I use it in my nasty tasting protein shake which taste like chocolate grass and sticks but now it tastes minty good. I also place two or three drops in my water. I had ants this morning and it worked on them! I also suffer from migraines so next time I get one, I&#x27;ll try it on my temples. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I love it! Rats hate it, Bought as a rate repellent</li>
    <li> The oil is very weak. I purchased another essential oil at the same time and the smell is much more strong, lasts longer, and is more pleasant. I will say that the packaging and shipment were nicely done.</li>
    <li> I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect; mixing it with water and using as a spray on the front of our house.  This makes a perfect repellent for the creepy-crawlies that invade the front of our house this time of year.  No more need to brush away the incessant cobwebs! YAY!</li>
    <li> I like the peppermint oil. I have had some mild relief for the bursitis in my hip. However, my skeptical husband who thinks this is all voodoo, has had GREAT results with it for his hip pain! Go figure!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Eve Hansen company. They sent the product out immediately and followed up with a helpful list of uses for the oil. I am impressed with this type of service and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend them and I will order through them again.</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint oil. However, the price said $21.95 when I selected it. But, once I got a confirmation,  I was charged $23.95. It took a while for me to get a confirmation showing what I ordered and the charge.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Hi good evening, Yes I did receive the peppermint oil and am enjoying it.  I put a few drops in my water at work in the morning and drink it throughout the day.  I think it might be a blood thinner though, because today I got a bad paper cut and my finger wouldn&#x27;t stop bleeding; it bled all day so had to put a band aid on it and when I took it off it still kept bleeding, but has finally stopped now.  That has never happened to me before so I was thinking the peppermint oil might have something to do with it.  Thank you for following up on my purchase! I pulled up you informational sheet also and will print it out and read it; looked very interesting! Thanks again! Carla&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is the second time I ordered from us. I love it. I use it in my coffee, hot chocolate, foot soaks, diffusers, etc.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I started using a few drops of  Peppermint Oil in my Hydro Flosser as recommended by my dentist for oral health.  This oil beats anything I&#x27;ve found at the Health Food Store.  I love the taste and how clean it makes my mouth feel.  A definite winner!</li>
    <li> Much stronger than anything you can buy in a grocery store.  Peppermint mocha coffee ... mmmm!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, great product, my only regret is that Eve Hanson does not market clove oil, for that is a market that needs some quality competition .</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Does what it says.  Very rejuvenating.  And I very much appreciate the recommendation sheer the company sends along with the product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my aching shoulder muscles. Works perfectly. So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with my Peppermint Essential Oil. I needed a reasonably priced large bottle of oil to use in household sprays. My Linen closet smells divine from when I sprayed some two weeks ago. The rest of the house smells fabulous as well. My son makes me spray some on him before he heads off to school. Delievery was quick and everything was as advertised.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The Lemon Oil arrived yesterday and it smells wonderful. I am looking for fresh fragrances and truth be known, I am trying to mimic Bath and Body Works &amp;#34;Kitchen Lemon&amp;#34; Scent. I will probably be using some in some lip balm I am making tomorrow. I never thought to add it to drinking water, but thanks for the tips.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> took right care of the spiders in my basement...thanks...I am scared to death of spiders</li>
    <li> Came back for a new bottle. This was my very first purchase from Eve Hanson, have been very impressed and keep coming back. I use this oil for so many things.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to everyone it is very good for price</li>
    <li> Love this peppermint oil.  Arrived very fast from seller. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product earns such ranking with its excellent quality and multiple uses. One drop goes a very long way and I plan to order more as gifts to friends and family. Perfect summer refreshing cool sensation.  Very pleased with value, packaging, quality and amount of product for the price.</li>
    <li> Quality peppermint oil, great viscosity and power of scent. Will certainly buy from again</li>
    <li> Good price and very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Peppermint oil is my most used oil and I tend to go through it very quickly. This bottle  is big enough to last a couple months and the quality is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Mentha Arvenisis is cornmint.&lt;br /&gt;Mentha piperita is peppermint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has the botanical name listed as Mentha Arvenisis, which is corn mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;CornMint (Mentha arvensis) also known as wild mint or field mint has six subspecies, is native to the cooler areas of Europe, Asia, eastern Siberia and also North America. It is a herbaceous perennial growing up to 60 cm in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are simple hairy and broad. The flowers are pale purple in color and sometimes white or pink. The herb is grown mainly for the extraction of menthol and the production of oil. The menthol that is extracted from this plant is extensively used in the confectionery, food and beverage industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main countries producing wild mint are China, India, Brazil, Argentina and Vietnam. The plant has been adopted both as a medicinal herb as well as a flavoring agent for food in many different cuisines around the world. The Aroma is extracted to produce everything from soap to chewing gum. One of the reasons for its commercial value is because it is relatively cheaper to produce than its close cousin peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extraction Methods:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mint oil is obtained from the flowering tops using the steam distillation process and is usually a solid before the main component, menthol, is extracted using the freezing method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characteristics and principal constituents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cornmint Essential oil is very high in menthol levels, being its main constituents menthyl acetate and menthol. It is high in free alcohols, ketones, menthone, isomenthone, esters and limonene. It has a fresh and strong aroma mildly bittersweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn Mint essential oil is put into practice to treat rheumatic pain, neuralgia, toothache, indigestion, laryngitis, and bronchitis. It is also an accepted treatment for tumors, earache and certain types of skin conditions and has been found to be very useful for the treatment of strains, sprains and bruises, ringworm, scabies and muscular pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is considered to have a positive effect on the nervous system, as it can act as a sedative and regulator. Due to its antibacterial and antiseptic properties it can be used to treat swollen gums, mouth ulcers and to alleviate toothaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is applied extensively in the cosmetics and body care industry to make everything from soaps, toothpaste and detergents, to industrial perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn mint essential oil blends well with Eucalyptus, Clary Sage, Lemon, Lavender, Peppermint, Marjoram, Spearmint and Rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cautions: Corn mint essential oil is non toxic oil but may cause skin irritation in some people. Its use should be avoided during pregnancy. Large amounts of Menthol are found in this oil. Mint essential oils that contain large quantities of menthol often carry cautions for use. A small amount of essential oil, used correctly and safely, should not cause fatal toxicity, as large amounts of menthol must be consumed before toxicity becomes a major problem. However, there are some groups of people that should take extra caution when using essential oils that contain menthol.&amp;#34;to be very useful for the treatment of strains, sprains and bruises, ringworm, scabies and muscular pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is considered to have a positive effect on the nervous system, as it can act as a sedative and regulator.

    <li> Very strong scent which is nice.  Bought it for headaches and tried it several ways, in humidifer, on temples, and drank in water and headache doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make homemade insect repellant and so far it&#x27;s great! Quantity and quality! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> works to repeal spiders!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I am able to breathe so much better and there are so many uses for it.: )</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product taste great smells wonderful for aromatherapy keeps the fleas away from my cats what can I say it does amazing things the quality of the product and the quantity for the price is absolutely amazing..</li>
    <li> Superior, pure peppermint oil. It blends easily with a base oil. It is soothing. The dropper is a big help with measuring the exact or almost exact amount needed each time. The oil and dropper were very well packaged. One more thing, the properties of this oil are long lasting and that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
    <li> use drops to make trash cans smell good</li>
    <li> I ordered this to see if it would help get ride of moles in the yard, mice in the house and spiders. So far, the moles are gone, we had no mice come in this spring ( first time in 5 years, no mice ) and I&#x27;m waiting to use it on the infusion of spiders we get in the summer. Although the sent is very strong at first it is nice and dissipates rather quickly. Thanks, great product.</li>
    <li> Smelled disgusting and had to be returned.  I prefer the DoTerra Blend.</li>
    <li> Great! Large glass bottle, with glass eye dropper. Appears to be good quality oil (I just received it). Great company to works with.</li>
    <li> Love it smells great. Good concentration for the price. My hair loves it</li>
    <li> smells good does what it should</li>
    <li> I use this for making my chocolate mint lip balm and bar lotions.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Great transaction!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  So many uses for it.  It was delivered as stated, in excellent condition.  Will order from this vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your commitment to excellence.</li>
    <li> Very strong peppermint flavor with only a few drops</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The oil is excellent.  I use it for homemade organic insect repellant.  I’ve also applied it to cotton balls and place them in nooks in this travel trailer and have no more mice or bug incursions.  It also repels gophers with just a few drops in their tunnel.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> You get so much for your money here. This stuff is strong, you barely need any of it. I love that it comes with a dropper, too! Super helpful for making perfumes! I also put it on my temples and nape of my neck when i want to relax. Really nice packaging too, the label is really nice.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;its a great product and I&#x27;m happy with the quality and variety of uses.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This has really helped my migraines!</li>
    <li> Have used it before and still love the results.</li>
    <li> This oil is just WONDERFUL!!  You only need a small amount (follow directions on bottle please) to add a refreshing fragrance to your entire home. I also use it to repel pests and insects out of my garage (spiders/beetle bugs/mice/moths/other insects) and keep them away from my trash cans. No problems with this since I started using the Peppermint Oil.  I live near the woods where mice and spiders can be a problem when I do not use this Peppermint Oil.  So far, the Peppermint Oil is one of the best products I have purchased in years for my home.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cure for heart burn, acid reflux, GERD and esphosgal spasms.  I couldn&#x27;t even take a sip of water without having trouble. Someone suggested peppermint oil and boy did it do the trick!!  I now put two drops in a bottle of water and drink at least two of them a day.  Best thing ever!!  I can now sleep all night without being woken up with acid rolling up into my throat.  I was also having trouble with my food getting stuck half way down to my stomach.  It was to the point where I was not eating much solid.  Within two days of the peppermint oil, it is 90% gone!  So happy for this good quality oil!</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil is the strength and quality I was hoping it would be and it arrived quickly..</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time, with a nice bubble rapper. The product itself has a very nice smell. I use it to spray around the house and close and stuff. Now depends on how much you apply to the bottle and mix it with water determines how strong the smell is I like it stronger then normal. I would buy this agin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but there are cheaper products available at the same quality.</li>
    <li> Originally, I accidentally ordered this product.  When I received it, I thought to myself left me give it try.  I glad I tried the product and did not return it.  I love the way peppermint smells.  I will be ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this oil. It arrived very well packaged and got here early. This is not some weak diluted knock off oil. The fragrance is powerful. The price is more than fair for this quality oil.</li>
    <li> I guess it has been 6 months since I ordered your peppermint oil as a means of keeping mice away. I shall jump to the punch line. I&#x27;ve not seen one since! I&#x27;ve got to tell you that when I received my bottle of peppermint oil, it was wrapped in plastic. Before I took off the plastic, (it may have been bubble wrap) I was very surprised at how strong the scent was. I made little tin foil holders for holding cotton on which I put a couple drops of the oil. I put one in each kitchen drawer. One drawer in particular where mice had visited, I lined with paper towels then put in my stuff after I put my little tin foil that held the peppermint scent. What I found  fascinating was that I could tell that a mouse had come to visit but upon smelling the oil, he made a very quick exit! He left a little &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34; on the paper towel so I knew he had tried to enter. In 6 months, I have not added any more oil and still have not seen any mice! Hurrah! I live on a farm and this Fall when crops are cut, I will spread my oil around some more. Thank you!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS GREAT. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
    <li> It has many uses very happy with this product and the arrival was prompt!  Plus we were sent a follow up with its uses.</li>
    <li> Oil works great! It does just what it says.</li>
    <li> The peppermint flavor is very nice an strong but not overwhelming..., I put drops on my temples and rubbed it in...it last a long time and i feel very relax.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with a tooth that made my jaw &amp; ear ache. It seemed to feel better when I rubbed peppermint oil on that area. And peppermint is not an offensive smell either!</li>
    <li> the peppermint oil did not work for my mouse problem, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this o use to settle my stomach.  It is VERY strong in smell and taste, but definitely works.  I either put 2 drops in my tea or water.  Any more is too much.  It  definitely helps settle the stomach.  One bottle will last forever.  I&#x27;ve since bought a second for my Mother Jo also has a sensitive stomach.  Well packaged and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This oil is of very good quality. It has a strong aroma that serves well for aroma therapy and other medicinal purposes.</li>
    <li> Great for stomach &amp; bathing</li>
    <li> Definitely works for sinus and headaches.  Put some on cotton pads and place them throughout the house, love the smell when I come in the door.   UPDATE: I put a drop on tongue add warm water, use as a mouth wash this will open your head, release any plaque built up you may have, keeps your breathe fresh, then proceed with normal teeth and mouth hygiene. This works for me may not work for everyone but sharing my additional found uses.</li>
    <li> Just received my Peppermint Essential Oil in the mail today.  Well packaged.  It arrived a week earlier than expected.  It&#x27;s just the kind of fast service I need.  I am a very happy lady.  It is the best.  I do mean top of the line.  I put 1 drop in my cup of green tea and believe me, that&#x27;s all I needed.  I gave my man a a back facial, and a neck, shoulder, hand and arm massage after diluting with a carrier oil of course and he said  not only was soothing and refreshing but it also helped him to breath better.  It even made my hands feel good after massaging someone else.  I&#x27;m in love with the product.  Perfect for my clients.  I am an Aesthetician and I can&#x27;t wait to put it to good use in more ways than one.  I&#x27;d just like to know, does it have to be refrigerated and what is the expiration date?  Thank you ever so much Eve Hansen. #Permanent Customer</li>
    <li> It is great and I am using it in a spray bottle to keep the spiders away on the porch.  Would deal with them again.</li>
    <li> It is being used for its natural first aid uses also I have a defuser I put a couple of drops in leaving the whole house smelling fresh. Love it as a natural product</li>
    <li> Huge bottle. Many uses that will come in handy for bugs, spiders, rodents and personal care. Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Used this right away.  I put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and use it to spray certain areas inside and outside my home for spiders and hopefully deter mice.</li>
    <li> My main use for peppermint oil is to keep raccoons away from the garbage.  I sprinkle some on the bag after I put it outside.  It works.  There is no mess to clean up in the morning!</li>
    <li> My carpet was so nasty from my puppy having accidents. My house smelled of urine. I put a few drops in my carpet shampooer with the cleaner. My daughter, who had complained about the smell continuously, walked into the family room and immediately said it smelled so good. My husband commented about the nice aroma (shocking!). I&#x27;m looking forward to using this oil for many other purposes.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend it as an inexpensive alternative to doTerra.</li>
    <li> Very good and long lasting smell. Worked well as car air freshener as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil!  We were using it to deter a little mouse - and it worked!!!  But the oil is so lovely, I&#x27;ve been using the balance in baths - thank so so much!!!!  (PS - the size is huge!  Totally worth it!!!)</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of mice. Mice that keep out smarting every trap I have tried to use. Even the ultra sonic sound things didn&#x27;t work but they sure did annoy me.  Any way I received this yesterday and I have not even opened the bottle yet as you can smell it with out it open and boy is it strong. I also have not seen or even heard a mouse since yesterday after putting this bottle still shut in the middle of the house.</li>
    <li> I got this originally to avoid spiders in my room but I used aroud  all the house to enjoy the smell</li>
    <li> Love this oil! High quality oil in a large 4oz bottle. Super fast delivery:-)</li>
    <li> Great product, awesome customer service!Definitely will buy again from them.</li>
    <li> Super service and great product. I just put the bottle in a corner where I had the possibility of mice coming in and I haven&#x27;t seen any droppings since. I haven&#x27;t even started spreading it around the other rooms I thought I saw droppings. If it works this good just from the fragrance of the bottle can&#x27;t wait till I take it out and put it to its full usage.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Love it and now looking to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> It smells really good but did not help deter mice. I have found use for the peppermint oil for my vacuum. I drop oil on a cotton ball and vacuum the cotton ball up. The whole house spells good while and after vacuuming.</li>
    <li> works  very well love it</li>
    <li> Great, stong peppermint scent!</li>
    <li> The service was prompt and professional. The product was exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Seller contacted me to give me helpful information about ways to use oil.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very strong and is a great price for the amount you get!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product...very pepperminty!!! I immediately mixed some with a little water and sprayed it around the corners where the spiders like to hide...so far, so good...I&#x27;m going to respray in a week, just in case. The house smells minty clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;The oil was safely wrapped in bubble wrap before placing in box with other item and more safety material.&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived right on time. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this seller!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smell good,  but haven&#x27;t use it yet</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure if it is repelling the mice, but it does make my apartment smell good.</li>
    <li> poor quality, definitely not pure, there&#x27;s something else in it, i think it&#x27;s diluted. if it were pure 1 drop would go longer than this does and not have any reactions.</li>
    <li> Has helped my stomach already. Only been using it 2 weeks. I drink a few drops each morning in water. Love this stuff! I don&#x27;t get indigestion anymore.</li>
    <li> Love it, my house smells great, and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I purchased this peppermint oil to massage onto my scalp periodically to eliminate itching particularly in the colder months when the air is more dry.  I add it to johoba oil along with other beneficial hair oils so it is not too potent.  It smells wonderful-- a nice peppermint bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived very fast. It was packaged exceptionally well--very professional. I would easily deal with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Very strong! Apparently they also repel fleas etc on your dog. I put some in our sun room, haven&#x27;t see a spider yet. Just put a drop as it is very strong. I love it.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is a great insect repellant.  I really don&#x27;t like using the chemicals in the commercial mosquito repellants.  I use this mixed with some alcohol and water around my baseboards to keep the spiders away.  Since it&#x27;s a food grade oil, I don&#x27;t worry about spraying it on myself when I go out into the yard or down the trail into the woods.</li>
    <li> Smell is strong and amazing got so many complments and saw the first spider 45 days after this was all gone so wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as a diffuser oil and love it.  Was a little potent at first until I got used to it but now I really like it.  I like this seller. After my first purchase I was contacted by the seller to be sure I was happy with my purchase, etc and with suggestions on uses for the Peppermint Oil. I thought that was nice. Then I received another email a couple of weeks ago with a coupon for money off of my next purchase. Great company that cares if they have repeat business!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for head aches, but I was surprised by the extra benefits. Since taking the oil I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve been less stressed out and my mood is overall much better. Would definitely recommend this product, A+.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it....  Never knew all the uses....</li>
    <li> Very nice peppermint oil.  I was looking for one to use in recipes and this works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great quality, pure, love it in the steam room.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last week based on Amazon reviews. It came in 5 days, much to my delight! It smells amazing, just as the customers have said! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer here! :)</li>
    <li> The aroma was strong and lasted for days after just using a few drops. My children and I said on a few occasions that it seems to open up our air passages. I found it to also eliminate other odors in bathroom. You don&#x27;t need to use much, a few drops do the trick. Researching what other uses this product has in store. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This seller is awesome. She follows up with everything, including tips on various ways to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is very satisfactory. Although skeptical at first, I am now a firm believer that THIS product WORKS!</li>
    <li> I love it there are so many uses for this product its amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> The first bottle I received had a broken stopper. After reporting it, Eve Hansen sent another; and checked all that batch so as to avoid more problems. Their followup is exemplary.</li>
    <li> I have tried this before it works perfectly fof refreshing have not seen a mouse sence i started using it.</li>
    <li> It is such a nice size and the fragrance is wonderful. I am using it to keep mice away from my building in the back of the property. It does seem to be working a lot better. then without it,</li>
    <li> Used it very satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a minor ant problem in my house and didn&#x27;t want to spray toxic Raid everywhere, since I have a cat. It worked like magic! All the ants left, and my place smells great like a pack of Altoids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for massaging the temples for stress relief. Great multipurpose product!</li>
    <li> I use this product when I winterize my RV to keep the mice out.  Mice hate the smell of peppermint but I love it.  The product was exactly as described.  Packaging was excellent with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> We love this product!  Took it to the countryside as a natural spider and rodent deterrant.  It worked!</li>
    <li> not what I expected too strong</li>
    <li> I have 2 other oils by this company and I am never disappointed. Great quality, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is only one bottle, not three like in the picture</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mainly for mice repellent.  I live in the country and would get one or two mice in the house and really wanted something to prevent this.  I put the peppermint oil on a cotton ball and put one on each heater vent (since that is where the mice was coming in).  Now, instead of one or two mice, I have had about 11 mice so far this year.  Seems to attract them more than  anything else.  Did help a bit with the spiders.</li>
    <li> Works great, and is not like the other cheaper brands out there. Mom is currently utilizing this for her IBS and has seen major results with just a few doses.  I am following suit and taking it as well and can see the results already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effect of this product is i have great long lasting fresh minty breath!</li>
    <li> I purchased the oil initially to repel spiders &amp; also for its medicinal use for migraines. I was skeptical at first but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in spiders &amp; I&#x27;m amazed to say that it actually worked in preventing my migraine from spiraling into a full blown &amp;#34;confined to bed migraine&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t have to take my Imitrex. I will say a little oil goes a long way. I only put a drop on my fingers and applied to temples and the pressure point between the thumb &amp; index finger. We will be purchasing another bottle. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice peppermint oil! It smells so nice. I purchased it because I read where it can help with mice. We had one in the garage but I ended up catching him with a no kill trap and then releasing him elsewhere. I did end up putting some on cotton balls and placing around the house to freshen things up. The whole house smelled like peppermint for a few days which was nice. I will have to look for other uses for it because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Strong peppermint smell. Haven&#x27;t used it to ward off mice or spiders as winter has arrived.</li>
    <li> VERY strong! The scent is perfect and the oil is not diluted. I use it for general room fragrance in a wax warmer, and a few drops lasts for days.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is so beneficial for you! I put a few drops in a cute box and put it on my desk at work... And when I am feeling stressed I just open the box and it really calms me down. I love my peppermint oil!!</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle of high quality peppermint oil which i bought for help with migraines.  The seller later e-mailed me different ideas for other uses.  Will be ordering again (if I ever run out)!</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times since purchasing it.  I used it to make Mint Ice Cream.  It worked perfectly.  I only needed 5 drops and it was plenty minty.  I have tried it in water to help my stomach, it did help some.  The mint floats on top of the water, so try not to get it on your lips when drinking it.  It&#x27;s pretty intense.  A few drops on a q-tip, rub on your temples to help ease a headache, very nice for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came well packed, although the first bottle had leaked because the dropper was in the bottle when it was sent.  But, they sent a new bottle to replace the first one right away.  They were so nice about the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Plan to order more soon!</li>
    <li> I received the Peppermint Oil very quickly and already have used it in my office.  The smell is great.  I plan on using it in my work vehicle also.  Thank you for the emails regarding my opinion of this product.  I will be sure to add more when I have used it for a month or two.</li>
    <li> Great buy. The aroma is very strong, I could smell it through the cardboard box. Works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> Product well wrapped in bubble wrap for shipping, nice strong smell</li>
    <li> I wasn’t sure what Peppermint Oil was good for, but when I was reading this can of bug spray that I purchased, I realized that it was mainly peppermint oil! I immediately picked this up and am completely impressed how well it works for not only getting rid of fleas, and ants, but for mood and relaxation. I wasn’t sure what to expect out of a 100% extract, but it’s impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell anyways, but this amps it up to a whole new level. I spread it around the house and it has not only given the home a very unique and clean smell, but the ants that were coming in are now gone. I read a bit more into the uses of this oil and am excited to try and use it with other options. As far as aromatherapy, antibacterial, and ant repellent qualities, I can testify to the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is that, 4 ounces a lot more than I realized. I thought it was going to be a tiny bottle, but nope, this was substantial and will last a while. I’m fully impressed, and recommend this to anyone that is looking for a natural oil.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quality and the price of this oil. Its extremely pure and strong. I received it very promptly as well. I would recommend purchasing this!</li>
    <li> way too strong and not a big difference in spiders</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality, fast delivery. I think it was also great service to&lt;br /&gt;receive an e-mail from the seller with tips on the many uses of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will always buy from Eve Hansen for similar products. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Although not using it for homeopathic or health reasons, it is proving very useful as a rodent deterrent around the garage and workshop. I use a couple of drops placed of the carpeting of some stored automobiles and have yet to see an issue.</li>
    <li> I love to use this for the smell around the house.  It is also a great deterrent for mice - put a couple drops on a cotton ball and use it to repel them.</li>
    <li> My small ant problem was solved by saturating cotton balls with peppermint oil and leaving them where I had found some ants.  I also placed some saturated cotton balls in my car; the peppermint aroma has helped to keep me alert when I am driving.  I am sure that I will find other wonderful ways to use this oil.</li>
    <li> I use to keep squirrels out of my trucks engine compartment.  So far it has worked well.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Wish it came with a list of all it&#x27;s uses.</li>
    <li> On time delivery, strong scent even before unwrapping plastic bubble wrap and received with plastic seal and no leakage, which I thought occurred because of strong smell. Used for aromatherapy and use less than usual.</li>
    <li> Every bit as great as the tiny little bottle I used to get from my massage therapist that was much much more expensive.  I use this almost daily for muscle aches.  So much better smelling than other sore muscle creams.</li>
    <li> This crap doesn&#x27;t work. I bought it to get rid of the mice and it does not work! I still  have mice and it been almost a month. Waste of my damn money</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is truly potent, much MUCH better than the doterra brand i have been using for the past year. I highly recommend this. I use about 5 drops for my hands daily for the past month, and it is still more than 3/4 of the bottle left!!</li>
    <li> After using my neti pot in the winter to soothe dry nasal areas, I put one drop of peppermint oil in a ceramic pot of boiling water with which I make tea. Before adding the tea bags, I lean over to inhale the peppermint rising with the steam. Please be careful not to get too full a dose. The inhalation perks me up amazingly. Who needs coffee when they have peppermint? Refreshing and fun and magic. I love it. I have not tried it topically yet, except to inhale from my fingertips which is too concentrated, not diffuse enough to get the marvelous steam effect.&lt;br /&gt;Then I add the tea bags and make my tea. So far, no bad effects from ingesting the peppermint, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of digestive problems.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the peppermint aroma. VERY strong. I&#x27;m comparing the smell to my doterra peppermint and its completely different. Depending on what you use it for it may work for you. I didn t like the taste when added to my drinking water. Lots of oil for price.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product quality &amp; quantity</li>
    <li> The Real Deal - Period. Strong, potent Peppermint oil in a LARGE bottle. Do not hesitate if this is what you are looking for. Great value for what you get.</li>
    <li> Used it to repel ants from the kitchen counter (can&#x27;t see how they are getting in) as I read that this would work but was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to repelling them the diluted spray also killed them when the spray hit them.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and very minty. I could smell it right through the bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean and to keep mice out of my apartment. It works.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. It has a natural smell, and can release my headache. Also, it is awesome for household uses.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle and love it! Great quality for reasonable price. Eve is very professional in sending email assuring satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m very into essential oils and this one is top notch. I&#x27;ve bought several types of peppermint and they all just didn&#x27;t taste as I thought they should. This one on the other hand tastes as it should. The dropper is perfect.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  However was disappointed as the dropper was either defective or rotting, expelling the strong fumes.  Must put it in a double zip lock bag because of the fumes.</li>
    <li> Great Product... Use as directed and watch all the creepy crawlers disappear...</li>
    <li> Great product. Great value. Excellent shipping. It was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This was a VERY good product. I would definitely recommend this seller to others.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it to keep the spiders out. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I tried it for spiders just in case it might do something.  the spiders were showing up on the kitchen counter and I hated the thought of chemicals there.  Lo and behold it worked.  It took about a week and I had to leave enough out so we could small it too.  I found the smell totally pleasant , but I love mint.  My husband thought it was strong, but was happy to go with the flow if the spiders went away.</li>
    <li> I love peppermint oil. I use it for headache relief and it works really well. Ibuprofen and other OTC pills were just not cutting it for me at all, and sometimes seemed to make my headaches worse!&lt;br /&gt;I really like having a natural alternative to pills and medications.&lt;br /&gt; This is a great deal for a good sized bottle! Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!! Great for pain relief!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;Significant reduce the amount of ants!</li>
    <li> Peppermint Oil has been a favorite remedy of mine specifically for for headaches and stiff neck for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and for the price, quantity and quality I highly recommend this brand.  Love this product!  Excellent customer service!!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use as a natural pest repellent (ants, mice, gnats). It was delivered promptly and packaged well. The peppermint scent is STRONG even with the dropper cap screwed tightly. You will only need to use a drop or two for your purposes. I&#x27;d suggest storing it in a closed cabinet if you are sensitive to the scent. As for my purposes,  I have noticed a slight decrease in pest activity. I also plan to use it for aromatherapy, refreshing trash bins, and to mix with other oils for a hair conditioner or tonic. I really like this product and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this peppermint oil to help repel pests and bugs in our new home in Kansas. I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks now and it has prevented any sequels to Arachnophobia from being filmed in our home... so I guess that is good!:)</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality  Peppermint Oil and I will definitely buy it again as needed!  It smells terrific! I make facial and body spritz with it and distilled water.  It&#x27;s a good value for the size and purity!</li>
    <li> Bought for spider repellant seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> We received the peppermint oil in a couple of days, it was well packaged. The product is great and we use it for DIY household cleaning solutions as an added fragrance. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> as advertised amazing and incredible</li>
    <li> Just a drop or two and a drink of water does wonder for relieving indigestion or mild nausea!  A drop on the back of the hand  and breathe in...... helps with sinus or migraine headache.  So many uses for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be pure peppermint oil, but something mixed in with it.  I couldn&#x27;t not tolerate the smell.  On the upside it&#x27;s a generous size bottle, but won&#x27;t do me any good, triggers more migraines cause of that other scent I am smelling other then the peppermint.  I&#x27;ll stick with the stuff I buy at my local nature store..</li>
    <li> Pleasant to smell and clear the air.</li>
    <li> Peppermint Oil is an excellent purchase, it is pure and has many uses. In fact I wasn&#x27;t aware of all the excellent uses it does have until I purchased from Eve Hansen.  You will receive a list of ways to utilize this oil that makes it a wonderful item to have around the house. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt reply from seller</li>
    <li> Great deal on some great peppermint oil,,,,,!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased peppermint oil to help get rid of new car smell. It has lessened the odor and is not an overbearing odor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is a wonder smell, it&#x27;s quite soothing. I must say at first I was a bit skeptical at first. However, my skepticism went away rapidly. The Peppermint Oil is wondrous, I could smell the essential oils aroma even with the plastic wrap on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING seller!  They immediately got in touch with me to acknowledge my purchase, and checked back a week later to make sure I loved it. They even gave me tips on ways to use the oil.  I bought it specifically to chase away spiders and other pests, I mixed some of the oil in a spray bottle of water and doused my home in it... haven&#x27;t seen a spider since!!  I&#x27;ve also found this is really great for clearing sinuses.</li>
    <li> very good product, appreciate receiving dropper top with it. shipped fast. will purchase again</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is STRONG. I used it for a headache last night, which was soon gone.</li>
    <li> I add this oil to my shampoo and it makes my scalp tingle and it smells amazing- you can also add it to you bath water! Love it!</li>
    <li> This comes with a separate dropper and I really appreciate the attention to detail. Smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Received on time.  Very large bottle, love the dispenser/lid.  Using it to keep mice out of our new travel trailer.  Will see what happens!</li>
    <li> The oil arrived in a timely manner, packed well with its droplet top and has a strong smell. I mixed some in some latex paint and painted the outside of my home and shop and it does seem to be keeping insects away plus I smell that peppermint smell when coming outside.&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil for headaches and for oil pulling in the morning to rinse my mouth.  It also helps to alleviate itching that I experienced due to dry skin. I put a couple of drops on my palms and just smell the aroma to help clear breathing when I have a cold. There are other plenty of benefits from peppermint oil and I&#x27;m sure that people will enjoy this product.  Saves money as well and keeps you healthy by not taking OTC medication for headaches that could damage your liver.</li>
    <li> LOVE the big bottle and the medicine dropper cap!</li>
    <li> great stuff will order again.</li>
    <li> awesome quality essential oil!...the price is even better!&lt;br /&gt;liked the peppermint so much had to order the lemon as well.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT LIKE THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> Great product will be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> Great oil...smells wonderful, fantastic quality!  Large bottle, good value...will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for mice and spiders!  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I like it but wish it lasted longer...I drop it on pieces of cotton and leave them as sachets to scent closets etc but also to keep bugs away. Seems to be working. I also put drops on little dishes around the house to scent the house. It is strong but not overwhelming and I need to keep replenishing...</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought to help control spiders in house, not fully tested yet, smells nice though!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived well-protected and so far, I have enjoyed using it, and will definitely re-order when I run out.</li>
    <li> Got my order in only 3 days. Large bottle. Only takes one or two drops in my h2eo diffuser. Will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have read much about the benefits of peppermint oil. My daughter-in-law uses it for tensions spots when she gets migraines. My husband uses it for sore muscles. I do the same. We both love the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the smell. It&#x27;s very strong, which is good, but it smells like a menthol cough drop and acetone. I wouldn&#x27;t have recognized it as peppermint if it didn&#x27;t say so on the label. I previously bought a smaller bottle of a different brand and the fragrance was amazing and very soothing. Then I bought a larger bottle of that same brand, but it smells kind of like turpentine with a hint of peppermint. So I decided to try this Eve Hansen brand. I wish I could find some like the first that I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see on the label that this brand is called mentha arvensis. The other brand I tried is called mentha piperita. When I looked up mentha piperita on Wikipedia it redirected to the article about peppermint, which says mentha piperita is the binomial name for peppermint. When I looked up mentha arvensis the article by that name referred to field mint, wild mint and corn mint, but never mentioned peppermint. An article on Boston University&#x27;s web site calls mentha arvensis Brookmint and refers to peppermint as its \\&quot;popular relative\\&quot;. Does anyone know more about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum 20 December 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the comments for additional information about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the item I ordered turned out to not be what I wanted (Mentha arvensis instead of Mentha piperita), it is what I ordered, it was nicely packaged, and it arrived sooner than I expected. Also the reviews by people who bought this oil are overwhelmingly positive, which says something about its quality. All very good. Even though it&#x27;s not suitable for my intended use I&#x27;m not returning it because I like it and want to use it for something else. Considering the seller&#x27;s prompt service, polite responses to the few critical reviews, and their offer to refund the purchase price if you&#x27;re not satisfied, I would feel confident ordering from them again if they are selling something that I want.</li>
    <li> I made the purchase, fair price  and arrived when and as expected.  It&#x27;s recommended to use in a diluted water solution in a spray bottle. We have had a recent problem with ants. I sprayed the sills etc. I haven&#x27;t seen any more ants! Peppermint is also helpful with nausea which is lucky since being sick. Not only did it help with nausea,  it helped with my head congestion!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and follow up with tips using peppermint oil, great tips!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make insect repellant spray.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I can say that the product is exactly as described.  It&#x27;s very strong too.  I could smell it before I opened the box.</li>
    <li> We were having issues with mice and this really worked....and the house smells like a spa.</li>
    <li> Love this peppermint oil! I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I got it several weeks ago. I use it in my aromatherapy diffuser and I also add a few drops of eucalyptus and sometimes a few drops of grapefruit or sweet orange together. It makes my room smell heavenly! I also use a few drops with unscented body oil which is a great morning pick up. Altogether, I feel this trio is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!  SO many uses!</li>
    <li> great quality product, I put drops around my garage to keep out mice, and so far no evidence of any coming in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Peppermint, what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!!  Works well in my large humidifier &amp; makes the whole house smell great.  Will definitely buy again &amp; will use in many different ways as I explore the benefits of essential oils &amp; their many uses for health &amp; wellness.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is of the highest quality, steam distilled from the leaves and stems of Japanese wild mint (Mentha arvensis).  It is crystal clear and has an intense, pure aroma that makes it a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil contains a high concentration of menthol, which creates a cooling sensation and reduces pain and itching better than many commercial products.  Even  few drops added to a carrier oil is very helpful for dry, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also used in aromatherapy and may be helpful for digestive problems.  It has an appealing flavor and scent and can be used as a natural air freshener.  It is often used as an inhalant for stuffy noses and I find the scent helpful for nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous 4 oz. (120 ml) amber glass bottle protects the oil from light and the cap has a convenient glass dropper.  The clean design of the pale green label reflects the purity of the contents and reminds me of an apothecary or spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Hansen provided a bottle of peppermint oil for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I plan to reorder more of this! It smells SO much better than doTerra&#x27;s product. Great price! Really love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have been fighting moles in my front yard for years, spent a fortune on methods of eradication, and hours of my time going after the little ()*&amp;&amp;^&amp;&amp;(&amp;^). I got the idea that if peppermint oil annoys spiders ants and other undesirables, I wonder if it would irritate the delicate olfactory equipment the moles have. WOW!! I sprinkled the oil around the edge of the yard and around and on any evidence of their existence. It rained shortly after doing this and within a week there was not one vestige of mole activity and this was over three months ago. NO MOLES. You REALLY need to advertise this product as a mole repellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this peppermint oil to go along with the vegetable juicing I am doing.  I have been adding 1-2 drops to my water bottles.  The flavor is great besides the health benefits.  The other day my wife mentioned she had a headache and after rubbing a drop into her temples the headache was gone in about 15 minutes.  The purity seems excellent  Overall I am very happy and will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Put some of this on the back side of a warm washcloth at night to help open my sinuses.  Also used it around the doors to discourage spiders.</li>
    <li> Lovely Peppermint Oil that we use so many different ways.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves a few drops of Peppermint in his bath; we use it in our diffuser as well.</li>
    <li> Great product in a easy to use container.</li>
    <li> My Experience with the seller was wonderful. I was contacted with thanks at the beginning and to confirm that I received the product at the end. The peppermint oil smells wonderful and while I don&#x27;t notice spiders fleeing for their very lives like I&#x27;d wished, I did notice they are far fewer in the places I have applied it. I&#x27;ll take it. :) Thank you Eve.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the huge bottle!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the price of this product. I have been told by multiple people how effective peppermint oil is.&lt;br /&gt;The seller even sent suggestions for use via e-mail.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but I guess I do like this product. Keeps all the spiders away here in Europe. Quality and price are pretty good. It is worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Accomplished exactly what I had hoped using your product. I diluted it with a carrier oil and applied it to stop my itching skin. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Will most likely purchase again from you in the future when it is time to replace the article.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I really like the large size and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Work very well for what I need it for. #1 RATED</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and always makes me feel better.</li>
    <li> This is so potent that I left it sit on the desk by my computer for a week before it was ever opened.  Every time I sat down the peppermint aroma greeted me.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the Peppermint Oil that I want explore other&lt;br /&gt;fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pure, fine and pungent quality!</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint oil and the service was great;)</li>
    <li> Started using it right away! Love the fact it has a dropper. :)&lt;br /&gt;Most bottles have to be carefully shaken.</li>
    <li> This is excellent quality oil and the dropper is fantastic.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase - thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased this oil for future use so I can&#x27;t rate it but as soon as I have a chance to use it you will hear from me if it rates lower than 5-stars.</li>
    <li> One of the best peppermint oil.  I love Eve Hansen products.  I will buy more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in order to prevent critters from entering my home...through the garage.  I contacted the vendor about the recommended mixture of water to oil, they promptly and courteously answered my question and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now...so far so good, no critters!  I also just had a head cold and the oil actually worked nicely to open my sinuses...just open the bottle and take a whiff!  LOL!  Great product and customer service.</li>
    <li> Love it and it really works. So far the mice it is working.</li>
    <li> This must definitely be the real stuff.....even before I broke the seal on the bottle, I could smell just a hint of peppermint! It&#x27;s wonderful! And just about the same time I received my order, I got an email from the seller with tips on using the peppermint oil. I really appreciated that. I look forward to all the ways I can benefit. Great product and Eve Hansen Beauty is a great seller!</li>
    <li> Great value and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I put the peppermint oil in my bath and it is relaxing. I have very dry skin and apply it to my legs, it keeps them from being dry without being sticky or greasy.  I also use it in a room freshener to keep spiders out of my house. It works great. I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
    <li> Arrived early. Undiluted peppermint oil , with glass dropper, so a little goes a long way.  Put 2 drops in my oil burner with a little water. Scent is still lingering. Must mix with a carrier oil before applying directly to skin.  Would recommend grapeseed or jojoba. This is a must have multipurpose product. Tried sellers hint and put 2 drops in my tea; very effective decongestant. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for Peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> Okay this is the most potent oil I have  to date. The smell is so great and it was strong  before i even open the bottle. It came fast and I use it for my itchy scalp. .soooooo soothing. The oil is very light weight and after 2-3 days i can still smell it in  my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the low affordable price. Everyone will love it!</li>
    <li> Had done a wonderful job keeping the spiders from building webs on the front door and screen door. I put drops of the oil on a cotton ball and pushed into each of the corners of the screen door. It is wonderful to go in and out without getting caught in webs</li>
    <li> I really bought it for critters in my outside shed  I don&#x27;t know if soaking cotton balls with peppermint oil helped but I will continue to do so every week just in case.  I do use it mixing it with water in my defuser  and it makes the room smell fresh and invigorating  I also want to put it in a spray bottle with water to keep spiders and ants from finding a home in my environment. Im very happy with my purchase and the delivery came so quickly  thanks again. CD</li>
    <li> Customer service was awesome and great price but beware the picture shows 3 separate bottles but product is only in one bottle.</li>
    <li> Love my peppermint! Love the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I was contacted by the seller to make sure I had received the product (I had!).&lt;br /&gt;I asked for suggested uses for the peppermint oil and was promptly sent several ideas..&lt;br /&gt;Everything was excellent. This vendor really knows customer service. The peppermint oil has many uses and smells great. It will last for many years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to repel mice that became a problem after a very cold winter.  I found it to be very effective, saturating cotton balls and replacing them every few days Because we have dogs we did not want anything toxic  .  A bonus benefit both my husband and self discovered is that it works wonders for sinus pain and congestion more effectively than decongestants and even eucalyptus oil with a much more pleasing scent.  Having read some of the many and varied uses for peppermint oil,I was intrigued by the suggestion that it is also effective in relieving migraine headache pain.  My husband suffers from severe migraines and has prescribed medication..  A couple days ago he was hit with one and had inadvertently forgotten to refill his prescription.  I told him to try the peppermint oil. He dabbed a little near his temple and experienced almost immediate relief.  A day later he felt one starting and immediately applied the oil again near his temple.  Using it quickly and pro-actively in the same manner medication use is suggested, apparently prevented the headache from escalating.  This particular product  comes in a pour bottle and includes an eye dropper as well.  The scent is very refreshing and pleasant.  I feel this is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Very pure peppermint oil. I just love using it. Customer service is also great. I recommend it to anyone who loves to use peppermint oil as part of their health needs.</li>
    <li> great peppermint oil, fair price</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My sister-in-law told me about this product when I went over to her house and had one of the worse headaches I have ever had.  She brought out her Peppermint Oil and placed a couple dabs on my temples and within seconds my headache disappeared.  It was amazing!</li>
    <li> Very good thing to have when your nose is stuffed.</li>
    <li> Excellent for everything!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, extraordinary communication, prompt shipping/delivery, and an exceptional product.  My husband keeps asking me to light a candle for the diffuser so he can enjoy the peppermint aroma.  This product also discourages the tiny bugs that slip through the screen!</li>
    <li> I use this for my leg cramps and headaches .  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very strong and a little expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice product! I really love the intense peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery, product exactly as described. High quality peppermint oil. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing, absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> I bought the Peppermint Oil to keep mice out of the mouse and so far so good!  The shipment arrived quickly and was packaged very well.  I like that the bottle has a dropper, it makes it so much easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for several uses.  I primarily use it myself to clear my sinuses.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use as air freshener and for two years as a mouse deterrent, put a few drops on cotton balls place in a jeep at mountain cabin no mice</li>
    <li> Fast service. Nice aroma. Makes my home seem more refreshing.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I find out that supermarket is cost less Than Amazon.</li>
    <li> I placed the oil in a spray bottle, sprayed my shed and barn and all roaches, mice, ants and spiders disappeared.  This stuff really works!!!!!</li>
    <li> When the Post Office failed to securely deliver the product, Eve Hansen sent us a second order. The product is great!</li>
    <li> Great product with many uses!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had ants and a mouse.  I dont like chemical sprays or traps and decided to give this a try.  The ants were so bad I had to hire professionals but I havent seen evidence of my mouse visitor since I started spraying this oil. I actually dont care if the oil got rid of the mouse or not, I enjoy the peppermint scent. I strongly recommend dealing with this seller.  Delivery was exceptionally fast. What I really appreciated was an email from the seller thanking me for my purchase and a list of uses for the product. Haven&#x27;t tried any yet, but I will. Meanwhile, I spray it on window sills and doorways to maybe keep out pests and definitely smell good.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil arrived quickly and was as I expected.  It is a nice large bottle with a convenient dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Peppermint oil for years and I love it.  It really helps me with my migraines.</li>
    <li> Quick service. Bought to help control mice. We are experiencing an abnormally high population of them this year. Unusual warm winter for interior Alaska past season maybe part of the problem. Just want them to move away. No poison, no traps, just move away.</li>
    <li> Use for my daughters gerd. A little strong but works great. Also works will in humidifier.</li>
    <li> WOW, WOW, WOW!!!  This stuff is POWERFUL!!!  &#x3D;o)  I got it, opened it, smelled it, put the lid back on (TIGHT) and can still smell it every time I get close to my kitchen!  GET IT!</li>
    <li> Large bottle, was as good as advertised, shuld last a long time..</li>
    <li> Well pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated, pleasantly smelling oil.  The seller was very helpful by sending  advices on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Really loved the product. Great uses.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was excellent to deal with. Shipped very secure and ultra fast. AAA+++</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong.  I bought it mainly to use as a bug repellent for a trip to Hawaii and as a spider repellent for a trip to a place in Las Vegas that has wolf spiders.  So far, the oil has worked very well in buggy Hawaii  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to encourage the mice in our house to go elsewhere, and it seems to have worked. We used cotton balls saturated with peppermint oil and steel wool in their favorite openings.</li>
    <li> I have not seen nearly as many spiders since I got this, and want to put some just under the front door to avoid getting any mice, I have never seen any in my apartment here, but I do not want to either. My daughter is interested in this product also so I want to take it with me when I go see her. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell but &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;, nothing artificial here!  I placed a few drops on cotton balls around my basement as a freshener, and it smells amazing! So much better than plug-ins!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and smells great! Using it to keep mice away and make the kitchen smell good.</li>
    <li> Thank you Eve. Your Peppermint Oil smells great. I am using it for some of the tips you mentioned in the follow up email. Keep it up.</li>
    <li> I originally put in a negative review because Amazon sent me the wrong bottles, but Eve Hansen apologized for Amazon&#x27;s mistake and sent me the right bottles at her own expense. That is an A+++ seller! The peppermint oil is divine, absolutely perfect and worth every penny! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I truly love this item.  Was very happy that is came with a dropper for easier use..helped me with a mouse issue.  I live right next to a wooded area, and needed to find a natural solution..</li>
    <li> After trying a shelf full of poisons and traps et al,&lt;br /&gt;traps n more traps&lt;br /&gt; the peppermint - a nice small bottle -&lt;br /&gt;stopped the ants cold.  I have not seen an ant for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
    <li> good for what you wanr to use it for you will not be sorry</li>
    <li> I grew up with always having some pure peppermint oil on hand. I use it to help keep my nasal passages open to breathe easier. When I bumped into your add I could not wait to order a bottle. I really like your brand and hope you keep making it so I can order more when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Larry Zielke&lt;br /&gt;mtnstrm85@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I use this in my coffee, tea, soups, and several recipes. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Wow!! this stuff is strong! I bought this product to use as an air freshener. I thought the bottle was leaking in the package because I could smell it through the shipping box. It will freshen an entire room without even unscrewing the cap. Works great in closets. Smells like pure peppermint not like sugary candy cane you get from some of these candles but the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also ingest the stuff, but be careful! make sure to dilute only a tiny drop in a full glass of water it will settle your stomach or you can gargle with it to freshen your breath.</li>
    <li> I ordered because I read it helps keep mice away!  I now use just foe the spell!!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a digestive.  It tastes much better than fernet branca and works. I even gave it to my French bulldog to settle her tummy.</li>
    <li> We use this oil to deter mice. Great big bottle, arrived quickly. We have enough to take us through to the next season.</li>
    <li> Good quality! Great quantity!</li>
    <li> Thanks for your lovely seller feedback:&lt;br /&gt;I really love this seller! They are prompt and very informative regarding uses for peppermint oil. I like the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased several different oils from amazon. This is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;It may be a bit more pricey, but well worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Best peppermint oil I have ever used.  I LOVE it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> You get a &amp;#34;quality product&amp;#34; when you order this from Eve Hansen.  I use it mainly for mouse control in my stored vehicle, and I also place the scent around in the garage (have not seen mice yet this fall.)  You get what you pay for, and this is a quality product delivered faster than I expected.  Very satisfied with the seller and the product.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived earlier than noted, was wrapped very well and is as described. The seller provided an email prior to the product arriving to let me know to expect the delivery and another after the product arrived to ensure I had received the product as expected. The bottles are large...which makes it a great value for the price. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> As already mentioned, these are very large bottles!  Before I even received my order, I got an email from Eve with some ideas for use.  Within a week, I got another email with more suggestions.  Excellent customer service for a fantastic product.  Even the bottle in my cabinet creates a delicious fragrance of mint.  I have severe gastric reflux &amp; as suggested tried a couple of drops in hot chocolate!  Fantastic!  I&#x27;ve put a few drops (too many, really. little goes a long way) in a Scentsy diffuser.  This weekend I&#x27;m going to try it in the house to subdue the aroma of 4 cats.  They only use their litter boxes, but I&#x27;m alway concerned visitors might smell them.  It&#x27;s great to keep getting these hints along the way.  Who knew Peppermint Oil would have so many wide and varied uses!!?!!</li>
    <li> The oil is very high quality. My wife and I have no experience using it, and we wanted to use it to treat our scalps. We applied the oil directly to our scalps. The sensation was pretty intense. Afterwards we read online that one should NOT apply the oil directly to your skin as it can cause some serious damage. We feel like we dodged a bullet on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now add it to our shampoo and use it to deter insects from our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality product - we love the smell!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, love the smell!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the strength of this product. I manly bought it for rodent control.  The last peppermint oil I bought locally was not as strong, and didn&#x27;t do the job.  Will definitely buy from you again.</li>
    <li> Great product, but since I use so much of it I&#x27;m now buying a more affordable brand</li>
    <li> I add this peppermint oil to my favorite shampoo and conditioner to help strength and grown my hair, which provides me with a slight tingling sensation. I like that this peppermint oil arrives to me fast and is actually natural and the only ingredient is the oil.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.  The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.  You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I use it everyday and in many ways.  I do coconut oil pulling and add 1/2 a dropper in with the coconut oil.  I add this oil to my homemade lip balm for a cool and fresh sensation.  I also use pure organic coconut oil instead of lotion, and I mix some of this peppermint oil into it and I love how it feels all minty and cool!  Smells great too!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for digestion and anxiety. I just add one or two drops to a cup of tea, and two drops to a bottle of water. I get to drink a refreshing peppermint drink and my heartburn and indigestion is gone. It is very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you&#x27;re: stressed, suffering from gastric problems (including heartburn, bloating, gas, and pain), and like the idea of hot chocolate peppermint milk. Delicious.</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice, strong aroma. Great price for the size. Should last quite awhile. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very strong.  Even closed, you can smell it.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> It was a pleasure to deal with this company.  My item was delivered on time and in excellent condition.  Eve Hansen takes a personal interest in how they deal with their customers, a nice touch.  As for the peppermint oil, I purchased it to use on my Maltese dog.  She has a yeast problem, so I rinse her off with water, white vinegar and a few drops of the peppermint oil.  Works well to relieve the itchiness, and the oil leaves a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use for mouse control in travel trailer.  Easy to use and smells nice..so far so good! Will also use for GI upsets. Thank you for a natural remedy to use.</li>
    <li> I was ready to write a rave review, but I do have issues and they really can&#x27;t be blamed on the oil itself or on Eve Hansen. I have to say the customer service aspect was top notch. They really do seem to care about the customer which goes a long way. The packaging of the dark glass bottle and glass dropper was top notch. Everything was intact when received. My issue is this: I&#x27;m not an essential oil knowitall. I had previously bought a 15ml bottle of peppermint from another company, loved it, and decided to buy this larger size years later after realizing how many uses I had for for it. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that this oil is made from Mentha arvensis and NOT Mentha piperita, which is the more common one. I was expecting a scent that&#x27;s like the common peppermint candy scent that we all know and love. This product is pepperminty, but has an undertone of medicine. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me as well as the other product so I won&#x27;t be buying this item again. Since it wasn&#x27;t the company&#x27;s fault, I didn&#x27;t bother to return it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I normally buy doterra products, because I know they are true and pure products. I decided to order this peppermint oil because the quantity was a lot more, however I should have known from the price the quality would be lacking. I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t smell like pure peppermint oil, and even though it comes in a glass bottle the smell of the oil was very strong and over powering through the closed bottle! I use peppermint oil to naturally get rid of my tension headaches, this oil will work for that however it does not last long enough and I have to reapply several times to get relief. I&#x27;ve decided to just use this oil in my room defuser for a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Strong scent...very nice. I bought this for my mom. She is very  pleased. I think it would be better to send it with a regular screw-on  lid and the dropper separately. It leaked just a few drops. The dropper is a good one. I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This item arrived very-well packaged and came much sooner than the original expected date. My husband had Peppermint Oil recommended to help with his allergies/asthma.  The product is excellent, reasonably priced compared to other options, and we are very satisfied with the whole experience. Plus I get the aromatherapy benefits of the scent of peppermint in the house.</li>
    <li> Very pure and strong smelling.  Am using it around the house to keep spiders away. Seems to be working. Used it in my granddaughter sand box.  No more spiders.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome Peppermint oil! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the big bottle so I will use for lots of different things.</li>
    <li> I love the oil.The bottle with the dropper top is also a big reason why i will order more essential oils soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to give specific information about this product since it is one ingredient in a natural insect repellent I&#x27;ve devised. I will say this, the repellant works better than any natural repellant I&#x27;ve bought. So, the product works as I intended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for spider prevention.  I&#x27;m happy to say it works.  Thank you</li>
    <li> GREAT PEPPERMINT OIL, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, TOP SELLER !! THANK YOU !!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered as promised and a quality of which exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> Would definitely order this product again.  Very potent.  A small amount goes a long way. True peppermint smell and taste.</li>
    <li> There are times in your life when you get it just right like when you think a long vacation is the answer or something so expensive it&#x27;s a one time hit.  Those days when the unexpected perfected gift is a simple smell of peppermint oil in a diffuser and you say, that&#x27;s exactly what I needed. I say that each time I turn on my diffuser and my peppermint oil. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help rid my house of a serious flea infestation &#x27;naturally&#x27; and that I had tried just about everything for to date: but nothing had worked....so mixed up one part oil to seven parts rubbing alcohol and sprayed all surfaces in my kitchen completely, even sprayed my hands and rubbed it into the cats fur. It was so strong it brought tears to my eyes (and the cats ran for cover and won&#x27;t talk to me right now)...BUT HEY! SUCCESS I CAN FEEL THE BATTLE TURNING AS HOARDS OF FLEAS HEAD OUT THE DOOR WITH LIL KERCHIEF BUNDLES TIED TO STICKS OVER THEIR SHOULDER....</li>
    <li> Package arrived before time very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I LOVE IT!!! It brings such a Fresh Minty Fragrance throughout my home!! Would I buy this again? Will I recommend this product to Family and Friends? YES I WILL!! I am ver much Satisfied regarding my order..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Monique 😊</li>
    <li> I love the smell when I walk in my house.&lt;br /&gt;Since I put it out all over, upstairs and down, I think it has done a good job of keeping spiders away. Mice are still around but it has helped with that too.</li>
    <li> I am prone to migraines &amp; nausea...I put 1 drop of this oil in some hot cocoa...headache &amp; nausea gone!  wonderful natural remedy</li>
    <li> It does not at all smell like peppermint. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it in green tea for the taste and calming it does to my stomach.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this peppermint oil!!  One of the best that I have ever gotten.  I really appreciate the dropper bottle.  Smells amazing and works wonders on headaches and sore muscles (properly diluted, of course!).  Thank you!  Will definitely remember you in the future.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much that I told some friends that I work with. I took a picture of the bottle and showed one of them the branding, and she actually bought two. One for her and one for her mom. I originally bought it for spiders. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s good stuff to get rid of them. I had no idea of the health benefits that are shown on the label. Very smart thinking of the marketing and design department. Thank you, Darren</li>
    <li> I so enjoy my peppermint oil. I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and both time my oil arrived prompt and in good condition. The quality of the oil is excellent and I will order again in the future. The health benefits of this oil have benefited me and my entire family.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of Eve Hansen Premium Peppermint Oil.  I use it for muscle soreness, mainly my back.  It is strong and really helps with soreness.  I am so glad I tried this brand of peppermint oil and I will purchase again.  You get a lot of great product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> odd &#x27;plastics&#x27; smell - may be the dropper or the contents.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfectly happy with this big bottle of e. oil. Feel that I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE WITH YOUR PEPPERMINT OIL.  THE BEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED I MY LIFE. NUMBER1 PRODUCT. Thank you I WILL BE ORDERING MORE. I KEEP YOU IN MY SAVE FOR LATER FOR WHEN I GET READY TO ORDER MORE. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint oil and highly recommend you buy it and use this seller. I have been so pleased with everything I have received from them and will continue to use their products.  Their Service is the best I have had on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I used a lot of this oil in a warmer during cold season.  PERFECT..</li>
    <li> I like this peppermint oil very much!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great essential oil. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Seems high quality - only takes a few drops to do the trick. Got it for oral hygiene, but peasantly surprised at how many other applications it has.</li>
    <li> if this is #1 rated on amazon then someone at amazon is getting a kickback ...because this stuff is not half a good of purasentials and I get it off Amazon as well ...I had a bottle of each at the same time and thus stuff is deluted and if it&#x27;s not then it&#x27;s just , I guess iff your using it for aroma what ever it might work ..I sent it back and bought another bottle of purasentials</li>
    <li> I have used daily for a month now in my morning water and have noticed nothing different!!!  I put 3-5 drops in every morning before I exercise.  I was hoping to feel more alert but have not felt anything different!!!  I think a 30 day period is a long enough time to feel results!!!  I will not purchase again or use anymore because I feel no benefits from this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this peppermint oil!  I originally purchased to deter ants, spiders &amp; mice but after Eve informed me of some of the other uses I cannot wait to try those as well especially trying it in hot cocoa.</li>
    <li> Not a very strong odor.  It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Although the peppermint oil is pricey (it&#x27;s ALL pricey) we pay it. We put it in a warmer, like a scentsy with a little oil for base. My mother in law needs something to open her sinuses and help her breathe.  She can&#x27;t take ANY medication. This helps her breathe.  We run the warmer and add drops of peppermint oil every waking hour. When I can&#x27;t smell the peppermint I add more drops. It works</li>
    <li> Great oil with great results. They have a good price and it does the same thing as more expensive oils. I am fairly new to this but have used them several times with outstanding results!</li>
    <li> This aroma revitalizes your senses and give your spirit a calmness and eases your fatigue. I recommend this for anytime of the day but especially after a rough day at work.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a therapeutic grade essential oil and is of good quality.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> GREAT Product.  Quick service.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Wonderful product. This is our first experience with peppermint oil and our last brand we will ever need to try. Great all around experience.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more. A great product with merchandiser&#x27;s attention even when there was not a problem. They just wanted to know if we had received it and were happy with it.  We add it to a liquid Castile soap (perfect for living in So. Florida), but it was a great help recently when we both got the winter colds from HELL! A little on a wet cloth on the forehead, back of neck, or on the chest made breathing a whole lot easier.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  The seller sent an email detailing some uses for the product as a natural remedy and the shipping was really fast.  I bought this product as a deterrent for spiders and it&#x27;s been several weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any.   I re-apply once a week to make sure that I remain spider free.  My home smells great and a little goes a long way.  I am going to try some of the natural remedies.</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil for a lot of stuff and I bought this as I had used my previous bottle up.  This is a good peppermint oil...I don&#x27;t know that I think it&#x27;s the best or awesome...but it&#x27;s good and the bottle is large.  If only more oils were this reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Nice morning pick me up in cold water. It&#x27;s strong though. A single drop for 12 - 16 oz water or tea is plenty to get a good but not overpowering flavor.</li>
    <li> great product  fast service</li>
    <li> Nice product.. Very potent, only need a few drops. Nice size</li>
    <li> I have been using peppermint oil  in my  water  for  several months. I have  found that I have loads of mental clarity  in the  evening  and I  add 11 small droplets to 1 qt.  of water. I enjoy several bottles thru the  day.  I will be a  return  customer.</li>
    <li> More intense smell then I thought. Makes me love it even. use for potpori , around litter box. Many other uses like in the barn, trash cans, put a drop on on old piece cloth and place it in the car folded so it not two strong.</li>
    <li> love that peppermint oil</li>
    <li> I enjoy the crisp scent... I hope it keeps out the insects as well as making the room smell nice.......</li>
    <li> Great product. Add it to my water bottle every day. Clears my head helps my migraines. Perks me up!</li>
    <li> Love the Peppermint Oil! My Grandkids also love the smell so in addition to it&#x27;s healing properties we use it everywhere! Keep up the great products!</li>
    <li> The seller emailed me twice, once to let me know the item had been shipped and second to make sure I had received the item. The second email also contained information for different uses for the oil. I will definitely order from this seller again and highly recommend them!! I use this product to flavour hydrogen peroxide for a pre-brush rinse. I used to just by mint extract at the grocery but decided to try the mint oil. I discovered that it doesn&#x27;t take much! The peroxide helps whiten my teeth along with the toothpaste and the oil leaves my breath smelling minty fresh!!</li>
    <li> the peppermint essential oils is amazing! I have very severe uncomfortable allergies and it has done wonders for me! I rub it on the temples on my forehead, breathe it in after boiling in water, and rub it on my neck - chest area. Not only has it opened my airway and lungs, it takes away my headaches and I feel so much better. It&#x27;s amazing how this God given natural remedy really works :-)</li>
    <li> I have been battling mice for five years. Now my first time using Peppermint Oil and they are gone! Thank goodness!!!!</li>
    <li> I suppose I&#x27;m terrible at gauging size; I was trying to think what would four bottles of my 1oz tea tree oil look like? This jar is huge and is some of the strongest peppermint I&#x27;ve gotten my hands on lately. I bought this so that I change things up for my anniversary. She&#x27;s used to me smelling like Wild Country and Black Suede...I am hoping it will be a nice change for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that&#x27;s both good and bad...one of my cats won&#x27;t come near me, and the younger tries to eat my pockets and shoes where I put a few drops on the seams. So this has doubled as a cat-repellent since the older one, who hates it, won&#x27;t climb on things she&#x27;s not supposed to if it has this on it. I&#x27;ve been putting small amounts under the counter on the exposed wood--no more cat in the sink! Definitely not the intended use but sure is what I&#x27;ll be using it for, for a while.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality oil! I&#x27;ll be buying from this retailer again.</li>
    <li> I use my peppermint oil almost every night in my diffuser and sleep great.  Also, it&#x27;s great for rubbing on the back of my neck to help with pain or relaxing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle of peppermint oil, it is also very concentrated and so a little goes a long way.  It smells great but very strong, so be careful.  I have used it on carpets, around the dog bedding area and in my aromatherapy diffuser with water.  One dro pis quite enough, it is very strong.  I love it, and it gives a fresh clean scent anywhere you use it.  I have also heard it helps to repel bugs, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed it that works.</li>
    <li> I love Amazon and I love this peppermint oil!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as described. Huge amount for low price. And they have amazing customer service. Emailed me twice to ensure I was pleased with purchase. I am!!</li>
    <li> I used the product to make a house cleaner and to make an exfoliating body scrub. So far the quality has been TOP NOTCH!</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for keeping ants at bay.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but it does!!  And it smells heavenly too.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong when I first apply. The next day the scent is gone.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer NEEDS to make it clear that this oil CAN be edible. The labeling was conflicting, and I had to rely on other reviewers.</li>
    <li> great product, great price, shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> Wonderful peppermint oil at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase, and will be buying other oils&lt;br /&gt;from this seller and will keep you posted!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of peppermint oil for various applications. Several different brands.&lt;br /&gt;First time using this brand of peppermint oil. Great value for a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great great great vendor. Excellent communication and really fast shipment. Love the product. I soak a few cotton balls with the oil and place around in basement - NO mice. AND I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally poisoning our dogs !</li>
    <li> Very good oil and will use it a lot. Aroma from bottle is strong so I feel it&#x27;s escaping through the stopper. Would reorder again.</li>
    <li> I pulled this out of the packaging and WOW!!  It was strong smelling.  This smell of peppermint has filled my house.  After a few days I stopped noticing it.</li>
    <li> Got this product to control mice and insects from entering our RV over the winter storage months.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and most effective. Only negative feedback would be the &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34;; is very strong so we keep it stored out in the garage.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and shipped fast!!</li>
    <li> Initially bought this to deter the mice in my NYC apartment, but since I have used it for many more things. I love the smell of peppermint oil to begin with. I make a spray out of the oil with water and spray it around my entire apartment. Since using I have seen a mouse once! That&#x27;s a huge difference. I&#x27;m not sure if they have left the apartment (hope they did) but I would say this worked great. It also leaves your place smelling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific brand is amazing! You literally smell the peppermint once you open the box. I have bought another bottle since my first purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It has a very strong smell and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> We all love this product we use it to settle our stomach, brush our teeth or just to flavor our water.</li>
    <li> Absolutely delicious! . Minimal amount needed in the diffuser for a lasting,refreshing smell!</li>
    <li> Yup. Everything you read is true. It&#x27;s really great, pungent stuff.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write this review until I use the product for a while.  This is really a high quality product.  I usually use it around the house, but apply directly to skin didn&#x27;t cause irritation to me.  I really love it, will buy again when I run out.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife to get through her pregnancy and she will not use it. She says it does smell like peppermint but there is something in it that is not quite right and she can&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
    <li> very weak, need to use 3 times as much to make a small batch of soap</li>
    <li> I could smell the peppermint oil as soon as it came into the house.  The fragrance was wonderful.  I have had a problem stomach for a couple of months and bought the peppermint oil in hopes it would sooth my stomach.  I found that the best way to make a soothing and comforting drink was to put a few drops in some mint tea.  I add a little almond milk and some stevia.  The result is a wonderful tasting hot drink that does calm my stomach.  I enjoy a cup every day.</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil is amazing! Love the bottle size! I go through so much this saves a lot of money. The strength of the fragrance is perfect!</li>
    <li> didnt work at all. a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping &amp; happy customer here. Would recommend to anybody in a heartbeat. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I bought one for myself, then one for my college-aged son who deals with migraines regularly.  LOVE this!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet for the purpose I purchased it (keeping the wasps/bees away from my balcony) but I can tell it&#x27;s good quality oil</li>
    <li> This stuff worked absolute magic on my daily headaches.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for many uses.  I use it when my stomach has gas or upset.  This great product that I have ordered twice will help with tired legs.  I stand to work in front of a quilt machine, it helps so much with the discomfort  tired legs and the pain that go along with the job and it helps to finish out my day.  I would tell people to purchase it, it will work.  I have two ladies that have ordered it and are happy campers using this product.</li>
    <li> the product arrived quickly and product was as advertised we are enjoying making the water infused so far we love it</li>
