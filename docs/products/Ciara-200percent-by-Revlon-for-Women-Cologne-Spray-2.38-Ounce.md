      <li>I have always, and still do, get wonderful compliments whenever I wear Ciara 200.  </li>
      <li>I pray that they will never stop producing this wonderfully feminine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I have already had people come up to me and comment on the wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is excellent.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my order from Amazon.</li>
      <li>The Ciara perfume I ordered  is excellent quality, and it arrived within 4 days of my purchase date.  </li>
      <li>I have worn it for years and this site has the best price I have ever paid.</li>
      <li>and I am so happy I did.</li>

      <li>Ciara is truly one of the great classics of all time.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely happy with the pricing on Amazon and the speed with which it was sent.</li>
      <li>Ciara is the most wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>This perfume is tricky, it smells good</li>
      <li>Its definatly  a blend of spices, vanilla, and musk that combine into a  beautiful symphony of seductive and very wearable notes  that captivate the senses and transport one to places both  exotic and ancient!!</li>
      <li>but it is nice fragrance to wear when you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
      <li>This fragrance will continue to stand on its own merit.  </li>
      <li>I own the 80% strength  as I prefer a bit more downplayed fragrances.  </li>
      <li>A very engaging scent for evening wear.</li>
      <li>However, now it cost way more</li>
      <li>This is my favorite of all colognes.</li>
      <li>I am verrrrrrrrrry pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love Ciara and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>My favorite pefume that I have used for probably 40 years.  </li>
      <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT AND</li>
      <li>She is the SUN, and when Ciara is in the air it is Patti I think of, with love.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite scent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m liking Juicy Couture a bit more.</li>
      <li>I have worn Ciara for decades now and am thrilled to get it at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>My favorite perfume that was a great deal back when I bought it.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s way strong.</li>
      <li>but it immediately fades and becomes a rich cloud of candy like perfume but not nauseating sweet.</li>
      <li>I can still purchase it and lucky for me at convenient drug stores, but order on line to get the 200 strength that I wear on special days.  </li>
      <li>This is more of a classic scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better than the high priced colognes I have tried.</li>
      <li>Its very light and soft smelling.</li>
      <li>The smell of Ciara is unique unto itself and there is  really nothing else it can be compared with.</li>
      <li>This perfume is my favorite but only bought once or twice because of the price at the stores.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE from Revlon&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your recent comments from the Revlon website and your interest in our products.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, because of fashion trends and limited consumer demand, it becomes necessary to discontinue an otherwise excellent product.</li>
      <li>It is a soft sweet and spicy scent, starts out powdery</li>
      <li>It is pure pleasure</li>
      <li>This scent is strong and long lasting, In fact it&#x27;s so strong--</li>
      <li>Thank you very much,Carmella</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved,loved,loved this purchase.</li>
      <li>which I do not like too much</li>
      <li>When I wear it, I get more compliments than when I wear any other scent.</li>
      <li>I remember seeing this on her vanity dresser among other perfumes, but it was Ciara 200 that was her favorite.  </li>
      <li>Her first cologne was White Shoulders when she was 14 years old.  </li>
      <li>This was my sister&#x27;s signature scent from the time she was around 18 years old.  </li>
      <li>I used to wear Ciara all through high school, and I remember it being a sharp semi metallicky scent.</li>

<li> There is toilet water (Eau De Parfums), cologne and then perfume.  </li>
<li> It is hard to find 200% Ciara Cologne where I live.</li>
<li> You get the same effect with the 100% with less cost!  </li>
<li> The 100 and 80 smell nothing like the 200 and certainly do not linger.</li>
<li> I brought the 200% strength and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I never wear any other perfume.   </li>
<li> Since fragrances are a matter of individual and personal preference, we are unable to suggest a substitute fragrance for you.</li>
<li> I bought the 200% strength for my mom who has used this   perfume since I was a little girl.</li>
<li> the bottle I received is more like 100 or 80 strength, very disappointed.</li>
<li> If I am going to the office I use very little.</li>
<li> even though I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle--I&#x27;ve grown almost tired of it.</li>
<li> The 200 strength is so hard to find in stores.   </li>
<li> A bottle lasts me at least a year</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Revlon Ciara Cologne Spray 200 Strength is no longer being manufactured.</li>
<li> /&gt;I am so sad!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to wear Ciara all through high school, and I remember it being a sharp semi metallicky scent. When I read the reviews of the 200 strength I decided to try it and I am so happy I did. It is a soft sweet and spicy scent, starts out powdery which I do not like too much but it immediately fades and becomes a rich cloud of candy like perfume but not nauseating sweet. It is pure pleasure and I have already had people come up to me and comment on the wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE from Revlon&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your recent comments from the Revlon website and your interest in our products.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, because of fashion trends and limited consumer demand, it becomes necessary to discontinue an otherwise excellent product. Unfortunately, Revlon Ciara Cologne Spray 200 Strength is no longer being manufactured. Since fragrances are a matter of individual and personal preference, we are unable to suggest a substitute fragrance for you. We would encourage you to visit our fragrance display in retail stores in your area.&lt;br /&gt;Ciara Fragrance 100 Strength and 80 Strength are still being maufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so sad! Just when I found this scent, its being discontinued!</li>
    <li> The Ciara perfume I ordered  is excellent quality, and it arrived within 4 days of my purchase date.  I am very happy with my order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ciara is truly one of the great classics of all time.  This fragrance will continue to stand on its own merit.  I bought the 200% strength for my mom who has used this   perfume since I was a little girl. I own the 80% strength  as I prefer a bit more downplayed fragrances.  The smell of Ciara is unique unto itself and there is  really nothing else it can be compared with. Its definatly  a blend of spices, vanilla, and musk that combine into a  beautiful symphony of seductive and very wearable notes  that captivate the senses and transport one to places both  exotic and ancient!! A very engaging scent for evening wear.</li>
    <li> There is toilet water (Eau De Parfums), cologne and then perfume.  This amounts to 80 strength, 100 strength and 200 strength.  I have used Ciara since the day they gave out sample spray bottles in 1973.  I have always, and still do, get wonderful compliments whenever I wear Ciara 200.  I pray that they will never stop producing this wonderfully feminine fragrance.  The 200 strength is so hard to find in stores.   A bottle lasts me at least a year so I buy two at a time, just in case I can&#x27;t find it again.  I never wear any other perfume.   YOU WILL LOVE IT AND THE COMPLIMENTS YOU RECIEVE!</li>
    <li> This was my sister&#x27;s signature scent from the time she was around 18 years old.  I remember seeing this on her vanity dresser among other perfumes, but it was Ciara 200 that was her favorite.  Her first cologne was White Shoulders when she was 14 years old.  These two  cologne&#x27;s are key for me when I think of her.  They represent her youthful force of nature/BEAUTY.  She is the SUN, and when Ciara is in the air it is Patti I think of, with love.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved,loved,loved this purchase. This perfume is my favorite but only bought once or twice because of the price at the stores. I am verrrrrrrrrry pleased with it. Thank you very much,Carmella</li>
    <li> This cologne spray was a wonderful value. I have been using it for years and it is excellent. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite scent but it is nice fragrance to wear when you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. It is a romantic scent and I prefer to wear it in the evening. I brought the 200% strength and a little goes a long way. If I am going to the office I use very little. The fragrance stays with you all day. I have never needed to re-apply.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume, I get compliments.  I have worn it for years and this site has the best price I have ever paid.</li>
    <li> My favorite pefume that I have used for probably 40 years.  Thank goodness I can still purchase it and lucky for me at convenient drug stores, but order on line to get the 200 strength that I wear on special days.  Its very light and soft smelling.</li>
    <li> I love Ciara and have used it for years.  I was extremely happy with the pricing on Amazon and the speed with which it was sent.</li>
    <li> This scent is strong and long lasting, In fact it&#x27;s so strong--even though I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle--I&#x27;ve grown almost tired of it. But when I spray it the next day, I question why I didn&#x27;t do so sooner. This perfume is tricky, it smells good but it&#x27;s way strong. I&#x27;m liking Juicy Couture a bit more. Try that one out if your looking for something ... juicy. lol. This is more of a classic scent. And AAA rocks, their prices do too.</li>
    <li> Ciara is the most wonderful scent. It&#x27;s very romantic and feminine. When I wear it, I get more compliments than when I wear any other scent. Therefore, I have worn it for 25 years. An application lasts too, especially the 200% strength. This is my favorite of all colognes. It&#x27;s even better than the high priced colognes I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have worn Ciara for decades now and am thrilled to get it at such a great price.  I order 2 at a time.</li>
    <li> When will revlon realize that there is an eager market awaiting the return of Ciara 200 strength.  The 100 and 80 smell nothing like the 200 and certainly do not linger.</li>
    <li> You get the same effect with the 100% with less cost!  I only buy this when I can&#x27;t get the 100% - I see no difference.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume that was a great deal back when I bought it.  However, now it cost way more so I don&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> Does not have the fragrance of 200 strength concentrate cologne. I have used this product for over 20 years, I know what it should smell like, the bottle I received is more like 100 or 80 strength, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find 200% Ciara Cologne where I live. Just purchased 100%.  Hope they never quit making this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
