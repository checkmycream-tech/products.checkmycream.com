<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have natural hair and this product works great on my edges. Makes them look like I have a perm.</li>
    <li> Alright, but doesn&#x27;t last (keep slickness) over an hr. Reminds me of Elasta QP. Probably better off using clear gel or something.</li>
    <li> this hair product smells really good, and leaves little to  no residue. Good price sells here in Germany for 20 euro</li>
    <li> I am natural and need to give my edges that smooth &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; look. Hicks is perfect for the job! The smoothness does not last all day however it does last for up 9 hours. It really is a great product! No white residue!!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well on edges and the back of the neck!! I wish I would have had this stuff a long time ago!!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those hard to tame edges. This product isn&#x27;t greasy and lays your hair down very well.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing!! It did great things for my hair. Granted it is a little on the pricey side for its size but I believe it is well worth it especially if you have kinky hair like I do, it works so many wonders!! But be careful to screw on the cap really tight after every use because I forgot and mine dried out a little and it is just never the same after that happens.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works wonders. I use it with my natural high puff. the only thing about it that i dont like is that it dont work well on wet hair</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my naps down a bunch of gunk. If worked I had to use a lot of it nearly the whole jar in one use.</li>
    <li> i chose 5 stars because this product is AMAZING! Its also cheaper than the hair stores even with shipping and handling im still saving a few dollars! Ive been using this product for over a year or so, and my beautician started using this product on my edges and it just left my hair slick and shiny for at least 3 days before i had to slick my edges down again. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flaky, crusty, or any of that. Yes im NATURAL so my edges are a little kinky but with a little Kicks Edges and a comb my hair is slick! Oh yea, and ZERO BREAKAGE!! I would recommend this product to anyone! Its worth every penny and it lasts for a while as long as you don&#x27;t use a lot, because you only need a little! Questions just ask! Hope i could be a help!!</li>
    <li> Thank you it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do!! I strongly recommend this product to everyone thanks again hicks edges!</li>
    <li> works great and i love it thus far a lil pricey but hopefully it will last awhile.i am very pleased</li>
    <li> Heart this stuff! I&#x27;m 4C and it lays my hair down...for a time. Put it on (follow the instructions - use a comb and rub until dry) and then tie your hair down overnight! Silky smooth in the morning!</li>
    <li> I gave it an ok rating. It works well but when faced with humidity it failed. When I received my package the containers where both cracked and melted during shipment. Once I let it sit and cool it went back to it&#x27;s original consistency.</li>
    <li> Holds down edges, and not greasy at all. However, it doesn&#x27;t last. The hold is very temporary. Might retry, not a must have</li>
    <li> Great product!  works wonderfully!  I will always purchase it.  I have not found a better product anywhere!  I fully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using this product and I love it. I heard good reviews on it before i purchased.</li>
    <li> The product is alright for about an hour. After that it all goes down hill and you will need to reapply the product for it to be effective enough to tame those stubborn edges.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product cause all the YOUTUBE hair gurus suggested that this is a step up from regular beauty supply edge control And maybe cause I have used this on a consistent basis but when I do I can&#x27;t really complain. I will say it does get the job done, its not sticky like the rest of the other edge controls  have used in the past and it does seems to leave what ever area I have applied it to softer. So its not extra amazing but it I probably would purchased this item in the future</li>
    <li> Work very well. I think it cost to much though. But it does slick edges down and depending on hair type it will give it a wave.</li>
    <li> Its really good but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
    <li> I love this gel because it is light and doesn&#x27;t flake.  It is a bit pricier than other gels however it is definitely worth its cost because it does the work.</li>
    <li> Disappointed .. It&#x27;s equal to Cream Of Nature which has  a less price tag. The price is ridiculous.. A few ounces more..AND?! Just over-rated..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I love it everyone should use it doesn&#x27;t work that good for natural hair but if relaxed or in between worth a try</li>
    <li> Hicks Edges is the only substance that keeps my hair in order . I hope I have enough of it to last me for now as I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> I gave up on this one because of the white risidues left on my hair after applying it. It was embarrassing to have them all day long at work. I regret buying it and wish that I could get my money back. Maybe it has worked for others.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. For the price it does not do what it is supposed to do. It works for about thirty minutes and that&#x27;s it. It also leaves white residue behind. I have braids and I don&#x27;t want my roots to be white. I&#x27;ll keep using my perfect edges from olive oil.</li>
    <li> it really works for smoothing down your edges.  only thing is it will cake up in dirty hair.  also, best to apply by hand instead of a brush so it stays thick and gel-like, not too thin</li>
    <li> This edge control does not build up and make your edges slimy and white. It makes my edges smooth and makes it look like I have a relaxer everytime!</li>
    <li> My wife love this stuff for my lil girl hair say it keep it soft and in place for a long period of time</li>
    <li> this product was very weak on my edges. It would hold for like a couple of minutes then my edges would start curling up. It also broke some of my hair off leaving the hair on my edges very short..and the product turned white on my hair..would not recommend it for protective style ( sew in ) unless you are going to wash your leave out hair every day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and it seems to keep edges down without being too stiff and tacky as the evening or day wears on. I did not mix it with anything else so I don&#x27;t know if it would flake with anything else. It doesn&#x27;t flake on it&#x27;s own. I don&#x27;t get incredible shine as I do with something waxier and stiffer.</li>
    <li> Hicks Edges Pomade does exactly what it promises. It holds down my edges adequately and does not flake. I always purchase it.</li>
    <li> This edge control is the best. Expensive the best I have had much better than the beauty supply stores a must buy</li>
    <li> The best edge control ever! I absolutely love it. It leaves no residue, and it tackles the edges perfectly. It doesnt take a whole lot to get the job done, so its worth the money!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold at all. This item is a waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Once you apply to edges of hair it stays for about 2 minutes before you start to lose the hold.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I just never have time to go to the beauty supply store. It works perfectly whether you are wearing a high ponytail or just for when the wind blows and shows your edges. It keep them looking sleek and not matted down.</li>
    <li> This Pomade works great on my hair and gives it a nice hold.......alleviates fly-aways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many gels. But this one is the best. Works immediately. Only need a small amount. Lasts for 12 hours.( I work a 12 hour shift) Very easy to wash out. Well worth the price. However, I do notice a slight white film build up if I apply it on my entire head and not just my edges after 12 hours. So to avoid having to shampoo my hair every day, I only use it on my edges (which is what I originally bought it for). If it wasnt for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Performs as advertised. As with any product there will be slight build up but that is expected. Only drawback is that it does not hold well in humidity and does not hold for an extended day (over 10 hours). Other than that it is well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> If you have natural hair (like mine) or edges that just refuse to be tamed this is the product for you. I love Edges by Hicks, this is def a must have in my household!!!</li>
    <li> This product works well with my natural hair. It holds hair firmly in place for several hours and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair once it wears off.  One container will last me several months and I use the product quite frequently. Don&#x27;t have to use much to hold your hair in place.</li>
    <li> no crazy build up on my edges...all day hold...the smell is not strong...a dab will do you. This product will last forever. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Really good edge control.  works good on my coarse hair.  work really good when I perm my edges keeps it flat all day.  Must have product.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work. It didn&#x27;t hold my edges down at all. And it gets so flacky. After the first two uses your gonna have to wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Its alittle more expensive than other edge controls ive tried but I now see why. It doesnt turn greasey once youve been outside in heat for a few hours, doesnt turn white and doesnt leave that disgusting residue the next day. It holds for a long time and all my clients love it.</li>
    <li> This worked really well until I went out on a hot triple digit day.  Hair immediately curled at the slightest  perspiration.</li>
    <li> The best product ever for laying down edges! I used some with just my fingers and it did wonders, but use a brush and it really slicks and lays.  I have natural AA hair and it lays my edges perfectly.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever using another product again!</li>
    <li> I was really afraid to try a new edge control after being unable to find my usual one at Target (I guess they stopped making the line of products). Anyway, my biggest fear was that it might leave white reside (this is what Edge Control did). It DOESN&#x27;T! I have not had any issues with residue AT ALL. And it holds my edges down pretty well throughout the day. I can&#x27;t say they are slick all day, but most of the day - yes.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold hair down for long. It clumps hair together with white residue. It is not worth $15... I&#x27;m sorry!</li>
    <li> this does no more than all the other edge control .the review i saw on youtube is what made me think that this was something special. It look like clear gel and also contains pomade.nothing special here but it works on already perm hair .will not work on natural naps.</li>
    <li> Well it came in the mail fairly quick,and in good condition. As for the product itself it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected on my grey edges..</li>
    <li> This Pomade is excellent! It has a excellent hold and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to be effective.  I will order more!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh; this is indeed a miracle product. I use this product daily without a build up. No flaking whatsoever! I&#x27;ve used it through my natural stages and it made my edges look as if they were relaxed. Certainly worth the cost. I&#x27;ve used similar products and they made my hair gooey and left a white residue. Not Hick&#x27;s....I use other Hick&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Perhaps my hair is too curly. It works for like 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Does not work for 4C natural or texturized hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my edges. I have wavy/curly, fine hair and the other gels do not work. This product smooths my edges and it lasts all day. No flaking or peeling.</li>
    <li> This is the best edge control product I have ever used. It is worth every penny I spent. It does not turn you hair hard or brown but it makes a straight and slick. I have found my new favorite product!!</li>
    <li> I use the product after I have straightened my hair. I place it on my edges and at first it holds but soon after where I applied the product it makes my hair curl up, which is opposite of my intentions.  In all it has horrible hold and if you have currly hair and use it for your edges after you straighten your hair it curls it. What a waste. Now I use Olive Oil brand Edge Control and its cheaper and works wonders.</li>
    <li> Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding!!! Ladies we have a winner. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! It works really well when I am stretching my relaxer for 15 to 18 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is everything the good reviews say it is. I went to 6 different stores looking for this product and it was sold out everywhere! I finally got sick of going to multiple stores and just ordered it off amazon. I have been natural since 2001 and have tried many, many, many products. I sometimes think I have a problem with buying so many hair products because I have and can be ridiculous. However, I heard about this product from watching countless YouTube videos and everyone said they loved it. I decided to give it a try. If you put it on you edges in the morning and leave your hair alone, it slicks them down for the entire day (my days are usually around 12-14 hours)!It doesn&#x27;t curl your edges, it lays them down nice and flat and works great for wash n gos, ponytails, straight styles...whatever you want that you would like for your edges to be nicely laid. I would consider my hair to be in the 4a range and it makes it look super fine, but I think it works for any hair type that wants to tame those edges for an extended period of time without using harsh gels. I definitely recommend and will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair wavy..keeps my edges straight (until I sweat). Great hold too!, Will recommend this product to teammates and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> this product makes all of your &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; hair/edges straight. Its like I have baby hair again</li>
    <li> I have very course hair and could not find a pomade that would keep my edges down. Hicks is the BEST and it WORKS!</li>
    <li> Edges helps me tremendously with my natural hair! It&#x27;s great for keeping my hair down and the style looking neat!</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I have tried. It actually lays down the hair, as it states. I will never buy another pomade again. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have not had a relaxer for nearly 8 months, and this product keeps my edges straight and eliminates fly-away hair! My hair is naturally wavy, but I&#x27;m sure this product would work with most hair textures. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> It  really hold my edges down, you don&#x27;t need a lot. I will order more and tell my friends about this good product.</li>
    <li> Love it, really slicks hair back..Does cake on your hair after a few days, but great for pull back hair.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream on my African American hair. Pulls those baby hairs in place and keeps them there for quite a well. Will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pomades that I have ever used. I have naturally curly hair and it keeps my edges down all day. It has a nice shine as well. My hair is naturally curly/mixed type of hair. It&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t flake up, leave a white residue, and it does not make my hair feel sticky. It has a nice soft, but firm hold. I def recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!!! I have not had a perm in soo long, I put some of this on my edges and my kitchen and it looked liked I had a perm. I didn&#x27;t have to put a scarf on to lay it down or NOTHING!! Definitely worth the money. And you don&#x27;t need much so it will last for awhile :)&lt;br /&gt;I will also say that I was a little skeptical at first because I thought it was a gel type substance, but I was proved wrong. Lol</li>
    <li> I received this product about 2 weeks ago and I love it. I have not relaxed my hair in about 4 months not and I have new growth which is hard to hide. So I tried this product and it works. (awesome)!!! it lays down my edges and it looks like I have a relaxer. It does wonders for the fly away hairs in the back of my head for when I want to wear a ponytail. I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone with relaxed or non-relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying it is rare for me to write a review for anything. Either the product is over the moon good, or it is just hugely disappointing. This product is AMAZING! I have really thick and coarse hair so finding something to tame my edges was very hard. Because my hair is in a short style, I had to resort to perking my hair every 3 weeks. I know that seems like a lot but my hair is just that coarse. Without a perm at the 3 week mark, my hair would only look permed on the top due to the new growth on the back and sides. This product has changed all of that. I simply put it on at night before putting my head wrap on my sides, around my 3 week mark, and voilà! The next morning when I wake up I am truly amazed. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of pomades but this is the only product to have given me these results. I no longer have to perm my sides every 3 weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> This is the best edge control I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t have to touch up throughout the day and unlike other edge controls, this does not take my hair out but grows it instead.  Cost more than others but it is worth it and it will last a while.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  When first applied it is amazing but within 10 mins it&#x27;s like you never applied anything.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I only have to use it once and the slickness lasts for 3 days, provided I wear a scarf.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly it does what it claims to. Strange texture that looks like a hard gelatin but it smoothes out and makes my 4 year natural VERY kinky hair look like I have a new perm and press.  Price is decent for what it does. Small canister but a little really does go a long way. I highly recommend this for those who wear half caps, lace fronts or pony tail pieces. This will make it look like you had your hair professionally done without the damage and hassles.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect if you don&#x27;t want that extra residue in your hair. And it also doesn&#x27;t make your hair dry! Smells amazing 😍</li>
    <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found a edge product, that doesn&#x27;t flake and make my hair white! Just about all the other products out there for edge control, leave my edges dry, flaky, crusty, and not pretty! This product does lay down edges, but with any product, you really be careful of build up. When I use this product, I usually don&#x27;t continue using this everyday, as you will get a build up. I usually use it twice a week, and then follow up with a moisturizer around my edges to re-activate the product - which does work. I fill good about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a few gels, and while doing research I found this one. I tried it when I first got it and it worked really well. But after washing my hair it was just okay. I think this edge gel is good for second day hair. But for the most part is did get the job done.</li>
    <li> well when i put it on my hair it laid completely flat i thought it was an amazing product not greasy at all. but after about 10 minutes i look in the mirror to see if it was holding up and my hair looked like it did before i put the stuff on! almost how jam does your hair except not greasy. very upset :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my edges down at all for my 4b/4c hair. I am disappointed for the price I had to spend. I wish I could find a product that just tames my edges.</li>
    <li> I have natural course hair and this product did not hold the hair down as firmly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I realey like this produce it realey works it&#x27;t smooth and realey lay your hair down and keep it in place i would recommend it to my friends Thank you Mary Jack</li>
    <li> It slicks your hair without getting hard.  I makes it look great. I will continue to buy this  product.  I will recommed this to my friends</li>
    <li> So, this stuff makes my edges look fantastic...then it dries in 30 minutes and I&#x27;m almost back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist said that because my hair is not course that gels will not work as well for me as someone with a more course texture of hair. I have spiral curly kinda mixed textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I had to choose an edge control out of all the ones I have tried (at least 7 or so) this would be my choice.&lt;br /&gt;It is not cost effective though for the amount I have to use to get the results for 30 minutes each day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it on my daughter&#x27;s and myself and it has our edges laid! Quick shipping and great packaging. I would definitely recommend this product. This is my second time ordering it and I plan to keep a supply on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Product must be very important because she keeps constantly nagging about her edge control getting out of hand. Now she can be quiet for a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it! I love this product it doesn&#x27;t flake at all and it works awesome for your edges to stay in place while looking glossy and fabulous, and the delivery was fine as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it does what it says it will, I will buy it again, it holds down my edges all day, of course it is cold now as far as the weather where I live, I have to see how it works in the summer weather, but so far I love it. Great product, hope they don&#x27;t change the ingredients in it, as we all know, when something is good and working well, they always want to make it better or so they think, I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair dresser. She said&lt;br /&gt;it would be difficult to find this product without a cosmetologist license.&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance with Amazon and found it.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. Does not flake and does not leave hair stiff like other&lt;br /&gt;pomades. Will be purchasing more in the future. I should have bought more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !</li>
    <li> This is the best edge control that I have ever used.  It doesnt flake and it smoothes everything in place.</li>
    <li> I love this product for many reason, the main being that it works well for holding done my edges!!</li>
    <li> This item came to me semi-melted, and I&#x27;m not sure if this product is suppose to be so soft, but it is. I will not be buying again. It doesn&#x27;t work like it is suppose to do for my edges. I cannot  recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> lays my edges for days at a time as long as its already straightened. It does leave a build up. A little goes a long way. Its a little too pricey. Its likes 16 at the beauty supply but now its only 11 or 12 on amazon. To be honest the olive oil edge control gives me the same results and it costs a lot less. If you don&#x27;t mind the price then go for it.</li>
    <li> This product didnt really work for me. I have natural hair and only use it for my edges. When first applied, it does straighten out the hair, but about 10 minutes later my hair gets curly again. My husband loves it and uses it for his waves..lol I told him he could have it and now I&#x27;m off to find another product.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but it won&#x27;t last me over 8 hours. You only need a little to slick down your edges. It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews where as clients were not satisfied with the product, I finally decided to give Hick&#x27;s Edges Transformation a try anyway, and it exceeded my expectation. My hair is natural and very coarse. Hick&#x27;s Edges Transformation laid my edges down all day. It even held up during my workouts at the gym. I will definitely purchase the product again and again, as I haven&#x27;t found another hair gel that last all day.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. I have natural hair... used it for my afro puff &amp; it laid it smooth. Smells great. Left my hair soft. I purchased it in the beauty supply for 12$ Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many Youtube vids raving about this stuff and I had to try it. I usually use Aveeda paste which I love but its only good for when hair is super clean. Hicks so far has been great at conctrolling my edges ALL day and keeps my edges straight. I wear hair extensions and it helps to lay my curly edges down straight and flat. wonderful product at agreat value. not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I had been using various edge controls and none of them worked until I bought this one. I haven been natural for almost a year now and none of the edge controls I used could hold my edges down like this one. I put this on in the morning and my edges ARE LAID!Doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky, greasy residue like other edge controls and it&#x27;s non flaky and smells great! Sometimes I spray water on my edges and then apply the Hicks edges and after doing that my edges are laid for two days without me having to apply more of the product! used it on my sisters hair and she perms her hair and it worked like a charm! Best edge control I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> When I first found Hick&#x27;s I was in love!  And I still am, except I have another love: Organic Root Stimulator.  Both products do the same thing, and lay your edges down flawlessly. I don&#x27;t notice a difference between either product, except the price.  Hick&#x27;s costs double the money.  Also, Organic Root Stimulator is easier to find.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but since my hair is naturally curly it just curl it up more then lay it down.</li>
    <li> I used this product in my business to smooth down those stubborn edge or fly away hairs. It really works gr8,and my clients love it to. Recommend it highly. Gr8 price.</li>
    <li> I love the product it tames my edges and is not greasy. It also makes hair curly. I recommend it for any natural hair type.</li>
    <li> Excellent product in controlling your edges and I love it.  I am recommending this product to everyone I know and then some.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hicks Edges Pomade for almost a year.  I love it b/c I only have to apply it once a day and it keeps my hair in place.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard like previous edge controls I used.</li>
    <li> This works well, but only on clean dry hair.  After a few days and with other hair care products, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I love product, doesn&#x27;t flake. Must apply a substanstial amount for a strong all-day hold.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product a friend, I have actually.</li>
    <li> My wife buys this for my daughter&#x27;s twists and loves it. She has used more expensive stuff from department stores and other outlets, but this stuff is the best by far.</li>
    <li> This really works well on my edges and is not too heavy. 👎it&#x27;s a little drying for me so I add Jamaican Black Castro oil w/ it. It last a long time and little goes a long way.  Update 3/21/15 I stopped using this product. I gave it away; it doesn&#x27;t compliment my seborrheic dermatitis. It aggravates my sclap and causes the flakiness to double, ie my edges started thinning. I recently found something else. I recommend Avenda control paste. Looovve it soooo much. My edges are thicken and no flakes.</li>
    <li> Its an edge pomade.  Its not a miracle worker lol but I still use it to get those hairs to lay down.  Nothing special but it will do.</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant smell, but product does not do what it states. Don&#x27;t buy, it would be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it last a few hours.  If I had relaxed hair maybe it would last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few edge controls and this has been my favorite so far. I have type 4c hair so finding a edge control that works for me. The hold lasts pretty well</li>
    <li> This is music to my ears, or magic to my roots!! i absolutely love it for good control of the edges when you want to wear your hair up. It does build up a bit so i normally use the last days of my &amp;#34;blow-out&amp;#34; when i know i will be washing it again soon. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have ever used when it comes to gels. It&#x27;s not a flaky and controls my edges beautifully</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It hardly gives any residue and really slicks my edges. I have natural hair and this product works really well for me. I have good hold for quite a while. Perhaps not the whole day but for most of the day. I would not recommend this product for fine hair. My hair is very fine in the back and the curl pattern in the back is more like a 3a-3b. I would say this would be too heavy for that texture of hair and because of that could potentially lead to breakage.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair in place. recommend to everyone. Works great for any hair type. 5 stars i used this all the time.</li>
    <li> Well, I purchased this Pomade about 3 weeks ago. For the first 1 minute of applying the product to my edges, I really liked it however, after about three minutes, it started to change by becoming white. By the time it was fully dry, and let say I scratched my hair a little, white flake like structures began to fall all. The area of my hair were this edge control was applied to looked like snow flakes that never melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product was that it held my edges well, however, I would recommend purchasing the Avlon KeraCare Edge Tamer as it holds just as well, and it does not leave white flake like structures once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Avlon for approximately two weeks now and I really like it. In addition, it has a better smell than the hicks Edges Pomade.</li>
    <li> This should not be for edges! Pomade holds hair down . This stuff held nothing down, my edges are not bad and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this edge product and I would say I use it every day but I actually don&#x27;t have too. I use it about every 2 to 3 days and wrap my hair at night. By wrapping it a keep my edges flat and just use a bristle brush to lay them down in the morning. After a week or 2 the build up with need to be washed out, but I wash my hair then any way. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Love the product.  it really smooth down the edges of your hairline.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but the product is NOT worth all the money, if your hair is not relaxed or of a decent texture it will only hold for a good 20 minutes</li>
    <li> Worked great...but doesnt work well with other products.  But it does what it.......  ....... ....... ...... ....... .... ... .</li>
    <li> my baby hair is hard to stay down. it needs extra extra extra holding gel to stay down and I would rather not use that. this works wonders</li>
    <li> This product sucks. Hair edges doesn&#x27;t lay but for like 5-10minutes. Would not recommend buying product save your money.!! Especially if u get sew in and leave front out your hair will look gray and flakey in the&lt;br /&gt;front using product</li>
    <li> For the price, I was disappointed by the flaking.  I do see good results after a fresh was though-I&#x27;m transitioning so I may try it again when I&#x27;m all natural.</li>
    <li> 4a natural hair and slicks my edges for 6-7 hours out the day which is find for me. The product dosent build up and has kept my edges very healthy and long. It seals moisture in my temp,e strands and my edges stretch to my chin. It defiantly helps with edge length retention.</li>
