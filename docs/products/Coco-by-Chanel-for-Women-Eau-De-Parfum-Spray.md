### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Smells real good.</li>
      <li>Excellent purchase.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, dreamy, attractive ,adorable.</li>
      <li>so I went onto Amazon to find a good deal.  </li>
      <li>but then the scent began to warm to my body and combine with my own chemistry, and the match was made!  </li>
      <li>I have never gotten a purchase online so quickly!!!</li>
      <li>I thought it smelled nice on her, but that’s just a man’s opinion.  </li>
      <li>and most seem to know who is wearing it.  </li>
      <li>:-)</li>
      <li>Mi wife uses it for more than 20 years.</li>
      <li>The scent was not the Coco scent (my wife has been using Coco for many years).</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my wife and both she and I love the scent on her.  </li>
      <li>If you like chanel 5 you will love coco, smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Many years ago my scents were Bakir by Germaine Monteil and Lauren from Ralph Lauren, then it was Venice by Laura Biagiotti and Pleasures by Estee Lauder.  </li>
      <li>and I love it what more</li>
      <li>and I thank you :)</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Should of read the reviews first!!!</li>
      <li>Unique, classy, vintage, warmist, strong and sexy are the $$$ factors of this wonderful perfume.</li>
      <li>I am willing to return the perfume for your own evaluation.</li>
      <li>I purchased in good faith a perfume of which when it arrived it was definately not what I normally wear.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many other high end designer colognes but this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>What sealed the match was when, the 1st time I wore it, my man was kissing my inner arm and asked in an appreciative voice \\&quot;what is this perfume?!\\&quot;  Of course he may have wanted some for himself!  </li>
      <li>I will most certainly still buy things through Amazon</li>
      <li>This is a full size 3.4 ounce of the Eau de Parfum spray and it was priced at eighty something.  </li>
      <li>My parent and i love it very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I have loved all Chanel fragrances for a very long time.  </li>
      <li>The perfume did not smell right.</li>
      <li>wear it just about everyday, love it, love it</li>
      <li>This perfume was exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>HaHaHaHaHa!</li>
      <li>I received the product but it wasn&#x27;t the real ones.</li>
      <li>but then u realize its no where closer to the real one in strength and after one minute you cant smell anything which sux so much.</li>
      <li>so thanks a lot</li>
      <li>I could not believe how fast it arrived.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves this perfume, its her favorite... arrived on time and exactly as ordered/advertised... even showed up on my doorstep a few days early!!</li>
      <li>Quality product and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This was not the perfume that is normally sold in stores.</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon right away and they emailed me straight back and sorted this all out for me and gave me my money back etc.  </li>
      <li>When we received the perfume it was clear to us that it is fake.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bottle looks actually real and even the smell is the same</li>
      <li>The perfume bottle had leaked and the parfumerie is old.</li>
      <li>It is much cheaper than to shop at your local store.</li>
      <li>and sadly I bought 3 of them as gifts, and I felt ashamed of giving my loved ones</li>
      <li>Another bottle was sent, a different brand, and it leaked exactly the same way.</li>
      <li>the Coco Chanel bought in the major department stores!&#x27;</li>

<li> the Coco Chanel bought in the major department stores!&#x27;</li>
<li> Does not smell storng fades quickly might be a knock off have brougt this product before had no issue not happy.</li>
<li> they usually carry 20 different sizes &amp; lotions &amp; such.</li>
<li> The smell is not strong and does not last long at all.</li>
<li> will recommend it to other friends...</li>
<li> (and not that girly, pink Coco Mademoiselle either!)</li>
<li> my wife insists this does not smell like the real thing, and is convinced it is a fake.</li>
<li> i think so amazon should have some check up on its third party sellers that what they are selling.its too late to return coz she started using it like after 3 months</li>
<li> i cant believe i paid that much money for a fake Chanel.</li>
<li> This coco perfume was fake the label even said Eau De FARFUME and the labels on the bottle didnt even match the real bottle i already have at home</li>
<li> It smells like it was watered down.</li>
<li> couldn&#x27;t find where i usually buy all my fragrance needs.</li>
<li> That was a dirty trick: I paid real money &amp; I got the fake perfume.</li>
<li> I spent a ton for a few tablespoons of this &amp; my wife got mad because it wasn’t eau de toilette, which I found referred not to something objectionable flushed upon use, but a diluted version of this product.  </li>
<li> Not a good company to deal with.</li>
<li> I WASTED MY MONEY ON THESE 3 - FAKE CHANNEL.</li>
<li> Not Happy</li>
<li> The labels were sloppy and badly printed and the &amp;#34;Coco&amp;#34; font was not right (we have side-by-side photos).</li>
<li> Usually Amazon sellers are decent people but not this seller - awful product, fake through &amp; through!</li>
<li> I bought this perfume for my sister for Christmas and it ended up being a fake .</li>
<li> I received a FAKE bottle of Coco by Chanel for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, when the package arrived, perfume had leaked all over the place.</li>
<li> There is something wrong with this product.</li>
<li> I am disappointed.</li>
<li> It smells awful...</li>
<li> We are very annoying as it is seen that even the product label is a fraude.</li>

    <li> That was a dirty trick: I paid real money &amp; I got the fake perfume. Usually Amazon sellers are decent people but not this seller - awful product, fake through &amp; through!</li>
    <li> Many years ago my scents were Bakir by Germaine Monteil and Lauren from Ralph Lauren, then it was Venice by Laura Biagiotti and Pleasures by Estee Lauder.  Now it&#x27;s Coco!!  (and not that girly, pink Coco Mademoiselle either!) Initially I didn&#x27;t like Coco . . . but then the scent began to warm to my body and combine with my own chemistry, and the match was made!  What sealed the match was when, the 1st time I wore it, my man was kissing my inner arm and asked in an appreciative voice \\&quot;what is this perfume?!\\&quot;  Of course he may have wanted some for himself!  HaHaHaHaHa!</li>
    <li> my wife insists this does not smell like the real thing, and is convinced it is a fake. Bottle looks real enough however. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> Seems to be me.  Everybody seems to like this smell.  and most seem to know who is wearing it.  thiank you.</li>
    <li> This perfume was exactly as promised. I could not believe how fast it arrived. I have never gotten a purchase online so quickly!!!</li>
    <li> i cant believe i paid that much money for a fake Chanel. Bottle looks actually real and even the smell is the same but then u realize its no where closer to the real one in strength and after one minute you cant smell anything which sux so much. i think so amazon should have some check up on its third party sellers that what they are selling.its too late to return coz she started using it like after 3 months so cant do anything with this now. but beware any fragrance don&#x27;t buy it online if you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off</li>
    <li> When we received the perfume it was clear to us that it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;The color was darker.&lt;br /&gt;The stickers were not the same as the one we compared with at Mayc&#x27;s and Dillards.&lt;br /&gt;I feel Amazon should fully refund our money, or I will never purchase from them again. I am willing to return the perfume for your own evaluation.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite scent. I have tried many other high end designer colognes but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> I purchased in good faith a perfume of which when it arrived it was definately not what I normally wear.  I contacted Amazon right away and they emailed me straight back and sorted this all out for me and gave me my money back etc.  I commend there efforts as I thought I would of just had to lose out but it is stories like these that give you confidence in internet sites.  I will most certainly still buy things through Amazon and I thank you :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and I love it what more is there to say. It is much cheaper than to shop at your local store.</li>
    <li> I received the product but it wasn&#x27;t the real ones. and sadly I bought 3 of them as gifts, and I felt ashamed of giving my loved ones these knock offs perfumes. I WASTED MY MONEY ON THESE 3 - FAKE CHANNEL.</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with this product. It smells awful...not like the Coco Chanel bought in the major department stores!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, dreamy, attractive ,adorable.</li>
    <li> Should of read the reviews first!!! This coco perfume was fake the label even said Eau De FARFUME and the labels on the bottle didnt even match the real bottle i already have at home i got from maceys I cant believe amazon lets this seller on their web page I have bought off amazon for 9 years and now what???

    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume, its her favorite... arrived on time and exactly as ordered/advertised... even showed up on my doorstep a few days early!!</li>
    <li> I spent a ton for a few tablespoons of this &amp; my wife got mad because it wasn’t eau de toilette, which I found referred not to something objectionable flushed upon use, but a diluted version of this product.  I thought it smelled nice on her, but that’s just a man’s opinion.  She stopped complaining and I see it eventually got used, so she must’ve like it.  Next anniversary, I’ll buy a bus ticket.</li>
    <li> This was not the perfume that is normally sold in stores. I don&#x27;t know what it is but it was a rip off</li>
    <li> Estoy totalmente decepcionada por el producto recibido,en primer lugar el envase llego con el tapon roto por lo que se habia salido parte del producto,  y en segundo lugar es una imitacion,tenia otro envase verdadero y he podido comprobar que tanto el envase como el perfume en si no es el mismo,deberian advertir que se trata de una imitacion.</li>
    <li> the item never showed up as promised but it did show up on my visa account. i tried to contact cristy,s but they never answered my request in the end. this is how it stands now you all have my money and my daughter never rcvd her christmas gift. so thanks a lot what do you hv to say about this find service</li>
    <li> The perfume bottle had leaked and the parfumerie is old. Not a good company to deal with. I have no number to send it back. Not Happy</li>
    <li> I just find it with my friend&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;It smells well and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to other friends...</li>
    <li> If you like chanel 5 you will love coco, smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it just about everyday, love it, love it</li>
    <li> Unique, classy, vintage, warmist, strong and sexy are the $$$ factors of this wonderful perfume. My parent and i love it very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the $ and not for youth.</li>
    <li> I have loved all Chanel fragrances for a very long time.  I have been out of Coco for a while so I went onto Amazon to find a good deal.  Boy, did I.  This is a full size 3.4 ounce of the Eau de Parfum spray and it was priced at eighty something.  Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a fixer or fraude.No has no coconut smell chanel.Mi wife uses it for more than 20 years.We are very annoying as it is seen that even the product label is a fraude.No should allow vendors so on Amazon</li>
    <li> Does not smell storng fades quickly might be a knock off have brougt this product before had no issue not happy.</li>
    <li> For some reason its not like the one I bought from Boston Store.  The smell is not strong and does not last long at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my sister for Christmas and it ended up being a fake . The label was all crocked and I was so embarrassed. Don&#x27;t buy !!</li>
    <li> The scent was not the Coco scent (my wife has been using Coco for many years). The labels were sloppy and badly printed and the &amp;#34;Coco&amp;#34; font was not right (we have side-by-side photos).</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, when the package arrived, perfume had leaked all over the place. Another bottle was sent, a different brand, and it leaked exactly the same way. There was no refund or further exchanges. .</li>
    <li> I received a FAKE bottle of Coco by Chanel for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray.  Never got my $90.00 back.</li>
    <li> :-) couldn&#x27;t find where i usually buy all my fragrance needs. they usually carry 20 different sizes &amp; lotions &amp; such. they only place i found it was here</li>
