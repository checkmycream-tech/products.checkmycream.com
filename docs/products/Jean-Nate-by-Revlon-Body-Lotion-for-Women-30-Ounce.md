    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jean Nate Hydrating Body Lotion every day for 15+ Years.  I love it&#x27;s light citrus scent and if you like compliments, you&#x27;ll love it too. There&#x27;s no product on the market that can equal it&#x27;s ability to give you what you want---Silky Soft Skin.  I live in a semi-arid state where skin dries out rapidly. Thanks to Jean Nate, I do not have this problem.</li>
    <li> my mom loved this stuff and i had a hard time finding it in stores,,goos price also..she died last month but i was told she felt special getting it in the mail</li>
    <li> I have bought now 2 from the same seller who sent it quickly, and I am well pleased by this product!  For the person who loves Jean Nate this is the product that you do not want to pass up while they are still available!  Excellent Product and Speedy Delivery!!</li>
    <li> I was very lucky to find this product at Amazon.  Apparently, Revlon has re-invented the entire Jean Nate line and the original bright, citrus scent is no longer available except if you can find a seller on Amazon or e-bay who has the old product.  I have no idea what the shelf life is of the older, original products but this body lotion I got was in great condition and the minute I smelled the scent I was 20 years old again (I&#x27;m 52 now)!</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate&#x27; Body Lotion for years. I use this after I take a shower. It is has a clean smell,very refreshing and also helps with dry skin. If I get an itchy spot on my legs or back, I will put some of this on and it will take it away. I recommend this to every woman. Most Body Lotions have a strong perfume smell but this one leaves your body with a fresh clean smell.[[ASIN:B000NP9QRA Jean Nate Smooth Hydrating Body Lotion, Original - 15+15 Oz]]</li>
    <li> I had been looking for several months in local stores for Jean Nate Body Lotion, when I finally decided to give Amazon.com a try. Very surprised to find this product! And at a very reasonable price! Normally I can&#x27;t find it until the Christmas season! Now I know where to go when I cannot find something in the local stores!</li>
    <li> Use all the time.  I grew up with my mom using it and then as I became an adult I found myself using and I just love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner or body lotion. It smells so good and it goes on very nicely. Not greasy at all. Wasn&#x27;t hard to rub in.  I don&#x27;t know why women spend a crap load of money on very expensive lotions when this smells so heavenly at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This a new update my spelling was awful.&lt;br /&gt;I as a man love this lotion. And as a kid in the&lt;br /&gt;70s, I loved how it made me feel like a woman. When I bought Jean Nate Lotion I love&#x27;ed how it smells and when I put it on, it make&#x27;s my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;And now, I use Jean Nate every day when I can.</li>
    <li> I was used this lotion for many years. I do not like any more for price 6x more !!! What is hapen. For price ?&lt;br /&gt;Is many many natural, organic and much cheper</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for many years. Since over the last year price seems to have gone up and most sites indicate out of stock, she called Revlon.

    <li> A great product, and very well received as a Christmas present. Arrived early in good condition. It was for my wife, not me. Accolade.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and it has a delicate, clean , fresh scent. Would  suggest it to anyone that loves Jean Nate</li>
    <li> The bottle was half empty and broken.&lt;br /&gt;It should be replaced or I should get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;H. Gutierrez</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, clean fragrance because it&#x27;s light and not overwhelming!  I use it daily and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> my Jean Nate body lotion 30 0z Product arrived with tops unscrewed so half of product was out of the bottle and in the plastic bag. Absolute mess and lost a lot of product not to say how mad I was for the carelessness of shipper. I had ordered three bottles and two of the three were unscrewed with product everywhere. I love this product but disappointed in shipper. Would not buy again from Amazon unless they do right by me!</li>
    <li> firends sisters loved it and she was pleased as well with the purchase. the amount was just what she had wanted , it will last longer</li>
    <li> Last year I was able to purchase Jean Nate Body Lotion 30oz for $18.00.  This year it is $68+.  How come, why, what happened.  Sprinkled with gold Dust??</li>
    <li> Bought this for Mother-In-Law for Christmas gift like she requested she loves it!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this body lotion. I&#x27;ve used since it came out. Now, it&#x27;s so hard to find it any where. I pray they will keep making it.</li>
