      <li>The reason I love these better than the metal clips or butterfly clips is that...these croc clips do not pull my hair when I go to remove them from my hair..</li>
      <li>Will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Love these clips.</li>

      <li>These are much sturdier and hold my hair much better than the flimsy ones from the store!  </li>

      <li>I have shoulder length thick hair and this clip is the only clip I have found that will securely hold my hair while I blow dry my hair layer by layer and to secure my hair while showering to keep my hair from getting wet.  </li>
      <li>The teeth are a little too sharp though and can easily snag on hair.</li>
      <li>They really hold tight in your hair, and they are pretty in pink!  </li>
      <li>Hold large amounts of hair, wet or dry and stay in place.</li>

<li> I have used this product for a few weeks.</li>
<li> These pulled my hair so badly from the studs on the bottom part of the clip.</li>
