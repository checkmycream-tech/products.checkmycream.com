      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Not only did it not irritate my eyes the mascara itself was great!  </li>

      <li>This goes on smoothly, lengthens and thickens very well, but isn&#x27;t clumpy!</li>

      <li>It dries out a little faster than others, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t add enough oomph to be worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove without heavy creams or a lot of scrubbing, and that&#x27;s what I REALLY like.</li>

<li> It took a while for me to figure out that some ingredient in commercially produced mascaras -- no matter how expensive -- was really hurting my eyes.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find...</li>
<li> Mascara, eyeliner and even eyeshadow can cause extreme irritation and itching and little white bumps on my waterline.</li>
<li> It takes a while to dry after applying, so is very messy.  </li>
<li> I would give it five stars for quality but it ran out in less than a month.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I did not check for an expiration date so this could be normal or it could have been past its sell by date.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this mascara is too heavy for my eyelashes</li>
<li> Also, it&#x27;s very hard to get off.</li>
<li> but it is just bad mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this mascara is too heavy for my eyelashes or it came to me dry.  It appears to be old when you touch it.  However, I like the thickening effect</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it goes on thick and it doesn&#x27;t ever smudge&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts all day long! Try it</li>
    <li> The product came to me with the mascara out of the package and the packaging torn up. I had considered sending it back but did not want to deal with the hassle. I decided to try it out but it is just bad mascara. It does not seem like there is any in the bottle and it requries many coats to even look like I have applied mascara. It absoluetly does not remotely make my eyelashes look any thicker. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It gives your lashes volumen and doesn&#x27;t form grumes. For me it works.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to dry after applying, so is very messy.  Also, it&#x27;s very hard to get off.</li>
    <li> Just like it.  It dries out a little faster than others, but that&#x27;s ok.  I use a cleaned used mascara wand to separate lashes if necessary, when it gets a little older and dries up.  It&#x27;s easy to remove without heavy creams or a lot of scrubbing, and that&#x27;s what I REALLY like.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara for several reasons.  First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  I use mascara to emphasize my eyes--I don&#x27;t want red, irritated eyes!  It also goes on clump free and makes my lashes look thick and natural.  Finally, it doesn&#x27;t flake off, leaving me with raccoon eyes after a few hours.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find...I hope it doesn&#x27;t become discontinued!</li>
    <li> I like Almay for eyes especially if you are sensitive or allergic to other products.  This color is a little more subtle than black if you are pale.</li>
    <li> Works on me.  Makes lashes nice and dark.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years because it is so gentle . I have blepharitis that occasionally acts up . This is the only mascara that has not left me itching or pulling at my lashes .  I love that it easily washes off  also. I was never a fan of waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t add enough oomph to be worth it. If you wanted a polished but super natural daytime mascara it might be ok, but I tend to go without and not spend the time applying.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve tried them all, at every price. This goes on smoothly, lengthens and thickens very well, but isn&#x27;t clumpy! A true miracle! It&#x27;s the absolute best I have tried. Removes easily with make-up remover or wipes. Doesn&#x27;t dry out lashes.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to mascara and happily, have been using this for a couple of weeks with no negative reactions so I&#x27;m happy with it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the length this product gives to my lashes! I usually do more than the one coat because I want my lashes really long but one does a great job if you are in a hurry! Try it out!</li>
    <li> The mascara goes on fine but I have to apply more than once. Stays on without forming clumps. I will buy it again for the color.</li>
    <li> I have eye allergies and can only wear Almay eye makeup.  I live in a small town where our stores do not handle Almat products.  The nearest place to go is 30 miles away to get it.  Glad I can order from Amazon</li>
    <li> This is the only &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; that I am not allergic to (in the black/brown color), so thankful for this.</li>
    <li> Very good mascara for one with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes. Mascara, eyeliner and even eyeshadow can cause extreme irritation and itching and little white bumps on my waterline. I searched for a mascara I could wear that wouldn&#x27;t leave me in pain and wanting to take my eye makeup off immediately. This product was recommended to me and I took a chance. I am very happy with the results. Not only did it not irritate my eyes the mascara itself was great!  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that does NOT make my eyes red-rimmed and itchy.  It took a while for me to figure out that some ingredient in commercially produced mascaras -- no matter how expensive -- was really hurting my eyes.  I tried a few other hypo-allergenic products without much luck.  Then I tried Almay.  No itch, no red rim and a nice, even coating of mascara.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars for quality but it ran out in less than a month.  Unfortunately, I did not check for an expiration date so this could be normal or it could have been past its sell by date.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 star because I like almay products and I decided to try brown. The color works great, but it&#x27;s a little drier then I expected for being mascara. A key tip though, put a few drops of (eye) saline solution in it to mix and it keeps it moist.</li>
    <li> Yikes. Older versions a pleasure. This was flakey. So much for newer is better.  Am switching brands after 15 years. Another out-sourced product??</li>
