    <li> I should have read the reviews. I end up getting a syringe from my veterinarian. Not worth the wait. Coming from overseas.</li>
    <li> It may be a fine product but be prepared to wait...and wait..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed this syringe to dispense a tinted caulk around my kitchen sink. The estimated arrival date is almost a full month after my order date.. I have since found that West Marine sells 10 oz empty caulking tubes that are specifically meant to be used for dispensing epoxy&#x27;s and caulk&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> After a while,  the round handle piece breaks and the numbers completely rub off easily.</li>

    <li> this was larger than I expected and won&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for but nonetheless I can use it for other projects.  it is very sturdy and the rubber washer on the plunger makes a good seal.  two sized tips and cap. mine is exactly as pictured. it was shipped from China and arrived earlier than predicted. altho it says it is for single use I expect it is reusable with water soluble liquids</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely shipping.</li>

    <li> use it for my fish tank water chemicals</li>
    <li> ...........mine came broken......top edge that you hold onto to pull out the plunger........plunger works but the top edge is VERY sharp. i don&#x27;t want to pay the postage - otherwise i&#x27;d send it back.</li>
    <li> The syringe itself is fine but not as pictured with a closed loop on the plunger. The plunger just has a flat end like most syringes. The included vinyl tubing is rather stiff and low quality but I did not need to use it for what I needed anyway.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my Halloween prop.</li>
    <li> Works just fine, took forever came from china.</li>
    <li> Just the medium I needed for a proper  indoor watering. Very useful for small plants. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product... handy for measuring nutrients for hydroponics solution.  Shipping is very slow compared to most other purchases made on Amazon, but don&#x27;t give up...it will get there in about 10 days.</li>
    <li> I hope to use soon, to see if this will work with what I had intended to use it for.</li>
    <li> good quality has tip adapter- long ship time but its worth it</li>
    <li> Great Tool for stuff and things like that</li>
