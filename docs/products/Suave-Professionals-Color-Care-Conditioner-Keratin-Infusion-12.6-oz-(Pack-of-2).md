      <li>I have my redken of course, but i always keep a good bottle of cheap conditioner on hand!.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend staying away from this kind if there is a possibility that your skin won&#x27;t take to it.</li>

      <li>I fell in love with the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner and decided to stock up.</li>
      <li>gave it 4 stars because while I can accept the scent of this product, its not my favorite.</li>
      <li>smell much better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s even better.</li>
      <li>Oh, it appears to repair better than any higher-priced products that I was attempting to use.  </li>
      <li>As one person said, this is NOT COLOR SAFE.  </li>
      <li>I just love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I will use them interchangeably, this color care version more in the summer time to combat fading from the sun.</li>
      <li>I think it is great and at this point, I am not afraid of how much I use!</li>
      <li>The smell is a clean smell, which I love.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so smooth after a months use.  </li>
      <li>silky smooth hair.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price along with free shipping.</li>
      <li>It relaxes my hair, and makes my hair free of frizz.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Suave is well on its way to making some great products finally, not only inexpensive functional ones.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so smooth.</li>
      <li>For the price this stuff is amazing, it makes my hair feel so smooth and really does help to keep to fly-aways in-check.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a very good product, particularly for the price, and I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>It Leaves the hair feeling very healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is so rich feeling that it almost feels like you rinsed after shampooing.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much smoother and more manageable.</li>
      <li>They are good to use to make Keratin treatment last longer.</li>
      <li>felt the difference after the very first use.</li>
      <li>, I figured it was worth</li>
      <li>I have used more than a dozen hair smoothing, defrizzing products and none really made much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of conditioners, both cheap and expensive and this is the best, bar none!</li>
      <li>right?...</li>
      <li>Lucky for me, this stuff is very affordable.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and easy to comb out when getting out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>it makes your hair smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and condiditoner work very well!</li>
      <li>I started using this when it first came out</li>
      <li>(Thanks, y&#x27;all! :</li>
      <li>have since bought several other Suave Professionals products, and am thus far equally impressed.</li>
      <li>a couple days after I used it, and some of my students asked if I flat ironed my hair:-)</li>
      <li>I have curly thick hair, for an inexpensive conditioner, this one is pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>But, again, for the price, this will work just fine, and I like that it is going to help me reduce the overall amount of money I end up spending on my hair.</li>
      <li>My colored-hair doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
      <li>It really works in getting the frizz out and detangles</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is good for the money, but my hair is not spectacular after using it.</li>
      <li>I do let my hair dry naturally as it curls better that way</li>
      <li>Both leave my hair smooth and soft, the original slightly moreso.  </li>
      <li>my hair has become increasingly frizzy as I have gotten older.  </li>
      <li>The only downside, is I can&#x27;t go 2 days without washing my hair as it is a bit more greasy then with regular shampoos.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes cheaper price does not mean cheaper product.  </li>
      <li>I have long, coarse, wavy hair, which I dye because mine is mostly gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine, lightly wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to being really poofy due to how lightweight it is, and this helps cut the pouf way down.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz in humidity (and living in FL, there&#x27;s a lot of that!)</li>
      <li>Since I colored my hair recently for the first time in 2 years, I decided to try this out.</li>
      <li>I have long, silky, curly hair…  When styled with the right product.  </li>
      <li>After using this for a short time my hair stylist from an expensive salon told me my hair was beautiful and asked what I was using on it.  </li>
      <li>Between washings, if my ends look frizzy, I apply just enough to wet the ends, run my hair dryer through (with the fine comb attachment) and the look is refreshed.</li>
      <li>Works ALMOST as well as the original version with less color bleed.</li>
      <li>The product stands up to any professional item I have tried.</li>
      <li>no frizz, just wavy curls that feel amazingly soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>and she couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair had become.</li>
      <li>My hair remains light and moves but if your hair type is different it may weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I have spent much, much, much more for other products and I don&#x27;t feel this one is too much different from some of them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I moved after 6 months and my new stylist did the same thing.  </li>
      <li>when flat ironed, with a little more body.)I am starting to actually like my hair!</li>
      <li>so far all I got were big thank yous!</li>
      <li>My hair is no longer a hot mess!</li>
      <li>I simply wash, condition, scrunch and dry naturally.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels soft and easy to comb out when getting out of the shower.  The smell is a clean smell, which I love.  You can&#x27;t beat the price along with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used more than a dozen hair smoothing, defrizzing products and none really made much of a difference.  Surprisingly, it is this product from Suave that works the best.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragance, so I added some of my own Rosemary essential oil and I love this stuff!  After all the money wasted on expensive products, it&#x27;s Suave that worked the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I have bought so many expensive repair kits and lotion for my overdyed hair and none of it worked as well as this suave. My stylist asked what i&#x27;d done to hair as she was always commenting on it&#x27;s dryness and she couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair had become. I also use Lanza k2 keratin leave in conditioner as well as the Suave keratin color care shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the reviews were glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be so-so.  As one person said, this is NOT COLOR SAFE.  I see all my color being washed down the drain with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good for the money, but my hair is not spectacular after using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my difficult hair and this works just as good as the expensive salon brands, if not better!</li>
    <li> I received a solicitation for a Keratin home treatment. When I checked it out, my hair didn&#x27;t \\&quot;qualify\\&quot; for the treatment, BUT somehow I stumbled upon this conditioner instead. I decided to give it a try because I had a $2 off coupon so it would be relatively inexpensive. What a great surprise. This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried everything including just about all the salon products. My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz in humidity (and living in FL, there&#x27;s a lot of that!) This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth and best of all, when I go out in the humidity, it doesn&#x27;t frizz up. Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, but I saw/felt the difference after the very first use.</li>
    <li> I have long, coarse, wavy hair, which I dye because mine is mostly gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using various conditioning treatments for years, always on a quest to find the best product. I&#x27;ve used S-Factor, Joico, and many others. I decided to try this after I used the Suave Keratin Leave-in Conditioner, which I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a very good product, particularly for the price, and I plan on purchasing more in the future. I have spent much, much, much more for other products and I don&#x27;t feel this one is too much different from some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because while I can accept the scent of this product, its not my favorite. I like the S-Factor leave-in conditioner smell much better. But, again, for the price, this will work just fine, and I like that it is going to help me reduce the overall amount of money I end up spending on my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells so good.  I have wavy/curly hair and it kept the frizz controlled.  Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  I hope Suave continues this line.  I also purchased the shampoo and leave in conditioner which all work well.</li>
    <li> I love SUAVE! When I found out they had packs online that you could order, I fell in love! This product works so well on my hair! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> im returning this item because i never ordered this all i ordered was swave professiona keritin heat defense leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair, for an inexpensive conditioner, this one is pretty darn good.  I have my redken of course, but i always keep a good bottle of cheap conditioner on hand!.  this one rocks!</li>
    <li> I have long, silky, curly hair…  When styled with the right product.  If not, it is long, curly, frizzy hair.  I started using this when it first came out and I love it.  I do let my hair dry naturally as it curls better that way and it keeps it healthier.  I have bought and used $20/bottle shampoo and conditioner with little to no benefit.  After using this for a short time my hair stylist from an expensive salon told me my hair was beautiful and asked what I was using on it.  She was shocked when I told her.  I moved after 6 months and my new stylist did the same thing.  I think it is great and at this point, I am not afraid of how much I use!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel great. I have fine, lightly wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to being really poofy due to how lightweight it is, and this helps cut the pouf way down.</li>
    <li> I just love this conditioner. it adds just the perfect amount of zing to the colored hair and in combination with the color care shampoo it&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU SUAVE!. THE PRICE, QUALITY, AND PERFORMANCE. WILL DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Sometimes cheaper price does not mean cheaper product.  The Suave line is amazing...get the shampoo as well, they both are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner and decided to stock up. That&#x27;s when I discovered this color care version. Since I colored my hair recently for the first time in 2 years, I decided to try this out. Works ALMOST as well as the original version with less color bleed. I will use them interchangeably, this color care version more in the summer time to combat fading from the sun. Both leave my hair smooth and soft, the original slightly moreso.  I am black and use them as leave-ins on my relaxed hair (sometimes co-wash with them but prefer Suave rosemary mint conditioner for that application and following with these) I know this line carries a leave-in but I prefer the thickness of these. Provides the perfect slip for my hair type. After applying to barely towel dried hair, I seal with natural oil (like sweet almond, kukui nut, kemy oil, or other) and dry with a hand held dryer with wide tooth comb attachment. I like to finish with a small amount of jojoba oil. My hair remains light and moves but if your hair type is different it may weigh it down. I HIGHLY recommend.  Between washings, if my ends look frizzy, I apply just enough to wet the ends, run my hair dryer through (with the fine comb attachment) and the look is refreshed.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this conditioner for the price! I have long, naturally-curly hair and don&#x27;t blow dry or straighten my hair. I simply wash, condition, scrunch and dry naturally. This conditioner helps to tame my wild &amp; crazy locks and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used!! it makes your hair smooth and soft! I have tried a lot of conditioners, both cheap and expensive and this is the best, bar none!</li>
    <li> For the price this stuff is amazing, it makes my hair feel so smooth and really does help to keep to fly-aways in-check.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so smooth. I love  Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Color Care conditioner. My colored-hair doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
    <li> This seems to be making my hair quite a bit stronger.  It works perfectly well to end dryness and frizz from blow-drying and then flat-ironing.  It takes me out of the frizz and straighten damage cycle that I was in for very little cost.  Oh, it appears to repair better than any higher-priced products that I was attempting to use.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It Leaves the hair feeling very healthy and soft. It has a very pleasant fragrance. Price is very reasonable. The product stands up to any professional item I have tried.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is quite excellent. It really works in getting the frizz out and detangles well. The shampoo is so rich feeling that it almost feels like you rinsed after shampooing. Very good value. Suave is well on its way to making some great products finally, not only inexpensive functional ones.</li>
    <li> I am a Paul Mitchell fan but on a whim I thoyght I would try this and boy was I shocked!!! My hair has never looked or felt better. My stylist ask me if I changed product when I told her I use this she is recommending to all her clients!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and condiditoner work very well! The only downside, is I can&#x27;t go 2 days without washing my hair as it is a bit more greasy then with regular shampoos. But it definitly keeps the frizz out!</li>
    <li> love this product. silky smooth hair. I&#x27;ve given this as a token gift to my sisters, and so far all I got were big thank yous!</li>
    <li> my hair has become increasingly frizzy as I have gotten older.  Last year I tried multiple shampoos/conditioners before finding this product.  Nowadays, I wash my hair about twice a week using this and the matching shampoo, then put just a dab of organic raw coconut oil on my hair while it is still damp.  and let it airdry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is gorgeous again...no frizz, just wavy curls that feel amazingly soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Yes, I typically turn my nose up at names such as Suave.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m not sure why- I happened to stumble upon this page, and the glowing reviews caught my eye. (Thanks, y&#x27;all! :o)&lt;br /&gt;So, I figured it was worth a try- I can always donate it to a shelter or something, right?...&lt;br /&gt;Am I ever happy to eat crow! This conditioner leaves my hair softer and shinier than any Alterna or Chi product, et al., that I have tried. Seriously. I am stunned.&lt;br /&gt;I have since bought several other Suave Professionals products, and am thus far equally impressed. Who knew??</li>
    <li> I bought this with the shampoo, heat protectant and leave in conditioner.  What a GREAT buy!!  My hair is so smooth after a months use.  My hair is no longer a hot mess!</li>
    <li> I have thick, bushy, very frizzy and unmanageable hair...that also happens to be going prematurely gray/white, so I color it. I have always hated my hair. I saw this and the matching shampoo in a store a few weeks ago and figured I would give it a try. I didn&#x27;t even expect much, but it is great! My hair is so much smoother and more manageable. One of my co-workers actually asked me what I used on my hair a couple days after I used it, and some of my students asked if I flat ironed my hair:-) (It looks a lot like it does when flat ironed, with a little more body.)I am starting to actually like my hair! Lucky for me, this stuff is very affordable. I also like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> It relaxes my hair, and makes my hair free of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the shampoo,  they are my best buy !</li>
    <li> This infusion Suave has some weird oil in it that completely made me break out.  I would recommend staying away from this kind if there is a possibility that your skin won&#x27;t take to it.</li>
    <li> These sell for a great price and They shipped quickly. They are good to use to make Keratin treatment last longer.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  So...</li>
