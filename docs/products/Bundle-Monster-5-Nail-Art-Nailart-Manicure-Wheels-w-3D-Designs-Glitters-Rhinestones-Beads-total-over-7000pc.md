      <li>Yes, the rings are small, and the picture makes them seem larger, but there are MORE than enough little beads in each section for several nail art creations.</li>

<li> i was pleasently surprised,not only was it exactly what i was looking for, it got here in way less time than they said it would!!!</li>
<li> Will last for a very long time.</li>
<li> Little tip.. take a dotting tool and dip it in clear coat to transfer these on to your nails</li>
<li> However, there is a wide range of different colors of both rhinestones, beads, and decorative hearts, shapes, etc.</li>
<li> Not nearly as packed as the picture.</li>
<li> I will be using this for a long time!</li>
<li> Some wheels were harder to turn than others.  </li>
<li> The little circles cases come way smaller than what they appear to be here on the pictures and have less rhinestones than shown</li>
<li> There is even little pink playboy bunny cut-out.</li>
<li> Everything from very small to larger!  </li>
<li> A few of the glitters got into the other parts</li>
<li> The slots are not nearly as full as pictured in the default image.</li>
<li> I was a little disapointed as well..</li>
<li> BECAUSE I COULD NOT USE THESE, SO A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t believe people have complained about the size/amount with the price if this compared to buying it at Sally&#x27;s or any other beauty supply store.</li>
<li> , I mean where else you going to find something like this around.</li>
<li> THE QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD</li>
<li> When I received it, they were small!!!</li>
<li> Yes, some of the beads end up in the wrong section</li>
<li> but I guess i was wrong.</li>
<li> Too bad we can&#x27;t select which beads we&#x27;d like in the wheels, because I won&#x27;t plan on using the \\&quot;playboy\\&quot; bunny or the clover ones.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is complaining. Yes, the rings are small, and the picture makes them seem larger, but there are MORE than enough little beads in each section for several nail art creations. This would last me FOREVER. I think for the price you cannot beat it and I love all the different selections. Yes, some of the beads end up in the wrong section but it&#x27;s not that bad. I think it&#x27;s definatley worth it, especially for me. Then again, I am not a manicurist so maybe that&#x27;s why I am not so picky.</li>
    <li> Loved the variety of colors in similar designs.  Too bad we can&#x27;t select which beads we&#x27;d like in the wheels, because I won&#x27;t plan on using the \\&quot;playboy\\&quot; bunny or the clover ones.  Some wheels were harder to turn than others.  Will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I received these before the estimated date and it was exactly what I expected. A few of the glitters got into the other parts but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t fix. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
    <li> Overall definately a deal. Not nearly as packed as the picture. i got about 10-20 of the nicer larger rhinestones. There is even little pink playboy bunny cut-out.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price! Shipping was fast and they came not damaged. Some rhinestones were stuck together though, but I&#x27;m using them and I think that I would never get so many rhinestones so cheap!!!!!!!! I am very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> When I got this I the mail I was sooooo excited.But, when I opened it I was kind of dissapointed because I thought the wheels would be bigger...... but I guess i was wrong.But I love the product is really great and I bought this to use for my polymer clay creations.Im sooo Happy :D I would recommend itt!!!!!</li>
    <li> The little circles cases come way smaller than what they appear to be here on the pictures and have less rhinestones than shown</li>
    <li> Lots of choice here!  Everything from very small to larger!  Looking forward to trying some new designs with them!</li>
    <li> Yes, the wheels are small, but each wheel comes with a great variety of beads, rhinestones and sequins.  I got multiple colors of rhinestones and beads.  The sequins (may be a better term for it - decals?) I got include gold Mickey Mouse heads, moons, tear drops, stars, hearts, squares, rounds, flowers and playboy bunny heads.  My local beauty supply store charges about $10 for the contents of one of these wheels.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to get this in the mail, since I have recently picked up nailart as a hobby. I was a bit dissappointed to see the package when I opened it. The slots are not nearly as full as pictured in the default image. However, there is a wide range of different colors of both rhinestones, beads, and decorative hearts, shapes, etc. But neverthless, it gives a lot of options for different nailarts :). I will be using this for a long time!</li>
    <li> When I saw this, I thought the wheels were going to be big thinking in the picture it showed pretty big. When I received it, they were small!!! It is literally about 2.5 Inches. So you are aware of it... I was a little disapointed as well.. The rhinestones where kind of mixed with the others not really a problem for me tho. But I am very excited to use it on my nails. Havnt gotten around to it but will soon. I believe it is a fair price, I mean where else you going to find something like this around. I also received it pretty quick!!</li>
    <li> THE SHIPPING AND TIME I HAD TO RECIVE WAS GREAT. HOWEVER, THE STONES ARE NOT THE BEST QUALITY.  WHEN TOP COAT IS APPLIED THE SHINE IS REMOVED AND LANDS UP LOOKING LIKE 3 D ART OF PAINT INSTEAD OF STONES. THE QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. I HAD TO GO BUY ANOTHER SET BECAUSE I COULD NOT USE THESE, SO A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
    <li> the product was pretty much as described, a very good deal. Not much else to say but worth the money</li>
    <li> Loved this set, a great variety of options. Can&#x27;t believe people have complained about the size/amount with the price if this compared to buying it at Sally&#x27;s or any other beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! And this requires a set amount of words to submit, i don&#x27;t know what else to say !!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome color and my new favorite color. This will be added to my collection of nail polishes.</li>
    <li> the wheels were a little small, but the contents were beautiful. even though i only got 10 red heart rhinestones.</li>
    <li> These Nail Art  wheels are Smaller Then in the Picture The Picture is  Taken From a Closer Look ,the glitter is cute I only wish the wheels were bigger and fuller</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great value for ten bucks.  The wheels are smaller than I imagined, but each section of the wheel was pretty full, and there was an awesome assortment of designs and colors.  Overall I am very pleased and would purchase again! Each wheel is individually wrapped so you don&#x27;t have to open them all to get one decoration out.</li>
    <li> Great rhinestones for the price. These are great for someone looking to jazz up their manicure. Little tip.. take a dotting tool and dip it in clear coat to transfer these on to your nails</li>
    <li> Hey!!! I just wanted to say that I love the Bundle package that I ordered...I think if you are looking for a variety of designs then I think this would be good for you. Small,Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> i was pleasently surprised,not only was it exactly what i was looking for, it got here in way less time than they said it would!!! great</li>
    <li> This is not what I wanted.</li>
