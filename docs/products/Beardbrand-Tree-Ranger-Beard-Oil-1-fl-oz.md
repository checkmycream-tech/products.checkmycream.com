      <li>But after about an hour was much more mild and still pleasant.</li>

      <li>Overall, it is an awesome product that I will be purchasing again!</li>
      <li>After using Tree Ranger for only around a week, I can already say this stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>That product was more like a gel, in that it held the hair in place, but also added un-wanted body.</li>
      <li>I Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Husband said- after a while the scent gets overwhelming.</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that I can rub my bread without getting oily hands.</li>
      <li>Feels more brittle and wiry .</li>
      <li>I love my beard oil</li>
      <li>I would say that my goatee looks well groomed, and even at 1.5 inches it looks shorter and more even.</li>
      <li>Makes your beard feel better and more manageable.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>The bottle also needs a better way to dispense the oil.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and really softens beard and face</li>
      <li>I have a more cologne-esque oil.</li>
      <li>$ i like it much better .</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more cologne-like beard oil, this one&#x27;s not for you, but if you want something unique to try and differentiate yourself with, go for it!</li>
      <li>Nice smell though a bit more eucalyptus than described and fades fast.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells just like a cedar, and strong too.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
      <li>One of the manliest smells available.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of taming my wild and wiry beard.</li>
      <li>it goes a long ways, adds shape to your beard and smells great.</li>
      <li>the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time highly recommend it to anybody already have 2 or 3 friends of mine who work on a railroad</li>
      <li>Makes the beard nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Just make sure when you apply your beard is nice and dry.</li>
      <li>At first the scent seemed strong to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong at first but fades quickly .</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and does the job managing my beard.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, though it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s obviously a little bit of an exaggeration but the stuff does seem to improve the quality of my beard and smells great.</li>
      <li>I love putting this stuff on after washing up, it has a really outdoorsy and fresh scent that is not too obnoxious but really wakes you up.</li>
      <li>Just the right balance of oil and scent.  </li>
      <li>When ordering products for Christmas that were out of stock, they upgraded my order to another product at a higher cost with no charge to me.  </li>
      <li>Does nothing but make your beard smell better briefly.</li>
      <li>First time buying beard oil and wish I would have done so a lot sooner.</li>
      <li>Only problem is that I find myself using too much of it and have to order more.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very strong coming out of the bottle but it wears off pretty quickly leaving just a small amount of fragrance.</li>
      <li>Once you throw cedars through a wood chipper and you have a layer of cedar dust inside your nasal passages, you really understand what cedars smell like</li>
      <li>though I&#x27;ve not had any problems with getting too much, I can always get the dime size amount they suggest.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>My mustache grows much faster and thicker, and thought if I&#x27;m going to try this then I should go all in.</li>
      <li>Water and oil don&#x27;t mix very well.</li>
      <li>After a few minutes it soaks in completely, leaving your beard soft and smelling great.</li>
      <li>so i guess that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m at 1.5 inches now and tried the cheap stuff from a local salon.</li>
      <li>Very nice even included a couple little extra things</li>
      <li>The scent is one of the better scents of any other beard oils I have tried and it combs into my beard very well.</li>
      <li>Nice scent not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Softens your bread while pleasing the better half.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>When my Beardbrand order arrived, I followed the instructions on my clean dry goatee and mustache.</li>
      <li>Stay away from the cheap oils, they often have other ingredients which are not always natural or aid in the grooming of your beard.</li>
      <li>also the sent is so smooth a little sharp on the Eucalyptus and light on the pine and ceder for my taste</li>
      <li>Bottle is a little difficult to use as you&#x27;ve got to give it some good shakes to free the oil,</li>
      <li>Earthy, woodsy, masculine smell.  </li>
      <li>It did not leave my beard feeling soft and luxurious .</li>
      <li>Looking to get new fragrances in the near future.</li>
      <li>I saw results within a few days and after 1 1/2 weeks of usage had tremendously softened my beard.</li>
      <li>it is a little more costly than some other brands i have looked up and tried</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of Beardbrand &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; line oils (as well as a few other brands) and this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>after it got to a certain length due to</li>
      <li>so it does not dry out</li>
      <li>great scent, consistency is not too thin or thick</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Quick delivery great produxt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It is easy to apply and smells good. Definetly help with breaking hairs and what not. Just make sure when you apply your beard is nice and dry. Water and oil don&#x27;t mix very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great brand!  Will buy from them in the future</li>
    <li> Does nothing but make your beard smell better briefly. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Best beard oil makes the beard soft and smell awesome.</li>
    <li> Good oil, stays in your beard and gives a nice sheen.  Not sure yet if it softens the beard and skin as I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks.  Bottle is a little difficult to use as you&#x27;ve got to give it some good shakes to free the oil, though I&#x27;ve not had any problems with getting too much, I can always get the dime size amount they suggest.  Scent sticks strongly for about an hour, and weak for about two.  Which in my experience is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tree Ranger: only get this is you want to smell like a cedar.  Seriously.  This stuff smells just like a cedar, and strong too.  If you&#x27;re looking for a more cologne-like beard oil, this one&#x27;s not for you, but if you want something unique to try and differentiate yourself with, go for it! I wear this one everyday and when I go out I have a more cologne-esque oil.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beard oil!  I&#x27;ve tried all of Beardbrand &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; line oils (as well as a few other brands) and this one is my favorite.  Earthy, woodsy, masculine smell.  Only problem is that I find myself using too much of it and have to order more.  Birdbrained customer service has also been great.  When ordering products for Christmas that were out of stock, they upgraded my order to another product at a higher cost with no charge to me.  Great company!  Great products!</li>
    <li> Excellent, awesome  scent and no more flakes on the front of my shirt.</li>
    <li> Awesome aroma- not greasy- I look forward to using this every morning. Can&#x27;t believe I have had a beard for so long without this</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I like the consistency, though the benefits are debatable.  This oil is very thin, and seems to not do as much as hoped for a thick or course beard.  The bottle also needs a better way to dispense the oil.  If you&#x27;re at all hesitant about the price, remember to look into an eyedropper or oral syringe as you&#x27;ll need a better way to pour it without wasting anything.  The smell is wonderful, though it doesn&#x27;t last long.  Depending on how long this bottle actually lasts, I may or may not order again.  3 stars all around.</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed with this beard oil. Stay away from the cheap oils, they often have other ingredients which are not always natural or aid in the grooming of your beard. I was hesitant to spend $25 on any grooming product. It&#x27;s not what men do! I&#x27;ve kept my goatee to about 1/3 to 1/2 inch in length for many years because it irritated me when growing longer and was impossible to control. However I decided to give it another try growing out and knew that I would need help controlling the appearance and comfort.  I&#x27;m at 1.5 inches now and tried the cheap stuff from a local salon. That product was more like a gel, in that it held the hair in place, but also added un-wanted body. And left a greasy feel to my goatee. When my Beardbrand order arrived, I followed the instructions on my clean dry goatee and mustache. My mustache grows much faster and thicker, and thought if I&#x27;m going to try this then I should go all in. At first the scent seemed strong to me. But after about an hour was much more mild and still pleasant. There is none of that &amp;#34;extra body&amp;#34; feeling to my goatee. It appears like it is lying naturally with a slight sheen. The fly-away whiskers are not at all noticeable. I would say that my goatee looks well groomed, and even at 1.5 inches it looks shorter and more even. Over the next few days I plan on limiting the amount I apply (a dime is too much for 1.5 inches), to get it dialed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely adding Beardbrand to my Amazon father&#x27;s day wish list. Looking forward to trying their other oils.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Does a good job of taming my wild and wiry beard. The scent is great. I work in the tree care industry and a lot of my work deals with removing cedars. Once you throw cedars through a wood chipper and you have a layer of cedar dust inside your nasal passages, you really understand what cedars smell like and I think the cedar scent in this oil is great. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. The scent is one of the better scents of any other beard oils I have tried and it combs into my beard very well. My only knock on this product is that it could use a pump to get the oil out of the bottle as opposed to just the open container.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Smells good. Need to grow my beard out completely to see the best results :)</li>
    <li> Your beard will smell like your hands smell after cutting down a Christmas tree while wearing a flannel shirt. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re at least a little lumbersexual.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t leave your beard all oily and greasy. The scent is very strong coming out of the bottle but it wears off pretty quickly leaving just a small amount of fragrance. Softens my beard just as well as Amish beard balm.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week or two and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my beard from just brushing, as I did before.</li>
    <li> i have had beard dandruff now for months and had a frizzy grizzly face this stuff is amaze-balls my dry skin cleared up in a matter of days and i am now down to using it every other day and it holds up it is a little more costly than some other brands i have looked up and tried but i will not buy another beard oil. also the sent is so smooth a little sharp on the Eucalyptus and light on the pine and ceder for my taste but my girl likes it so i guess that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  Just the right balance of oil and scent.  I&#x27;ve even used a little in my hair.  Though at $25/bottle, I can&#x27;t get too crazy there.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Purchased 2 weeks before birth of child with concern that my beard would be too rough for her delicate skin. I saw results within a few days and after 1 1/2 weeks of usage had tremendously softened my beard. This product softened up my beard, has ended my dandruff issues and the scent is perfect. I don&#x27;t fear scratching my daughters face/skin when holding &amp; kissing her. Will buy again when current bottle nears empty.</li>
    <li> My beard smells like I just got done giving a beautiful, mossy, old-growth redwood a mustache ride. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Husband said- after a while the scent gets overwhelming. We could try another scentl, but overall for usage he gives it a 4.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Nice smell though a bit more eucalyptus than described and fades fast. That said I am damn happy with it!</li>
    <li> After using Tree Ranger for only around a week, I can already say this stuff is awesome! I love putting this stuff on after washing up, it has a really outdoorsy and fresh scent that is not too obnoxious but really wakes you up. Overall, it is an awesome product that I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Great product and he loved the way it made his beard feel and smell. Would definitely recommend for others to buy</li>
    <li> I love my beard oil I use it every day</li>
    <li> Nice scent not overwhelming. Arrived quickly and does the job managing my beard. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Makes your beard feel better and more manageable. Keeps your face from feeling as dry also. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great product, smells great but not overpowering, makes beard more manageable and shiny, and they actually list the ingredients, unlike some of the snake oil that is being sold online.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really softens beard and face</li>
    <li> Smells awesome on my face without being obnoxious or making me feel high. Get some.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. This oil takes some of the shaggy out of my shaggy beard and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to realize what the smell reminded me of; but I narrowed it down to what my flannel shirt smells like after I&#x27;ve been carrying firewood around the camp. One of the manliest smells available. Be your lover&#x27;s lumberjack!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! it goes a long ways, adds shape to your beard and smells great.</li>
    <li> What does manly smell like? This beard oil. That&#x27;s obviously a little bit of an exaggeration but the stuff does seem to improve the quality of my beard and smells great.</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  I only wash my beard twice a week so it does not dry out (I use Burt&#x27;s Baby Shampoo)..  Every morning when i shower I either wash my beard or just give it a rinse and then when it is DRY (oil and water don&#x27;t mix) I put a few drops (about eight) in my palm, work my hands together and get it worked through my beard.  There are some You Tube videos showing how to do this properly.  This restores the oil in your beard.  After a few minutes it soaks in completely, leaving your beard soft and smelling great. Not at all oily, just healthy.  The Tea Ranger is my favorite.  The Tea Tree is a bit too minty for my taste, but my fiancee likes it.  The smell is not over whelming.  With this product, I have notice that my hair is more healthy and grows out longer, not breaking like it used to after it got to a certain length due to it being dry and brittle.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to take care of your beard!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based solely on previous reviews . I find the scent pleasing . It&#x27;s a bit strong at first but fades quickly . I personally did not care for it otherwise . It did not leave my beard feeling soft and luxurious . Feels more brittle and wiry . Previously i had used Moroccan argan oil i  purchased at Walgreens for 6$ i like it much better .</li>
    <li> the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time highly recommend it to anybody already have 2 or 3 friends of mine who work on a railroad say is it really helps soften the beard after a long hard day and hot summers and cold winters working on locomotives</li>
    <li> great scent, consistency is not too thin or thick</li>
    <li> Makes the beard nice and soft. 4* because  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. Overall a solid product, I&#x27;ll order a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> Love this. First time buying beard oil and wish I would have done so a lot sooner. Makes my beard look shiny and rejuvenated unlike dry and wirey without it. Would recommend this to anyone. Looking to get new fragrances in the near future.</li>
    <li> Very nice even included a couple little extra things</li>
    <li> This is my second order. In between I tried a lesser or cheaper beard oil based on reviews. And what a mess! Didn&#x27;t smell as good almost bad and left my hands oily. I think some of the comments are based on the roughness of ones beard. I have to say my wife loves the smell and I love the fact that I can rub my bread without getting oily hands. This stuff works! Softens your bread while pleasing the better half.</li>
