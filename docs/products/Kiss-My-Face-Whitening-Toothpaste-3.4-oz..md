      <li>Wonderful toothpaste all natural</li>

      <li>but the taste is good and my mouth feels very fresh after brushing with it.</li>
      <li>Good mild minty taste.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans as well as the more abrasive, mainstream brands, but I can get used to it.</li>
      <li>After 6 months of using this toothpaste i had more plack build up then</li>
      <li>This toothpaste has neither of those and has a lovely, minty flavor.  </li>
      <li>but sure do love this over any &#x27;norm&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Leading you to believe you get more for your money.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>addition to that most important</li>
      <li>(I realize this last comment does not apply to most men :P)</li>
      <li>I use to use Tom&#x27;s until I could not get the gel kind and switched to this brand, and actually Ireally like it better!</li>
      <li>, I love the feeling of it, and it taste fresh and minty.</li>
      <li>It was the first organic toothpaste I ever tried and it works soo much better then \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpastes.</li>
      <li>and I fall in love at first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was quite pleased with the refreshing taste and it left my teeth feeling smooth and clean!         </li>
      <li>As a dentist &amp; health nut, it is challenging to find something that not only is effective, but that you believe in.</li>
      <li>It also makes my teeth feel squeaky clean every time I use it, as if I&#x27;d just had a teeth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
      <li>paste tastes awesome, really subtle mint, and the texture, even though it is not as &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; as regular pastes, is pleasant.</li>
      <li>feel clean and fresh and eco earth friendly.</li>
      <li>AHHHH fresh breath.</li>
      <li>I heard good reviews of kiss my face and decided I&#x27;ll go ahead and give natural toothpaste one last whirl..</li>
      <li>I was actually quite surprised on how great tasting this natural toothpaste was!</li>
      <li>Great tooth paste with taste that last a long time.</li>
      <li>So comparing this to other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; whitening toothpastes and tooth powders, we found this one to be truly effective.</li>
      <li>I use it twice each time I brush, because it foams up pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste so much that I only use other brands when I don&#x27;t order more before I run out.  </li>
      <li>in it really helps my gums.  </li>
      <li>towards the end if the tube it didn&#x27;t seem to freshen my breath as much as it use to.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to get him to try and and stop using his, He was very hesitant to</li>
      <li>It has a nice subtle herbal/minty taste while you&#x27;re brushing, but doesn&#x27;t leave any aftertaste so you can eat right afterward.</li>
      <li>me, the main downside of the Kiss</li>
      <li>The idea we have of \\&quot;white teeth\\&quot; is not natural (not to criticize anybody who likes it), so achieving a blindingly bright result can only be done</li>
      <li>It is the only one that really works!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the mega foamy, super sugary issues of other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my teeth (soft teeth, lots of cavities) and tartar was a huge concern as well.  </li>
      <li>Toothpaste\\&quot; then substituting \\&quot;Natural Toothpaste\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good toothpaste but the size is useless for why I bought it.</li>
      <li>what i normally had when going back to the dentist.</li>
      <li>This tube will last a lot longer than my other toothpastes because I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>

<li> what i normally had when going back to the dentist.</li>
<li> This tube will last a lot longer than my other toothpastes because I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
<li> Perhaps I developed some sensitivity due to the use of Whitestrips in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> As usual with those, your teeth don&#x27;t really get any whiter by using them.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t use it anymore, but somebody with less sensitive teeth probably can.</li>
<li> I struggled for a long time to find a toothpaste without tartar control ingredients and SLS that I think were contributing to a yucky rash on my face.  </li>
<li> after that trial of trying natural teeth products, I didn&#x27;t want waste a single dime.         </li>
<li> In the months since, my daughters and I have tried several other products.</li>
<li> The bottle says to use an inch of it, but you really only need half a pea size.</li>
<li> Kiss my Face was required by FDA to change the label LONG AGO but this place - and some others too - continue to use the old image and false label.</li>
<li> I dont think we would use any other toothpaste again.</li>
<li> I like other KISS</li>
<li> but I was specifically looking for a 3.4oz toothpaste due to TSA restrictions.</li>
<li> I like the philosophy behind this product and have been using similar toothpastes for a long time.</li>
<li> Shameful too that Amazon seems to be looking the other way!</li>
<li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a dramatic difference in that aspect.</li>
<li> The last time I tried a natural toothpaste, the taste was horrible and left a gross grittiness on my teeth..</li>
<li> Just had my six month checkup and cleaning yesterday and my dentist was stunned at how little plaque and tartar i had.  </li>
<li> The little health food store where we were buying this stopped carrying it.</li>
<li> While this stuff seems to have organic Aloe - according to the small print on the package - the toothpaste is 70% or less organic or the label change would not have been required.</li>
<li> Not sure it has made my teeth any whiter....</li>
<li> My teeth, in 2 weeks of using it, are a lot whiter than before (when I was already using 3D glamorous white), and I get a lot less discomfort from cold foods.</li>
<li> As someone who has used a myriad of whitening products before (strips, paste, mouthwash) and to little or no effect, I came across this paste skeptical, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> Feeling frustrated after noticing, again, how terribly yellow my daughter&#x27;s teeth have gotten, I decided to see if Amazon carried it.</li>
<li> This says $1.81 an ounce but at $10.15 and a 3.4 oz tube there is false advertising.</li>
<li> had to use my husband&#x27;s name-brand toothpaste on a trip when I forgot mine, and it tasted awful to me.  </li>

    <li> This toothpaste is great. It was the first organic toothpaste I ever tried and it works soo much better then \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpastes. It has a nice subtle herbal/minty taste while you&#x27;re brushing, but doesn&#x27;t leave any aftertaste so you can eat right afterward. It also makes my teeth feel squeaky clean every time I use it, as if I&#x27;d just had a teeth cleaning at the dentist. My teeth do seem a bit whiter also but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a dramatic difference in that aspect.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste about three months ago.  I was nervous since it had no fluoride in it, though that&#x27;s why i bought it, wanted to get away from all the chemicals.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my teeth (soft teeth, lots of cavities) and tartar was a huge concern as well.  Just had my six month checkup and cleaning yesterday and my dentist was stunned at how little plaque and tartar i had.  I&#x27;ll stick with this toothpaste from now on.  I like other KISS MY FACE products, glad to find their toothpaste is great as well.</li>
    <li> I like the philosophy behind this product and have been using similar toothpastes for a long time. As usual with those, your teeth don&#x27;t really get any whiter by using them. The idea we have of \\&quot;white teeth\\&quot; is not natural (not to criticize anybody who likes it), so achieving a blindingly bright result can only be done chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the main downside of the Kiss my Face toothpaste is that it made my teeth hurt at lot. I won&#x27;t use it anymore, but somebody with less sensitive teeth probably can.</li>
    <li> The bottle says to use an inch of it, but you really only need half a pea size. I use it twice each time I brush, because it foams up pretty fast. Good mild minty taste. This tube will last a lot longer than my other toothpastes because I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste so much that I only use other brands when I don&#x27;t order more before I run out.  It tastes great, works great and I believe the CoQ10 in it really helps my gums.  I have a family history of gum disease so gum health is crucial for me.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the bonus .6oz but I was specifically looking for a 3.4oz toothpaste due to TSA restrictions. It&#x27;s a good toothpaste but the size is useless for why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste with taste that last a long time. AHHHH fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this great toothpaste. Our favorite toothpaste! It doesn&#x27;t have the mega foamy, super sugary issues of other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> nice with aloe vera. good for bleeding gums. I recommend from my heart. Try for yourself and you will see</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product, I love it, best toothpaste available</li>
    <li> After 6 months of using this toothpaste i had more plack build up then what i normally had when going back to the dentist. I&#x27;m sticking with using Crest toothpast.</li>
    <li> I was actually quite surprised on how great tasting this natural toothpaste was! The last time I tried a natural toothpaste, the taste was horrible and left a gross grittiness on my teeth.. after that trial of trying natural teeth products, I didn&#x27;t want waste a single dime.         I heard good reviews of kiss my face and decided I&#x27;ll go ahead and give natural toothpaste one last whirl.. I was quite pleased with the refreshing taste and it left my teeth feeling smooth and clean!         Aside from that yes, it is a bit pricey, but I would definately buy this product again.[[ASIN:B0014APKYG Kiss My Face - Whitening Toothpaste, 3.4 oz toothpaste]]</li>
    <li> The little health food store where we were buying this stopped carrying it. In the months since, my daughters and I have tried several other products. Feeling frustrated after noticing, again, how terribly yellow my daughter&#x27;s teeth have gotten, I decided to see if Amazon carried it. Hooray, they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that most important feature-- it actually works!-- it has a very pleasant flavor and leaves your mouth feeling clean. It&#x27;s also a good feeling to know it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful or unnatural ingredients. White teeth aren&#x27;t a big enough priority for me to put chemicals in my daughter&#x27;s mouth, so I didn&#x27;t try any chemical whiteners. So comparing this to other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; whitening toothpastes and tooth powders, we found this one to be truly effective. It is the only one that really works!</li>
    <li> I have been using organic toothpaste for 3 years now, but my husband refuses to because of the taste and feeling of the organic ones i have tried. I bought this hoping to get him to try and and stop using his, He was very hesitant to but finially did and LOVED IT I dont think we would use any other toothpaste again., I love the feeling of it, and it taste fresh and minty. I have been recommending it to may of my friends who use organic toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Good Product.Arrived Promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> As someone who has used a myriad of whitening products before (strips, paste, mouthwash) and to little or no effect, I came across this paste skeptical, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;This paste delivers! My teeth, in 2 weeks of using it, are a lot whiter than before (when I was already using 3D glamorous white), and I get a lot less discomfort from cold foods. Perhaps I developed some sensitivity due to the use of Whitestrips in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This paste tastes awesome, really subtle mint, and the texture, even though it is not as &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; as regular pastes, is pleasant. I look forward to brushing my teeth now, its a weird sort of craving. :)&lt;br /&gt;I can wear peach colored lipstick now, no problem. (I realize this last comment does not apply to most men :P)</li>
    <li> Excellent combo of ingredients. Tastes great too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell yet if whitening is working but sure do love this over any &#x27;norm&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothpaste all natural and I fall in love at first use.&lt;br /&gt;I feel clean and fresh and eco earth friendly. Two thump Up.....</li>
    <li> I like this product. Not sure it has made my teeth any whiter....but the taste is good and my mouth feels very fresh after brushing with it. The lack of chemicals makes me a happy person as well. Just ordered more!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans as well as the more abrasive, mainstream brands, but I can get used to it.</li>
    <li> Unscrupulous retailers on the Amazon web site like evitamins are knowingly trying to hood-wink you into buying \\&quot;Organic Toothpaste\\&quot; then substituting \\&quot;Natural Toothpaste\\&quot;. evitamins insisted I got what I ordered when I questioned the discrepancy. Shameful too that Amazon seems to be looking the other way! Kiss my Face was required by FDA to change the label LONG AGO but this place - and some others too - continue to use the old image and false label. Don&#x27;t let them get away with this scam. While this stuff seems to have organic Aloe - according to the small print on the package - the toothpaste is 70% or less organic or the label change would not have been required.</li>
    <li> I struggled for a long time to find a toothpaste without tartar control ingredients and SLS that I think were contributing to a yucky rash on my face.  This toothpaste has neither of those and has a lovely, minty flavor.  I continue to purchase this wherever I can find it cheapest, and sometimes that is Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use my husband&#x27;s name-brand toothpaste on a trip when I forgot mine, and it tasted awful to me.  You really start to notice the harsh chemicals these companies use in their products, after you no longer use them.</li>
    <li> This says $1.81 an ounce but at $10.15 and a 3.4 oz tube there is false advertising. Leading you to believe you get more for your money.</li>
