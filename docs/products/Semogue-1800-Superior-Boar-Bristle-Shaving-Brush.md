      <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.  </li>

      <li>Super cheap and a great brush</li>
      <li>I returned it as the synthetic bristles couldn&#x27;t hold lather for more than 1 pass.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I decided on this Semogue 1800.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t image spending more that $20 on a brush after seeing how well this thing performs.  </li>
      <li>I considered spending $50+ on a better badger brush, but after reading about boar brushes I decided to save some money and give them a try.  </li>
      <li>I have badger brushes also but they are significantly more money.</li>
      <li>My favorite brush.</li>
      <li>I like the feel on my face better with this boar.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s artisan quality (except for the sticker, but it looks better without it anyways)  </li>
      <li>It gets better as you use it.  </li>
      <li>Looks nice, and well designed to fit grip.</li>
      <li>That one just looks better on the display stand.</li>
      <li>There is no nasty smell like some reports say about boar brushes.</li>
      <li>As someone who has to shave daily, this brush is simply perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Little break in required, feels great, lathers great.</li>
      <li>The difference was so profound that had to walk to the kitchen to show my wife the beautiful, meringue-like lather I made.  </li>
      <li>This is a great brush,backbone soft tips,lathers well.</li>
      <li>far, everyone is happy.</li>
      <li>did (as if made from Husky) and is more precise, meaning no foam up my nose or in my ear.  </li>
      <li>and if it is true that these brushes get better in a month or so after breaking in, I can&#x27;t see a reason to pay more for a brush.</li>
      <li>It actually lathers up really nice and gives a good backbone for exfoliation.</li>
      <li>This brush was ready to rock right out of the box and worked great with almost no smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Great service fast shipping exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and it arrived very quickly; added bonus, the seller offered free shipping.</li>
      <li>The knot has a fairly soft, pleasant touch.</li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the handle is also fantastic.  </li>
      <li>After reading a lot about boar brushes, I decided on this Semogue because it was highly regarded on the shaving forums and I liked the look of the wood handle.  </li>
      <li>I had originally bought this brush for a friend that wanted to give we shaving a try.</li>
      <li>This was a gift to my husband to go along with his new Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.</li>
      <li>but this doesn&#x27;t hold enough water or lather to guarantee a good experience.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s stiffer than badger, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing for me anyway.</li>
      <li>This is a brush I wanted to love, but it refuses to love me back.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best $17 I have spent in years.  </li>
      <li>long hairs and handle make it a bit easier to lather in a mug, this brush holds a decent amount of soap and create a great</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, it&#x27;s quality all the way.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s obvious that he would find this new shaving brush superior.</li>
      <li>The amazing thing is that this brush is noticeably smaller and appears to have fewer bristles than my cheap badger brush, but it completely annihilated it in performance.  </li>
      <li>Other then that a pretty good brush.</li>
      <li>When this thing wears out, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying another Semogue brush!  </li>
      <li>It took me many attempts to find the right glue to put it back together</li>
      <li>Broke in very fast.</li>
      <li>in all a great hard soap brush for the price.</li>
      <li>My husband really enjoys shaving with this brush--bravo Semogue!</li>
      <li>I first used a badger brush from Van Der Hagen.</li>
      <li>This is my first boar hair brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be</li>
      <li>Just received my semouge boar 1800 today and used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>I an glad I kept the brush, because it would only have caused him frustration.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m kind of a newbie to wet shaving).  </li>
      <li>Semogue makes an amazing product, and because of this brush, I bought 2 other Semogue brushes.  </li>
      <li>easily whipped up tons of lather in my bowl (Proraso blue cream)</li>
      <li>The very first time I used this Semogue brush it created an amazing, thick lather.  </li>
      <li>It is stiff enough to easily go under my nose with out putting lather up my nostril, but will splay out nicely when pushed against my neck and face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish the handle came in a little more narrow so it would fit my brush/razor stand better.</li>
      <li>I ultimately decided on this Semogue 1800 because the bristles seemed to be a good fit for using hard shaving soaps for face lathering, which is my preferred way of shaving.  </li>
      <li>Very well made,.</li>
      <li>next morning it had only a nice soap aroma.  </li>
      <li>I got a good lather the first time and not even broken in yet.</li>
      <li>It whips up OK, but by the time I am ready to make a second pass, there is nothing left in the brush.</li>
      <li>I can find no fault with it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This brush is an AMAZING brush for hard soaps.  </li>
      <li>I just recently got into wet shaving and started off with a very cheap badger brush.  </li>
      <li>This is my second boar brush, the first being an Omega.  </li>
      <li>I have higher end badger brushes and this still hits my regular rotation.</li>
      <li>brush has a small break in period, and it just gets better with age.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A very nice starter brush for DE shaving. I purchased this brush, not knowing if I would like DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Well made boar bristle brush, well made. After this brush I purchased a badger brush. But will use them both depending on which shave soaps I use. All in all a very nice brush for $20</li>
    <li> I like a little stiffness to my shave brush, as I use a shave soap and like to exfoliate a bit. No smell, very solid construction. Nice bristles, and a great handle. Looks nice, and well designed to fit grip. Works up a good lather. Definitely worth the price, and a great brush, even for boar.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my husband to go along with his new Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. My husband loves both products. He was using a very cheap shaving brush beforehand so it&#x27;s obvious that he would find this new shaving brush superior. He has noted that the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, at least as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> The Semogue 1800 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush does not disappoint--I read many, many reviews both on Amazon and on shaving blogs and this handmade brush from Portugal is a winner. And for the price it really out shines and out performs brushes far more expensive. It looks and feels works as a superior quality brush. Some men find boar has a funky smell but I detected none whatsoever, neither does my husband. I bought this as a Christmas gift and it arrived very quickly; added bonus, the seller offered free shipping. My husband really enjoys shaving with this brush--bravo Semogue!</li>
    <li> This is my third Semogue boar brush. I have badger brushes also but they are significantly more money. While both do a good job the Semogues are  great value.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot about boar brushes, I decided on this Semogue because it was highly regarded on the shaving forums and I liked the look of the wood handle.  On arrival I was anxious to see if it had a funky aroma that apparently some boar brushes have.  Out of the box it had a very slight musty aroma, not bad at all.  I lathered it up twice and let it sit with the lather on it for about an hour each time... rinsed it out, slapped it on my wrist a few times, swirled it on a towel a few times and set it on the counter for the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning it had only a nice soap aroma.  I was very surprised how soft this brush felt on my face, it was not prickly at all.  It is stiff enough to easily go under my nose with out putting lather up my nostril, but will splay out nicely when pushed against my neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It easily whipped up tons of lather in my bowl (Proraso blue cream) and if it is true that these brushes get better in a month or so after breaking in, I can&#x27;t see a reason to pay more for a brush. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> The Semogue 1800 is sold as a natural boar bristle brush. It&#x27;s not natural boar. It&#x27;s synthetic boar. I returned it as the synthetic bristles couldn&#x27;t hold lather for more than 1 pass.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic.  I had been using badger brushes, and had assumed boar wasn&#x27;t as good (I&#x27;m kind of a newbie to wet shaving).  This brush is an AMAZING brush for hard soaps.  It face lathers like a champ.  Semogue makes an amazing product, and because of this brush, I bought 2 other Semogue brushes.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.  It&#x27;s artisan quality (except for the sticker, but it looks better without it anyways)  It gets better as you use it.  I would recommend Semogue to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this every other day for the last 2 weeks and it&#x27;s still as good as when I got it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s not even lost any hairs. Broke in very fast. Lathers up soaps and creams with ease. And it looks sharp.</li>
    <li> This is my second boar brush, the first being an Omega.  I have tried various badger brushes but have been disappointed by their performance.  This brush was ready to rock right out of the box and worked great with almost no smell to it.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a brush I wanted to love, but it refuses to love me back. The wood handle looks good, and feels comfortable in my hand. The knot has a fairly soft, pleasant touch. The problem lies in what happens to the lather. I have allowed it to break in, and have tried it on multiple soaps and creams. Every time, regardless of soap or cream, the lather dissipates on the brush. It whips up OK, but by the time I am ready to make a second pass, there is nothing left in the brush. I have tried several methods of cleaning the knot, but to no avail, this brush just kills the lather.  I had originally bought this brush for a friend that wanted to give we shaving a try. I an glad I kept the brush, because it would only have caused him frustration.</li>
    <li> I first used a badger brush from Van Der Hagen. This boar hair brush creates a richer lather, that coats nicely. I use Shark super chrome razors, which are very sharp, and since using this brush, I have yet to nick myself; not the case with the Van Der Hagen.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush,backbone soft tips,lathers well.I am impressed with semogue brushes. Have the 620 awesome,great quality brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> The boar bristles are soft on the face, but stiff enough for hard soaps. The price isn&#x27;t bad for what you are getting either. I prefer this for hard soaps, but you might want a badger with shorter hairs and a thicker knot if you are using creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long hairs and handle make it a bit easier to lather in a mug, this brush holds a decent amount of soap and create a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want a stand to allow your brush to dry properly, rather than sitting it up on the end of the handle. If water sits in the ferrule, your brush might do what mine did and the knot my separate. It took me many attempts to find the right glue to put it back together permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great hard soap brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and a great brush once you break it in.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. Period. If you haven&#x27;t purchased this brush, and you are a user of shave soaps, get on it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a small break in period, and it just gets better with age. As someone who has to shave daily, this brush is simply perfect.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for the first time this morning and found it to do an excellent job in making a good lather.  It looks and feels like a quality boar brush.  It had no odor and although some may think it needs a break-in period I think it is great right out of the box.  I can find no fault with it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just received my semouge boar 1800 today and used it for the first time. Right out of the box, it&#x27;s quality all the way. Nice wood handle with the ring around it that holds the knot in place. Yes, it&#x27;s stiffer than badger, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing for me anyway. It has a nice backbone and is not floppy. I got a good lather the first time and not even broken in yet. There is no nasty smell like some reports say about boar brushes. I have a best badger and a pure badger. I like the feel on my face better with this boar. Oh! And the price is excellent. Far less expensive than badger and seems to be as good if not better Than badger</li>
    <li> Great service fast shipping exactly as stated. I it works great also.</li>
    <li> Builds a nice lather compared to the starter brush that came with the Van der Hagen shaving kit.  Had it for a few weeks now so it&#x27;s nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice the funky boar smell like the other reviewers and it hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles yet.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush for the price and being that it&#x27;s a boat brush. I wish it had a bigger knot, but that&#x27;s a different model number. It actually lathers up really nice and gives a good backbone for exfoliation. I have higher end badger brushes and this still hits my regular rotation.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  My hard soap is easier to shave with with this.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I wish the handle came in a little more narrow so it would fit my brush/razor stand better.</li>
    <li> What an awesome brush! Face lathers like a dream.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  After getting an E-Shave starter kit I almost gave up on the idea of all the shave hype and safety razors but tried this because the reviews and low cost.  I love it and to works perfect.  Does not shed like the e-shave did (as if made from Husky) and is more precise, meaning no foam up my nose or in my ear.  After my faith was restored I purchased a silver tip badger brush based on reviews and still prefer this one.  That one just looks better on the display stand.</li>
    <li> Little break in required, feels great, lathers great. Why buy a more expensive brush when you can have y&lt;br /&gt;This one.</li>
    <li> One of the best for anyt soap! Very well made,.</li>
    <li> This is my first boar hair brush. I&#x27;d say it works well for soap &amp; mug shaving. I prefer face lathering with cream but this doesn&#x27;t hold enough water or lather to guarantee a good experience.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into wet shaving and started off with a very cheap badger brush.  After being underwhelmed with the performance of the badger brush, I started doing some research on brushes.  I considered spending $50+ on a better badger brush, but after reading about boar brushes I decided to save some money and give them a try.  I ultimately decided on this Semogue 1800 because the bristles seemed to be a good fit for using hard shaving soaps for face lathering, which is my preferred way of shaving.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase and I&#x27;m glad I decided on this Semogue 1800.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be and it has vastly exceeded my expectations.  My cheap badger brush was producing such poor lather that I was about to give up on my soap.  The very first time I used this Semogue brush it created an amazing, thick lather.  The difference was so profound that had to walk to the kitchen to show my wife the beautiful, meringue-like lather I made.  She thought I was nuts, but I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  The amazing thing is that this brush is noticeably smaller and appears to have fewer bristles than my cheap badger brush, but it completely annihilated it in performance.  I can&#x27;t image spending more that $20 on a brush after seeing how well this thing performs.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever spend the money on another badger brush.  When this thing wears out, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying another Semogue brush!  This is by far the best $17 I have spent in years.  I am completely amazed with this little thing.  Oh, and the handle is also fantastic.  It looks great, feels great, and provides an excellent grip!</li>
    <li> Be careful of the temperature of the hot water you use, because it will loosen the glue.  Other then that a pretty good brush.</li>
