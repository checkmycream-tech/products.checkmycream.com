    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. This bottle is twice as big as the ones they sell at the store for the same price.</li>
    <li> Loved it when my grandma got me the whole Micheal Jordan box. I just really like this cologne and received many complements on the scent</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Stores around our area have stopped carrying this in there stores.  My boyfriend love to wear this stuff and is happy that we can purchase it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He loves it. Shipping was quick and very protected in package.  I personally can&#x27;t stand the smell of it myself though.</li>
    <li> nice smell greaqt price use it everyday</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding the original colonge.  Ordered it for my grandson who like this one colonge.  Gave it too him for Christmas.  We were both verry happy.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and smells great!!  I&#x27;m giving this to my husband for Father&#x27;s day, but I opened it to sure it smelled good, and it does.  It&#x27;s a much larger size than I expected which is good, very nice price for the size.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my Husband.  He first used it in Cancun.  We BOTH enjoy the smell of this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Better to buy it here than the store next door.It was about $5:00 cheaper compared to where it&#x27;s sold cheapest at the mall</li>
    <li> I, for one, love this scent. Everyone I&#x27;m around loves this scent and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. This scent is all around amazing! Buying again! This and the Flight are the best by Michael Jordan. Also, the Legend one isn&#x27;t that bad, but I&#x27;m saving that one for when I get old.</li>
    <li> always loved this smell. good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing spectacular, but you will like it. You&#x27;ll probably be able to recognize the scent. I would recommend it for and every day causal smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t smell it myself. But it has been getting women excited since I first put it on in 1999. No lie.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and so does my gf i bout this a long time ago and its not even a centimeter down the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, my husband loves it and so do I.  Not overly perfumed as some after shaves/colognes.  This product on Amazon was a great bargain.  It is hard to find in stores as it is the original MJ cologne.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and I do too. Clean and spicy with a little attitude at a great price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, and I get many compliments on how good I smell. The cologne smells fresh and masculine, and for its low price, I really don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular! I have several expensive bottles from D&amp;G and Ralph Lauren and they are nice in their own right but far too expensive for such a small quantity of cologne. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! .</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to people who like a nice clean smelling cologne.  My son-in-law likes it and it&#x27;s hard to find in the north country.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne ever. Highly recommend to any guy or girl that has a guy she wants to smell delicious. Great for the price too!</li>
    <li> My mom asked me to get this for my dad and he smells great in it.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne and things are always on time or delivered earlier than expected when ordering through Amazon. Can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
    <li> This cologne is the best on the market and for a reasonable price. Love it. The other MJ scents can&#x27;t shake a stick at this classic.</li>
    <li> Awesome gift for my husband. Brought back childhood memories for him. It has a very soft masculine scent, every man should have it.</li>
    <li> the only fragrance my hubby likes</li>
    <li> I wanna smell like Mike.</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time am enjoying it</li>
    <li> A clean-good smelling cologne.Its a cologne you can wear everyday that has a good smell to it.Looking for good cheap cologne buy this.</li>
    <li> My son asked for this for xmas and it was just what he wanted. It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift before and had to get more after I always get compliments on dates about it.</li>
    <li> My son was very happy to get this cologne for Christmas and being that it&#x27;s discontinued in stores was a plus.  Thank you.</li>

    <li> my baby (boyfriend) loves it and wants another one</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my man. He always gets compliments on how well he smells too</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my husband. Actually he only uses this perfume. Very good smell!</li>
    <li> This is Very impressive product with a very good price, seldom to see some thing like this. I am recommended. The Seller was wonderful.</li>
    <li> If u need a everyday cologne this is it. U will have to use it twice a day tho. This is the perfect after gym cologne something just too throw on. Great value</li>
    <li> It was ok @ the most, scent doesn&#x27;t stay with u very long, expected more.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this since I was in High School. The girls loved it too. I still get compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing. Classic EDT. A must have for every man&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different cologne&#x27;s and this by far is the best I have ever tried, even better than any of the high priced name prands</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. We both really liked it. This is a big size. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew who is 12.  Its a clean cologne and not overbearing.  You know kids that age want to bathe in it so I thought this would be something that won&#x27;t over power everything else and it doesn&#x27;t.  My husband also wears it to work.  It&#x27;s clean and crisp scent.</li>
    <li> This is the real original deal. Fresh pine-ish scent. My fave.</li>
    <li> excellent shipping time and price</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, recommend it for sure. Packaging came in a bubble wrapped envelope and also pretty fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I smell good now, it helped me slam dunk the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Also, nice cologne to have for a throw back day.</li>
    <li> I Love It So Much I&#x27;m Going To Buy It Again This Is A Must Buy One The Best By Michael Jordan</li>
    <li> Smells terrific and lasts for a long time. Wonderful Christmas gift for our son. The price was nice, too. Great gift.</li>
    <li> Great cologne - It is hard to find so I always order from Amazon.  My husband&#x27;s favorite.  He gets many compliments.</li>
    <li> As a teen I used to stick to axe products but those are too common and easy to tell apart. A friend gave this as a gift and I put it to the side cause upon seeing &amp;#34;Michael Jordan&amp;#34; I thought &amp;#34;how good can a basketball players fragrance be&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Another lesson why you should not judge something without trying. One day I couldn&#x27;t find my armani Cologne and I was in a rush so I saw this and tried it on just so I would have some kind of Cologne.  I&#x27;ve bough 2 bottles since then cause it&#x27;s such a good fragrance and I regularly get compliments on it. I&#x27;ve had people try and guess the brand and they always name the ones that go for $70+ a bottle.</li>
    <li> Remember: this is a cologne, not a perfum</li>
    <li> My dad loves this cologne which makes me happy because its his go to birthday gift which is no small feat</li>
    <li> I bought it for a young teenager. He loved it, his girlfriend loves it, so I guess it&#x27;s a five!</li>
    <li> Been rocking this since high school and I will continue to buy it until it&#x27;s no longer sold. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on what cologne I wear and I never tell :)</li>
