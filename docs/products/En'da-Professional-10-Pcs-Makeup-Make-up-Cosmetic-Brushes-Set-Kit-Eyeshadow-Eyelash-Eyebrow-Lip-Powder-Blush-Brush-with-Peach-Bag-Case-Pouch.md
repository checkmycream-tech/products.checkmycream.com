<li> like the case, but the brushes are far less than quality.</li>
<li> The bristles are soft, but the bigger brushes shed really bad and they do not pick up powder very well.</li>
<li> The big one falls apart a little bit, but other than that, they work well!</li>
<li> So far, very these makeup brushes have been very disappointing..</li>
<li> hairs fall out every single time i used them and not to mention they are hard and hurt</li>
<li> every last one of my brushes are literally broken</li>
<li> If you need a complete set of makeup brushes you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
<li> The larger brushes shed when I use them and they had a weird smell.</li>
<li> , if you have to do the little fixes, so what, you&#x27;re still way ahead of the game, at least IMHO.</li>
<li> I gave this product a 5 star review, because they don&#x27;t shed, they don&#x27;t smell that weird, and it came with everything pictured.</li>
<li> I had to give the brushes a wash as they had a nasty smell to them.</li>

    <li> This product is great! None of the brushes came off the handles, and they didn&#x27;t shed at all! The bristles on all of them are super soft!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good makeup brushes.  The big one falls apart a little bit, but other than that, they work well!</li>

    <li> Great buy!  Brushes are sturdy and as advertised.  The case is made well and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>

    <li> Brushes are great , no fallout , and the case is great , as well ! I recommend this item to anyone !! Lovin&#x27; it</li>
    <li> like the case, but the brushes are far less than quality.</li>
    <li> hairs fall out every single time i used them and not to mention they are hard and hurt</li>
    <li> These r the best makeup brushes I have ever purchased!! I&#x27;m so picky about my makeup, so I looked around for awhile before I ordered. I&#x27;m completely happy and more than satisfied. They r soft. My makeup looks clean and fresh every time it&#x27;s applied!! I highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft, but the bigger brushes shed really bad and they do not pick up powder very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Monday (Feb. 25th) and just got it in the mail this morning (March 2nd)! I had read some of the reviews before I purchased this, some were good and some were \\&quot;ok\\&quot;. There was one I read about white powder being on some of the brushes? I did not get that when I opened these brushes. The eyelash brush was not included. Instead of the eyelash brush it was a thinner brush like what you would use for liquid eyeliner. A couple of the brush&#x27;s handles came off, but those were an easy fix. The brushes are SUPER soft! Would HIGHLY recommend these brushes for anyone!:D</li>
    <li> The larger brushes shed when I use them and they had a weird smell. They are really soft though and the eye shadow brushes are nice. It didn&#x27;t come with the eyebrow brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these makeup brushes!! They are perfect!! I would recommend to everyone!! The feel of the brushes are as great as more expensive ones and they have a great price!!</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and one for my mom for her birthday. She opens it, takes the plastic off&amp; 2 of the brushes came off of the handles. Later mine did the same. Positive side, soft, the bristles don&#x27;t come out easily like others and the case is very convenient.</li>
    <li> For its price, it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t come with the eyelash brush, even though it&#x27;s in the picture. I had to give the brushes a wash as they had a nasty smell to them. They are very soft though and nice quality.</li>
    <li> every last one of my brushes are literally broken I washed them one time and the brushes just fell apart do not buy these brushes</li>
    <li> I received the brushes very quickly and am pleased with the product. The brushes are soft and apply a variety of makeup well. They pick up eyeshadow, blush, and power foundation easily. The brushes are also fine enough that some good taps shake the power off. I have been using them with [[ASIN:B002XHA5A8 Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Pearls Marbleized Eyeshadow, Carbon Frost 05, 0.09 Ounce]] everyday since I got them and create awesome eyeshadow effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note that there is NOT a eyelash brush included (as shown in the picture)- it is replaced by a very fine brush that can be used to apply liquid eyeliner or create an effect with eyeshadow. The carrying cases is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good price for nice product!</li>
    <li> and I still purchased this set.  I&#x27;m very happy I did.  Yes, the two larger brushes came apart almost instantly, but a touch of glue fixed that issue.  Yes, the brushes had an odor to them so I washed them, problem solved. (I wash brushes before using anyway)  When I think of the tiny bit of effort I had to expend to make this set fantastic, well, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.  I have purchased single brushes that cost more, here this set has 10, and for the price they are very soft, they work extremely well with product and they clean up like a dream.  What more do you want in a brush?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy this set, if you have to do the little fixes, so what, you&#x27;re still way ahead of the game, at least IMHO.</li>
    <li> They arrived in time, I  order in April 29th and arrived in May 3th.&lt;br /&gt;the reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the brushes was worn, had powder eye shadows.  though I wash the brushes, I  threw the brush since I do not know who use the brush. for everything else work great. I recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Llegaron en tiempo, las ordene en abril 29 y llegaron en mayo 3.&lt;br /&gt;la razon por la que le doy 4 estrellas es porque una de las brochas estaba usada, tenia polvo de sombras para ojos. aunque yo lave las brochas, tiré la brocha puesto que yo no se quien uso la brocha. por todo lo demas funcionan muy bien las recomiendo...</li>
    <li> Pretty decent brushes. I have not used them yet, but I will update after I use them and then maybe change the stars</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks and these have yet to arrive. So far, very these makeup brushes have been very disappointing..</li>
