    <li> Great colors and size!</li>

    <li> It is a lovely makeup purse. The finishing good, the purse is the right size. The packaging is good too.</li>
    <li> I choose five stars because no one in town has the selecton as&lt;br /&gt;amazon does. I would recommed this makeup bag to anyone.</li>
    <li> deff love the make up bag will buy again and recommend any and everyone who view to buy I love it</li>
    <li> Nice makeup bag. The colors are as pictured, very pretty. A little bigger than what I needed but it&#x27;ll do just fine for the few makeup items I carry in my purse. The material is good and looks like it&#x27;ll last. Like that you can wipe clean when needed.</li>
    <li> Definitely , the best purchase I made. The makeup bag is an average size and very cute and just as shown on pic. I defy recommend</li>
    <li> I love it so much. I brought two. One for my makeup and one I use as a pencil case for school. I love it. Its big enough to fit your makeup and it&#x27;s just so cute. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure about this item only being $7, but it shipped fast and when I opened it, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier! The colors are bright, the quality is great, and the gold trimming is amazing!</li>
    <li> The bag is pretty and much larger than I expected. The outside is made of canvas and is a bit scratchy however.</li>
    <li> low quality, i would NOT recommend this flimsy bag ,you will more than likely regret this purchase. thats what happened to me.</li>
    <li> I love the estee lauder / Lily Pulitzer combo makeup bag! Nice colors and quality bag. I will not have to buy gift with purchase from a department store again just to get free gift bag I will come to amazon instead.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5/5 because it&#x27;s absolutely adorable, and the shipping is estimated to take over a month, but I ordered mine three days ago and received it today! I am extremely pleased. This product is definitely worth the money. The size of the bag was a pleasant surprise. Slightly larger than I expected, which is great considering my makeup bag needs to hold a lot of essential brushes! With all this being said, I don&#x27;t suspect this is an actual Lilly Pulitzer for Estee Lauder, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for brand names to begin with! If you&#x27;re looking for a bright, cute, large makeup bag and not a brand name, I&#x27;d say go for it! I&#x27;m a first time shopper on Amazon, and after receiving this gem, I&#x27;m a little addicted to online shopping now.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the bag was thicker. But actually it&#x27;s very thin, I&#x27;m afraid it will break. But the size is alright.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for spring, but its fall and I&#x27;m still using it! Its the perfect size, all my makeup and my brushes fit.</li>
    <li> I just got my bag literally a couple minutes ago! i LOVE it. the colors are lovely. brighter then in the pictures. the bag size is great if you have a normal amount of makeup.. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to my bag arriving and now that I have it I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Its a great size and the colors are so cute. I loved the price and the quality. Even my toddler is fighting me for it! Thanks</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. And it&#x27;s the perfect size for my minimal and to stick in my purse if needed.</li>
    <li> So cute!! I bought this for a friend for christmas and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for storing your everyday makeup. It even fits my lorac pro palette in nicely. Though I wish the material were a bit thicker, it&#x27;s still good nonetheless. (also adorable)</li>
    <li> This bag is just what I was looking for. The right size, length and color. I received the bag in 2 days another added plus.</li>
    <li> Besides being a fan of Estee Lauder cosmetics, the makeup bag is very pretty, and serves it purpose as I expected it would.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. It is rare to find anything Lilly in a thrift shop but after ordering this one, I found a blue one for 99 cents. Ther were perfect for our recent cruise.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present and it is exactly what I hoped for! It&#x27;s perfect size for a healthy amount of make-up and the pattern is bright and pretty!! I know my friend is going to love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this bag! It&#x27;s great for all the small things that normally get lost in my purse. The extra large zipper opening makes it easy to find things in it. I love the design and have 3 more Lilly Pulitzer bags on my wish list :)</li>
    <li> Nice bag, pretty and different for sure. I would recommend it for a small makeup bag for traveling - worth the money.</li>
    <li> very cute bag, but makes me wonder if it is authentic. The label looks like their is a print error. Quite disappointed with the purchase</li>
    <li> I love the spring time colors of this bag.  It is just the right size for my cosmetics.  I purchased two of them because I like it that much!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these bags and they are perfect for carrying my makeup in my purse.  They are very colorful and have a nice lining that you can wipe with a damp rag if dirty.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as you seen on the picture, and as other reviewers described the color is really vibrant and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a lot of make up products. It looks so beautiful I like to put it somewhere I can see and it makes my day!&lt;br /&gt;The price is about right. The gold lining around the bag may peel if you are not careful with a sharp object.</li>
    <li> Cheap material but guess worth the price</li>
    <li> I really like this bag for its colors!! I mean all those other bags they sell everywhere are either pink or black (not that I have anything against it!) most of the time but this one looks so cute and reminds me of summer! It also fits A LOT of make-up. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect pouch for my make-up. Lipbalm, Lipstick, Face powder, mini-perfume etc. Very Cute.</li>
    <li> Love it no complaints . A majority of my makeup is lipstick lol but I have 2 mascaras my estee lauder foundation and brush and about 12 lipsticks and blush, just to give you an idea on what it can hold I still have room for more so that&#x27;s a plus. I Like the color it&#x27;s true to the picture . Wonderful purchase for a great price</li>
    <li> Great bag! Fits great in my purse and I love all of the colors. It was an excellent and wonderful purchase!</li>
