    <li> Simple to use. Just used it for few weeks, was scared to try it at first but after a while I get the hang of it. My skin felt more plump and smooth the next day :)</li>
    <li> I got the package 4 days thought of coming 2 days coz of Amazon prime. The roller comes in a very decent package comes with instructions. Im hoping to have a positive outcome 6mos of using it. First time using it was good, felt no discomfort after all and i love it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I would recommend Belo Derma Roller to anybody who wants to try.</li>
    <li> I still have to find out after 6 months, right? But what i notice is it does make my pores a little smaller and my skin finer.</li>
    <li> i dont know how to use it</li>
    <li> Better than the pricey one I bought.</li>
    <li> According to my wife, she likes it but has yet to try it because she doesn&#x27;t have numbing cream Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> as described, thanks!</li>

    <li> I love the derma roller! My skin pores are getting lesser, clearer and softer. I just need to ask you what is the best serum should i apply after doing the roller. Currently, im in cosmelan 2 and tyrosinase inhibitor. Please let me know what serum should i apply. Thank you and awaiting.</li>
    <li> Love my new Belo dermaroller!!!!  I did not feel any pain at all. Looking forward to use this every month as per recommendation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this derma roller because I read some reviews that derma roller can be a big help for hair fall. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet since I&#x27;m using this for just a month now ( once a week).</li>
    <li> A must have for a beauty regimen! Very effective product.</li>
