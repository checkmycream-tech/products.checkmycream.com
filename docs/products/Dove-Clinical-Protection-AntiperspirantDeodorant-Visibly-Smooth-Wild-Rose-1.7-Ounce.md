### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and then it dries perfectly within a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>but this one seems to work the best ??</li>
      <li>Greatest deodorant ever.</li>
      <li>THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED</li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely happy to have found this.  </li>
      <li>very nice feel when appying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wished that it came with some kind of hair growth repressor.</li>
      <li>Nice scent and i like the hair growth inhibitor.</li>
      <li>I works great, smells great, and it really does lighten/reduce underarm hair.</li>
      <li>This was sold as rose scented.  </li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>I do wish they would leave it unscented or make it in some kind of foodie scent, because if I&#x27;m having allergy symptoms, floral scents can aggravate it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it works best if you epilate the hair - like by waxing.</li>
      <li>IT WAS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE,,, BUT</li>
      <li>I find myself reapplying deodorant at my desk around 3pm most days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I have been searching everywhere for it, and have not been able to find it till now.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this one.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how I feel most scented deodorants are, SO smelly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like any rose of any kind.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this deodorant!</li>
      <li>and I used to sweat easily and often.</li>
      <li>All the others seem fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt; way to be sweat free and keep under arms smooth.</li>
      <li>But it was really cheap.</li>
      <li>It is rose scented, but that fades pretty quickly into nothing.</li>
      <li>It just smells obnoxiously sweet.  </li>
      <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
      <li>I put it on a night right before I go to bed (as directed).  </li>
      <li>You have to put this deodorant on at night to get the full effect, so that pretty much means doing all your showering, shaving, shampooing at night too.</li>
      <li>And it works also as far as keeping me dry/smelling fine all day.</li>
      <li>I always use clinical protection, but this is the first fragrance that doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with wetness protection.  </li>
      <li>I love that they finally have one that slows hair growth.</li>
      <li>I also love the subtle wild Rose fragrance.</li>
      <li>First of all, it is the only kind that really works for me, and second it smells heavenly!</li>
      <li>I really like the way it dispenses, you can really smear it in</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do a true experiment of applying it only to one underarm.</li>
      <li>I wake up in the morning ready to tackle the world and able to shave a hair less frequently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hairy person, and this stuff really stops odor AND keeps the underarms soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells though.</li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and always get a rash when I use scented deodorants, but not this one for some reason!</li>
      <li>I got a sample of regular Dove Clinical through the Amazon Vine program, and I loved the effectiveness so much that I have switched brands after 20 years or so of using Secret.</li>
      <li>This kept me dry and fresh.</li>
      <li>completely--</li>
      <li>This is a thick paste that ejects out of patterned holes at the top of the tube.</li>
      <li>While it is a little on the costly side it is worth it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too sweet of a smell.</li>
      <li>Not only does this keep me smooth all night and the next day, but for me, it has the same deodorant and anti-perspirant protection of the regular Dove clinical.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clearly been discontinued because the tube I got was a smidge dried out at first.</li>
      <li>The tube is smaller than I would have thought, but it&#x27;s also a bit wider than a normal deodorant as well, so even though it looks smaller</li>

<li> The dove clinical protection keeps me dry all day.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Dove Clinicals</li>
<li> it&#x27;s probably average</li>
<li> it just slows it down so that I&#x27;m not worried about stubble at the end of the day.</li>
<li> Well I was walking around the store the other day when I saw this on the shelf, and I thought it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
<li> But I feel like I have a lot less hair, I have to remove it less often.</li>
<li> I usually like this brand</li>
<li> but this one smells really weird.</li>

    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this deodorant! First of all, it is the only kind that really works for me, and second it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I usually like this brand but this one smells really weird. I don&#x27;t like it at all, neither did my friend.</li>
    <li> Greatest deodorant ever. No joke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy person, and this stuff really stops odor AND keeps the underarms soft.  When the hair grows back in, it&#x27;s not as coarse.</li>
    <li> The expiration date had passed.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy to have found this.  I have been searching everywhere for it, and have not been able to find it till now.  While it is a little on the costly side it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Nice scent and i like the hair growth inhibitor. very nice feel when appying.&lt;br /&gt; way to be sweat free and keep under arms smooth.Nice</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> I started using this years ago when it 1st came out.  I put it on a night right before I go to bed (as directed).  It is a soothing scent, though I only notice it when I put it on.  I wake up in the morning ready to tackle the world and able to shave a hair less frequently.</li>
    <li> I THINK THEY HAVE DISCONTINUED THIS IN THE STORES IT WAS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE,,, BUT THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clinical Protection line for years. I love that they finally have one that slows hair growth. I&#x27;m pretty sure it works best if you epilate the hair - like by waxing. And I like to think it actually does work. I didn&#x27;t do a true experiment of applying it only to one underarm. But I feel like I have a lot less hair, I have to remove it less often.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and always get a rash when I use scented deodorants, but not this one for some reason! I did see someone complaining that the scent was not strong enough for them...who the heck wants other people to smell your deodorant from 2 feet away?! That&#x27;s how I feel most scented deodorants are, SO smelly. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells though. I LOVE this one. And it works also as far as keeping me dry/smelling fine all day. I&#x27;ve tried the other Dove Clinicals but this one seems to work the best ?? I really like the way it dispenses, you can really smear it in and then it dries perfectly within a couple of minutes. Sticks always seems to gunk up on my armpits which is really gross, this does not. WHY have the stores around me stopped selling this one?!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that ever worked for me! I was overweight when I started using this and I used to sweat easily and often. This kept me dry and fresh.</li>
    <li> This was sold as rose scented.  It isn&#x27;t!  It just smells obnoxiously sweet.  I&#x27;d never buy this scent again.</li>
    <li> This is a thick paste that ejects out of patterned holes at the top of the tube. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent to me, so the &amp;#34;wild rose&amp;#34; name is a bit of a misnomer. The tube is smaller than I would have thought, but it&#x27;s also a bit wider than a normal deodorant as well, so even though it looks smaller it&#x27;s probably average sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately...It doesn&#x27;t appear to have reduced my underarm hair, even though I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks. I also thought with the name &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34; I&#x27;d never get sweaty stinky, but by the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t hold up. I find myself reapplying deodorant at my desk around 3pm most days.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever used.  I works great, smells great, and it really does lighten/reduce underarm hair.</li>
    <li> The dove clinical protection keeps me dry all day. I also love the subtle wild Rose fragrance.</li>
    <li> You have to put this deodorant on at night to get the full effect, so that pretty much means doing all your showering, shaving, shampooing at night too. I got a sample of regular Dove Clinical through the Amazon Vine program, and I loved the effectiveness so much that I have switched brands after 20 years or so of using Secret. The only issue I had was shaving and putting this on at night, which meant extra stubble by the end of day. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of sleeveless tops, so it&#x27;s not like anyone would know, but *I&#x27;ll* know-- you know? I wished that it came with some kind of hair growth repressor. Well I was walking around the store the other day when I saw this on the shelf, and I thought it&#x27;s a miracle! It is rose scented, but that fades pretty quickly into nothing. I do wish they would leave it unscented or make it in some kind of foodie scent, because if I&#x27;m having allergy symptoms, floral scents can aggravate it. For me the hair growth slowed overnight and I had immediate results. It doesn&#x27;t stop hair growth completely-- it just slows it down so that I&#x27;m not worried about stubble at the end of the day. Not only does this keep me smooth all night and the next day, but for me, it has the same deodorant and anti-perspirant protection of the regular Dove clinical. This is my holy grail deodorant and I will never switch back!</li>
    <li> I always use clinical protection, but this is the first fragrance that doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with wetness protection.  All the others seem fine.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like any rose of any kind. It&#x27;s a little too sweet of a smell. It does work well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s clearly been discontinued because the tube I got was a smidge dried out at first. But it was really cheap.</li>
    <li> For some reason if you look up the 2-pack of this product, they only show one.  But, this product, which is only a single pack, depicts the 2-pack.  WTF Amazon?</li>
