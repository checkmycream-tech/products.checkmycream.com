      <li>Everything else I tried hurt my head but these hold strong and are very easy and pain free to use.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t hold my hair any better then the original clips which came with my 2&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Easy to find,</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have arthritis but can use them easily.</li>
      <li>The clips are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I needed extra clips for my hot rollers and these work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and use the smallest in a magnetic roller set and this item would not hold the rollers in place.</li>
      <li>They work wonderfully on our hot curlers as well as our regular rollers.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to order and receive them quickly.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t mark your hair and they fit any size rollers.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I love using the clips over my hot rollers.</li>
      <li>I just love these clips, They work so well with hot rollers and Velcro rollers.</li>
      <li>These clips get the job done, they are miles better than the old fashioned U shaped pins, but not as strong as the clips that came with my Babyliss roller set.</li>
      <li>Well, I found that the clips that came with my roller set are adequate but these really are a lot better for holding them in place</li>
      <li>I got these to use with my hot rollers  because I read they are better than the roller clips that comes with my hot roller set.</li>
      <li>I do have pretty smooth hair</li>
      <li>I have purchased several sets and love them!</li>
      <li>Overall recommended, just nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Worth the purchase, all the way around.</li>
      <li>They hold much better than most other clips.  </li>
      <li>The wire clips take a LOT of practice to get right..</li>
      <li>These dont wrap entirely around the rollers to keep them in place, it&#x27;s a bit of a struggle to get them clamped somewhat securely, and even then they easily lose their grip and require re-clipping.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy to do my rolls in the morning !</li>
      <li>I got these curler clips to replace the ineffective ones that came with my hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using these with the Conair hot curlers.</li>
      <li>I use these for my hot rollers instead of the wire clips.  </li>
      <li>Watch when hot roller touches your neck or ear...be prepared with cotton balls to protect skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They get to hot.</li>
      <li>Wish I would of got some other kind.</li>
      <li>They are so simple to use and hold the curlers in my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>They are what I needed large enough to fit really large rollers.</li>
      <li>work perfectly and hold the roller in place without stabbing your head as the pins do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Theses are softer, gentle and keep heat on the curler closer to your hair.  </li>
      <li>I really like these clips.</li>
      <li>My mother is very picky about her hair products.</li>
      <li>Took just as much time to get them gripped onto the roller and hair in a way that it would stay put.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought these to go with my Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo Roller set.</li>
      <li>These clips I bought are big enough for my jumbo rollers and hold much better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for anyone who uses curlers.</li>
      <li>These are much easier to use than the metal pins that usually come with hot rollers, because they hold the roller better and hair completely and don&#x27;t heat up.</li>
      <li>I have trouble with hot rollers staying in my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t need them to hold rollers in, but were very helpful to partition &amp; hold my thick, long hair prior to applying  and using the hot rollers more quickly.</li>
      <li>The hot roller set that I bought didn&#x27;t come with enough clips.</li>
      <li>I use the clips that came with the hot rollers instead of these big bulky clips.</li>
      <li>But they only included half the amount needed, so I had to buy more.</li>
      <li>Bought these clips because my hair breaks easily and the pins for brush rollers, and hairpin shaped clips for hot rollers are definitely hard on my hair!  </li>
      <li>B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]].</li>
      <li>THESE WORK VERY WELL, AND ARE JUST ELEGANT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I NEEDED EXTRA CLIPS</li>
      <li>These fixed the problem.</li>
      <li>As you can imagine, the hot rollers havent come out for a long time.</li>
      <li>You have to put the clip with the short side down, and make sure you spin them into place, because if you just clip them over the roller, you may end up with a giant dent in your hair.  </li>
      <li>Really needed since the clips that came with the hot curlers are to small and do not clip to the head well.</li>
      <li>Not great, but not horrible</li>

    <li> Good clips. Keeps curlers in place. It&#x27;s nice to find a product that works well.</li>

    <li> Bought these clips because my hair breaks easily and the pins for brush rollers, and hairpin shaped clips for hot rollers are definitely hard on my hair!  These are great--they slip on and off easily, and hold my hair in place for the curl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using these with the Conair hot curlers. Really needed since the clips that came with the hot curlers are to small and do not clip to the head well.</li>
    <li> A. they dont hold the roller in tight enough and B. when I take the rollers out my hair has a big dent in it from where the clip was</li>
    <li> These clips are really really good.They don&#x27;t mark your hair and they fit any size rollers.</li>
    <li> This does not hold small rollers in place. I have fine hair and use the smallest in a magnetic roller set and this item would not hold the rollers in place. The did hold after they fell but that is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect clips for the velcro rollers - any size! Target and Walgreens used to carry them years ago - but no more. So glad to locate them at Amazon. I keep them in a basket with my velcro rollers. Sometimes, they are still laying on the floor - and I step on them. Not a good thing (they break)! But, atleast I know where to buy them! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are the best clips ever. Everything else I tried hurt my head but these hold strong and are very easy and pain free to use. You should definitely buy them.</li>
    <li> I bought these due to a recommendation I read in the reviews for the Remington H9000 Pearl Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers (which I also bought)  These do not leave dents as the ones can that come with this roller set.</li>
    <li> The hair curling clips work just as I had hoped they would. The grab onto the curlers without falling out our sliding down.</li>
    <li> the clips are perfect and work so much better than the wire clips you are given with hot rollers. never fall out. I love them!!!</li>
    <li> The clips did not hold as firm as I thought they would. I prefer the metal pins that come with the rollers over these clips....</li>
    <li> I bought these clips specifically for use with my[[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]. Was disapointed that they do not securely hold these rollers in my hair, especially since they were recommended and are of the same brand. These dont wrap entirely around the rollers to keep them in place, it&#x27;s a bit of a struggle to get them clamped somewhat securely, and even then they easily lose their grip and require re-clipping.</li>
    <li> I got these to use with my hot rollers  because I read they are better than the roller clips that comes with my hot roller set. Well, I found that the clips that came with my roller set are adequate but these really are a lot better for holding them in place and they don&#x27;t leave crimp marks in my hair.</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy clamps, they don&#x27;t hold very tight, so if you have heavy or thick hair it tends to fall out or pull down..</li>
    <li> You have to put the clip with the short side down, and make sure you spin them into place, because if you just clip them over the roller, you may end up with a giant dent in your hair.  It looks ridiculous.  They&#x27;re a good product though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for years and have periodically broken the flimsy clips that came with them.  These clips to replace them are perfect!  Sturdy and much more dependable at staying in my hair!</li>
    <li> My mother is very picky about her hair products. So after browsing Amazon she found this, and was very pleased with what she received. The order arrived quickly, and in great condition. I would recommend the vendor.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to do my rolls in the morning ! No more clips that brake my hair.  I love them</li>
    <li> They are what I needed large enough to fit really large rollers. It remains to be seen how long they will last.</li>
    <li> These clips work so poorly that I have stopped using the hot roller set all together.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do they need to be heated, they break constantly.  They do an exceptionally poor job of holding hair in place.  When they do work, I unroll my curls to discover unsightly creases left by these clips.  As you can imagine, the hot rollers havent come out for a long time.</li>
    <li> THESE WORK VERY WELL, AND ARE JUST ELEGANT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I NEEDED EXTRA CLIPS AND THEY SERVER THEOR PURPOSE WELL&lt;br /&gt;THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> I use these for my hot rollers instead of the wire clips.  Theses are softer, gentle and keep heat on the curler closer to your hair.  Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I use the clips that came with the hot rollers instead of these big bulky clips. They just seemed too clumsy for me to handle.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t hold my hair any better then the original clips which came with my 2&amp;#34; Conair purchase. Why do they leave a dent in my hair? Frustrating!</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed for my rollers.  The clips are easy to use.  I have arthritis but can use them easily.</li>
    <li> THESE PRO~CLIPS ARE AWESOME THAT THE DESIGNER SUGGESTED WHEN I BOUGHT THE CERAMIC REMINGTON H9000 PEARL HEATED CLIP ROLLERS.....THE CLIPS STAY IN PLACE, AND DO NOT SLIDE OUT! NO MATTER WHAT! AND I TRIED! I HAVE LONG HAIR TO MY WAIST!</li>
    <li> I really like these clips. They will fit any size roller and have a nice grip. I can also use them to section your hair.</li>
    <li> They work on those large rollers that I can&#x27;t keep in my hair with those stupid wire clips, but I found the Conair Curl Secret and that works better that any hot rollers every could</li>
    <li> The wire clips take a LOT of practice to get right.. these make it easy for those of us who have a difficult time with hair gadgets!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need them to hold rollers in, but were very helpful to partition &amp; hold my thick, long hair prior to applying  and using the hot rollers more quickly. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The rollers are just okay. They are Difficult to keep in. Seems you must remain still while they are curling your hair.</li>
    <li> I needed extra clips for my hot rollers and these work perfectly.  The hot roller set that I bought didn&#x27;t come with enough clips.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t mention this in the description.  Since one reviewer said there were only six, I ordered 2 sets.  Now, I have 20 clips for 10 rollers.....grrrrrrrr!</li>
    <li> I use these  in connection with the Conair heated jumbo rollers.  Their rollers have these dainty metal clips that don&#x27;t hold at all.  These fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> Love these clips!  They hold much better than most other clips.  I have alot hair and most wimpy clips wont hold...these do!</li>
    <li> I bought these clips to use with my conair roller set and they hold the rollers much better than the clips that came with the roller set. I bought 2 boxes so that I had enough for all of the rollers in my roller set. They don&#x27;t leave a line on my hair like the clips that came with my conair roller set either.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They work wonderfully on our hot curlers as well as our regular rollers.  I highly recommend for anyone who uses curlers.</li>
    <li> These are much easier to use than the metal pins that usually come with hot rollers, because they hold the roller better and hair completely and don&#x27;t heat up. Worth the purchase, all the way around.</li>
    <li> I love using the clips over my hot rollers. I have trouble with hot rollers staying in my fine hair. Now they stay until I take them down from my hair. This helps my curls last longer. I would suggest these for anyone with the same problem as myself. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These clips are a good deal ,great hold and work perfectly for my hot roller set!  I have purchased several sets and love them! I often just use them in my hair without rollers, add gel, scrunch a bit clip and let dry!  Nice curly do!</li>
    <li> Was looking for this type of electric roller clip and thankfully Amazon came through and I was able to order and receive them quickly. More work could be done on designing a roller clip that is not bulky but gets the job done. These work but they are clumsy to use and bulky for travel. But they work well and it&#x27;s what I needed to use my rollers when travelling.</li>
    <li> They are so simple to use and hold the curlers in my fine hair.  Much better than the pins that come with the curlers</li>
    <li> I just love these clips, They work so well with hot rollers and Velcro rollers. Keep the roller nice and snug.</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought these to go with my Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo Roller set. I never could get the hang of using the U shaped clips that come with the set. Only complaint is that if you use all 12 rollers, this set of clips comes in a 10 pack. I purchased 2 sets of clips.</li>
    <li> I have large rollers and these fit perfect and hold great in my hair. I would buy more when needed!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was exactly what I wanted. Best thing I&#x27;ve bought for myself in a longtime. Easy to find, reasonable price, free shipping, delivery was excellent, no damage, love this product.</li>
    <li> The Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips was a wonderful gift for my granddaughter who needed more clips.  She was very excited to receive them as we were to have found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have lost a few of the hair pins that came with my electric curlers and decided to try these clips.&lt;br /&gt;They work perfectly and hold the roller in place without stabbing your head as the pins do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with these roller clips.</li>
    <li> These clips were better than the ones the setter came with.  Holds hair better.  Threw out the ones setter came with.</li>
    <li> Rollers work perfectly! Watch when hot roller touches your neck or ear...be prepared with cotton balls to protect skin.&lt;br /&gt;The type of styling lotion makes a big difference in how long hair stays styled.</li>
    <li> The clips that came with my conair rollers left dents in my hair and were always falling out. I do have pretty smooth hair so I understand its hard for them to stay in but they needed more room. These clips I bought are big enough for my jumbo rollers and hold much better.</li>
    <li> So so, they hold the rollers ok. Not great, but not horrible, just ok.  I find the pins that came with the rollers hold them just as well as these clips.  I thought the clips would make the process easier and faster, but honestly it didn&#x27;t.  Took just as much time to get them gripped onto the roller and hair in a way that it would stay put.</li>
    <li> Expected clips to hold rollers tighter. But all in all ok for the cost. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing them to hold regular plastic but not hot rollers.</li>
    <li> They get to hot. Won&#x27;t stay in your hair. They keep falling out. Wish I would of got some other kind.</li>
