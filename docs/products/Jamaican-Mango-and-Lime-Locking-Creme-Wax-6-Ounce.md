      <li>Fantastic product and</li>
      <li>the texture similar to beeswax the black stuff but its great stuff locks up  good word of advice use after shower  </li>
      <li>First purchase was more waxy; second purchase was more liquid.</li>
      <li>a little bit after it dries, this stuff works great for that.</li>
      <li>my locs are 27 months old and look the better then they ever have.</li>
      <li>it came quickly in the mail, and held the locks together really well.  </li>
      <li>For the first 2-3 days it was holding pretty well</li>
      <li>this might be good but washing Petrolatum out of hair does not sound</li>
      <li>If you can apply everyday in a normal climate this product is probably pretty good</li>
      <li>I recommend dreading your lock nice and tight first.</li>
      <li>but I guess you are supposed to use more often because I noticed it began to dry out.</li>
      <li>Works very well for my son&#x27;s locs.</li>

      <li>YES  straight</li>
      <li>I really like this brand \\&quot;Mango &amp; Lime\\&quot; for my lock maintenance.</li>
      <li>this Locking Creme Wax...its really soft, light and has a soft scent.</li>
      <li>I also use many of their other products.</li>
      <li>Everybody knows the petroleum based products are not good for your hair, specially for dreadlocks!!!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend to those with dreads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very busy and don&#x27;t get to twist as often as i would like</li>
      <li>Petrolatum is the first ingredient on the bottle Followed by Micocrystaine wax, D&amp;C Yellow #11 and  </li>
      <li>First ingredient: Petrolatum, which is petroleum jelly   Second ingredient: Mineral Oil, which is a by-product of petroleum jelly  </li>
      <li>Its smells nice and a little dab goes a long way.</li>
      <li>if your naturally nappy just twist</li>
      <li>LOCs are natural no help needed  esp</li>
      <li>so when it is used there are natural issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
      <li>, i have been more proactive lately and notice the difference.</li>
      <li>i ordered this and recieved something totally different, it had the right order sticker on the jar but the jar was a different product</li>
      <li>I find when it&#x27;s in my hair, it takes my hair a long time to dry and kind of just smears around my little flyaways.</li>
      <li>is that just because a product is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it will work the best for your hair.</li>
      <li>It gives a soft conditioned look and feel to the lock while the \\&quot;Resistant Locking Gel\\&quot; or \\&quot;JAM\\&quot; holds and helps my locks to form properly.</li>
      <li>This this stuff will stay in your hair for better or worse.</li>
      <li>and I live in extreme heat conditions.</li>

    <li> This dread wax smells reaaally good. It holds your hair together for a few hours, I mainly use it after I shower and I need something to tame my dreadhawk a little bit after it dries, this stuff works great for that. You get a little bit on each dread and work it in until all the hairs are inside and it looks and smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after growing my locs for over a year. I have used EVERYTHING!!! I then saw this product and decided to buy it. I like it, it holds style if u are really trying to achieve it. It helps you help ur locs. no product is a miracle worker but this product has totally changed my locs. I&#x27;m very busy and don&#x27;t get to twist as often as i would like, i have been more proactive lately and notice the difference. my locs are 27 months old and look the better then they ever have. i have parts again!!!! When its wash time u may have to was ur hair a few times there is a lil build-up but it does not get flaky, and is not irritating. will be trying more of their products</li>
    <li> Does the job of maintaining the locks really good.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells really good too</li>
    <li> Everyone told me to use this product for my locks so I tried it out. I like the way it smells and it is very easy to apply. Not sticky like some other products. For the first 2-3 days it was holding pretty well but I guess you are supposed to use more often because I noticed it began to dry out. If you can apply everyday in a normal climate this product is probably pretty good but I work out all the time (sweating my hair out) and I live in extreme heat conditions.</li>
    <li> This is great if you want your dreads to moisterized and greasy. I had to wash my dreads with dawn dishsoap 3 times and all the grease still didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> love the smell, the way it feels in my noodles, and everything else about this product! Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> It is more like a grease than any kind of wax. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I have semi ethnic hair (mulatto) and it made my hair extremely EXTREMELY GREASY!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will be hitting a hair store nearby for an organic beeswax to continue working on my locks.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for years and the best thing I can tell ladies considering going natural is that just because a product is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it will work the best for your hair. This product can be drying but of all the products this product holds my curls after a twist out the best.     For those that don&#x27;t know, a twist out is when you two strand twist your hair and then unravel the twist and wear the ringlets. This product defines your curls and is perfect for that style.</li>
    <li> Inconsistent product.  First purchase was more waxy; second purchase was more liquid.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before doing my research on dreads. Thinking wax was something that was good to use. After my research i decided that this was not something i wanted in my dreads. Wax products like this while the lock them in place all so keep them from from  tightening.  So if you just want temp dreads this might be good but washing Petrolatum out of hair does not sound fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list on Amazon for this product is all so different from the list on the bottle. Petrolatum is the first ingredient on the bottle Followed by Micocrystaine wax, D&amp;C Yellow #11 and  fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all of that didn&#x27;t all ready kinda suck my container was broken on the bottom.</li>
    <li> i ordered this and recieved something totally different, it had the right order sticker on the jar but the jar was a different product</li>
    <li> But it didn&#x27;t last for me.  I have an extremely stubborn grade of hair.  Not enough hold for me. Maybe would work for someone with less stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> great locking creme! did its job with no complaints, and left a great smell in my dreads.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this product a lot.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smell gud but don&#x27;t help at all</li>
    <li> I am in the process of dreading my hair.  I had dreadlocks a few years back and was using Knotty Boy products then, but their prices kept me from buying their stuff this time around.    Pros: It smells GREAT, it&#x27;s affordable, and it&#x27;s not sticky like other waxes.  You should note that this a creme. This stuff isn&#x27;t going to be hard or stiff like your average beeswax.    Cons: I find myself having to reapply this stuff often, it doesn&#x27;t seems to have the same hold as Knotty Boy&#x27;s wax or even Murray&#x27;s.  Usually a little wax goes a long way but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t have the hold and I find myself using more of it.     Overall, my hair is dreading up nicely and it smells great.  I would recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t feel like spending a fortune on Knotty Boy or DreadHead products.</li>
    <li> First ingredient: Petrolatum, which is petroleum jelly   Second ingredient: Mineral Oil, which is a by-product of petroleum jelly  Everybody knows the petroleum based products are not good for your hair, specially for dreadlocks!!!  Don&#x27;t buy if you care for your hair!!</li>
    <li> I continue to love this product. I use it for my braids as a seal. I will apply a cream type moisturizer and then use this wax to lock in the moisture. What this does is to keep my hair moisturized and protected while it is braided and it helps with the process of taking my braids down by preventing dryness and therefore breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and how easy it is for me to apply to my braids. This is my system of choice for my braided styles.</li>
    <li> I love the product. it came before it was suppose to which is amazing and when i use it it makes my locks smell amazing and i have seen huge improvement in them. It is an amazing product if you use it as the directions tell you to.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints- it came quickly in the mail, and held the locks together really well.  Plus, it smells really good.</li>
    <li> This creme has a nice smell, but it would be nice if it were more waxy.  I find when it&#x27;s in my hair, it takes my hair a long time to dry and kind of just smears around my little flyaways.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and I highly recommend to those with dreads. Smells amazing without being over-powering and isn&#x27;t greasy. Very satisfied. Giving it a four because it was a Christmas gift and came later than expected.</li>
    <li> very good and service was outstanding</li>
    <li> this stuff smell so good wish the world smelled liked it  minuses the texture similar to beeswax the black stuff but its great stuff locks up  good word of advice use after shower  that&#x27;s how you get ultimate usage.</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful fragrance . It has great hold for locking. It also seems to moisturize the hair. I&#x27;ve used it now for five years. I also use many of their other products.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use the product.  It was recommended to me by a family member whose &#x27;locks&#x27; have a beautiful style and sheen.</li>
    <li> great for locks. havent used it personally but my clients enjoy the smell and the the shine. it works great</li>
    <li> I never put anything with beeswax in my locks or that of my clients.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand \\&quot;Mango &amp; Lime\\&quot; for my lock maintenance. I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. My daughter is 4 she has horrible scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried at least 50 different brands and products by now on my daughters head so i gave up!!! I was looking at some styles for my self one day and I saw a little girl on youtube that had her ahir locked and I had seen the progress of her hair growth. So I said if I lock my oldest daughter&#x27;s hair I  will still have my youngest daughter hair to braid and style, her haid wouldn&#x27;t be breaking or shedding from her constant scratching and it would just grow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So any way I locked her hair for 2 months KML I couldnt go throught with it! Her locks were beautiful n everything but I just had to plait and bead it up. I only used the Mango &amp; Lime stuff, thats the Locking Resistant Gel, the island oil it think..not sure of the correct name, this Locking Creme Wax &amp; the shampoo. Before my daughter hair was like a little off her shoulder, her scalp was a little damaged from the scatching and dry scalp but when i took the locks down her hair is almost in the middle of her back and her scalp was fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways I love this product and I am going to keep using them for myself and for my daughter even though she doesn&#x27;t have locks any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***About this Locking Creme Wax...its really soft, light and has a soft scent. I mix it with the \\&quot;Resistant Locking Gel\\&quot; or some \\&quot;JAM\\&quot; when i&#x27;m palm rolling then I go under the dryer! It gives a soft conditioned look and feel to the lock while the \\&quot;Resistant Locking Gel\\&quot; or \\&quot;JAM\\&quot; holds and helps my locks to form properly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works very well for my son&#x27;s locs. It has a great smell and very well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great scalp product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not good for the hair of some cultures  so when it is used there are natural issues.&lt;br /&gt;.Kinky YES  straight no!  however all hair locks  and some better than others..I have worn locks since 1975 without cutting so you know where they are  lol&lt;br /&gt; I choose to simply wash my hair and twist it with my fingers and oil my scalp..My sons use all of the products but their hair does not look as good as mine..Why?  LOCs are natural no help needed  esp if your naturally nappy just twist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps I am born in Angola</li>
    <li> I bought this for dreads but I read elsewhere compelling evidence that petroleum was bad for them so now I use it on my lips. Mmm.</li>
    <li> This this stuff will stay in your hair for better or worse. Its smells nice and a little dab goes a long way. I recommend dreading your lock nice and tight first.</li>
