      <li>The smell is incredible and it cleans your skin; I want it in a larger size bottle.  </li>

      <li>and I really enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>The clay is absolutely amazing product, very nature and makes the skin happy.&lt;br /&gt;Yet</li>
      <li>I shall stick with using the clay for a great facial.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I bought it as a gift for a family member they to love it</li>
      <li>First, I love that i don&#x27;t have to worry about the mask drying out, it&#x27;s already a powder that you get to mix up as you need it.</li>

      <li>This clay dries very tight on your face, it feels amazing while it dries and even more amazing when your done.</li>

      <li>Not knowing if I&#x27;d like it, I opted for this combination package figuring I could use the rose water for a facial mask if the cocktail was a bust.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely reorder the powder, but maybe not the set with the rose water.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful combo I apply this in the morning for 10 mind for a month,  and my skin has never been more cleaner or soft.</li>
      <li>I use it by itself as a toner to feel fresh</li>
      <li>What more could you want from a natural product.</li>
      <li>Other reviews had good results with that and is what made me decide to buy this product</li>
      <li>After about 30 minutes my skin turned back to a normal color and felt smooth and nice.</li>
      <li>I apply argan oil right after</li>

    <li> I wanted the rose water to try a recipe for a cocktail.  Not knowing if I&#x27;d like it, I opted for this combination package figuring I could use the rose water for a facial mask if the cocktail was a bust.  It was not good in a cocktail but works great for the facial mask!</li>
    <li> This product seems to works good as a mask where it gets rid of dead skin but I have not been able to get rid of stubborn white and black heads. Other reviews had good results with that and is what made me decide to buy this product so I am kind of disappointed it did not work as well for me.</li>
    <li> Love the product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I wish there was more rose water though. I ran out of it quickly, but I found that this helped my husbands dry skin on his scalp.</li>
    <li> Great. Works wonders. Saw a video online and decided to try. Very happy with purchase. Smells delectable too.</li>
    <li> I had Khassoul clay recommended to me when I got a facial done for my birthday. I can really tell a difference on my skin and the few wrinkles I have begun to get really seem to fade away after using. It does make my face a little red afterwards, but it goes away quickly. Moisturize well afterwards! I love this product and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This product has absolutely transformed my skin since the very first application. The rose water smells amazing! A must try product.</li>
    <li> Perfect service, on time delivery, loved it! Made my wifey happy, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of clay since I left the Middle East, a Turkish barber shop used it mixed with spices in a little brown packet. This clay dries very tight on your face, it feels amazing while it dries and even more amazing when your done. I recommend you mix it thin with the rose water for a deep penetration, also use something like sea breeze after you wash it off to deep clean all of the mask out of your pores. The rose water is great! I use it by itself as a toner to feel fresh and I really enjoy the scent. This is better than Kiehl&#x27;s mud mask in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful products, and so nice that they are paired together. Just mix a bit of the rose water with the clay powder for a fantastic mask that not only smells heavenly, but leaves one&#x27;s skin so soft and clear. Very delighted to have found this product.</li>
    <li> OMG, I just used my mask for the first time, and I just had to get on my computer and write this review.  A-MA-ZING!  Let me explian: I just bought a Clarisonic and started using two days ago.  My skin got so dry and rough on my cheeks close to my nose, so I am nervous about continuing to use it even though it does seem to be cleaning my skin better (many reviews say to just stick it through); so, I decided to use this mask in hopes that the detoxifying properties might help smooth my skin out and get rid of the dry patches.  Well, IT DID!  I would say it brought the dryness down by 95%.  The rest of my skin where I didn&#x27;t have roughness feels literally petal-soft and cool and refreshed.  I had these stubborn blackheads above the bridge of my nose next to my eyebrows that just would not come out even with my blackhead removing tool.  After taking off this mask, boom!--they popped right out with a gentle use of my blackhead removing tool.  Same for my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to tone and moisturize your skin (preferably with argan oil, which is what I did).  Also, this is an exceptionally STRONG mask--I&#x27;m talking, I&#x27;ve never felt a mask tighten this way before.  You literally feel and see the mask sucking your skin in and it literally moves your skin.  But it does not hurt and irritate.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product.  Does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Product was nice. Would purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product didn&#x27;t have my hair extremely dry like the amla powder the rose water is good the amla powder it burns my scalp I only put just a little bit this time around and it still burns</li>
    <li> I love it so much I bought it as a gift for a family member they to love it</li>
    <li> This mask makes my skin feel amazing afterward,  but when it dries, it feels slightly painful. I still use it once a month and I like the results.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with these products. They have done wonders for my difficult skin! I highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve the look and health of their skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used these products on my face to get rid of blackheads and it seemed to work okay, although a little drying. I may try the other type of clay next time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the rosewater!  The smell is incredible and it cleans your skin; I want it in a larger size bottle.  The clay is great for a facial but I&#x27;m not thrilled with it for my hair.  I shall stick with using the clay for a great facial.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful combo I apply this in the morning for 10 mind for a month,  and my skin has never been more cleaner or soft. It sort of a hasslebut the benefits of natural clay and exotic rose water is just too perfect. My makeup goes on smoother and my blackheads which I&#x27;ve had for years are diminished&lt;br /&gt;.  What more could you want from a natural product.</li>
    <li> I love the rose water, the clay dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the rose water so much, I placed another order for two bottles. According to the USPS they delivered it on March 4th, but I did not receive it. My order # 002-0536928-9264267&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to see if USPS will investigate this matter, since I suspect the delivery person left this item and two others at my door step and they were all stolen.</li>
    <li> I dont use this as much as I should, but this really reduced the depth of the lines on my neck area with just one use. I can imagine how well it would work for someone with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> love both of these products. First, I love that i don&#x27;t have to worry about the mask drying out, it&#x27;s already a powder that you get to mix up as you need it. The rose water smells like roses,but not overwhelmingly so. I use as a toner and after shave and deoderant (that probably sounds weird but now I don&#x27;t ruin my clothes with antiperspirants that don&#x27;t stop me sweating anyway). arrived well packaged abd on time.</li>
    <li> Good price, product is high quality.</li>
    <li> So far so good!! Love the rose water. Even though I did notice a lil spillage.Will b buying again. Hope they tighten up the lid.</li>
    <li> The rose water smells wonderful and seems very moisturizing!  I have very dry skin, so I do not leave the clay on as long as the directions say.  It seems to be very effective in evening my skin tone.  I follow this with a few drops of organic jojoba oil to moisturize and my complexion has been wonderful.</li>
    <li> Received within delivery time frame. The lava powder was not sealed and some did come out in the package. As for the use, this mask does hurt while it drys. It tightens the face. I don&#x27;t see a significant change in my facial skin.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I love this stuff the clay worked wonders on my hair cant wait the use it on my face.  the rose water is a great toner.</li>
    <li> I use the clay as a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; mixed with honey and water (with a little of the rose water). My hair is soft and shiny and not stripped.</li>
    <li> Loved the packaging and love the product even more. Didn&#x27;t think I would be able to mix but its easy!&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the rose water is so nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used clay once so far, mixed with the rose water and it was a strong mask, drying very tight, so I might have used too much clay...I&#x27;ve been using the rose water by itself also as a toner and its very nice.  My skin is looking fine.  The mask did not draw out every single black head on my face but overall I like the products.  I also want to try the clay in my hair as a mask but have not gotten around to that yet.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to receiving these two products especially after all the five stars reviews I have read out there, not only on Amazon but also on other websites. I was a little sad when I received the package because the rose water spilt for like a quarter and the jar is not sealed :-/ (hence the four stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it is indeed a five stars product. The rose water smells amazing and my face skin felt refreshed and hydrated immediately. The clay mask does keep its promise. I have T zone skin with a lot of blackheads on my nose and under my chin I get these painful and under the skin spots which I can never squeeze because they are very deep and I have to deal with the pain until they heal on their own.  This clay did its magic trick right after the first usage. The blackheads on my nose just washed away with the clay and the inflammation caused by the spots under my chin has reduced considerably and the spots are already healing. After using the clay I had a little bit of dry skin on my cheeks, but just using rose water afterwards took care of it.</li>
    <li> The rose water is OK but don&#x27;t use the mud for hair just stick to the facial treatment</li>
    <li> feels good on the skin. love the rose water as a toner and the clay mask feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> I love this set. I use them together and separate. So great for skin and super gentle for my super sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I received my purchase a day ahead of schedule of the delivery date, that was a wonderful surprise. That being said I can count on the seller to give personal attention to getting my purchase&lt;br /&gt;Order to me on time. My experience with Elma &amp; Sana organic Moroccan rose water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and khassoul powder was more than I expected. The rose water had a nice fresh rose scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;I grow roses so I can tell the difference between&lt;br /&gt;still and distilled rose water. It was very soft and&lt;br /&gt;refreshing like they were basket pick from the&lt;br /&gt;rose bushes in a timely matter and preserve it fullness.  The khassoul powder was  rich in color. The texture finely ground perfect for the uses describe on the jar. After using the khassoul powder my hair was soft to the touch. My fizziness was control.  The moisture was replace back Into my hair. This product after one use has become a permanent part of my hair regimen. It was the missing link for my hair. Before I had to continue to moisturizer and co wash a couple time a week now problem solved. The next day it was shiny, soft and  bouncy and my bantu knots held their form without gel just shea butter. My recipe with the khassoul power the amount you add depends on how much hair you have to cover. Khassoul 4 table spoons, peppermint 20 to 40 drops depends on how strong you want it to be. I have been using peppermint mixture for over a year. If you starting out using it start with a smaller dose of 10 to 20 drops. Peppermint with stimulate ,massage, the scalp and improve blood circulation to the scalp to promote growth and a few drop of coconut oil. Place a plastic cap or plastic bag on your head for 45 min to a hour. Depend on the degree of what condition you hair is in. I am a year and several months natural. I leave the mixture in at least 2 to 4 hours for this first session and intend to leave it in on a overnight basis</li>
    <li> I have done many many masks in my lifetime, but this one is absolutely amazing!  I bought it for my sons acne, but love it for myself.  It really clarifies and tightens the skin and I love the rose water smell.</li>
    <li> This duo with some olive oil did wonders for my hair. It softened my kinks and defined my curl&lt;br /&gt;pattern. I wish it was more product tho. Also it was delivered to me in two days.</li>
    <li> I love the rose water. I have started spraying it on my face and it feels so good and refreshing. I apply argan oil right after and I love the way it mixes with the rose water and soaks right in. The clay I am still trying to figure out. I think I have been making my mask too thick so when it dries it really pulls on my skin and then it is really difficult to wash off, so I am going to try to thin it out a bit. I have cystic acne on my chin and I can&#x27;t say that the clay has helped me with that at all but I still like doing the clay masks and I think it purifies my skin in other ways. I love single ingredient skin care.</li>
    <li> The clay is absolutely amazing product, very nature and makes the skin happy.&lt;br /&gt;Yet the rose water is a little bit irritating for my skins.</li>
    <li> Next time I will purchase the clay alone. It leaves my skin so smooth and soft. Actually, I don&#x27;t just like it, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using rose water, BUT this one smells kind of weird... It doesn&#x27;t smell like fragrant, distilled roses... Maybe it was from a weird batch of roses, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I tried to apply the mixute of the rose water and clay on my face. For some reason my face turned red like after sunburn. I didn&#x27;t have burning sensation though. After about 30 minutes my skin turned back to a normal color and felt smooth and nice. I&#x27;m going to try it again. The rose water alone smells amazing. I wish the smell lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Amzing value, and great quality. There are sooo many product to chose from, this is the best for me. It leaves my skin feeling tight and clean I love it</li>
    <li> I have purchased Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s argan oil in the past and I knew they had great products.  This is a great set at a wonderful price.  I first tried the Khassoul clay through Shea Terra and loved it&#x27;s effect on my skin and wanted to try this because it included the rose water.  This leaves your skin incredibly soft but tight with closed pores and not dried out at all.  This is a fantastic way to get minerals directly deposited into your skin.  Highly recommend this set.  Thanks Elma &amp; Sana!</li>
    <li> I waned to make sure this product got the review it deserved.  As far as the mud-I am a Klutz-so that didn&#x27;t go so well.  However the rose water is what I wanted to bring to people&#x27;s attention.  I live in the 6000 high altitude area of Colorado.  I purchased some of the &#x27;simply&#x27; face cleaning towelettes.  The rose water has been sitting for a few months when I looked at it after cleaning my face with the towelette.  I put a couple of drops of the rose water on a white towel and took another layer of make up off my face.  I am about to buy another bottle, but wanted everyday people to see this and know for a person with skin allergies, sensitivities and breakouts, this is a really great product to clean your face, and the rest of you (helps with sleep) with a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I love this moroccan clay powder!  I think the set is a little pricey.  I can get the clay powder by itself and purchase the rose water at EarthFare for much less.  But this is a wonderful mask!  I love to mix it up and apply it just before taking a bath.  When the tub is full, I get in and wash off the mask.  That makes a mess in the tub, but that&#x27;s ok.  The mask makes my skin feel wonderful and maybe the clay in the bath water helps my skin too (?).  Either way, this makes my face feel soft, smooth, clean, and makes my pores look smaller.  And I think it takes the redness out of blemishes.  I will definitely reorder the powder, but maybe not the set with the rose water.</li>
    <li> Amazing product mixed with room temp aloe vera juice works wonders on face n hair</li>
    <li> Not the real  rose water maybe ?! Kind of diluted with water !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the rose water and I really liked it. I have yet to try the clay mask.</li>
    <li> I did not think the product was as quality that was stated. My expectation was not met i&#x27;m sure the results vary but it didn&#x27;t help my skin type</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of these products.  Works great and leaves your skin irresistibly soft and smooth.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
