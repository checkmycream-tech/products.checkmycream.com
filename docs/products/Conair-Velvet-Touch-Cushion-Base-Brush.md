<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this brush. I really think it has made my hair healthier because it pulls the scalp oil to the ends.</li>
    <li> Makes hair smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> i love it glides through my smoothly and is great</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot but don&#x27;t love it. It tends to pull out my hair but that could just be because my hair is always so knotty and I have really thick hair as well. Probably should look for a softer brush.</li>
    <li> It has a nice wide head, which is very useful for long hair.  Cushiony head and a comfortable handle.  A great value.</li>
    <li> Great brush and good price</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for detangling! Any length hair! And I have very thick hair and now no more tangled mess!</li>
    <li> I find it a bit harsh on my head but it does de-tangle my hair fine.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.  I am going to buy another one.  Unfortunately, the one I had broke after only two months.  But that&#x27;s how much I like the brush. I&#x27;m willing to keep buying it even though the handle may not be very sturdy.  Edit: I decided not to re-buy this brush.  I found the Wet Brush which works soooo much better and it is one solid piece so my hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged in the groove where the handle and paddle meet and will also, hopefully, not break so easily.</li>
    <li> High Quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Good for combing straight or back, while giving volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Hard to use for precise combing of course, due to size.&lt;br /&gt;* A little bit large, if you want to carry while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;* White dots do not come off, so firmly built&lt;br /&gt;* Chic design.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!  I am a black woman with natural hair...helps with de-tangling with ease!  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice hairbrush. It&#x27;s got an easy to grip handle and nice bristles for brushing long hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go-to hairbrush, nice large head and comfortable handle.</li>
    <li> I got it for my mom she loves it.</li>
    <li> i recently went natural, and the brush works great for me 💁💕</li>
    <li> I am absolutely totally satisfied with the brush with a velvet touch!</li>
    <li> A basic brush, but it&#x27;s just what it appears to be.</li>
    <li> Perfectly good paddle brush. This type of brush is supposed to have some give but it is quite stiff, so it received 4/5 stars instead of 5/5. However, if you prefer stiff bristles this will work perfectly for you.</li>
    <li> Nice and does the function it claims. Good deal too with the &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; program</li>
    <li> Arrived with bristles smashed flat and unusable.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush of all time, especially if you have long hair.</li>
    <li> Great deal, but a bit hard on the scalp</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for blow drying long, thick hair. Doesn&#x27;t catch AT ALL. Very gentle with no stretching or pulling.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly very nice quality. much better than the Revelon hair brushes we bought from Macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Great brush. I have been using round brushes for years, this brush gives my hair a sleek look, but still keeps the fullness.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom she loves it, no complains from her at all</li>
    <li> Perfect for my long hair</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. It gets rid of my knots quickly and painlessly. 5 stars, easily.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> It seems to be a really good brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Very big Brush though. Love the handle .</li>
    <li> Too big than I expect</li>
    <li> little hard and seemd cheap. But works</li>
    <li> Great for detangling curly hair!!</li>
    <li> Have used this brush for many , many years. Love it and works well for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and it works very well. One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
    <li> This was a great brush while it lasted.  Unfortunately the handle broke off after less than 6 months of use.  5 stars for it while it lasted, minus 2 however for the short lifespan.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best brush that i have. It detangles even on wet hair</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time and love it! I have SUPER snarly hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it brushed through my wet hair without feeling like I was totally yanking on my scalp and/or destroying my hair. I had heard great things about the wet brush (which to be fair, I&#x27;ve only had my hairdresser use on me) but decided to try this first based on price. About to order another one!</li>
    <li> Pretty standard hair brush.  Good product for this price point</li>
    <li> After my last visit to the hairdresser, I was advised to purchase a &amp;#34;paddle brush&amp;#34;!  Had no idea what it was or what I would do w/it, but my hairdresser instructed me and how to use it for my new hairstyle.  Went to a Beauty supply store and was appalled at the price they were charging, $15 to $20!  I went online to my great fall back, Amazon, and lo and behold, found them their for a fraction of the price.  Received it today and I love it and it helps a great deal w/the kind of styling I&#x27;m doing now, learn something new everyday!</li>
    <li> Love the size and its soft!</li>
    <li> Feels so nice!  I just needed to replace my tired old Conair paddle brush with a new one but this one really does have a nice feel.  Love!</li>
    <li> EHHH. Didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use it.  While taking it out the packaging it fell and the handle broke complete off I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Never brushed my hair regularly before. I heard it was good for you. Although I have very short hair, my scalp doesn&#x27;t burn or get scratched from the brush. Came in on time. Brush was in a plastic bag. I&#x27;ve been using it daily. There is a slight chemical smell when I took it out. Nothing fancy but for me it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The brush has a bad smell to it, like rubber. I never used it. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It was so cheap and it is the best brush I have ever had! It didn&#x27;t look like anything special but it was so cheap and had good reviews so I ordered it and now i see what everyone was talking about. I have very dry thick course hair and it is hard for me to find a brush that works but this is great!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my six-year-old grand-daughter for her birthday.  She was thrilled and immediately used it to gently remove tangles from her silky hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Very sturdy. I have really long hair and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. Having read the reviews, I was a bit skeptical, but after using it I do notice that my hair does not fall out as easily as before (I use to use a comb). Also, my hair does seem shinier! Not only that, the bristles feel good sliding on my scalp with each brush stroke.</li>
    <li> Feels Great on my head! I love it!</li>
    <li> My Wife&#x27;s Conair brush handle broke the other week so I got her this as they didn&#x27;t carry the type she broke.</li>
    <li> It massages my scalp&lt;br /&gt;its easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;i have not had a brush that i love more!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Doesn&#x27;t snag hair. Very good quality. Material of the brush dries fast after washed.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush! It can handle my thick hair and I love it! It&#x27;s quite sturdy too.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush that I have ever owned. I have really crazy hair and sometimes I forget to brush it for a few days. I have frequently panicked thinking that I am going to have to cut all of my hair off when other brushes couldn&#x27;t make it through the tangles without nearly ripping my scalp off. However, this brush (that I purchased based on other people&#x27;s awesome reviews and the low price) makes it through really crazy tangles without any problem at all. It does not hurt whatsoever and if the brush ever broke in the future it is the only one that I would ever buy again.</li>
    <li> The rubber grip on the brush would constantly pull my hair and the brush itself broke within a month</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush- like the Olivia Garden Ceramic line better.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I just love this brush. It keeps our hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great brush... It untangles well and fast.  However its hard on the head with no give on the bed.  Its easy to clean and is very durable.  I am happy</li>
    <li> Nice hairbrush.  I bought two and unfortunately one was missing some bristles but they both work fine.</li>
    <li> The Best!  Able to detangle my daughter&#x27;s long hair much better with this brush.</li>
    <li> Works great. A little harder than I like but obviously I just push lighter while brushing. Free shipping makes it a must</li>
    <li> The paddle makes it easier to brush through &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; hair because the teeth are flexible and wider apart- but also when anyone&#x27;s hair is wet.</li>
    <li> Very good. Cheaper than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller I recommend both!</li>
    <li> Wow. no pull detangling brush. I have very curly hair and this does the trick. I love it. Gotta get my sister one.</li>
    <li> I love this product!works great on my hair,its my favorite one.i feel like my hair makes more straight.</li>
    <li> I like how it brushes your hair so nicely.</li>
    <li> Love! I originally had a different brush for about 2 years. The brissels started falling out and it started to really tugging at my hair. So I needed a new one. I looked at Amazon and thought hey, for less the $4 why not try it. And omg amazing! My hair use to be very thin and fine. When I grew my hair out and started using a different shampoo. So my hair seems very thick now. With this brush, it gets right thru it. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to tug or pull out hair. So it&#x27;s a bonus for me as I don&#x27;t want to go back to having thin hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have found ever for my daughters thick hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a good friend as I have the same one already. She loves it and my daughter loves it. Tangles come out easily</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, it&#x27;s also curly and wavy.  I&#x27;ve tried the Wet Brush and it couldn&#x27;t even handle my hair when dry.  I returned it and decided to try this brush.  It glides through my hair wet or dry!  I think it has to do with the bristles not being too flexible which I found the bristles on the Wet Brush to be.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug although I always start brushing from the bottom up.  It cuts a lot of time out of styling my hair and I love the price!</li>
    <li> LOve using this brush, it&#x27;s kind of soothing to the hair and scalp. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Not that exciting, but it does the job and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> this is the 3rd brush of this kind that I have brought from different makers and I keep getting the same results the teeth bends and eventually the plastic pulls away from the brush and i&#x27;m left with a 2 piece the paddle and the brush.  I use this to wrap my hair at night so that I don&#x27;t have to use heat or rollers every day.  I won&#x27;t buy this type of brush again they don&#x27;t last long.  I have decided to stay away from buying these types of brushes I have found the perfect brush and it&#x27;s been working wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this brush! First the price is great. Second, brushing my long, easily tangled hair is like a dream. My last brush pulled my hair and this one seems so much more gentle.</li>
    <li> Great brush, like it alot, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife cant shut up about this brush, lol... she says it&#x27;s very soft and a bargain for the money.</li>
    <li> With the exception of the strong smell of rubber, I liked this brush until it snapped in half while I was brushing my hair. Granted, my hair was wet and I have moderately thick hair, but I was definitely not overtaxing the brush. I used it maybe 10 times. I owned my last paddle brush for about 10 years, and the only reason I finally replaced it is because so many bristles had fallen out.</li>
    <li> I have thick, thick hair.  This brush works great!</li>
    <li> Great brush, can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Replaced my wife&#x27;s hairbrush.  This is a quality brush - no complaints from the lady.</li>
    <li> It is a nice size and a well made brush! I love it. Very wonderful. Great price as well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Does a great job in conjunction with my hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is already partially straight by the time I am 80% dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered three for my girls.  We will be ordering more.  We love them!</li>
    <li> My wife has extremely thick hair &amp; this is through only type of brush that gets through her hair &amp; tangles. Been using this type &amp; brand for years.</li>
    <li> This brush fell apart in less than a month.</li>
    <li> I spent over 4 decades trying brushes for my super fine, thin, and long hair that does not tear my few precious strands.  Who would have thought that an inexpensive brush would work better than all the others. When I awaken my hair is a jumbled mess. With this Conair brush I did not feel one tug.  It is AMAZING!!!  I&#x27;m ordering another one. My hair is the kind that knots when the wind blows. If you have hair like mine, buy this. It is a 10 Star item.  After I wrote this review the price jumped from $2.90 to the present price of almost $9.  That happens often here on Amazon. I feel Someone is taking advantage of you and me. Also, it is never a small increase, it always seems to double. Rediculous,</li>
    <li> Very soft with my hair and detangles. Very efficient when blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for tangled hair. It does not pull and combs through amazingly.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick hair...it is curly on the underside and straight on the top. What does that mean? It is usually a frizzy, thick mess of knots. The hardest part of tangled hair is finding a brush that is gentle, so as not to rip everything out or make you cringe in pain as you brush. I have tried many types of brushes, but this is soft and cushioned...and awesome for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, especially to those with long, thick hair!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Def my favorite. very nice quality.</li>
    <li> NICE AS DESCRIBED PACKAGED WELL SHIPPED FAST</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s a brush. It brushes. Mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> I have very long curly hair.  This brush helps get the tangles out fast and painlessly.  My daughter is disabled and cannot sit up unassisted so she always has knots in the back of her head, but the brush helps remove them quickly and painlessly as well.  She does not fuss when I brush her hair and THAT says a lot!! Great brush.  I will be replacing all of my&lt;br /&gt;Other brushes with this one.  Yes I have a few becauSe I always misplace them lol.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is ok, I have had better experience with some other smaller brush that cost even less but I lost that one. I don&#x27;t know much about brush materials but this one was just too stiff for my hair. I have 32 in. long hair that is extremely thick, slightly wavy and a bit dry. This brush didn&#x27;t really help me get through all my tangles without experiencing pain. It would be excellent to have in the car or somewhere that you can use when you&#x27;re in a pinch but not as an everyday brush. I would suggest invest more in brush if you have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it for her long straight hair!</li>
    <li> Favorite brush! Re-ordered it to have an extra, I&#x27;m so happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Great price, and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed at first, but now I love this brush.  It holds onto the hair while I&#x27;m blow drying, so I don&#x27;t get a sink full of hair to clean-up.  My hair is very thick and it allows me to brush it out in seconds, very fast and thorough.  I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time fussing with my hair, so this brush saves me time.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Great brush. If anything happens to it, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day. It is gentle on my hair and the paddle size is great for pulling a ponytail together. I threw three of my &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; bushes away after I started using this. They just couldn&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite brush, so soft and it makes my hair seem more shiny, for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Large enough to brush my hair smoothly, dry and wet</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING!  I bought this brush because why else, I needed a new brush for my hair.  Having hair that goes down almost to my butt I need a brush that wont give out on me partway through brushing.  This brush is super comfortable to use.  It has a nice handle that does not hurt my hand after brushing for a bit and the bristles are not super stiff so they don&#x27;t stab me in the head with each stroke.  It is also super easy to clean.  Even my dog likes this brush, he thought it would make a tasty snack one day, but luckily I caught him before he destroyed it.  Don&#x27;t worry the brush is okay!  It has no missing bristles and only slight scaring in the corner.  I think the fact that it survived my dog trying to eat it says a lot for the durability of this brush!  If you are looking for a new brush, especially if you have long hair that knots easily this brush is your next brush!  I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a new brush.  Actually I should probably buy a few more to keep on hand in case I lose mine or they stop selling them or something</li>
    <li> I got this for half the price I would buy it in the store as an add on item and I will not use any other brush. I have very curly, thick hair as well as my daughter and this is the solution!</li>
    <li> so far so good. I kind of gotten tired of similar brushes with the bristles go down inside of the pad rendering the brush useless. This one is not done that and I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t if in fact it does I&#x27;ll get back later and change my rating.</li>
    <li> Works well with wet hair and with dry hair... also used it while blow drying and performed well.</li>
    <li> This was only a couple bucks add on item &amp; I needed a new brush, so I grabbed it.  It&#x27;s pretty good for the $2 something I spent on it, but it is just plastic brush.</li>
    <li> I just love this hair brush,I like what it do</li>
    <li> Is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever yet to own.. SOOOO satisfied with it. Cud use it wen my hair is wet and it does not pull a lot of my hair out :)</li>
    <li> price quality very good choice. I received what I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my long thick hair!</li>
    <li> This brush is not very heavy. It combs my hair well and is easy to use and clean. I use it often to brush my hair out during/after blow dry-sessions at home. It is a good brush for the price!</li>
    <li> Great for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair that gets tangled constantly (even if it is up) and this brush glides right through.  It&#x27;s hard for me to find a brush that will go through my hair without having to tug and pull and break my hair when it gets knotted.</li>
    <li> It was just a stocking stuffer, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive, and days after X-Mas. That much was very disappointing. The brush is quite nice and the recipient is enjoying it today.</li>
    <li> The brush has already dented in in the middle and I can&#x27;t get it back out. Happened the day I bought it. Otherwise I would have liked it.</li>
    <li> I would dread having to brush my 4 year old sisters very long ( to her lower back) slightly curly hair. Her hair gets very knotty very fast. It was a good 15-20 minutes process going through and brushing out her hair. But now with this brush it literally takes less than 5 minutes. And it&#x27;s a breeze. I did not have to distract her with my phone and did not hear a single &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34;. I am amazed at the difference a brush can make!</li>
    <li> Great brush especially that fact it doesn&#x27;t frizz out your hair.. Works great when blow drying wet hair into a straight hairstyle..</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price. I have long, very straight hair, and this is great for tangles, for blow-drying, and feels good on the scalp. Conair always produces.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush but I love it. It has a nice grip and really puts the strands of my hair in place. The bristles are relaxing...</li>
    <li> Bought it for mom because they said it wont snag or pull. She has thin native American hair.&lt;br /&gt;This snags and pulls worse than her bristle brush.</li>
    <li> Feels good when brushing your hair</li>
    <li> great brush, I love this brush it does a well done job to comb my hair specially for people that have lots of thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and this brush is great for it! Doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair like other brushes do, gets tangles out easily, and the handle is strong for getting through my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This brush a little awkward to use because it is so big. Not sure of this yet</li>
    <li> The third time I used it the brush part separated from the back of the brush. Sigh. So now every time I use it sooner or later it pulls out. I really should have returned it when this happened. I&#x27;ve had brushes for years and years, this should have lasted more than a few times.</li>
    <li> Nice paddle brush, hard to go wrong here.</li>
    <li> It would be an amazing brush if the handle Wasn&#x27;t complete crap it broke the first time I brushed my hair and I have thin hair</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I normally did not use a brush on my 3C/4A natural hair, but this brush has been gentle and does not rip my hair when I use it for light styling. I also used it after blowing out my natural hair and flat ironing. Great brush!</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t too forgiving.  I was expecting more of a cushion.  It was a decent brush for the money.</li>
    <li> Was cheap, works fine, comfortable to hold and comb hair, so happy with product.</li>
    <li> I was kind of confused how a brush could be rated so highly when I bought this, but it really is a great brush. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Overall not a bad brush. It says that it is good for wet or dry hair, but I do have difficulty getting it through my wet hair ( thick and wavy). I now use a different brush for my wet hair, but this works fine on my dry hair. It&#x27;s nothing special, but gets the job done</li>
    <li> Excellent brush at a great price!!!</li>
    <li> i have med/long hair and this brush is great! it detangles easily and leaves my hair smooth without the static that some paddle brushes do to you hair! love</li>
    <li> Love it! Same type my stylist uses. Hair dries smooth</li>
    <li> Great brush for the money, very sturdy and perfect for using in the shower!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to use when blow drying my hair smooth, but now I also use it in place of my detangling comb. I have fine-textured hair that tangles easily when it&#x27;s wet, and this brush goes through it without breaking my hair - much better than a comb!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush.  Not a lot can go wrong. My only complaint and it has to do with shipping (so, not reflected in my rating) is that the plastic label that wraps around the brush dug into the bristles causing them to indent for awhile making the brush feel awkward when brushing, but it has since popped out.</li>
    <li> hard plastic bristles</li>
    <li> Best brush combs my hair really nicely and detangles my hair great. It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
    <li> new. clean. and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> The brush itself works fine but the handle broke after I dropped it on the floor one time. I still use it without the handle and it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great add on item. Soft bristles, brush has a good surface area and has a good grip. For the price versus performance, it&#x27;s worth the buy. Keep in mind I am a guy that was looking for just a basic comb to travel with and then throw away...my expectations were not that high and this more than exceeded it for the price.</li>
    <li> Size is bigger than I expected, otherwise quality is good.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very naturally curly hair (for a white girl), and was afraid this brush would get caught in my hair while dry brushing or using it to blow my hair straight, so I was very skeptical when I bought it. I am happy to report that I LOVE this brush! It is my favorite brush to use now, does not pull my hair much (wet or dry), and works wonderfully! It is really easy to get the huge mass of hair out of it after my daily hair brushing, too! LOL</li>
    <li> Love it.  Super easy to run through my knotty curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, basic paddle brush with plastic bristles and smooth round plastic tips. It is very comfortable in your hands, not too heavy and not too light-weight.  Perfect for styling long, wavy hair!</li>
    <li> i like this hair brush, this one is very soft and good quality for this price , recommend everyone to buy.</li>
    <li> Can,t beat it ror the price, Use it allthe time.</li>
    <li> This is great I have very thick hair so finding a good brush is hard. This is cheap and does the trick.</li>
    <li> Very nice, helps detangle  my daughter mop a lot easier!</li>
    <li> Great product!! And for the price it&#x27;s a bargain :)</li>
    <li> very good for my hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price!</li>
    <li> Nice general purpose brush. I have long thick curly hair and it works great for me. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Very sturdy brush. However, this means it&#x27;s a little rough on the head. It should definitely last a long time though.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair brush. I love the velvety feel of the handle and the back of the brush. It glides perfectly on my curly thick hair. Doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair strands. I love using it to just &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; my head while brushing. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot but sometimes I feel like I am banging my head with it--I am not sure if it the nature of the style of the rush or if I just bang my head?  But it does smooth the hair nicely and a nice price.</li>
    <li> First of all, for the price, this brush is so worth it! I would even buy it for much more. It works better than most brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have the thickest hair. My hair is straight but easily gets knotted up by the wind or just throughout the day. When I first received the brush, it was a lot bigger than expected, I don&#x27;t really mind. If anything, it&#x27;s an advantage, because now I only have to brush 5-6 times for my whole head. It brushes effortlessly and without any tug. How is it possible that my hair feels more velvety and soft after I brush it as well?! All in all, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this brush.</li>
    <li> The brush was a Christmas gift, my granddaughter loved the brush. It&#x27;s easy for her to brush her tangled hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush if you have either tape or clip in hair extensions.</li>
    <li> its a brush that works,nuff said</li>
    <li> I had to buy my own hairbrush because my sister keeps stealing mine. I ended up getting another one for Christmas but I still use this one. I think an important part of a hairbrush is stiff bristles that don&#x27;t bend under thick, tangly hair. My hair is just past my shoulders but there&#x27;s so MUCH of it and this brush does not shy away. I love it. actually, when I bought it, it was an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item and only $6 but I suppose it was so popular they decided to charge twice as much and have it ship individually. It&#x27;s still worth $14 though. if you have prime, it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m not sure how much the shipping is if it&#x27;s not prime, but if you don&#x27;t have prime, just go buy one in the store where you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. I love this. my tangly lion mane hates it and loves it.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I have never met someone with as much hair as I have. I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair that grows down to my butt! The knots I get just from sleeping are tremendous! It is a tough thing to keep up with. Sometimes I let it go and don&#x27;t bother brushing my hair for four days. And that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s just horrible and makes me want to cut it. This brush makes brushing through the knots so much better and less painful. The knots closest to your scalp are the worst but this brush makes it least painful as possible. My old brush is smaller than this and it worked, but it hurt. I don&#x27;t know why but bigger brushes just like this, make it so much better. I love it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it: It has this weird strong smell to it that hasn&#x27;t gone away and I&#x27;ve had it for a month. It&#x27;s a really really strong factory rubber kind of smell. I don&#x27;t like it. Maybe it&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;m pregnant and my smelling is heightened but I don&#x27;t like it. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this?</li>
    <li> Strong, great brush. Helps detangle and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have kinky coily hair and this brush work well with it. The soft cushion helps with smoothing, especially when I am using setting products or oils. If you have hair like mine, make sure you use the brush on small sections of hairs. Don&#x27;t forget to detangle those sections first with a wide tooth comb. If were to ever use a blow dryer again, this would probably be the brush I&#x27;d use for blowouts.</li>
    <li> Great, absolutly awesome, i dont know if i am wrong but i feel my hair more handy since i been usingthis one(1 month)</li>
    <li> I like this brush I like the feel of it when I brush my hair..  The only problem I have with this type is trying to get out the accumulated hair in it.  Anyone have any great suggestions?  I have tried using a comb but because these brushes have those little getting balls it doesnt work well. I also tried a knife but it is very time consuming.  There has to be a way.  Anyway that is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Good hair brush for long hair,</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Conair paddle brush, this one has a very uncomfortable handle. The handle is short, small in diameter, and not cushioned. The cushioning on the older model really helped me get a good hold when brushing long, wet hair. Also, as other reviewers pointed out, the bristle pad is not nearly as forgiving as the older model, and tends to pull more. I would not buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> would have been perfect if it didn&#x27;t come in dented</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comfy brush, except I dropped it on the wooden floor from my hand once and the whole handle snapped off. But the paddle part is wide enough for me to use it without the handle.</li>
    <li> This brush has NO GIVE. It&#x27;s hard and hurts when you brush with it. If I hadn&#x27;t paid do little for it, I would return it. OUCH!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s BIG! Does a great job brushing hair and getting tangles out</li>
    <li> Great paddle brush that&#x27;s very gentle on the scalp. Love the price!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair, and it takes quite the brush to get through tangles. This one slides through with ease, and is sturdy enough to reach my scalp as I brush! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great add-on item, good quality brush for long hair.</li>
    <li> perfect for my girls hair. runs easily without pulling her hair</li>
    <li> This brush has been used only 3 times since I&#x27;ve had it.  On the first use, one of the bristle tips snapped off and hit my forehead.  I thought it was one of the protection balls that flew off...no, the bristle broke in half with the ball still attached--ouch.  The second use was fine and the third two balls fell off.  Yeah, it is now in the bottom of the drawer. The size and grip handle are nice, however the durability is poor. I usually keep brushes for years and they withstand daily use, cleaning and weekly soaking with no problem. I&#x27;ve never experienced this before with a brush.  I have a couple of Conair brushes which is why I bought this one.  Hopefully, you&#x27;ll have a better experience than I did.</li>
    <li> So I have waist-length, straight, fine to medium hair. My hair gets easily tangled but anything and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to brush out. I think it works alright, it just all depends on your brushing technique. I start from the bottom and work my way up. With that being said, it has a plastic smell. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a month or two and it still smells like it just came out of the package. That would be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush. It&#x27;s perfect for my long thin hair and it lets me  remove tangles without all the pain. It works great on both wet or dry hair and it&#x27;s very well made. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years now with no missing bristles nor bristle tips.</li>
    <li> Great hairbrush for any type of hair, but truly amazing for long hair that tangles easily. Wet or dry this wont pull out your hair, wish I knew about these types of brushes earlier.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my existing hair brush (which I have kept for way too long) and this one is by far the most economical off all that I saw.  My old brush that I had (embarrassingly for 9+ years - I did clean it on regular basis) was by Conair as well, but after such a long run, it was time to part with it.  One thing that I really appreciate about Conair hair brushes, that (at least from my experience) the little ball tips on top of the bristles don&#x27;t chip off, even after years of usage.  I cannot remember how many brushes I used in the past that after a month or so of usage, the tips will start coming off.  This is definitely not the case with this brand.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month now, multiple times a day, and it looks like it just came out of the packaging.  I don&#x27;t see this brush wearing down for years to come but I will replace it quicker than my old brush, 9+ years is way too long.  But I least I know from personal experience Conair makes quality brushes that last years  and years.</li>
    <li> I have had long, thick, and coarse hair my entire life.  Finding hairbrushes that are comfortable and functional can be difficult.  I bought this one just as a random try as a Prime &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item.  I&#x27;ve never spent so little on a hairbrush that I actually like!  It doesn&#x27;t cause static like I often find with hairbrushes.  The handle is comfortable!  I&#x27;m tempted to get a second one as a backup!</li>
    <li> Good quality paddle hair brush.</li>
    <li> A few of the bristles were missing, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Good product..Makes my hair soft...</li>
    <li> Came as an add on with a hair dryer I bought my wife, she loves them both!</li>
    <li> Nice brush for a very low price thanks to Amazon&#x27;s add on program.  It&#x27;s less than half the price of the same brush at the &amp;#34;Wall&amp;#34; mart.  Paddle brushes are so nice for really tangled or long hair.  I use this brush on my tender-headed grand daughters and for some reason, I guess because of the way the hair is distributed over a larger brush surface, it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull as much as a smaller brush.  Nice cushioning around the brushes and protective vinyl on ends of bristles so it doesn&#x27;t scratch scalp or pull hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush. I love how is massages my scalp :-D</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and this brush works perfectly for blow drying.</li>
    <li> Consumer Velvet Touch Paddle Hair Brushbis a great brush. It is a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush and it gets the knots out of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my dome, so I guess it passes the brush test.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this brush I started using it, and it&#x27;s the only one I use. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Great brush...... Work well no complains here! 4c hair type</li>
    <li> Prevents hair fall and unhealthy scalp! been using this not just to comb my hair but also to massage my scalp. prevents dandruff build up!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this brush but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t as dense as I was hoping for. But then again, it was under 5 dollars. I am not saying is a bad brush, but it didnt work for me. MAybe someone with longer hair may have a better experience.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes -- bought one for each girl in our family, and we all have different hair...my hair is fine, curly and delicate, my older daughter has waist-length straight hair, and my younger daughter has curly, tangle-prone hair.  We all love these brushes and have had good results with very little breakage.</li>
    <li> Great Brush &amp; Great Price...</li>
    <li> I usually like Conair&#x27;s paddle brushes but this one I&#x27;ve only been using for at most 2 months, and it&#x27;s already on the verge of falling apart. I have super-long straight hair (hip-length) and through just brushing my hair, which doesn&#x27;t get particularly tangly, the paddle is separating from the handle after less than 2 months of daily, normal use.  I have to keep pushing the paddle part back into the handle as there&#x27;s a good eighth inch sized gap between that&#x27;s getting bigger and grabs my hair as I brush.  Any day now, while brushing my hair, the paddle part is going to finally come off of the handle and be stuck in my hair, and then I&#x27;ll have to buy another one...again. It&#x27;s good while it&#x27;s whole, but considering I have not had it very long, it should not be falling apart already. I may try to Gorilla Glue it back together, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to. Will just look for a brush that&#x27;s all one molded together piece so I don&#x27;t keep having this problem.  5/10 Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was included in my granddaughter&#x27;s suprise care package and she was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> My brush broke after a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> The brush is excellent for the price.  The quality is solid and it has done the job perfectly.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot. I actually have two, one for home and one at college. I have medium thick wavy hair and it has no problem getting through the tangles. Does the job and the handle is smooth which is nice.</li>
    <li> Bristles were messed up, pulled back by the band.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite new brush! It smooths out your hair very well and it&#x27;s very big so it gets the job done fast. Also it&#x27;s perfect for blow drying because it makes the hair shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Works great for detangling extra long hair. I ordered two of them thanks to the great price. Have used them for a few weeks now with no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the worst brush I&#x27;ve had but certainly didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I was under the impression when purchasing this item that it would get my knots out of my hair without leaving my hair extremely frizzy. This WASN&#x27;T the case. I brushed my dry curls out and my hair was a complete Afro. The brush does brush pretty painlessly but by no means does it help with frizzy-ness. Needless to say i was disappointed but probably will be keeping because it does have a good grip on my hair.</li>
    <li> Hold up really well, not too hard, really like</li>
    <li> Good hairbrush for a great price.</li>
    <li> great, untangles my daughter&#x27;s hair fast!</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles -- makes detangling easy. Would be great for brushing a child&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for 5+ years, and all of the bristles are intact - just ordered a new one because my boyfriend likes to use mine so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never given much thought to hair brushes. They just always seemed to appear--in Christmas stockings, from travel kits, etc. A brush is a brush, right? Apparently not. I bought this as an add-on item and didn&#x27;t give it much thought...I now carry it around the house with me. Weird? Yep, a little. But it&#x27;s such a great, simple product! The size of the paddle might seem big if you have short hair, but you don&#x27;t need to be shopping for a brush, get a nice comb. For my long hair it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, has a nice smooth finish, and now I feel like something out of a Jane Austen novel, sitting in my nightgown in front of the mirror, methodically brushing my hair, my gaze far away dreaming of Mr.....you get the point. It&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly hair. I use directly after shampooing and conditioning I use it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> This broke after using this after 2 months</li>
    <li> Great brush for my manly hair. Everytime i use this brush on my head with the help of my blowdryer. I feel even that much more manlier. I go out into the world, ready to pounce on the ladies.</li>
    <li> I enjoy brushing this against my scalp</li>
    <li> All I was looking for was a replacement brush and I have found it. This went through my fine hairs knots with ease and it hasnt fallen apart on me. If it does, Ill send an updated review!</li>
    <li> O.K. brush. nothing to shout about. Average usage. Large face. O.K. price. good for a spare. I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I have long curly hair and this makes it manageable.</li>
    <li> like the brush! works very well ! easy !</li>
    <li> fell in the shower and the head fell off after having it for just a week or two</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my mom.  She needed a new hairbrush, and she said she was specifically worried about her getting a little thinner as she gets older.  After talking with my hair dresser for some advice, she recommended a few things, all of which this brush has:&lt;br /&gt;1)  The ends of the bristles each have a little ball on the end.  This prevents breakage.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brush is very cushioned, which takes a lot of the stress off of your hair.  My hair dresser said this is essential to prevent thinning.  If the brush isn&#x27;t cushioned, it will pull harder on your strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also asked about getting a Boar&#x27;s head brush.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few of them recently for myself, as I&#x27;ve read that they are excellent for your hair.  My hair dresser agreed that they&#x27;re good, but she said this type of paddle brush is better.  So, I went ahead and got it for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom absolutely loves it, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  At this price, I&#x27;m happy to have gotten such a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that -- because the brush is plastic -- it&#x27;s not a good brush to use while blow drying your hair.</li>
    <li> great brush for my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Nothing overall super special about the brush it&#x27;s like all of the others out there. It does its job and it&#x27;s amazingly priced.</li>
    <li> Love, love this paddle brush. It goes through my long asian hair so smoothly without tugging on my hair or ripping my hair out.  If I have tangles, I feel it untangles them effortlessly.  I hope this brush lasts me a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It feels good on my scalp and the handle is soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to use on my hair. No tangles stop it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the dollar store brushes or any other version again. These are priced very well, are durable, with durable plastic bristles and have lasted a while. If it gets too gunky I wash it out in baby shampoo. I go through brushes quickly because of my oily hair, so I don&#x27;t like to hang onto them very long , even with washes. This price can&#x27;t be beat and I bought two to stock up. I love that  can get these on Prime!</li>
    <li> works ok but not what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> It is a great paddle brush the give it has is wonderful for tangles, this brush is so great for detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair I love it!!</li>
    <li> This paddle brush is great! It easily detangles my hair without causing breakage.</li>
    <li> I have only used the brush on dry hair and it works great on tangled hair. I have fine hair and the brush doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for the price I got it at! For less than $3 on amazon, it functions as an at-least-$10 brush! This brush gets tangles out super easily and is very gentle on the scalp due to the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; at the end of each spike/bristle.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! I&#x27;m an African American woman with naturally kniky type 3c4a/b and this brush works very well for smoothing out my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull on my hair when I brush it!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for my thick red hair! Not so much thick, but there&#x27;s a lot of it! I brush straight out of the shower and it gets rid of all of the tangles! It&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s cheap. It does the job! Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairbrush for kids!!! It hurts a lot less then a normal brush! I would recommend this highly!!!</li>
    <li> Great everyday brush for long hair. Cuts brushing time down due to size. Not the best brush I have owned but no complaints for the price.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s better than thought. I love it more than tangle Teezer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!!!!!!!! So easy to use &amp; makes hair easy to brush</li>
    <li> Love this hairbrush so much I had to order more because my daughters were fighting over it. Honestly I ordered it originally to as an add on to get my cart up to $35 for free shipping, now it is the only brush I use. I have had the same hairbrush for over 15 years ( I know I should have replaced it) after I received this and tried it I don&#x27;t want to use any other brush and I have to hide it. Works great on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair as well as her sister&#x27;s thick hair. My youngest always fought getting her hair brushed but stands still when I use this brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush, Great price!</li>
    <li> its the best hair brush i had .i just love it.i think i am just going to brush my hair all day</li>
    <li> This brush have a very weird chemical smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> Great brush great price.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this brush!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to detangle my toddler&#x27;s hair and I also use it on my thick curly hair both to detangle while wet and to blow-dry. For the price you can&#x27;t loose.</li>
    <li> it helps me blow dry my hair very nicely&lt;br /&gt;wish it was a bit smaller but I cant complain</li>
    <li> Work well in function but as most of the hair brush it is very hard to clean</li>
    <li> these last me forever so i rarley need to buy them but this is like my 3rd or 4th one. eventually, the handle breaks. i gorilla glued the one that broke last when i ordered this one and its still together and strong. the new one is great and is the same as what i had before. comfortable to handle and use so i love it</li>
    <li> I do like this very much.</li>
    <li> This brush is Wife Approved (TM)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has gone through at least three brushes in the last two years - her most recent brush lasting no more than 4 months before bristles began falling out. That brush was bought at a local Marshalls department store for $15 - so I figured it was worth a shot getting this cheap brush for an interim replacement at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To our surprise - this brush has exceeded every expectation, considering it&#x27;s price. Holding up to daily abuse. We&#x27;re going to buy more if (or when?) this brush eventually poops out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality, excellent price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Large size. Great for tangles</li>
    <li> Really nice quality, and I love that I can comb my hair within 5 strokes.</li>
    <li> This brush has no troubles with my hair. It&#x27;s cheap, and it works. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brush (first one broke in half after about 1.5 years use, my hair cannot be stopped, it can only be slowed). Bristles do not fall off like with other brushes I have owned, meaning the brush stays good until it breaks. Hard to clean, but hey, every brush I have ever owned has been hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it occasionally feels nice to brush my beard with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair length: 7 inches below shoulder&lt;br /&gt;Hair thickness: Thick&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Straight</li>
    <li> I am all about paddle brushes per the type of hair I have. I am happy to say that this has not broken on me as others have and that really makes me happy. I bought multiple as gifts because my family has long and thick hair. They work great and we will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> Great at detangling my hair</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;A A REALLY GOOD BRUSH I WANT MORE OF THEM.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. especially if you have a sew-in .</li>
    <li> brush combs through hair easily and leaves hair smooth.</li>
    <li> too hard on the skull</li>
    <li> EDIT: Haven&#x27;t even had the brush a year before the handle broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good cheap brush.  No frills, works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush that can take on my crazy hair.</li>
    <li> Just an average hair brush. Nothing special. No problems.</li>
    <li> Great for long hair. Other brushes would take out a few hairs everyday. This one takes out way less, and doesn&#x27;t pull. Its heavenly, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> ...and need help with blow drying to achieve a sleek straight style, this paddle brush is great. Cuts down the drying time as well. Handle is comfortable to use. I bought two of these. My hair was bouncy with lots of movement after blow drying.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it ZERO stars! Worst Brush EVER! Pulls hair out and causes hair breakages like crazy!! I have had several of these brushes BREAK IN HALF after just a few days of use. PIECE OF CRAP. DO NOT BUY as they are worthless and made in China. Save your money and buy a better quality product from a more reputable brand.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine Caucasian hair and it still rips through my hair. Awful and painful;. May look pretty but broke in half!&lt;br /&gt;Conair has the worst brushes I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This really is a quality brush for an online buy. Its really nice for long hair. The handle doesn&#x27;t break when you drop it as many times as I do, so it almost break proof for wood surfaces at least (for me).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to paddle bushes and this didn&#x27;t disappoint. Works great on all thicknesses and really helps with little girl tangles</li>
    <li> absolutely loved them so much, I purchased more for Christmas stocking stuffers...great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> This is the second time we&#x27;ve purchased this hair brush.  We&#x27;ve had the first one for over 4 years now and it still works just fine.  Great brush for long hair.</li>
    <li> it came with missing &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The brush hurts my scalp as I brush my hair.  Do not like this brush at all for that reason.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, untangles hair gently, love it!</li>
    <li> The brush itself is very nice and really makes your hair softer.  My only complaint is that the handle is weak.  It fell out of my hand once (four hours after I received it) and hit my sink and the handle broke right off.  Having just purchased it I was pretty upset.  I was able to duct tape it but it&#x27;s not quite the same.</li>
    <li> I was torn between purchasing this brush and a more expensive detangling brush.  I&#x27;m very glad I chose this brush - it&#x27;s perfect!  It&#x27;s excellent at detangling my hair without being specifically being a detangling brush.  I have very long hair and this has never failed to run through it cleanly with no knots whether it&#x27;s after the gym or just a shower - and my hair is notoriously full of knots!  I am blown away at the quality of brush that I received for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once issue is that this is definitely not a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; brush.  If I use it after the flat iron it makes my hair a little frizzy.  This may just be an issue with my fine hair, but it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
