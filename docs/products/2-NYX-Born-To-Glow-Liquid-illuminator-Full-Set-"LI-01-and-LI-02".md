      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and so adorable</li>
      <li>Works better when you mix with foundation 😊</li>
      <li>lighter one is what I&#x27;m using to mix with the tinted moisturizer to lighten it up even more and give me that bit of glow that my skin needs.</li>
      <li>I love Nyx products and that includes this one.  </li>
      <li>I love the darker shade more</li>
      <li>It gave an okay sheen</li>
      <li>Not too shiny, no sparkles, blends perfectly, and I can&#x27;t wait to try the other as well...</li>
      <li>It adds a soft shimmer to the face and really looks great!  </li>
      <li>The lighter color works wonderfully for me (I am very fair skinned) and gives me a pretty glow without looking shiny or fake.</li>
      <li>I personally think the more sparkle the better!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and stays fresh and dewy looking.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did, because one I used the first, ID def be running to the store to buy the more natural color.  </li>

      <li>Just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>This is my first time messing around with products like this</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Got here so fast!  </li>
      <li>The darker contour color is a little light but still beautiful none the less.</li>
      <li>One came damaged but the seller was very quick to respond to my email and a replacement was shipped the same day.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not all that certain how they&#x27;re supposed to work.</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of it and the hint of color and shimmer</li>
      <li>Very sparkly .</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>It gives off a very &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>if u need quick and simple make up</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had fun playing with the different effects I get depending on placement.</li>
      <li>This is a very creamy formula - it will squirt out on you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

<li> but I will say that a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way, which seems to be a theme with NYX products.</li>
<li> As I have said in other reviews, I wish it had been me.  </li>
<li> The darker color is too dark for me (hence the 4 stars).</li>
<li> It seems a bit too dark to mix with foundation</li>
<li> sparingly, first, then my bare mineral base, blush, n finishing powder.  </li>
<li> and sometimes I mix a little in with my foundation to brighten it up.</li>
<li> I also use it a little on my cheekbones under the eye for a glow.</li>
<li> but it wore off within a few hours.</li>
<li> Not sure why there&#x27;s so many bad reviews!</li>
<li> /&gt;The sparkle is very subtle.</li>
<li> You&#x27;re not going to look like some crazy disco ball or anything.</li>

    <li> My sister really loved them!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! The lighter color works wonderfully for me (I am very fair skinned) and gives me a pretty glow without looking shiny or fake. The darker color is too dark for me (hence the 4 stars). If I ever get a bona Fidel tan, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be perfect! 😉</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay if u need quick and simple make up</li>
    <li> amazing!!!! I add some of the bronze one to my foundation and use the cream highlighter with my underwhelming concealer. a keeper!!!! and so adorable</li>
    <li> not really for darker skin girls</li>
    <li> This is my first time messing around with products like this so I&#x27;m not all that certain how they&#x27;re supposed to work. I just know how I&#x27;m planning to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighter one is what I&#x27;m using to mix with the tinted moisturizer to lighten it up even more and give me that bit of glow that my skin needs. This is a very creamy formula - it will squirt out on you if you&#x27;re not careful. I just the non-opening end of the tube against my palm before I open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darker one I&#x27;ll use as a creamy bronzer or contour. It seems a bit too dark to mix with foundation but I may try just to see what it looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sparkle is very subtle. You&#x27;re not going to look like some crazy disco ball or anything. A little bit goes a long way, which seems to be a theme with NYX products.</li>
    <li> Perfection. Just the right amount of color.</li>
    <li> I use this to mix in with my face make up to give it a glow, I can&#x27;t find a luminous make up, Revlon used to have some but discontinued it. I also use it a little on my cheekbones under the eye for a glow. I like it, it is my second order.</li>
    <li> I love Nyx products and that includes this one.  I have wanted Nxy cosmetics ever since they awarded the Queen a lifetime supply when he/she won RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race.  As I have said in other reviews, I wish it had been me.  Anyway, this stuff is awesome.  It adds a soft shimmer to the face and really looks great!  I would definitely recommend these products to any he or she or he/she!</li>
    <li> Love this, gives you a soft dewy glow.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure why there&#x27;s so many bad reviews! I love this stuff! Great price! Works better when you mix with foundation 😊</li>
    <li> I love the darker shade more but I use them both. I don&#x27;t find them to be too sparkly but I will say that a little goes a long way. One came damaged but the seller was very quick to respond to my email and a replacement was shipped the same day. I will buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Sometimes I use it alone and sometimes I mix a little in with my foundation to brighten it up.</li>
    <li> Goes on skin just like the color of the package literally you have to blend it a lot to get the glow. Very sparkly .</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on smooth and stays fresh and dewy looking. I am using both tints to highlight and contour. Great product. I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got here so fast!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It gave an okay sheen but it wore off within a few hours. I wouldn&#x27;t rave about it nor buy it again.</li>
    <li> These are the handiest face illuminators to use.  NYX has great products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this brand before, but after this purchase I&#x27;ve been looking for what else I can get from them. I really like the feel of it and the hint of color and shimmer it gives. I&#x27;ve had fun playing with the different effects I get depending on placement. Nice product!</li>
    <li> I just got these and I&#x27;m in love!  Even my husband said my face looked great.  I&#x27;ve used the pink one...sparingly, first, then my bare mineral base, blush, n finishing powder.  My face glowed , it looked like, from the inside and that I just had the perfect, youthful glow.  Not too shiny, no sparkles, blends perfectly, and I can&#x27;t wait to try the other as well...I bought both and I&#x27;m so glad I did, because one I used the first, ID def be running to the store to buy the more natural color.  Buy both...you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> These are great products for the price. The darker contour color is a little light but still beautiful none the less. It gives off a very &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look, so if that is not your thing then this isn&#x27;t your product. I personally think the more sparkle the better! and you only need a little drop...will last forever.</li>
