      <li>I was using my own Aveda conditioner on her sometimes and it made a huge difference</li>
      <li>I love this product for child&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>After trying out several \\&quot;natural\\&quot; leave-in conditioners--all of which proved the do a good job to some degree or the other--I must say that this was my favorite of all!</li>
      <li>As a health and beauty product lover, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for new, healthier, better or more effective products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Easy to pump</li>
      <li>And so easy to comb through after the bath.</li>
      <li>you want a good conditioner to use on your kids, Little Twig is a good choice :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the right leave-in conditioner for my hair since I have really fine hair and most products just make my hair sticky and more tangled.</li>
      <li>The instructions say that you can either rinse out or leave in, but for our family&#x27;s fine hair it needs to be rinsed otherwise</li>
      <li>I have made it a habit to just run some conditioner through the bottom half of my kid&#x27;s hair after every bath and that works out perfectly.</li>
      <li>I use it as a co-wash, light rinse out and leave in.</li>
      <li>A tiny dollop of this detangler works great.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and clean and I love that I can leave it in if needed.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It works just as well as my conditioner and better than most adult all-natural conditioners</li>
      <li>So far, the Little Twig has been our favorite with the best results.</li>
      <li>it does seem to detangle ok but hair starts to look greasy if you use too much of it.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, and it is all natural.</li>
      <li>Both myself and my 10 yr old have fine curly hair and love it.</li>
      <li>As a parent shopping for products for my 3 year old, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for products with high quality ingredients, low toxicity levels and excellent safety ratings.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy but is a mild conditioner and great detangler.</li>
      <li>Our 19-month-old&#x27;s hair was snarly and tangled every night, but this product makes his hair, soft, smooth and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>This stuff didn&#x27;t, and his hair felt dry and frizzy instead of soft, lovely curls like it should with a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Because you use so little, it is actually a great value.</li>
      <li>but I am not crazy about the scent.  </li>
      <li>My wife delivered our first child a year ago with a full head of curly hair.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>looks okay if you don&#x27;t completely rinse it</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite conditioner for my preschooler and for myself, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I tend towards dryness, though I have found that most natural products end up leaving my hair</li>
      <li>I use Little Twig on both my children and it&#x27;s great, my 2 yr old son has beautiful soft curls and it tames my 4 month old daughters locks.</li>
      <li>out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying my best to avoid parabens, pthalates, and other potentially harmful chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for working through curly hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worked the best for us out of the other seven we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also put a squirt in my hand, add water, and then use it on her do hair to reshape her curls and tame fly aways.  </li>
      <li>Also, keep in mind this is for children&#x27;s hair and children have healthy hair in general, so</li>
      <li>My hair almost feels dried out, and I have to use more and more of this each time.</li>
      <li>My four year old had fine curly hair.  </li>
      <li>afro - he does have really thick hair, but the Organic Excellence conditioner worked great with about 1/4 cup.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty damaged (she&#x27;s 5).</li>
      <li>Her hair is so smooth and soft after using this.</li>
      <li>Since this conditioner can be applied and rinsed out or left in, I tried both methods and was pleased with both results.</li>
      <li>An amount the size of a pencil eraser is more than enough for my daughther&#x27;s shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter is 22 months and her hair is long enough to get tangled now, and since it is fine hair it is also kind of \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and staticky without any conditioner.</li>
      <li>My 3.5 year old has beautiful long strawberry blonde hair, but brushing or combing it used to be a harrowing experience -- she would scream, fight and squirm as soon as we got within 10 feet of her with a comb or brush!</li>
      <li>I purchased this after Little Twig was kind enough to send me a free sample...</li>
      <li>This stuff makes his golden brown hair soft and twirly after a bath.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it really smells like tangerines</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it should really be advertised for all hair types.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found to smooth my child&#x27;s tangled hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the little twig shampoo, but the conditioning detangler is very heavy in my daughter&#x27;s hair and her hair is not fine.  It is thick and curly.  It smells great, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I purchased this solely based on the ingredients and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s a nice light conditioner and a good detangler with a nice citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.  I use it as a co-wash, light rinse out and leave in.</li>
    <li> It really does detangle and condition. I worried it would be greasy when used as a leave-in, but I can&#x27;t see a difference on days we rinse it out as compared to days we don&#x27;t. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but you need a VERY little bit. An amount the size of a pencil eraser is more than enough for my daughther&#x27;s shoulder length hair. With Prime benefits, it was cheaper on Amazon that purchased direct (where shipping was $$$).</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite conditioner for my preschooler and for myself, too. It totally fixed all of her rough hair days. Her hair is so smooth and soft after using this. And so easy to comb through after the bath.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 22 months and her hair is long enough to get tangled now, and since it is fine hair it is also kind of \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and staticky without any conditioner. I was using my own Aveda conditioner on her sometimes and it made a huge difference but I was worried the ingredients might not be gentle enough-- when I saw this product I was very happy to try it. It works just as well as my conditioner and better than most adult all-natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. Her hair is silky and I barely had to comb it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after Little Twig was kind enough to send me a free sample... so I already knew that it works great on my daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;ringlets\\&quot; - she&#x27;s got thick, soft curls. Once my sample ran out, I had a coupon for the California Baby detangler - what a waste of money! It did nothing. I just put a portion of the Little Twig on my fingers and work it through her hair and then easily re-establish her part with the comb. It works so well that I&#x27;ve repurchased 2 more bottles and plan to start using it on my hair too :)</li>
    <li> I use Little Twig on both my children and it&#x27;s great, my 2 yr old son has beautiful soft curls and it tames my 4 month old daughters locks. It smells fresh and clean and I love that I can leave it in if needed. The only down fall is the price.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it as a leave in conditioner for my daughters hair. It isn&#x27;t greasy. I use a dime sized amount on her ends and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Broken and spilled upon arrival.</li>
    <li> nice and light weight.</li>
    <li> not good for thick hair</li>
    <li> Smells good and detangles my daughter&#x27;s hair easily!</li>
    <li> Love the leave it in option which is great when you are dealing with a toddler</li>
    <li> My daughter has very fine but thick curly hair that&#x27;s very dry. I&#x27;ve never cut it so it&#x27;s pretty damaged (she&#x27;s 5). This is the only conditioner that allows me to brush through it. I&#x27;ve tried a ton. Loreal, sauve, Jason&#x27;s, fairy tales, burts, and more. Hate the price but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> As a health and beauty product lover, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for new, healthier, better or more effective products. As a parent shopping for products for my 3 year old, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for products with high quality ingredients, low toxicity levels and excellent safety ratings. After trying out several \\&quot;natural\\&quot; leave-in conditioners--all of which proved the do a good job to some degree or the other--I must say that this was my favorite of all! I will not get into details or comments regarding its ingredients, but I will note that it was rated as relatively low in toxicity (2) on the EWG site. The reason I liked this conditioner over all of the other ones we tried is because it worked really well on my 3 year old&#x27;s long and fine blonde hair. My little one&#x27;s hair is very fine and has a tendency to tangle and knot up when it is dry and when it is wet. Since this conditioner can be applied and rinsed out or left in, I tried both methods and was pleased with both results. This conditioner does an excellent job of detangling hair and leaves it very soft, shiny and \\&quot;loose\\&quot; or silky. Every strand falls loosely on the head and these results last at least over night--at least. I noticed that after we started using this conditioner regularly after my kid&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t get tangled over night and it was easier to brush or comb through in general. I have made it a habit to just run some conditioner through the bottom half of my kid&#x27;s hair after every bath and that works out perfectly. Finally, It is not greasy or heavy and it will not weigh hair down, but you have to be careful because you only need a tiny amount. With this product, a little goes a long way so you just have to do some trial and error until you find the amount that works for you. Also, keep in mind this is for children&#x27;s hair and children have healthy hair in general, so when you see a review by an adult complaining that this product did nothing for their damaged hair just remember it was not designed to do anything for damaged adult hair.o anything for damaged adult hair.</li>
    <li> The instructions say that you can either rinse out or leave in, but for our family&#x27;s fine hair it needs to be rinsed otherwise it is heavy and greasy. The conditioner smells great and my 3-year old likes it.</li>
    <li> it does seem to detangle ok but hair starts to look greasy if you use too much of it. i like that it is natural ingredients to replace my last brand of chemicals though so we&#x27;ll se how it goes on conditioning.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a great scent to it, and I specifically picked it out to avoid conditioner with bad chemicals in them. This one works well—it cleans my kid&#x27;s hair well, washes out thoroughly, doesn&#x27;t sting the kid&#x27;s eyes, and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem, though: the bottle is smaller than you think. When you look at the picture, it looks like a decent size. In actuality, the bottle is about the height of a computer mouse if you were to stand it up on end. Somewhere around 4 inches. Looking at the photo, you&#x27;d think it was a couple inches taller. I was surprised when I ordered it, as was my wife.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  No gnarly hair after the bath anymore.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son has lots of curls and ringlets in the back and he was getting lots of tangles.  I got this detangler and I only put a tiny amount in and our problem has been solved.  Even if he won&#x27;t let me brush his hair, the tangles have been almost resolved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the right leave-in conditioner for my hair since I have really fine hair and most products just make my hair sticky and more tangled. This is the best leave-in conditioner I have EVER used! Plus it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> My wife delivered our first child a year ago with a full head of curly hair. Due to the tangled bird&#x27;s nest since day one, we have been on the hunt for a good conditioner to help cut down on the mess. So far, the Little Twig has been our favorite with the best results. We have order three bottles so far.</li>
    <li> A tiny, pea-size drop is all you need. My daughter is two, but has lots of long, fine hair. A tiny dollop of this detangler works great. We rinse it out and it leaves her hair tangle-free, but not greasy. Because you use so little, it is actually a great value. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> the scent could be nicer!</li>
    <li> My 3-year-old girl has has super curly hair, so we have been trying out a lot of different hair products to try and find something that:&lt;br /&gt;1. makes it easier to comb out tangles in the bath, and&lt;br /&gt;2. looks okay if you don&#x27;t completely rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying my best to avoid parabens, pthalates, and other potentially harmful chemicals.  Little Twig is definitely our favorite pick so far.  We tried several other natural/organic conditioners (and even a couple that were quite a bit more expensive), and Little Twig is the one that we keep coming back to.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for working through curly hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worked the best for us out of the other seven we&#x27;ve tried.  So here&#x27;s the break-down:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Effective detangler&lt;br /&gt;- No parabens, pthalates, petro chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to pump&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave hair too greasy&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Have to use a lot (at least on my daughter&#x27;s extra curly hair)&lt;br /&gt;- Not all organic (but hard to find hair products that are)&lt;br /&gt;- Wish it came in larger size&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good conditioner to use on your kids, Little Twig is a good choice :)</li>
    <li> Works great but I am not crazy about the scent.  A little too strong for me but if you have tangly hair a little goes a long way and it does a really nice job helping to get the snarls out.</li>
    <li> My grandson has curly hair, I use this after shampooing him, and leave it in. I comb his hair out in the tub and there are no fits or tears. His hair dies soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> My 3.5 year old has beautiful long strawberry blonde hair, but brushing or combing it used to be a harrowing experience -- she would scream, fight and squirm as soon as we got within 10 feet of her with a comb or brush! This miracle detangler changed all that -- now I can comb her hair easily and without drama while she plays happily in the bath.</li>
    <li> This does not leave a heavy residue in my daughters hair when I leave it in and it works when I rinse it out.  I don&#x27;t think it really smells like tangerines but it is a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Arrived with no pump so company credited purchase with no return. Wanted a natural leave in conditioner since my scalp breaks out. This is great. Smells good, detangles and conditions, holds style and no allergic reaction. Both myself and my 10 yr old have fine curly hair and love it. Use Kinky Curly too but this Little Tikes offers a bit more shine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it. You only need a tiny, itty bitty amount and it makes a huge difference! Our 19-month-old&#x27;s hair was snarly and tangled every night, but this product makes his hair, soft, smooth and easy to comb through. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I will forever use this product on my kids&#x27; hair. And i do mean forever. Love the smell, the texture and the way that it detangles on contact. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> a tiny bit goes a long way. works just as advertised and will last forever since a tiny bit will work for my daughter&#x27;s whole head.</li>
    <li> I love this product for child&#x27;s hair. Not too heavy but is a mild conditioner and great detangler. Have been using for several years. I like that it has natural ingredients and skips the harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product four or five times on my toddler&#x27;s hair. She hates rinsing her hair, so I&#x27;ve tended to just leave it in. It does a great job of getting the tangles out.</li>
    <li> Love this! I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner in the shower for the kids if I use a pump of this after. I also pump some into a little sprayer, add water, and use that for &amp;#34;spray conditioner&amp;#34;. I also use this after I shower and really like it. I don&#x27;t have much else to say, it&#x27;s by far the best leave-in conditioner/detangler we have found and I love that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals we avoid. We&#x27;ve had this for several months with 3 of us using it and still have 3/4 of the bottle left. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Conditioners don&#x27;t cut it. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found to smooth my child&#x27;s tangled hair. Run a little of this through washed hair and brush or comb... works like a dream. And being all-organic and all-natural helps. Well worth the price.  :)</li>
    <li> Works great with the shampoo!  No more tangles and no more fly-aways.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> I love this!  My four year old had fine curly hair.  I put a generous amount on, let it sit for a few minutes, then brush out the tangles, then rinse.  I&#x27;ve also put a squirt in my hand, add water, and then use it on her do hair to reshape her curls and tame fly aways.  I also use it sometimes on my hair. It&#x27;s a good detanglet.</li>
    <li> Great product. The whole family uses this product, including mom. We always rinse after conditioning, so our hair isn&#x27;t greasy. Also easy to brush afterwards, at least for our hair types. Saves lots of tears. No artificial ingredients, which is what we need due to allergies.</li>
    <li> This conditioner/detangler has a nice fragrance and is quite easy to wash out. Although it leaves the hair with a natural shine (not greasy-looking!), it does a so-so job on actually detangling it (even on my daughter&#x27;s thin, wavy, hair).</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.  Wish they had a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This stuff seemed awesome at first. The first time I used it, my hair looked beautiful when I took it out of my waves. I am Latin &amp; have hip length black hair that is half straight, half slight waves (I blame motherhood). I tend towards dryness, though I have found that most natural products end up leaving my hair almost damp feeling - they condition, but perhaps are too hydrophilic? Anyway, this product seemed just right, until the second or third time I used it. My hair almost feels dried out, and I have to use more and more of this each time. My son, who is multiracial &amp; has tight curls in the front, magic marker sized curls in the back, said he would have to use the entire bottle for his medium length afro - he does have really thick hair, but the Organic Excellence conditioner worked great with about 1/4 cup. This stuff didn&#x27;t, and his hair felt dry and frizzy instead of soft, lovely curls like it should with a good conditioner. I think this product would work well for more European hair and/or young babies. The smell is nice, and it is all natural. I don&#x27;t think it should really be advertised for all hair types.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son has dry hair, he takes after me. I don&#x27;t even use shampoo on his hair anymore, very rarely when he gets himself very dirty, it just dries it out way too much, even organic. This stuff makes his golden brown hair soft and twirly after a bath. Love it! I even use it on my own hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter who has ringlet curls. This conditioner is amazing! I put it in her damp hair, brushed her hair with a wide tooth comb, and let her hair air dry. This conditioner kept her hair soft, shiny, and knot-free for days following her bath. Definitely the best hair product I&#x27;ve found for her hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! I use it after shampooing my daughters hair and then rinse this out as well. Her hair is tangle free and shiny! The product smells good, too.</li>
    <li> I use this on my girls and my own hair. Love the product. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because it came damaged. Still usable but the pump was missing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite do the job on long hair. Smells good though</li>
    <li> Kind of pricey for a small amount.</li>
