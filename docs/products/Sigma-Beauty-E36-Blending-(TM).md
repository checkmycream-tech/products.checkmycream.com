    <li> I like this brush, its just not as large or as dense as I thought; but still of excellent quality.  I wish I had bought Sigma brushes instead of MAC.....</li>
    <li> First the shipping was greatbut when i hit the brush the head was loose and one time it had fallen off :( haven&#x27;t been able to actually use it</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying a deeper shade just in the crease and outer corner of the eye and blending it in seamlessly. Also works well for the lower lash line! Wonderfully soft and comfortable to hold, surely Sigma quality. I wish it came in a synthetic version.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush to use for the inner tear duct or to help blend out eye shadow on the lower lashine.</li>
    <li> Sigma has the best brushes around! This one is a thin blending brush, perfect for smaller eyes! A great buy!</li>

    <li> great brush, gets right into the transiton area, great quality. no dislikes used on the eyes love all sigma brushes. a keeper</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this brush! I have semi-hooded eyes with not a lot of space from my crease to my brow, so this brush is excellent to blend out my crease without taking the color up too far to my brow bone.</li>
    <li> very scratchy! After all of the hype on how this brand is better than mac, and while i agree that the price point is better, the quality was just ok. it def was scratchy and I did not expect it to be so scratchy. I like the size and the precision and only use it when i really need to but overall it is a really scratchy brush.</li>
    <li> THe best blending brush I own! This is the real deal not fake &amp; Great quality. A Must have.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  I have other Sigma brushes that I love - this one is underwhelming.</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as I thought, but a great quality good blending brush.</li>
    <li> I have hooded eyes and this has been my go to brush for getting perfectly in between the crease. I would recommended this brush to every single person who has hooded eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush, perfect blending.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Very precise, good quality you expect from Sigma. Use it every day!</li>
    <li> This little miracle gets in the crease so well. So I use my sigma E35 for the transitional color. Then I want another color in the crease but I want the other color I put on first to still show so I use this E36 to put the other shadow on top and also blends it well. Just love this brush so much. I use it everyday and because I don&#x27;t want to keep washing it I am going to buy 2 more. Doesn&#x27;t shed worker. Soft and good quality. Just make sure you buy from a seller that it&#x27;s in the sigma website. Sigma.com has a. List of certify sellers by them that sell legitimate brushes. If the seller you are buying from is not in sigma.com&#x27;s list don&#x27;t buy from them. It can be fake. I buy from amazon because I feel the brushes get to me faster and it&#x27;s cheaper. Sigma.com take too long to deliver. Hope this review helps. Good luck and don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush. It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
    <li> This brush probably doesn&#x27;t recieve the enough credit. Extremely helpful, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I could have lived without this one.  I am a brush hoarder and collector so I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to have it, but really, it isn&#x27;t essential in any way.  Good quality and fast shipping so A+ there.</li>
    <li> I would repurchase this if the one I just received got old, or wore out. It is soft and blends eye shadows with flexible brushes. I would also recommend this to friends and family. I really enjoy this brand of a brush, it is quality.</li>
    <li> Great for transition color application and blending.  No shedding and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> So surprised.  When this 1st arrived the brush head was smaller than I expected (I really wish companies would include scale references in product images - like picture it next to a dime, a paperclip, etc).  I was a bit disappointed at 1st, but once I used it... WOW!  This brush does a great job of blending eye shadows to seamless perfection.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> great brush good for small eyes</li>
    <li> Very good to do a cut crease</li>
    <li> Great for getting in the crease, very controlled application.</li>
