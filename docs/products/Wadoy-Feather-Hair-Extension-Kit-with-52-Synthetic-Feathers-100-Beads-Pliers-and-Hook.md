      <li>Some of the feathers are somewhat cheap looking, but then others are great.</li>

      <li>For a $10 kit and free shipping I am extremely satisfied!</li>
      <li>Because I would not have called them feathers, maybe more like colored hair strands that have stripes or something.</li>
      <li>I was expecting them to be more like feathers</li>
      <li>but hey it&#x27;s ok</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were exactly as described and are awesome-especially when considering the price.</li>
    <li> These are not FEATHERS!!!!!!! They Are synthetic plastic &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; stands. I didn&#x27;t get 52 either, I got 49. It looks like a clump of hair with the end of a shoe lace holding it together.</li>
    <li> Not feathers just hair with lines drawn across tools and beads are good but miss represented as feathers</li>
    <li> These were a huge hit with my girls. Even had the neighborhood kids knocking on the door asking if I could put one in their hair. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The kit was just what I was hoping for and the girls love it.  The feathers look great for synthetic and come in great colors.  All the kids are loving them and we are having lots of fun.  I would recommend this kit to everyone.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Nice!  This shipped directly from China . . . which kind of surprised me.  I knew the shipping date was out a bit (took a couple of weeks)--so when a small package arrived from China, I had completely forgotten about this order and didn&#x27;t realize it was from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon  (It arrived on the shorter end of the projected time frame).  Bottom line: the set is beautiful.  Feathers aren&#x27;t really feathers, but rather a group of strands (like hair), with rich colors and the horizontal banding you see in the product photo.  They are LONG--16-17&amp;#34; but you could trim if needed.  There are about 50-54 of them--just did a rough count.  The crimping beads range from light to dark (so should blend with most hair colors).  The pliers are pretty high quality and should hold up/work well.  The little hook seems a bit &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;--but for the price, I&#x27;m thrilled.  I plan on giving for a birthday gift to a 11 year old girl--I KNOW she&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(p.s. packaging isn&#x27;t fancy--just clear cello bags.  No directions included--but you can find easy &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on YouTube).</li>
    <li> No beads came with this!! and only about 20 feathers ...really disappointed</li>
    <li> Was awesome came with a ton of feathers. I ordered n January 17, 204 and still have15 as of January 2, 2015</li>
    <li> bright colors and great to have around the house for when you have kids over and you want to keep them entertained.....</li>
    <li> These feathers are perfect! everything you need included! You cannot get a better deal! These are the exact same feathers they put on at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for my daughters birthday party and they were a hit!  They look so beautiful on.</li>
    <li> This item came as described. I used it for a bachelorette party and before we went out put a couple in everyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;They all liked it!! I even saw some of them showing up to wedding with them in ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute, easy and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE- to remove just slide it down hair strand. ;)</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Wish there was a rainbow one though</li>
    <li> Sorry to be a snob, but these are not feathers. They are crappy synthetic hair extensions. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice hair feather looks elsewhere.</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for. everything is really high quality and it arrived way before the original shipping estimate (almost a month prior)! the \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; aren&#x27;t real feathers, they&#x27;re synthetic hair, which is great for vegetarians:)</li>
    <li> My daughter saved her money to buy this and free shipping was a plus but the waiting on the package was a little much for a kid.  She loves the stuff she bought.</li>
    <li> The feathers split and knot up. Terrible!</li>
    <li> This was delivered very quickly and exactly as described.  Nice product...</li>
    <li> This feathers have been really great for some temporary color without any use of dye!  I wish the kit came with a few more beads. Also, it is hard to get used to the beads being in your hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter made hair feather barettes for a school Holiday Faire using these. They arrived quickly and were exactly as pictured. Note that these are NOT real feathers but synthetic hair, but that makes them easier to handle. The crimper tool and attachment tool were both good quality. Overall, a good value for the cost.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful, and they look like feathers! It is synthetic hair, and not feathers though! They are designed to look like feathers, and they feel natural in your hair. Also they will not burn if you try to curl them! Lastly they look exactly like the picture, but the purple and dark blue are harder to tell apart. My only complaint is my beads were open, and they spilled in the rest of the package. These also arrived a day earlier than the estimated day.</li>
    <li> These are not feathers I will be sending them back!!</li>
    <li> My daughters loved this in their hair it looked really good and was super simple to put in and not that hard to take out. I would have gave it five stars but brushing was a pain for my girls.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:47459de1d5fb25c5cda3346b0edfea82]] There were a lot of details regarding this kit and it was easier to explain on a video with a visual, so I uploaded a video.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a fun kit to play around with, once you get the hang of it.  I didn&#x27;t get all the colors in the product picture and the kit didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  Because attaching the extensions didn&#x27;t work the way I normally see the way done in salons, I included in the video, a way to work around it.  The quality of the hair in this feather extension kit is more on the \\&quot;costume\\&quot; side, but I will update later about how well it stands the test of time.  Still, it is fun, would use this for costume or Halloween and easy enough for beginners.</li>
    <li> Missing turquoise, lavender, and the light blonde feathers.  Everything else arrived as shown.</li>
    <li> These are not feathers</li>
    <li> I really like this because it comes with everything you need, the tools aren&#x27;t big so you can put them in you backpack when you go to parties and stuff Even though it is synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t split like regular feathers does. AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I do little girls hair and these are fun, easy to use, and not expensive so if they loose them it&#x27;s ok. But they can be reused which is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I like it, it looks cool in your hair it is really quick to do and my friend likes it!</li>
    <li> Kids had a lot of fun</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors. Gives a pop of color to my hair without being permanent.</li>
    <li> Great set! Comes win everything you need. The feathers it comes with are very cheap &amp; not even faux. It&#x27;s pretty much cheap wig hair.</li>
    <li> Great kit! My daughters and nieces loved it!!!</li>
    <li> The synthetic feathers are decent. But first of all, the rubber part in the beads is falling out many times. Also the pliers for clamping are corroded or rusty...over all, I&#x27;m not all that pleased with this product. I really wish this company would refund me.</li>
    <li> Cute kit but didn&#x27;t include all the beads I paid for!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. So many pieces and a full kit to install, they wash great and style/blowdry like real hair. So pleased</li>
    <li> Make sure that you read the details, these are not feathers they are hair, they do look nice and I am satisfied with them but when I bought them they did not say hair they said genuine feathers or something like that.</li>
    <li> They are pretty and came in a timely manner but they are NOT feathers they are just small colored hair extensions not at all what I wanted........</li>
    <li> NOTE: THESE ARE NOT FEATHERS!!&lt;br /&gt;Despite what this company says in their description, these ARE NOT feathers. I was very disappointed when what I got, was not what I thought I paid for. Once I got past the disappointment, and some anger, I tried them out, and they are great. they stay in for a while, and they look good. They are just NOT feathers. product is good, just not as described by the company. comes with a ton of beads though, and the pliers and the hair hook. All good quality.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and bright feathers with many color options! Package came with all components listed in package; feathers, beads, hook, and pliers and was delivered very quickly which was great! Great long extensions for hair :)</li>
    <li> Love them!! I have gotten so many compliments and they have stayed in and lasted a long time!! Lots of different colors and beads!</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as bright as I would have hoped for but they&#x27;ll work just fine for my kids. Not a bad deal for the price. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Not what it appears to be. It is not feathers at all. It&#x27;s fake hair that feels NASTY. It has the quality of a Halloween costume wig.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these! They&#x27;re very easy to put into her hair, and they&#x27;re so much cheaper than buying them at the mall or a salon. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Bright, colorful feathers.  Easy to use.  Directions weren&#x27;t bad but I found a video on YouTube to clarify.  My 8 year old loves this.</li>
    <li> fun and easy, lots of colors to choose from and arrived much faster than expected!</li>
    <li> Wonderful people to work with got ourbproducts quick</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t realize they were hair and not actual feathers, so they won&#x27;t work for my intended purpose. Overall the product is great, came on time and neatly packaged. The hair is soft to the touch and the clips are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Had ONE feather put in my hair, at a carnival, for $10... Very pretty, SMALL feather. Granted, it stayed but not worth the $.&lt;br /&gt;HAD to have more but chapter. After searching and reading maybe a dozen different deals finally picked this. Happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, long , vibrant Feathers. Great shades of , reds, blues, greens. Some purple and brown. Hoped for more purple or whites. Beads are perfect size. Nice handy loop tool and clamps.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY DRAW BACK: NO Instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Looks simple enough, still would help to know basic steps. Found a good tutorial online. Cool. Ill be going to salon for help.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 41/2 of 5 stars for me. Price for just feathers was good enough for me. All else bonus!</li>
    <li> Great starter kit, only problem was the tool you thread the bead with it broke right away. But I fixed it with superglue. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Good quality. You get a lot for the cost. This is something I just took a chance on and they are so cool. I only used one so far. My daughter is picking colors &amp; changing them everyday. They are well made and will last a while.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my 10 year old.  She LOVED it.  The kit doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of organization other than the different colors rubber banded.  The materials aren&#x27;t the best, the tools easily come apart, but for the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> didnt receive beads or hook. paid for all of it and only received feathers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughters birthday. I called my sister to come and put them on all the girls but by the fourth one the girls were doing them by herself. So easy and simple! I was kind of disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t feathers it was like colored hair and when the girls took a shower they used hair spray to put all the hairs together because it would separate. Other than that great dont recommend it for real use i consider it kind of like a toy.</li>
    <li> These were awesome!!! Better than expected! The price is GREAT for the value . I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The shipping on this was phenomenal! I actually got it a couple weeks before the standard shipping date! They are beautiful too and everything worked really well! :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so great for such a low price! They are perfect!!!!! I should&#x27;ve bought more!</li>
    <li> Very cute! I bought these for a spa night party and everyone loved them! I loved the colors too :D</li>
    <li> It is a good product although I will point out a few things for you.&lt;br /&gt;1. The feathers are synthetic so they tangle easily,&lt;br /&gt;2. The tool comes apart and does not hold hair so I use my finger,&lt;br /&gt;3. There aren&#x27;t as many micro beads as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to point that stuff out.</li>
    <li> They where on time. They are not feathers as said in title but if you read the full post it does tell you this. I have used these on my daughters and they&#x27;ve worked out well.</li>
    <li> Loved these wishbtheir was more blue and yellow in the package</li>
    <li> Fast. Easy. You get 50- I bet I didn&#x27;t use 30. Use smaller strands if yours won&#x27;t pull through easily. Cannot be slept it!  Perfectly perfect.</li>
    <li> The whole kit is great and easy to use. Can leave them in your hair for days, wash them curl them, take them out and use them again. The beads are also reusable-well worth the money. They did take a little longer to get here, but they are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! And hair is beautiful!</li>
    <li> This feather extension kit was a big hit at our halloween party.  Everything we needed was included.  It came fast and right on time, in just a few days.  The feather I put in my daughter&#x27;s hair has now stayed in over a month and still looks great.  Very easy to use.I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Super cute! You can straighten them and wash them with no problem. They do not curl. But you can scrunch them it be pretty wavy.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved these.</li>
    <li> We have had fun decorating our hair.  It has been a little difficult keeping the strands from getting tangled together.</li>
    <li> This a a fun and easy to use little set.  I am in my late 20s and miss being able to have brightly colored hair.  I can easily pop a few of these in if I&#x27;m going out and get the look I miss so much.  These are clearly synthetic and should not be mistaken for natural looking hair extensions.  Fun for kids and adults. They are easy enough that I was even able to teach my husband how to put them in for me!</li>
    <li> Items came very fast.  You received enough feathers to last forever!  They were also very good quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people ate expecting .. these are hair feathers( hair)  not feathers as the picture clearly shows ... As for some of u people don&#x27;t blame the product blame yourself for them not being what u expected stupid!!  They are amazing quality and super easy to use! Great for adults and children ...  10 stars and super cheap especially for such good quality!!!  They do come from China so don&#x27;t expect fast delivery but worth it!!! LOVE THEM :)</li>
    <li> It is very cute, easy to use, but it does not curl... Other then that is perfect.  Colors are ver ptetty</li>
    <li> Not recommended:(( just got them try ed contacting and no call back:( sending back!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp; was shipped very quick. They are excellent.</li>
    <li> The tools that came with this set are great and easy to use, as are the beads. The extensions? Well, honestly they look like Barbie hair to me and I will not be putting them in my hair. They don&#x27;t look like feathers at all, just colored, synthetic, striped hair. The price for the tools and the extensions were about the same as if I were to buy the tools and the beads alone. So, if you just need tools this isn&#x27;t a bad deal, but if you want extensions that look nice you may want to keep looking.</li>
    <li> What a great deal. Lots of colors and beads and tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very vibrant colors. Synthetic, so not feather-like, but more like strands of hair bound together by an aiglet. I followed the youtube instructions, but made the mistake of cutting off most of the aiglet (that&#x27;s the tab at the end of a shoe lace, btw) after I crimped the bead. You are to do this with real feathers, but it&#x27;s a bad idea with these feathers as I cut off the part that was holding the hairs together. Unfortunately, these did not last, and came out with every hair washing/brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one that I didn&#x27;t cut stayed in, but did get tangled over time (3 stars). These would be great for a party since they&#x27;re so inexpensive, but don&#x27;t expect them to last.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering from this company, the product is well made.  ALways a hit in our house and when my daughters friends come over they all want extensions.</li>
    <li> Easy to put in and out! My 6 y/o loves them! We even put some I&#x27;m her little sisters hair that stayed on for a while!</li>
    <li> Awesome kit!!! It comes with tons of extensions and beads and good tools that really get them to stay in well. I read reviews first so even though it says feathers I knew it was only faux hair died like feathers but I like that better as they are easier to work with in your hair. For a $10 kit and free shipping I am extremely satisfied! Great for slumber parties. The only thing I wish was a bit different is I wish the beads that hold the hair in place were a bit smaller. These work well if your hair is really thick or you put them way underneath but if your hair is on the thinner side and you want them placed under the top layer of your hair the beads poke out.</li>
    <li> Aside from strands tangling easily, this was lots of fun!</li>
    <li> The kit is very complete and has plenty of &#x27;feathers&#x27; in the many colors. The tools are sturdy and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is not very good though, my 10 yr old daughter was a little disappointed how these do not look like feathers at all...of course it is what you pay for. So if it is for like a birthday party activity or little girls it is worth it. Not if you are looking for a NICE look.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! They came with alot of dark colored beads in the 6 kits I ordered which is perfect for the girls that I bought them for because most have dark brown hair.  Long for the girls with really long hair and you can even cut them if you have short hair and I have even curled mine because I have curly hair.  The feathers are bright and really prettier in person.</li>
    <li> I ordered these knowing that they WERE NOT real feathers but I was not expecting that they were actually patterned hair extentions. I thought they were synthetic feathers. So imagine my suprise when i opened them! Putting that aside, everything came that was supposed to. And my package arrived 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date, yay! The extensions are honestly gorgeous even though they were not what I expected. The colors are so vibrant, the beads aren&#x27;t flimsy, the pliers are nice, the &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; tool is a little cheap but it&#x27;s ok for the price. I highly recommend ordering these if you are looking for a cheap alternative to hair feathers.</li>
    <li> If you are just starting this you need this kit. It has great plyers and great colors. I will be getting more!!</li>
    <li> Crappy plastic strands with lines drawn on the pieces. Extremely low quality.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my tween girls and they love them. Girls are always looking for a way too stand out and this does just that.</li>
    <li> Great value and quality</li>
    <li> Some of the feathers are somewhat cheap looking, but then others are great. Clips work well. Overall great product for the price!</li>
    <li> not really any feather look to them</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed my items and it was exactly what I expected .i will recommend this item for any feather lover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the kit I got. It made a great party accessory for all the girls. There was enough pieces to give many girls all different color feathers.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they aren&#x27;t actual feathers but we didn&#x27;t mind one bit.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally buy this again. I feel it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> These are okay. The ends are big which makes it difficult to put more than one &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; through microbead. My hair tool broke after two uses. But it&#x27;s cheap and worked for what I needed it too.</li>
    <li> Order in advance, see ship times. Amazing for a party. Very big selection...lots of fun and super easy to do. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t order it in time for the big 8th birthday spa party, but it&#x27;s been a hit for all sleepovers and parties afterward.</li>
    <li> very cool wish they had lilac, they give you random colors not the ones in the picture, but its still a good product to start with.</li>
    <li> This product description is not accurate. I received my order and it consists of synthetic hair. It is in no way feathers.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; I was not really happy. Because I would not have called them feathers, maybe more like colored hair strands that have stripes or something. However after I used them on a few kids I liked them. They are long and can be cut to size and looks more like hair then a feather.</li>
    <li> Can I start by saying I LOVE these extensions. They are really cute!! I loved them so much I bought more sets of these and I do them in peoples hair at boutiques and events!! I have not had one single complaint about them at all. They work for all hair types, hair colors, and hair lengths. plus they are cute for all ages, not just teens. I have put them in toddler girls hair for pictures, teens hair, babys for pictures, even moms that just want a edgy young vibrant look (im one of them). I love these extensions and will ways be purchasing from these guys.</li>
    <li> I love these things this is my 3rd time geting these same ones so ya love them great to have in my hair it&#x27;s really easy to straighten my hair in the morning too hope this was helpful and good luck to those who get this</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the reviews but the description not clear at all that you&#x27;re getting synthetic hair colored to look like feathers. I had several people very disappointed.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Love these! The tools that came with the kit made it so easy!</li>
    <li> When I bought this hair feather  kit, I didn&#x27;t  kniw how to do it, and it didn&#x27;t  come with directions. I figued it our on my own, and i actually really like it. I cant have  colorful hair at my work, and as a teenage girl i wish i could, but i can get away with these  feathers. (:</li>
    <li> that was one of the nicest produdts i have used feather wise in my hair!! it was worth the money. if 52 is to much just get the 28 but my friends and famiy love it too! i currently have 10 in my hair and it looks very cool so i encourage anyone to buy this product:)&lt;3 And it ship within a week not a month like it says! the only downer is it gets kind of messy if you dont take care of them and put them in bags!</li>
    <li> Gift for my niece and she LOVED it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! The &#x27;feathers&#x27; are not feathers. They&#x27;re thin hair-like strands. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product. Plus, it took over three weeks to arrive at my house!</li>
    <li> It takes a while to ship but is worth the wait</li>
    <li> These are a hit with all my friends. Everybody wants me to put them in their hair, I&#x27;m gonna need to buy some more little kits to sell to my friends.</li>
    <li> This review is a rip off and definitely what it says it is. These are fake hair nasty feeling extensions, not the feathers you would expect as if you were to go to the beach and have them put in. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am going to return this rip off product.</li>
    <li> I thought by the description they were feathers not normal colored hair extensions. Feel like I was mislead! Won&#x27;t be ordering from them again! Not Happy!!!</li>
    <li> We sold these in our booth at the 4th of July...They were a big hit!</li>
    <li> For synthetic feathers they work fine.I use them on the kids. The rest of the kit,the beads, and what not work great</li>
    <li> Got two sets and dang there&#x27;s a lot all the beads you will need and the perfect tools love it. But I was expecting feathers not hair extensions but hey it&#x27;s ok I still like them</li>
    <li> These look like mini coon tails not feathers. I didn&#x27;t like the extensions.  But it came with nice pliers and beads. These are synthetic hair.  Don&#x27;t try to cut or curly these, its bad.</li>
    <li> They arrived earlier then I expected :)&lt;br /&gt;I wish the micro link beads were dived up colour wise a bit more evenly :(&lt;br /&gt;Tools are perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;I was however disappointed to have to pay extra duty on top of the $22.00 I already paid for shipping ... Perhaps I missed the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; print&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL ... We are happy with our purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this item and was extremely disappointed after receiving it. The feathers they give you are just colorful hair extensions and the are a cheap quality to. Very thin and fine. I do not recommend this item at all abs it took a month to ship and get here.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; are all threaded apart. Pretty sure it&#x27;s supposed to be one piece. I like this kit but not the extensions themselves.</li>
    <li> Im happy with my purchase.  Customers are satisfied. Thank u</li>
    <li> This kit arrived in very good condition.&lt;br /&gt;It was present for my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with the product that I have no problem to recommend to others</li>
    <li> I did not know this was filled with synthetic extensions. Kinda dissapointed but its my fault. Cute for a gift. Came by expected shipping date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more, love how you can easily change your hairstyle in a matter of seconds :3</li>
    <li> Cute, silky, durable, and a great value.</li>
    <li> These are actually great&lt;br /&gt; For the price you can&#x27;t beat what you get. Paid $25 at the salon for 1 feather for my daughter.  Now she we do a different color every time one falls out. Only bad thing was no instructions.  But we figured it out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be more like feathers then actual hair so when I opened the bag I was a little put off. The colors are bright and they are really long extentions. I&#x27;ll have to update my review once I&#x27;ve put some in but for right now I&#x27;m just ok with this item.</li>
    <li> Love these. They are easy to use but come with no instructions so I just googled some and it only took a few minutes to do my own hair. They lasted all week through swimming, washing, blow drying, etc.</li>
    <li> Came with all of the right pieces and everything but personally i did not like them.</li>
    <li> These extensions are great. You get a lot of product for the price and they arrived quickly. The color also lasts through several Washeans and stylings.</li>
    <li> So amazed. I just love this. Hair: 13 colors total, 4 of each color. Beads: 5 colors total. Really comes with the 52 synthetic feathers and 100 beads. Items where well packaged from the seller I used. Got items way before posted date. I am so pleased with this transaction. Never have I every been This pleased with a seller (some come close but if I could give this seller more stars trust me I would).</li>
    <li> i thought these were curlable and straightenable..</li>
