      <li>That&#x27;s about all I could find that was good.  </li>

      <li>Rather amazing.  </li>
      <li>CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU THAT AFTER USING AFTA PRE-ELECTRIC SHAVE LOTION</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and in addition it conditions and smoothens the skin.</li>
      <li>is a nice soothing cream--it is not in the slightest greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as effective -</li>
      <li>the smell is amazingly nice which I always get compliments on.</li>
      <li>I once bought a bottle of Stetson Pre Electric that worked pretty good, but it was kind of oily!</li>
      <li>My skin gets razor burn very easy.  </li>
      <li>Its kinda strong, not the kind of smell I prefer.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>As for which scent is better, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and hope they never stop making it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that amazon carries this product because I can&#x27;t find it in my area anymore.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I pray that this product is not discontinued as so many others have been over the years.</li>
      <li>Called them many time after that and</li>
      <li>I love using Afta and have been for 40 years.</li>
      <li>I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Glad we found it.</li>
      <li>Love the lotion</li>
      <li>so I can get a dozen or more at a time.</li>
      <li>I have found none better.  </li>
      <li>I find that this product helps to raise my beard and makes for a better shave.</li>
      <li>has given me a dramatically closer shave, and one that is more comfortable, too.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS  A GOOD ECONOMIC LOTION</li>
      <li>This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave.</li>
      <li>fine.    </li>
      <li>My electric razor felt hotter, and the hairs stayed like a fine powder on my face and scalp</li>
      <li>This product solves that problem and leaves my skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can&#x27;t beat that anywhere.</li>
      <li>Goes on non-greasy, shave is close and smooth -</li>
      <li>This dries within minutes and stands up hair for a smooth close shave every time.  </li>
      <li>It cost more to return this product than it is worth.</li>
      <li>Before I started using Afta, I was using Skin Bracer and also William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric (original).</li>
      <li>The ORIGINAL AFTA SHAVE SKIN CONDITIONER  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it to Me!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!</li>
      <li>Most importantly, my shave is closer by far with the Lectric Shave.    </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous change in the amount of irritation I USED to get.  </li>
      <li>Supposedly the new William&#x27;s gel is better than Afta, but since I still haven&#x27;t been able to locate it in my local area i haven&#x27;t been able to do a comparison.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the smell is really way strong.</li>
      <li>For the most part, I&#x27;m gonna used my old stand by: William&#x27;s Lectric Shave!</li>
      <li>Only kind my husband likes.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Hope they continue to carry this item as it is the best product of this type made, but difficult to find a retailer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult to find this product at the retail store.</li>
      <li>Was a pleasure living out in Raleigh, NC for 2 years where the local stores would carry this product but coming back to CA good luck finding it anywhere.</li>
      <li>As far as its promise that it doesn&#x27;t clog the heads, well this is true.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE WITH MY NORELCO ELECTRIC RAZOR.I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like buying 12 of these at a time</li>
      <li>I ordered two of the bottles - which arrived VERY promptly - and started shaving with the Afta.    </li>
      <li>Love this product and the items arrived quicker than expected.</li>
      <li>So much easier to just order a quantity on line.</li>
      <li>Pros:  -Much cleaner than Lectric.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that the scent stays with you the whole day.  </li>
      <li>I really wish I could return this to the store, as I don&#x27;t have any use at all for the rest of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>This also made me feel that I was going through the product way too fast.  </li>
      <li>Probably not quite as smooth a shave as Williams, but that&#x27;s very subjective, and likely due to the fact that the razor doesn&#x27;t glide over your face as easily as with an oil</li>
      <li>The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because as someone else mentioned the smell on the original formula (green label) can be a bit overwhelming---</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re used to shaving dry, this will be a smooth transition.  </li>
      <li>Something I know can be a particular hassle depending on your brand of razor.    </li>
      <li>My main objection to electric shavers has always been the burning skin in the throat area.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
      <li>try the blue label afta (i think its called Mountain Fresh or Mountain Breeze)for</li>
      <li>It raises the beard for an extremely close and comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Your skin stays smooth and not oily like other pre-electric shave products.</li>
      <li>Afta seemed to help a little bit in some of the areas that really didn&#x27;t need much help in the first place, but problem areas like under the chin and near the Adam&#x27;s Apple were still left with a significant amount of hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The only drawback, which I consider minor, is that the fragrance is rather strong.  </li>
      <li>After I shave (especially in the Summertime when it&#x27;s hot) I tend to get heat bumps if I don&#x27;t use it, and by using it-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not an alcoholic smell like the \\&quot;Lectric</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They sent me the wrong item. When contacted I was told the correct item if in stock would be shipped and I would be notified. Never got a call. Called them many time after that and no answer. I am still waiting to see my credit for returned items. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Sometimes hard to find item at discount stores or local pharmacies.Why spend time and gas going to the store when you can get this item for the same price or cheaper at Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> As the title notes, not Williams Lectric Shave.  Pros and cons of the stuff by comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re used to shaving dry, this will be a smooth transition.  It&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply, less messy than Williams.&lt;br /&gt;- Not a bad smell, or overpowering to me as some have said.  Actually found it fairly mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s dry. Really dry, like shaving without lotion.  Oh, maybe some lubrication, but if you press even moderately hard, you&#x27;ll understand the true meaning of \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; because the head of my Braun gets almost too hot to touch without any lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;- Probably not quite as smooth a shave as Williams, but that&#x27;s very subjective, and likely due to the fact that the razor doesn&#x27;t glide over your face as easily as with an oil pre-shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes awhile to dry - maybe an extra 5 minutes, and you DO need to let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted, not being oily is a plus AND a minus.  As a pre-shave, it works, and it depends on what you&#x27;re used to; level of irritation is about the same with Williams and this product (I&#x27;d been using the Williams for sensitive skin, which is hard to come by now).  Maybe a little more folliculitis with the Afta, because it likely has ground-up something-or-other in it to provide at least some skin lubrication, but oil is just as bad on some skin.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store. Usually they cost $3-$4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore. I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can&#x27;t beat that anywhere. This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave. Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing.</li>
    <li> Afta Pre-Electric Shave is the best prep for an electric shave that I have found. It raises the beard for an extremely close and comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve found no other product that works as well. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had problems finding it locally so I turned to the internet. Great product. Close electric shave. For just a couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> I find that this product helps to raise my beard and makes for a better shave.</li>
    <li> THIS IS  A GOOD ECONOMIC LOTION AND IT IS VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE &lt;br /&gt;PAID.</li>
    <li> Afta Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is the best pre-electric shave lotion on the market.  I have tried every electric shave conditioner on the market.  This dries within minutes and stands up hair for a smooth close shave every time.  This product will not clog razor like Williams or other \\&quot;oily\\&quot; type skin conditioners.  Your skin stays smooth and not oily like other pre-electric shave products.</li>
    <li> SURELY less irritating shave when using it!! (I have a thick beard and sensitive skin, bad combination, and I tried it with Braun 7526). &lt;br /&gt;now about closer, I think that depends on the type of ur beard and skin. Braun 7526 does not do good job (not at all sometimes) on the neck and jawline, after applying Afta, now maybe a little closer on the neck and jawline, but still far from as close as other areas. so it really was not big help FOR ME for a closer shave. &lt;br /&gt;the smell is really way strong. Even after I wash my face like 5-6 times with soap, some of it still is still there. Its kinda strong, not the kind of smell I prefer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, if the shaver is getting irrititating, This is a very good reason to buy Afta. If you are looking for a closer shave, I am not sure, you gotta try it, cuz it depends on ur beard.  &lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to wash ur face 5-6 times to at least get rid of most of the scent afterwards.</li>
    <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE TIRED OF THE USUAL GREASY-FEELING &amp;quot;WILLIAMS &#x27;LECTRIC SHAVE&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;MENNEN SKIN BRACER&amp;quot;, YOU&#x27;LL LIKE AFTA.</li>
    <li> Williams Lectric Shave goes on greasy, doesn&#x27;t protect against razor burn like Afta. Goes on non-greasy, shave is close and smooth - it&#x27;s the only thing I use now with my Norelco or Braun shavers. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I could find anywhere since Williams Lectric Shave Ultra was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Before I started using Afta, I was using Skin Bracer and also William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric (original). I was unhappy with both of these products because putting them on was basically the same as putting on a handful of oil on your face.  These products are so greasy and sticky&#x3D;--they are absolutely disgusting--the Williams is especially greasy. In addition I had often noticed that after using the Skin Bracer product my face often burned after shaving, and if I put on after shave it burned even more!!! &lt;br /&gt;One day I was in the supermarket and saw the Afta product and thinking that it couldn&#x27;t be any worse than the other products i had tried i picked it up-I have never gone back since.&lt;br /&gt;Afta is a nice soothing cream--it is not in the slightest greasy or oily. It has a nice smell and in addition it conditions and smoothens the skin. Razor burn is never a problem with this product.In addition the cream does not clog up the razor like an excessively oily product can. It provides a very close shave--I definitely see and feel the difference when I shave without using it. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because as someone else mentioned the smell on the original formula (green label) can be a bit overwhelming---try the blue label afta (i think its called Mountain Fresh or Mountain Breeze)for a more subtle and gentler aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I have been told that William&#x27;s Lectric now produces a pre-lectric gel for those that disliked its original formula and prefer the  Afta cream. Supposedly the new William&#x27;s gel is better than Afta, but since I still haven&#x27;t been able to locate it in my local area i haven&#x27;t been able to do a comparison.</li>
    <li> Soothing pre shave raises beard and improves razor movement on face.  I have found none better.  Availability in some local markets is limited.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using Afta for decades and has only become harder to find in any stores. Was a pleasure living out in Raleigh, NC for 2 years where the local stores would carry this product but coming back to CA good luck finding it anywhere. Luckily we have Amazon for this as I ordered the 12 pack after some slight hesitation as reviews seem to get mixed up on Amazon between this and the pre-electric shave. This I wanted as the after shave and the smell is amazingly nice which I always get compliments on. Love this product and the items arrived quicker than expected. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Bought this after an extraordinarily bad suggestion to try Lectric.  Some pros and cons:    Pros:  -Much cleaner than Lectric.  -Sort of worked.  A little.  -Smells fine.    Cons:  -Sort of didn&#x27;t work.  A lot.  -Drew blood    Afta seemed to help a little bit in some of the areas that really didn&#x27;t need much help in the first place, but problem areas like under the chin and near the Adam&#x27;s Apple were still left with a significant amount of hair.  And for the first time ever, my electric razor actually drew blood - twice.  Never happened with Lectric, or sans-treatment entirely.  I really wish I could return this to the store, as I don&#x27;t have any use at all for the rest of the bottle.  I&#x27;m giving up and going back to razors.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, but it is hard to find in stores.  He has used it for years, tried other brands, but always comes back   to Afta.  So much easier to just order a quantity on line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it. Recently all of the stores in my area have stopped stocking Afta and I was very happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My main objection to electric shavers has always been the burning skin in the throat area. I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;Afta\\&quot; to be the solution to my problem. It lubricates as well as condition the &lt;br /&gt;skin while not causing a razor clog. Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other brands of pre-electric shave conditioner, but I was so displeased with my new electric shaver that I decided to give Afta a try; I chose the \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent.  (It&#x27;s kind of a silly name, since \\&quot;Afta\\&quot; makes you think of \\&quot;after,\\&quot; and you&#x27;re supposed to use it \\&quot;before\\&quot;!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Afta has given me a dramatically closer shave, and one that is more comfortable, too.  It made the difference between an unacceptable shave and an acceptable one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the bottle says, it is a non-greasy formula.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to clog the razor heads, also as claimed.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks, so it may be too early to tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, which I consider minor, is that the fragrance is rather strong.  It reminds me of an inexpensive after shave lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t dissipate with my post-shave rinse with water; you would probably need to wash with soap and water to make it completely go away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m so pleased with the improvement in quality of my shave that the lingering aroma doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
    <li> Great product. Pity it is not available in Australia. We were in Hawaii when we bought it and found it to be great.</li>
    <li> I searched the web for this item, that I could not find in local stores, or anyplace other than Amazon, and had it in three days.  Rather amazing.  Hope they continue to carry this item as it is the best product of this type made, but difficult to find a retailer.</li>
    <li> I thought the only pre-Electric shave product out there was \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; which works well, but is very messy and has an alcoholic smell.  Then, one day I stumbled on Afta&#x27;s line (two scents as far as I&#x27;ve seen) in the store and decided to give it a shot.    Unlike \\&quot;Lectric Shave,\\&quot; Afta is an easier to use cream.  The \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; would always get all over my hands, no matter how careful I was.  This also made me feel that I was going through the product way too fast.  Afta&#x27;s cream makes it easier to control the portions, it&#x27;s far less messy and much easier to apply.    As far as its promise that it doesn&#x27;t clog the heads, well this is true.  The \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; would make an oozy, oily mess inside the heads and forced me to clean them every day.  I still clean them every day when using the Afta, but it&#x27;s an entirely different \\&quot;mess\\&quot; left behind (if you can even call it a \\&quot;mess\\&quot;.)  It&#x27;s not oily or oozy, but somehow, it&#x27;s powdery or dry, almost like you didn&#x27;t use the pre-shave at all.  Needless to say this makes for an easy clean-up and allows you to forgo a day of cleaning if you&#x27;re feeling lazy or just don&#x27;t like cleaning the heads every day.  Something I know can be a particular hassle depending on your brand of razor.    How about the smell you ask?  Both scents of the Afta are pleasing, but that&#x27;s all subject to personal taste.  It&#x27;s definitely not an alcoholic smell like the \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; which is a plus.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that the scent stays with you the whole day.  I shower AFTER I shave and no matter what I use to wash my face (sometimes a combo of soap/Noxema face wash) the Afta smell keeps going. Naturally, it&#x27;s a weakened scent, but noticeable in close quarters. Again, depending on personal taste, this can be a good or bad thing. It doesn&#x27;t bother me and I haven&#x27;t noticed anyone giving me funny looks, so it can&#x27;t be too bad.  As for which scent is better, I don&#x27;t know.  They&#x27;re close enough as to be indistinguishable.    I mentioned beforethat the portions are easier to control because it&#x27;s a cream.  That means you could probably stretch out the 3oz. bottle for over a month, depending on how much or little you like to use and probably your skin/beard type.    I don&#x27;t know if it gives me a CLOSER shave or not.  If forced to guess, I&#x27;d say it has made a bit of a difference.  Again, it probably depends a lot on the razor you use.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous change in the amount of irritation I USED to get.  My neck used to burn badly and was developing what seemed to be perma-rash before I stumbled upon Afta.  Yes, the \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; helped, but the effects wore off after time.  Afta has seemed to stop all rash and irritation and the effects don&#x27;t seem to be waning.  For this reason alone I recommend it.  I suppose it varies depending upon your skin type, but my neck was pretty bad and now there&#x27;s no rash at all.    Now that you&#x27;re on Amazon and reading this review, you should buy it here.  Why?  For some reason, this is a very difficult item to find in stores.  Oddly enough, plenty of stores stock the Afta AFTER-SHAVE, but don&#x27;t carry the pre-shave.  I live on Long Island and have only found one chain that carries it.  It&#x27;s even hard to find on the internet.  I don&#x27;t know why.  Afta After-Shave has been around a long time and is an established brand name.  Not to mention it&#x27;s a great product.  Maybe they&#x27;re being strong-armed by the \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; racket.  Who knows?  All I know is it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The ORIGINAL AFTA SHAVE SKIN CONDITIONER  is really a good product for Me. After I shave (especially in the Summertime when it&#x27;s hot) I tend to get heat bumps if I don&#x27;t use it, and by using it- it cuts down the likelyhood of Me getting them tremendously. I capitalized the product name above, because You have to be careful when buying as they make a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; shave lotion and it&#x27;s not as effective - for Me at least. Wal Mart used to carry it, snd also Kroger Grocery stores, but for some reason both have quit carrying it. I was afraid Mennon had quit making it, so when I found it on Amazon I bought a case- it&#x27;s worth it to Me! I&#x27;ve tried the Afta in the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent, and it&#x27;s not as good. If You have trouble with heat bump&#x27;s and even razor burn/scrape give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;PawPaw Cabe</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE WITH MY NORELCO ELECTRIC RAZOR.I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU THAT AFTER USING AFTA PRE-ELECTRIC SHAVE LOTION I EXPERIENCED A SHAVE COMPARABLE TO AGILLETTE MACH3 TURBO BLADE.I AM AMAZED THAT THERE WAS NO RAZOR BURN....NO NICKS...NO BLEEDING..USING AFTA MADE SHAVING A JOY....GREAT PRODUCT....HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT....</li>
    <li> I have used this pre-electric shave skin conditioner for years. I am so allergic to all other products&#x27; perfumes used in them that I cannot stand to have them under my nose. The lotion works perfectly and quickly to prepare for shaving. I have quite sensitive skin and this does not affect my skin at all. I use a basic unscented lotion as an after shave since there is no longer any unscented after shave or the old spice type which I could use. I pray that this product is not discontinued as so many others have been over the years. A bottle lasts me about two months.</li>
    <li> I love this product and hope they never stop making it.  It is unique because it is a cream base and not liquid or powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that amazon carries this product because I can&#x27;t find it in my area anymore. I&#x27;ve tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don&#x27;t really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!</li>
    <li> Update:  Amazon and the supplier allowed me to return the after shave and refunded my money, so I am happy with their service.  I ordered the pre-electric shave from another link.  Lesson learned - if using links from previous orders, double check that the product is the same as what was ordered before.  Apparently the product associated with the link can change ... in this case from pre-electric shave to after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to give this 0 stars but the lowest I can give it is 1 star.  I have been ordering Afta Pre-Shave from Amazon for several years.  When I placed this order I went back to a previous order and re-ordered.  To my surprise, I received Afta After Shave, NOT Afta Pre-Shave.  The text and review comments discuss Afta Pre-Shave, but the picture and title are for Afta After Shave.  I am attempting to return the product, but I don&#x27;t think it will be allowed as this material is considered \\&quot;Hazardous\\&quot; by the Post Office per an Amazon response I received when I tried to return it.  If you are looking for Afta Pre-Shave as mentioned in the text and review comments, you won&#x27;t get it by ordering this product.  Looks like a mistake by Amazon and / or the seller since it appears that an Afta Aftershave link has replaced the Afta Pre-Shave link.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time, and have always used Lectric Shave.  However, I&#x27;m always looking for ways to improve my shave. So, after reading reviews about Afta, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered two of the bottles - which arrived VERY promptly - and started shaving with the Afta.    On the positive side - there is no real oily feeling after shaving.  That&#x27;s about all I could find that was good.  My electric razor felt hotter, and the hairs stayed like a fine powder on my face and scalp( I shave my head too), and I noticed that there was a definite difference in the closeness of the shave.  I use the newest Braun Pulsonic razor - which I also bought on Amazon (works GREAT) - so I know it&#x27;s not the fault of the razor.    I shaved with the Afta for 5 days, and finally this morning went back to the Lectric Shave.  WHAT a DIFFERENCE.  The shave was cooler, much smoother, and since I always wash my face and scalp after shaving, the slight oily feeling is taken care of.  Most importantly, my shave is closer by far with the Lectric Shave.    So, the Afta has found its way to my circular file, and I will continue to be a Lectric Shave user.  Sorry, AFTA.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns my face and a bottle of it doesn&#x27;t last very long either!!!! I will never use it again. I once bought a bottle of Stetson Pre Electric that worked pretty good, but it was kind of oily! For the most part, I&#x27;m gonna used my old stand by: William&#x27;s Lectric Shave! You can&#x27;t beat the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it.  In my shopping area, it was becoming difficult to find.  Finding it at Azamon.com, and, in quanity was great.</li>
    <li> Only kind my husband likes.  Glad we found it.</li>
    <li> I never have used this product, I wanted the Afta Pre-Electric (as picture above shows) and got the Afta After Shave Conditioner. It cost more to return this product than it is worth.</li>
    <li> exactly what I ordered. NOT AFTER SHAVE BUT PRE-ELECTRIC SHAVE.  I have used this before and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> My skin gets razor burn very easy.  This product solves that problem and leaves my skin smooth.  Love the lotion</li>
    <li> I have been using this for twenty yrs.good stuff</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for my man&#x27;s skin condition!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but noticed it is harder and harder to find in stores. Home delivery worked great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult to find this product at the retail store. I love using Afta and have been for 40 years. I order over the internet now so I can get a dozen or more at a time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband who has used it for years.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
