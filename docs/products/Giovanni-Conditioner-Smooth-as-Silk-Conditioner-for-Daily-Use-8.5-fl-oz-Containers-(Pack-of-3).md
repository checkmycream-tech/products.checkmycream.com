      <li>I would say 50% of the time my hair would be AMAZING and 50%</li>
      <li>but to just work it through your hair and kind of massage to get lather.</li>
      <li>It could totally be my own hair type though.</li>
      <li>but also I have never used it during the summer when its a bit drier, so it may fair better then).</li>
      <li>The protein treatment is nice.</li>
      <li>and I love it even more!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a great conditioner , i use it with the matching shampoo . great !! i have dry hair , and i&#x27;m trying to grow it LONG . i think with the help of this conditioner and it&#x27;s matching shampoo i will have way less split ends and my hair will be able to grow long .</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive, dry skin and eczema, and this conditioner works great for my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t build up, but adds back some of that natural moisture my hair thirsty curls are missing.  I use this every time I shower, and just use shampoo when necessary.  I use the Kiss My Face Whenever shampoo when needed.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair and it can get dry very easily. its hard to find a product that would leave my hair silky without weighing it down. I bought this and had no high expectations....the only all natural shampoo I have ever used that has worked is Hiku...but since its 30 dollars I had a hard time justifying the re-purchase. This stuff is just like Hiku! It is awesome!! My hair feels like its been deep conditioned everyday! Even after shampooing my hair feels moisturized...when does that happen?!!The smell is similar to a grapefruit...not my favorite...but I can live with it b/c this stuff does what it promises! The trick with all natural shampoo&#x27;s is not to gather your hair up and squish it for lather...but to just work it through your hair and kind of massage to get lather. I know a lot of people say natural shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners tangle their hair...and I think thats b/c they are useing the way you would a regular sulfate ridden shampoo. I also leave natural conditioners in a little longer...that seems to help :)....I will never be purchasing 30 dollar shampoo again!!</li>
    <li> Oh, man. I cannot praise this product enough. I am African American with 3c/4a curls. My hair is thick and Shea Moisture curls conditioner, Curls (the brand) conditioner, and Tresemme all didn&#x27;t work for me that well. I put this conditioner in and can detangle my hair ten seconds hair with little to no issue. It is, by far, superior to the brands aforementioned. I really hope this never gets discontinued!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipment arrived on time, and the products didn&#x27;t look tampered with at all. Yay.</li>
    <li> Thank you Giovanni I thought I was born with greasy hair, after a couple bottles I realized it is the crap they put in other shampoo&#x27;s and Conditioners.  Although it is slightly more expensive than those found in markets you need to use less and this bottle will last me weeks.</li>
    <li> Been natural for 2 years now &amp; have spent LOTS of money on products. This product works great for my 4A Afro Textured hair. You can instantly feel a difference in your hair, it will be smooth, soft, &amp; easy to manage. The ingrediant list is great too. For an extra treat, apply smooth as silk w/Kinky Curly Knot Today to detangle your hair. You will be in heaven. Only gave 4 stars b/c there is some arm work involved with getting the product out of the bottle. I leave my bottle sitting upside down for easier squeezing.   P.s. have tried all the shampoos and don&#x27;t like any of them. The protein treatment is nice. Try Kinky Curly Come Clean</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about getting this product, but after watching youtube video I took a shot. Wow this stuff made my hair sooooo soft and detangled at the same time. It lathered up a little which I loved and made my hair smell citrusy, and feel silky.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t respond the wayI thought it would. What works for others doesn&#x27;t necessairly work you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately two weeks, both with the shampoo and on its own.  It is wonderful!  My hair is not as frizzy, doesn&#x27;t tangle as badly over night and doesn&#x27;t bunch up around my shoulders as it dries.  I have very curly hair which I am growing out.  My hair feels and looks good.  My hair is always shiny, but this product makes it even more so.  Only problem is with the bottle structure -- it will be impossible to get all of the product out as it nears the end.  I will have to cut the bottle open, and it seems to be very thick plastic.  I would love them to change the bottle, but not the product itself.  REVIEW CORRECTION:  Two years later, I should have rescinded my glowing review.  They never did change the bottle, but the conditioner recipe was altered and it no longer works like it did. I threw them away.  I just recently was reviewing my comments and realized I never corrected this review.</li>
    <li> I love that this conditioner has all natural ingredients in it. I also love that it makes my very long, coarse, wavy hair smooth and shiny. I wouldnt want to be without it for long.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a gf&#x27;s shower once when visiting from out of town. Her hair always looked so shiny, so I bought some. Nothing in a salon, drugstore, or health food store works this good. My course, color-treated hair needs ALL the help it can get.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works so well on my 4c natural hair. A must for homemade deep conditioners and great for detangling coarse and thick natural hair.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this conditioner. I use it religiously!! I am super bummed that I didn&#x27;t get more. It leaves your hair hydrated, never dull! When using this I don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of product to moisturize my hair!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great for hair, I have dry length and only use it on the length.  it&#x27;s very moisturizing and gives great slip without having any silicones in it.  The scent is very light as well and not synthetic or overpowering.  Make my hair smooth as silk, just like it says.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I used it as a co-wash and it left my 4c hair hard. Second ingredient is Ceateryl Alcohol. Ingredients are different on the bottle I ordered. Would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner--it makes my hair silky soft without feeling weighed down.  It is very difficult to get the last few uses out of the bottle.  Hopefully Giovanni will rethink their package design.  Still, this conditioner is worth it.</li>
    <li> Black girl with natural wavy/curly hair. I use this most of the time in place of shampoo. When I DO shampoo, I use the smooth as silk shampoo.  I Love this product!  Love the way my hair feels when I use it!  It Lives up to its name...\\&quot;smooth as silk\\&quot;  Great price...Buy this in bulk!</li>
    <li> This and it&#x27;s accompanying shampoo are simply the bomb. All natural, cruelty free and they work. This is the only line of natural hair care products that has worked on my dry hair. I don&#x27;t think I will ever be using another shampoo/conditioner combo in my life, unless they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for naturally wavy or curly hair. I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite conditioner!</li>
    <li> Conditioner works well.  It does not leave my hair feeling greasy as most other conditioners do on my hair even after a thorough rinsing.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  When I ran out of it, I could really see and feel a difference in my hair, which is long.  With the conditioner, my hair is smooth and soft. Without it, using another conditioner, my hair became dry and rough.  Happy to get a three pack of this and will always keep it around.</li>
    <li> I use this product as my deep condition and the Trader Joe&#x27;s as my main conditioner.  I leave this on my hair for about 45 minutes under a shower cap and when I rinse it out, it leaves behind soft and easy to manage hair.  I use to use this one alone but at the price I wanted to find something cheaper as a quick rinse conditioner and use this one for deep conditioning.  Highly recommend it along with the leave-in conditioner and shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that allows me to finger-comb my thick, curly hair when it&#x27;s wet without producing more tangles! No comb necessary in the shower with this product because knots and tangles just slip right out. I don&#x27;t feel like it leaves film on my hair after I&#x27;ve rinsed, as some conditioners do. The packaging isn&#x27;t the best and in fact one of my bottles was leaking upon arrival but it&#x27;s still an awesome product and I love the light grapefruit scent.</li>
    <li> A \\&quot;must have\\&quot; to work with the shampoo.  I color my hair and this conditioner is wonderful for making my hair smooth and silky - love it!!</li>
    <li> I used this as a co-wash, and it did so well, I let the shampoo go and just used this instead.  It has a very good clean smell and it makes your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have try n this condition before and loved it then , this is y I bought it again it gets my hair soft easy to manage I will reorder this again</li>
    <li> My hair was like straw after using this product and thr shampoo</li>
    <li> Weighed my hair down after using it awhile.  Would not buy again.  But that is me.  I like my hair feeling light and clean. Heavy products are not permitted in my coif.</li>
    <li> Good but not as I expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have curly, fine, virgin hair and always only used this as a wash-out conditioner at first and loved how it felt while it was in my hair. I used to then put in Giovanni&#x27;s Weightless Leave-in which I love as well, but decided to give this a try in its place one day and I love it even more! It&#x27;s the only hair &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; I use besides a light shampoo and my hair is shiny, soft and never feels dried out (and my hair can tend to be on the dry-side). I live in the PNW and it fights frizz better than the WLI in my opinion, but still isn&#x27;t frizz-free when I&#x27;m walking around on days without a hood on or something (but also I have never used it during the summer when its a bit drier, so it may fair better then). Either way, stuff this is awesome and I love that I can get it in a 3-pack, and would fully recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use to get this from Wal-mart, buy they never seem to order any(I think I bought out all their stock).So I have to get from here.  My hair really loves this conditioner.  I use it mostly as a deep conditioner and my naturally kinky hair feels really soft afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it has really curved the shedding problems my hair use to have.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner at the recommendation of someone and it was ok I&#x27;m not in love with it I didn&#x27;t really see the difference it wasn&#x27;t good or bad I&#x27;ve also cowashed with it it worked better that way  but not as a deep conditioner the good thing was the price for 3 bottles</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had issues with the packaging yet but the conditioner is awesome. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton, runs easily thru your hair and my hair is soft and clean and rinses really well. Much cheaper than Aveda and I think I like it more!</li>
    <li> I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave-in. It has a wonderful moisture balance that allows my hair to stay moisturized all day. It is rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great conditioner.  leaves hair smooth and silky.  nice and thick so not much needed to get the job done. no complaints</li>
    <li> The Smooth as Silk Conditioner is one of many Giovanni haircare products I&#x27;ve tried and loved.  The Smooth as Silk is packaged just like the others, which is a bit of a downside as it&#x27;s hard to get that last bit of product out! However, that is the only negative about this conditioner.  The positives: it&#x27;s organic, not tested on animals, gives hair amazing slip, smells wonderful, and conditions nicely.  One great thing about Giovanni products in general is that they are an organic line that is easily found in department stores/pharmacies.  I will buy this product again :)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this conditioner since I went natural .. It works great for that wash in go curly look. I will continue to order this conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this hair product so much.  It does exactly what it says, it moisturizes my hair whole cleaning it and not leaving it greasy.</li>
    <li> I am natural with 3c/4a hair. Being natural you are always in search of a great conditioner that gives good slip. Well this is it. I leave it on while i shower and my hair is instantly detangled. It makes my hair feel so soft and its very moisturizing. I am able to run the comb right through with hardly any problems.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to co-wash conditioner. I love the slip it has, and it doesn&#x27;t smell overwhelming, but it does have a nice scent. I just wish they came in big pump bottles!! I&#x27;d stock up on that stuff like CUH-RAZY. I go through one of these every 2-3 weeks. Very long, very thick, very curly hair. All the Giovanni products are great.</li>
    <li> First off, I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product on a YOUtube channel and had to have it for my daughter. She&#x27;s been natural since birth and now at 2 years old this conditioner does wonders for her Curly/Fine hair type. This is definitely a staple for us. :) I love how her curls look after using this.</li>
    <li> Make my hair feels nice and soft.  It smells pretty good also.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it leaves my hair so soft. I usually finger detangle because it gives my hair a lot of slip.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims to do. My hair is softer and easier to manage. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> Overall, this product is better than any brand you could buy at CVS, Wallgreen and the like. I have been using this for a year and a half. However, for some reason, sometimes I get incredible results after washing my hair with it but other times it is just okay. I would say 50% of the time my hair would be AMAZING and 50% it would just be good. I am not complaining, just pointing out the variance. It could totally be my own hair type though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have long thick and coarse hair.  Switching to no sulfates has made my hair healthier than ever and this is the best conditioner i have found, will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice conditioner for regular daily use. With added oils, it&#x27;s good for deep conditioning too. One of my faves.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and the softness it leaves in my hair</li>
    <li> I orinally thought this was the leave in conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t matter love it still.  Gives my hair much slip.  I love the way it makes it feel.</li>
    <li> I love Giovanni products and thus I buy in bulk!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner with natural ingredients, no parabens, no animal testing. It&#x27;s concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after seeing the recommendations on you tube. I have to say i am very happy with the conditioner. I usually use Pureology Hydrate and this conditioner worked very well as a deep conditioner with a significantly lower price tag. I will be using this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Great smell and works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is such crap. Sorry but Suave does a better job then this.</li>
    <li> this was my secret after me 50:50 shampoo i love my hair i know when the summer hits i will add this to my regimen i was scared to rinse it out but when i did i was confused my hair was so silky i taught i didn&#x27;t rinse well but i did my hair was supple smooth and shine I love this my type 4 hair and i have all of the type 4 hair on my head love this thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million and one brands and this is, quite honestly, the best conditioner I have ever used for my 3B curls. It&#x27;s hydrating, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t build up and works great in combination with the shampoo of its line or alone as a co-wash (which is how I generally tend to use it). What I love most about giovanni products is that they perform consistently with my hair, every single day, regardless of the weather. It such a relief to not have to worry about having great results some days and dry, tacky curls on another. This is a great choice for people who don&#x27;t respond well to cones and alcohols.</li>
    <li> So, I bought this conditioner at the advice of many a natural hair afficiando&#x27;s. I was painted portaits of grand illusions of how my hair would bounce like Tracy Ross Ellis. My hair would smell like hope and success. And finally it would be as slick and smooth as a 1975 pimp. I raced home with the anticipation that Ralphie had when he finally got his Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle! I hardly could take my shoes and work clothes off fast enough. I stuck my head under the faucet, flipped open the beautiful pyramid of a bottle and squeezed the liquid \\&quot;cure\\&quot; in my shaky hands. I put a whole heap of it in my 4c natural hair. I giggled out loud as i swished and swashed the heaven in my hair and on my scalp.  What was this feeling I felt on my hair? The smell, the more I swished the harder the swashes got, my fingers were getting caught in the fast approaching nap balls. i kept going, thinking this was all apart of its ingenious! Maybe things had to get worse before they got better. But my hair grew tougher and tougher, I got nervous- \\&quot;this can&#x27;t be happening! Maybe some cruel 3a hair curly saw me eyeing the bottle at Whole Foods and went to the sink and replaced the real stuff with some other crap!\\&quot; I rinsed my hair out, looked up in the mirror and saw a tangled, knotty, nappy, hard, silky mess.  I was pissed.  Mom was right-I shot my eye out! Its not for me and my 4c! Maybe it will work for you, but i am getting a refund. This doesn&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t work at all. It made it worse.  I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Essence \\&quot;Hello Hydration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the end</li>
    <li> I like this but it isn&#x27;t the greatest. It is also cheaper at target and khols for larger size bottles. I would probably use it again but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first option.</li>
    <li> This conditioner was hard to find in the stores so I ventured to order and try them myself.  Well...it works!  It works so well that I ordered 5 of them.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> They must have changed their formula. I used to buy this conditioner all the time but now it doesn&#x27;t condition as well and it makes my hair feel staticky.</li>
    <li> I purchased Smooth as Silk conditioner after reading rave reviews on Amazon and on haircare blogs. I was so disappointed when it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling smooth, silky, or even soft. I used it at first as a deep conditioner and was unimpressed. I have been using it to co-wash until the product runs out and am getting the same lackluster results. I agree with the reviewers who commented on the impractical bottle design. I hope the company takes note. On a positive note, the citrus fragrance of the conditioner is nice for summer. I realize that products don&#x27;t work the same for everyone, so I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from buying Smooth as Silk conditioner. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Giovanni is on of the top 3 conditioner on the market. Amazon sells a pack of 3 for very very good price. You won&#x27;t find a cheaper price any where, I looked so save your self the time &amp; buy it with out any second guessing your self.&lt;br /&gt;Its good for:&lt;br /&gt;curly hair&lt;br /&gt;colored hair&lt;br /&gt;damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;over exposed hair&lt;br /&gt;dry hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one more great bonus, it is a green product. It&#x27;s a green product</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it makes my hair very soft and manageable. I will purchase the Smooth as Silk Shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell. I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Smooth as Silk Shampoo. They clean and condition well. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works great for me but I&#x27;ve had better conditioners.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I really liked this conditioner at first. It has a nice, very mild scent and was a lot smoother than other natural conditioners I had tried in the past. I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 months now and have noticed both my hair and scalp getting worse and worse. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling silky or smooth, but thin and coarse feeling. I&#x27;ve also been having issues with dry, flaky scalp. I don&#x27;t recommend this product despite the overall good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now moved on to Hugo Naturals Balancing Conditioner. What a difference!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It is the only one that goes onto my long shampoo matted hair (I use a great tea tree shampoo for my dry scalp, but it leaves my hair very tangled) and detangles like magic. When I put it on it does feel just as it claims, &amp;#34;smooth as silk&amp;#34;. It has an excellent &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; factor. I am able to run my shower comb through it quite easily after distributing it easily through my hair, and I use way less product than my previous conditioners. After drying and styling my hair feels nice and soft also. I have never met another conditioner like it. I will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t like this product. The ingredients shown here, are not the exact ingredients on the back of the conditioner. It made my scalp dry and irritated. I bought a 3 pack, I used one, hoping it would work, but it didnt. the other two are either going to be given away or thrown away.</li>
    <li> One of the most moisturizing conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. Works well on naturally curly hair. Great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent for my curly hair. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Lives up to its name!!  Awesome conditioner.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am over 50% gray, and until I started coloring my hair a few months ago, it was very dry and tired-looking.  The hair color helps my hair look and feel better, but this conditioner makes my hair feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not used conditioner much in recent years, but after I started using Giovanni shampoo a few months ago, I decided to try this conditioner.  Now I use it every time I shampoo, which is usually every other day.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. A little goes a long way; I have shoulder-length hair, and a quarter-sized dollop is enough to work through all of my hair. I appreciate the fact that it does not have an overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is so thick that sometimes I have to shake the bottle (with the cap closed) in order to move it toward the opening so I can dispense it.  The dispenser is easier to use than another brand of conditioner I have used.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble getting the last bit out of the bottle, so there&#x27;s no wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> My hair is always flat and frizzy.  I have really long hair and it gets oily so I wash every day.  This conditioner helps detangle and really makes my hair soft and LESS frizzy.  My husband loves the scent and I do too.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Its was just ok for me!!! I am a hairstylist so products are a big deal to me.. But as 1 should knw to see any results of aproduct wait at least 6 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for several years and have been really pleased with the results. The ingredients are way more natural (and mostly organic) as opposed to other conditioners, and it really does leave your hair soft. The fragrance is very light. Also, the product is cruelty free and not tested on animals. It&#x27;s a great every day use conditioner!</li>
    <li> Makes my natural hair silky smooth...can&#x27;t wash without it. I would recommend to people especially with type 4a to c curls</li>
    <li> I had been buying Pureology and the cost is just crazy, I found this and wow, for the money it is an awesome little product.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy color treated hair and it leaves my hair very shiny, even with well water as I live in the country, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am in my early twenties and my hair has suffered a decade of all sorts of chemicals. After reading these reviews I was hoping this would bring moisture back into my hair. Suffice to say, it didn&#x27;t. I was better off buying Herbal Essences from my local grocery store. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair needs some serious treatment go for Moist 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner by Aussie. Trust me, you will be glad you tried out Aussie.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair and use it as a detangler and leave in.  It is so smooth and silky while conditions the hair. Like others hard to get to the last drop.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie at being natural and this stuff is great.  Makes my hair so manageable.  I recommend this to all naturals.</li>
    <li> This Conditioner was formerly &amp;#34;Pure Organic&amp;#34;. It has now been changed to &amp;#34;Eco Chic&amp;#34; and the new ingredients which are no longer all &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; has made the product for me unusable.  I was a faithful customer up until this point but will no longer purchase this product as the new formulation does not perform as well with my fine hair and the hard water that is typical of where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was probably for cost reasons that the formulation was changed but I would have been happy to pay more to keep the old formulation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! It is so moisturizing, it protects my hair from heat styling. It smells lovely and leaves my hair moisturized, healthy, and detangled. I like that I can get three bottles for the price that two cost in stores!</li>
    <li> This is like heaven in a bottle and it did as it said &amp;#34;Smooth as Silk&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i am now chemical free with natural hair and this product gives me the luster, body and curls</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I have African American (4a) hair, and it is a wonderful moisturizer/detangler.  My only qualm is the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love my bottle of Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish conditioner, and I was reading the ingredient list not long ago... and surprise surprise.  The ingredient lists are practically IDENTICAL.  So much so that I am willing to believe they use the same manufacturer, but I don&#x27;t know this to be a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I can see is that Trader Joe&#x27;s bottle is much bigger and sells for $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ya&#x27; know!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and all of the Giovanni products that I have tried so far work well in my 4B hair type. I use it everyday as a co-wash in the shower and I shampoo once a week. My hair feels great.</li>
    <li> I hate the shampoo so it&#x27;s hard to tell if this conditioner did anything for my hair.  When I got out of the shower and my hair was wet trying to comb it was absolutely horrible.  I could barely get the comb through my hair.  I have very healthy hair as well.  I just can&#x27;t recommend this product.  It also had no smell.  After I dried my hair my hair smelled like I had been outside.  I knew I should have tried something else because I have used Giovanni products a long time and remembered I did not like them then so why would I like them now.  Try the desert essence coconut shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s actually good and smells awesome.  good Luck!</li>
    <li> What can I say? This is the best vegan conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I have super curly hair so I go through a lot of conditioner to detangle. I will only use Giovanni. My only gripe is the bottle design. It is nearly impossible to take the entire cap off to get the last bit of contents out. I feel like I end up throwing out quite a bit of product because I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle. I&#x27;d prefer a more traditional bottle design rather than this sorta trapezoidal thing they&#x27;ve got going. But the stuff inside the bottle is great!</li>
    <li> Finally - a conditioner free of parabens and phthalates that actually detangles and smoothes my hair!  I tend to have an oily scalp that needs daily washing (sorry to those who believe the less you wash the less oil you produce - definitely not the case with me!  And dry shampoo makes my head itch), but my very long, thick professionally hi-lighted hair needs some TLC or it quickly goes the way of straw.  I had gotten rid of all parabens in my products for several years now, but phthalates were the new problem.  I have used Davines Nounou for a couple of years now and LOVE it and switched between it and Bain de Terre when I needed more cleaning power, but, now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I wanted to be assured that there were no chemical fragrances in my products.  So, I put away the Davines and Bain de Terre and started using Acure Lemongrass shampoo and conditioner a couple of weeks ago, but the conditioner left my very long, thick hair frizzy and tangled - the kind of tangles that I haven&#x27;t had since my surfing days.  It was awful.  So, I tried the Acure Moroccan Argan Oil conditioner, and, although my hair was smoother, it was now TOO weighed down while my scalp became super oily and broke out in acne near the nape of my neck!  They were HORRIBLE bumps, some of them as big and deep as cystic acne.  There seemed to be no middle ground for me - either natural products left heavy, pore-blocking residue from all of the oils or made my hair feel like straw...sometimes both.  I had read the reviews for Giovanni and was hesitant to try it because of the more recent reviews stating that the new formula isn&#x27;t good.  I completely understand how frustrating it is to love a product and have the company change the formula out of nowhere.  Well, I was desperate enough to try it anyway, and I am oh so glad I did.  I used the 50/50 shampoo with this Smooth as Silk conditioner, and it&#x27;s PERFECT for my type of hair.  This is the first natural conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used that immediately detangled my hair the same way typical conditioners with silicones do and left it soft and smooth.  I haven&#x27;t experienced scalp itch or dryness for the shampoo, but I don&#x27;t use the 50/50 every day.  I switch back and forth between 50/50 and the Acure Lemongrass shampoo, but I now consistently use this Smooth as Silk conditioner.  It&#x27;s pricy, but, if you&#x27;re as desperate as I was, you might give it a try.  The smell isn&#x27;t delightful or anything, but it&#x27;s a pleasant light, clean smell.  I might even continue using these products after the baby is born for health reasons.  Now, if only Pacifica could come out with a shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;d be in heaven!  That&#x27;s the only brand of body wash I&#x27;ll ever buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too light as a conditioner. It does keep frizz away but when used with the shampoo my hair still feels dry. It may work for some but it didn&#x27;t work for me. The ends of my hair are too dry for this product. I don&#x27;t dye my hair, blow dry it or straighten it so my hair is just naturally dry on the ends. I wanted it to work especially since the shampoo really strips your hair and its so expensive. But alas, I will be throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, I use as a leave-in, also works great on my 2 year old granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> I use this every time i wash my hair. It is great and not too thick. Does what it is supposed to do without the harmful chemicals. I use this on my hair and my daughters and we love it. It smells nice and clean and helps soften the hair for tangles. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I actually meant to buy the leave in but being that this a natural product I have been leaving it in anyway which just leaves my hair looking and feeling great. My hair is actually in box braids right now and I am using this two times a day. My new growth does not look rough at all and I love that this conditioner isn&#x27;t making my extension slip. I&#x27;m so in love with this conditioner oh and the smell my boo stopped complaining about my braids in his face it smells so good lol.</li>
    <li> This product came about a week ago and it came as advertised. Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren&#x27;t lying when they say &#x27;pack of 3&#x27;. I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don&#x27;t live in the States, it&#x27;s a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for several years now. I am very happy with how my hair responds to it. It has a great level of moisturization but does not leave any residue. I also use Chickapoo from the same brand and will continue to do so. Great products.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t post reviews about hair products because there are so many factors&lt;br /&gt;to take into account that what works for me may not work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Giovanni Smooth as Silk (SAS) conditioner deserves an exception to this rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to find an excellent natural product for a price that makes the choice sustainable.&lt;br /&gt;However, Giovanni SAS can be used either as a leave in or as a conditioner or as a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;It gets 10 stars for all three uses in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for a multi-use product is over and it has been a very long search,&lt;br /&gt;and extremely expensive until now.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the 50:50 balanced shampoo and I have finally found the perfect combo! I then use the serum after slightly drying my hair and my hair does not need to be flat ironed any more.</li>
    <li> Okay value for the 3 bottles, totals around 24 oz... We usually buy paraben and sulfate free products, around 32 oz for closer to $15 or so, from our local Grocery Outlet. Thought it would be nice to have our hair care on Subscribe and Save for the convenience but may stick with our prior routine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner feels wonderfully silky out of the bottle and smells great too. I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes my hair especially silky though. It&#x27;s nice, no added build-up or anything, just not better than other natural type products we&#x27;ve used for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s in your budget, it&#x27;s a good product and you may enjoy it. Not sure if we&#x27;ll be sticking with this one though. Smile. Hope this is helpful!</li>
