      <li>This wax is wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Much better than sticky wax.</li>
      <li>I just make sure that I order ahead.  </li>
      <li>No-Tweeze Hair Remover is the best I&#x27;ve found for facial hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve waxed for 20 years, I thought I had tried most waxes</li>
      <li>I love not having to use strips.</li>
      <li>When I moved away, she made sure that I had the name so that I could order and use it myself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years.  </li>
      <li>it did more than that, it tore skin too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff..</li>
      <li>I love that I did not need strips</li>
      <li>works good, but sadly not vegan.</li>
      <li>This product is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>So glad this was used for my first experience doing any type of waxing!  </li>
      <li>I also like the fact that this is an easy wax to clean up.  </li>
      <li>Gives really smooth results.</li>
      <li>I think I prefer the Natural Wax products for their consistency and ease in application, but No Tweeze is a good product.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this large size.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more when i run out!</li>
      <li>Works great- messy but does the job well.</li>
      <li>I warm it on a low stove setting in about 1+ inches of water.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using wax at home.</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever used a hair removal product.</li>
      <li>That way the wax doesn&#x27;t get to hot.  </li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the microwavable waxes as the tubs get hot</li>
      <li>This one is an easy one to clean up, though I still put down parchment or wax paper cause</li>
      <li>I tried a cheap flip the switch warmer which gives no control over how hot the wax gets and it takes a long time to melt the wax.</li>
      <li>and I think it worked better than any other home wax I have tried.</li>
      <li>works better than other waxes i have used.</li>
      <li>Effective, easy to apply but messy and stringy compared with other beeswaxes that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>After it cools it get hard as a brick but resoftens easily and fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>and if you&#x27;re not careful the hot wax can tip out onto your hand and floor.</li>
      <li>With the others I would have new growth within 2 days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years on myself and friends with very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>If I had tried the other first I would never have done it again.</li>
      <li>Some waxes were hard to clean up if some fell off while applying.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on myself and friends with very sensitive skin</li>
<li> If I had tried the other first I would never have done it again.</li>
<li> Some waxes were hard to clean up if some fell off while applying.  </li>
<li> I use a candle warmer to melt it, I melted the large quantity and put it in a smaller metal vial from one of the small ones I had left.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s enough to last a very long time.  </li>
<li> All you need is a flat stick to apply, no cloths are needed for removal.</li>
<li> When I am about out of the smaller container, I just put the larger container on my candle warmer, melt it, and refill the small one.  </li>
<li> Until I saw this size on amazon, I had been special ordering the product in small (expensive) quantities at a local beauty supply store.</li>
<li> so heating would only take a few minutes.</li>
<li> Expected it to be messier than it was.</li>
<li> As with any wax, be careful not to overheat, as you will burn your skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s always frustrating when you find those little containers that only last a short time.  </li>
<li> Think it depends on the person using it, but found it painful for me to use, others may find it works fine for them....</li>
<li> It also left a hard residue in the tub which had to be scraped off.</li>
<li> Use near a sink though, because it does leave &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of wax behind as you are applying it.</li>
<li> You can turn the heat up to start melting the wax and then turn the heat down and stir the wax while it&#x27;s still somewhat lumpy</li>
<li> A little messy</li>
<li> Just buy a firm silicon spatula to spread on skin.</li>
<li> It is a bit messy though.</li>
<li> I am a messy person when waxing.</li>
<li> but this removes hair painlessly with very little residue.</li>
<li> I put a small amount in a small glass container</li>
<li> but it is HARD and takes along time to liquify for use.  </li>
<li> it is runny and then suddenly is hard and crackly.  </li>
<li> Like another person who reviewed this stated, was tired of buying small quantities.  </li>
<li> and it is the one product that doesn&#x27;t cause excess irritation, even on the thin skin below the eyebrows.</li>
<li> It also doesnt leave behind any sticky residue.</li>
<li> I always had to tweeze when using other waxes and that is time consuming not to mention painful.</li>
<li> Very painful and took a long time to peel off.</li>
<li> I think I used it wrong.</li>
<li> but I was wrong!</li>
<li> Useless!</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Horrible. I could not use it. Useless!</li>
    <li> Says no strips needed but when you read the instructions it requires strips that are not supplied could have saved the shipping and bought locally.</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this product by my hair dresser several years ago. When I moved away, she made sure that I had the name so that I could order and use it myself. Until I saw this size on amazon, I had been special ordering the product in small (expensive) quantities at a local beauty supply store. This product is so easy to use. You can buy tongue depressors at any pharmacy to use as applicators and heat it in the microwave for home use.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Just buy a firm silicon spatula to spread on skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years.  It&#x27;s always frustrating when you find those little containers that only last a short time.  I was delighted to get this from Amazon.  It&#x27;s enough to last a very long time.  They&#x27;ll be hearing from me again, but not for a while.</li>
    <li> This wax is wonderful for sensitive skin. As with any wax, be careful not to overheat, as you will burn your skin. Yes it does leave &#x27;strings&#x27; of wax.  I&#x27;ve used this for years on myself and friends with very sensitive skin and it is the one product that doesn&#x27;t cause excess irritation, even on the thin skin below the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> customers like this wax... no strips.  Like the size of  this container.  arrived in timely manner and well packaged.</li>
    <li> A little messy but this removes hair painlessly with very little residue. I put a small amount in a small glass container so heating would only take a few minutes. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Works great. I love that I did not need strips and I think it worked better than any other home wax I have tried. It is a bit messy though.</li>
    <li> Think it depends on the person using it, but found it painful for me to use, others may find it works fine for them....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed for 20 years, I thought I had tried most waxes but I was wrong! This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;You get the smoother waxing and it is simple to apply. Well, I am so impressed I&#x27;ve purchased more after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try you&#x27;ll be surprised and Happy Happy Happy !!!! It truly is no tweeze I have used salon  waxes, Zip and so on. I always had to tweeze when using other waxes and that is time consuming not to mention painful. But this wax is GREAT. Just follow directions and your good to go. Also, it has not even began to grow back in the 4 days since I&#x27;ve used it. With the others I would have new growth within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I think I used it wrong. My husband put it on his back to remove hair-- it did more than that, it tore skin too. Very painful and took a long time to peel off. It also left a hard residue in the tub which had to be scraped off. It smells like pine sap and adheres like glue, permanent glue. It&#x27;s in the garbage along wilt a wooden spoon which was stuck to it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love not having to use strips.</li>
    <li> No-Tweeze Hair Remover is the best I&#x27;ve found for facial hair. All you need is a flat stick to apply, no cloths are needed for removal. Just grab the wax and pull, you&#x27;re done. I use it with the Gigi Economy adjustable warmer. You can turn the heat up to start melting the wax and then turn the heat down and stir the wax while it&#x27;s still somewhat lumpy so it isn&#x27;t too hot. I tried a cheap flip the switch warmer which gives no control over how hot the wax gets and it takes a long time to melt the wax. I don&#x27;t like the microwavable waxes as the tubs get hot and if you&#x27;re not careful the hot wax can tip out onto your hand and floor.</li>
    <li> I have used this successfully for many years!  I just make sure that I order ahead.  I warm it on a low stove setting in about 1+ inches of water.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using wax at home. The product says you don&#x27;t need strips and you probably don&#x27;t, but I used them anyway. The wax worked great and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I could not use thus and I return it</li>
    <li> Works great- messy but does the job well.</li>
    <li> Effective, easy to apply but messy and stringy compared with other beeswaxes that I&#x27;ve used.  Also seems to stay hotter which makes the application slightly more difficult.  But it does the job and removes hair gently enough that I could reapply where  I missed some without any complaints from my skin.  After it cools it get hard as a brick but resoftens easily and fairly quickly.  Reheating doesn&#x27;t seem to degrade it but it becomes even stringier with each reheat.  It dries like peanut brittle (if you have ever made that or seen it made) it is runny and then suddenly is hard and crackly.  I think I prefer the Natural Wax products for their consistency and ease in application, but No Tweeze is a good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Wasnt sure if it was gonna work at first, but it works perfectly. You just warm it up, apply it, and it dries within seconds. Then you just pull it off. Gives really smooth results. Much better than sticky wax. It also doesnt leave behind any sticky residue. Will definitely be buying more when i run out!</li>
    <li> works good, but sadly not vegan. i wish i could find a vegan way to remove hair from the lip. this is driving me bonKErs.</li>
    <li> works better than other waxes i have used. shipment has been prompt.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..this is the only place I can get it.  Hope that never changes.</li>
    <li> So glad this was used for my first experience doing any type of waxing!  Awesome stuff! I also bought another brand and it never hardened up and left a residue. If I had tried the other first I would never have done it again.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking I would use it but it is HARD and takes along time to liquify for use.  I&#x27;ll just keep using a razor.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. First time I&#x27;ve ever used a hair removal product. Expected it to be messier than it was. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t require the cloth strips to remove it. Use near a sink though, because it does leave &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of wax behind as you are applying it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Like another person who reviewed this stated, was tired of buying small quantities.  Glad I found this large size.  I use a candle warmer to melt it, I melted the large quantity and put it in a smaller metal vial from one of the small ones I had left.  That makes it easier to melt what I need.  When I am about out of the smaller container, I just put the larger container on my candle warmer, melt it, and refill the small one.  That way the wax doesn&#x27;t get to hot.  It is easier to control the temperature in the smaller vial.  I also like the fact that this is an easy wax to clean up.  Some waxes were hard to clean up if some fell off while applying.  This one is an easy one to clean up, though I still put down parchment or wax paper cause I am a messy person when waxing.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my facial chin hairs.  I purchased the NoNo after trying this.</li>
