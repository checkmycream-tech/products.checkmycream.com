<li> Body Wash really helps with winter&#x27;s dry skin!  </li>
<li> The bottle is large, not easy to squeeze one-handed to apply product to the bath puff, especially in the shower when your hands and the bottle are wet.</li>
<li> As for the lotion itself, it does not suds up very much in my hard well water, and I don&#x27;t notice that it is helping my winter-dry skin very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used Dove for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> Purchased originally at the beginning of winter, and unable to find it since.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t get the feeling of dry itchy skin after showering with Dove that I get from using soap.</li>
<li> It is a limited edition product</li>
<li> If you have dry skin, or just want to keep your skin looking moist, any time of the year, then this is the soap for you!  </li>
<li> You will not use any other.</li>
<li> I use it year round for Winter skin and Summer for dry, sun kissed, skin.  </li>
<li> Price here on Amazon is alot less than stores.</li>
<li> Living in Florida dry skin from sun exposure is common.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel dried out.  </li>
<li> I started using Dove Winter Care and in just a few weeks</li>
<li> Tried this product hoping to keep my skin from drying out this past winter.  </li>
<li> The scent is subtle to the point ever my husband uses it, no lingering after scent at all.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s weird..</li>
<li> This wash keeps my skin from drying out during this cold weather.</li>
<li> I have have sensory processing disorder (I am hypersensitive to stimuli) and almost all body washes leave me with horrible sensations on my skin.</li>

    <li> So glad I bought the six pack, this stuff is amazing. I have no need for lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  I have not been able to find in stores, so I thought it had been discontinued.  I&#x27;m glad I found it.  This wash keeps my skin from drying out during this cold weather.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has skin problems such as Psoriasis etc. I have used many products, along with medications, injections to reduce my Psoriasis nothing was working. I started using Dove Winter Care and in just a few weeks my Psoriasis is gone. My skin is soft with no dry areas.. I highly recommend this product.. If you have never used this product you need to try it.. You will not use any other. Price here on Amazon is alot less than stores. Love it. I am saving 45.00 per injection which is 2 times a month, buy using Dove Winter Care.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash ever! Dove makes an amazing product, given I have eczema I need as much moisture as I can get and this is the only body wash I have had ( nutrium moisture)  where slathering on lotion isn&#x27;t completely necessary after a shower ( I still do it though out of habit). The scent is subtle to the point ever my husband uses it, no lingering after scent at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my dry skin. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it in summer since it works better for me than the summer care. I gave it 4 stars for price more than anything. Way cheap at Costco if you can find it.</li>
    <li> Dry skin much relieved with this. I almost don&#x27;t want to rate this so you don&#x27;t steal the last one!</li>
    <li> Living in Florida dry skin from sun exposure is common. Now I have a body wash that will help soften the &amp;#34;sun kisses&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
    <li> I just started to use Dove&#x27;s products and I can say that compared to the other product this particular one is great in term of providing that moisture that my skin need.&lt;br /&gt;But one thing I cannot get use to is the consistency...it&#x27;s weird..</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DOVE SCENTS GLAD I WAS ABLE TO GET SO MANY AT A TIME!! KUDOS!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first hit the shelves several years ago, it works and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body wash. It&#x27;s more or less a lotion in the form of a cleansing wash. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling great! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I could not find this in any of my local stores.  Purchased originally at the beginning of winter, and unable to find it since.  This has been the best wash for dry skin.  Hopefully Dove brings it back next winter.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, or just want to keep your skin looking moist, any time of the year, then this is the soap for you!  I use it year round for Winter skin and Summer for dry, sun kissed, skin.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The best wash I&#x27;ve ever used! Scent is awesome too. Hope formula becomes available all year long. That would be great.</li>
    <li> I like Dove products in general, and this product seems okay. Once you get it on your skin, that is. Packaging is VERY important in beauty and bath products, and this is a loser. The body wash is so thick it doesn&#x27;t squeeze out of the bottle easily. The bottle is large, not easy to squeeze one-handed to apply product to the bath puff, especially in the shower when your hands and the bottle are wet. As for the lotion itself, it does not suds up very much in my hard well water, and I don&#x27;t notice that it is helping my winter-dry skin very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Product is acceptable, but packaging issues cause annoyance, which is NOT a pampered \\&quot;I love this bath product\\&quot; feeling. At all.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel silky soft.  I don&#x27;t feel dried out.  I twish it were available in the stores year round.</li>
    <li> DOVE Winter Care Body Wash really helps with winter&#x27;s dry skin!  It is a limited edition product and I could no longer find it in my local stores.  You really should try it!</li>
    <li> I have have sensory processing disorder (I am hypersensitive to stimuli) and almost all body washes leave me with horrible sensations on my skin. This is the first body wash I&#x27;ve tried that I actually like after I am all died after a shower. I&#x27;ll be buying more at wally world next paydayand if they don&#x27;t have any left in stock I will be ordering this 6 pack. Perhaps we can petition Dove to make this a regular product and not just the special edition.</li>

    <li> This body wash really helped me a lot with dry skin and i love it. It&#x27;s almost like I have lotion on out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this body was as it softens and feels great especially during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Tried this product hoping to keep my skin from drying out this past winter.  Worked great and decided to order a small supply.</li>
