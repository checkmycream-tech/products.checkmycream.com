      <li>Perfect for normal skin never breakout after using this...</li>
      <li>Great coverage and helped tremendously with my acne and</li>
      <li>Not breaking out is still good, but it would be better if it did as advertised and cleared up the existing pimples. :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am in love with Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin Clearing Mineral Powder.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product and will order it again.  </li>
      <li>I also used my Revlon PhotoReady Liquid Makeup over the powder so that I had more coverage &amp; a glowing brown color to my face.</li>
      <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is really that good.</li>
      <li>The shade I purchased, Classic Ivory, looks perfect and natural (I am darker than porcelain and lighter than beige)</li>
      <li>I originally bought this because it was 1/4th the price</li>
      <li>Light but adequate coverage, and never looks strange/cakey on my face.</li>
      <li>It feels velvety smooth on my face, brushes on effortlessly, and is just the right texture (neither oily nor flaky)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>A nice full powder brush makes application fast and easy resulting in a natural look.</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t look quite as bright as with my usual brand of mineral powder, but it still looks healthy and the color of this powder blends well with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Looks lovely and causes no irritation to my skin, which is sensitive and acne-prone</li>
      <li>I have not had many breakouts since I began using the powder about a month ago, in combination with other healthy skin</li>
      <li>my normal mineral powder that I use primarily for SPF, and have to say I won&#x27;t be going back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also put a little more powder on top</li>
      <li>The item arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>No high perfumes and any blemishes are covered quite nicely.</li>
      <li>This powder works all day while I&#x27;m working, and covers my blemishes pretty well without looking &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; or unnatural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t cake and it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It also lasts pretty well into the day unless you&#x27;re sweating a lot.</li>
      <li>I m sure somebody else had a different experience with it.</li>
      <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this stuff is really great, I buy mine at my local wal-mart but all the same this stuff covers very well</li>
      <li>so my skin can be pretty with AND without makeup</li>
      <li>Offers light to moderate coverage, and builds easily</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I strongly suggest that you go to a store and actually look at these colors available, because they are waaaaay different than what shows up on my computer.</li>
      <li>It gives pretty decent coverage...</li>
      <li>Really worked for me as a powder to set my foundation and reduce shine</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and find this powder stays almost the whole day without needing a touch up.</li>
      <li>I am now using the lumene BB cream as my minimal every day foundation along with the night cream and LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>It does not get stuck in my pores (I have very large pores and makeup nearly always gets caked in there -</li>
      <li>I was skeptical to purchase this because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>This powder is loose and blends easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a higher end mineral foundation for several years, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about picking this up, however I&#x27;ve had a patch of acne and red marks that&#x27;s been persisting for nearly a year.</li>
      <li>The fact that it has salicylic acid in it is amazing; there was a huge sore zit on my forehead &amp; after wearing the powder for less than a day already it&#x27;s going down.</li>
      <li>If your face is REALLY oily this may work well for you, but otherwise you should steer clear of this product.</li>
      <li>it really does clear your skin</li>
      <li>When I first saw the commercial for a makeup that CLEARS UP YOUR PIMPLES, I thought my dream had finally come true.</li>
      <li>Love it so much I finally wear make-up every single day!</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I like the ease of application and the natural look that is produced by this product.  </li>
      <li>It actually clears up your skin fairly fast.</li>
      <li>I chose this Skin Clearing one because I wanted something that would not cause me to break out because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products, so I&#x27;ve slowly been converting to them over time.</li>
      <li>While the powder is ok, it did not last nearly as long as other powders.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really live up to its name and &amp;#34;skin clear&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse either, and covers fine.</li>
      <li>I ran to Target &amp; bought this product, curious to see how much coverage it could provide, given that I have a lot of post-acne marks on my face.</li>
      <li>I used this with the neutrogena face wash and toner - apparently they don&#x27;t work well together  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve had no new breakouts and the patch of red marks</li>
<li> Just a single application lasts me all</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too dark and too yellow for me to wear.</li>
<li> I wish the case was a little smaller because I carry in my purse - not a deal breaker.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what others are talking about when they claim this doesn&#x27;t set well, oxidizes, is too transparent, or is too yellow.</li>

<li> My face is hydrated and breaks out less.  </li>
<li> But when I put it on, my complexion looked dull, chalky and dry.</li>
<li> If I hadn&#x27;t seen it first, I would have purchased a color outrageously darker than the shade I really use.</li>
<li> It looks a little yellowish in the compact</li>
<li> It never feels heavy either.</li>
<li> I HEAVILY suggest buying this.</li>
<li> It also dried out my skin and made it flakey and then, since it is a powder, it accentuated the flakes on my face.  </li>
<li> I use if my face gets a little shiny!</li>
<li> I do not break out from this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin</li>
<li> This compact is difficult to use - to get into, and after a short while it fell apart.  </li>
<li> and I hardly ever have acne.</li>
<li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores if it gets late</li>
<li> I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> I hate having to reapply makeup.</li>
<li> I hate having blemishes.</li>
<li> It covers well, and prevents (for me, anyway) that awful shine that breaks through as the day wears on.</li>

    <li> I originally bought this because it was 1/4th the price my normal mineral powder that I use primarily for SPF, and have to say I won&#x27;t be going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what others are talking about when they claim this doesn&#x27;t set well, oxidizes, is too transparent, or is too yellow. It looks a little yellowish in the compact but it&#x27;s not at all upon application and I have very fair skin. I apply this in the morning and wear it until bedtime without any issue at all; rain, wind, or shine. Just a single application lasts me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores if it gets late and I happen to fall asleep in it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to purchase this because it seemed too good to be true. But honestly, I love it! My skin looks really good. I am buying this again!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the commercial for a makeup that CLEARS UP YOUR PIMPLES, I thought my dream had finally come true. I ran to Target &amp; bought this product, curious to see how much coverage it could provide, given that I have a lot of post-acne marks on my face. The fact that it has salicylic acid in it is amazing; there was a huge sore zit on my forehead &amp; after wearing the powder for less than a day already it&#x27;s going down. But when I put it on, my complexion looked dull, chalky and dry. I also used my Revlon PhotoReady Liquid Makeup over the powder so that I had more coverage &amp; a glowing brown color to my face. I also put a little more powder on top so I didn&#x27;t look so shiny. But I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using the two together so my skin can be pretty with AND without makeup :) Go Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this product. The color is completely different from the picture. It&#x27;s too dark and too yellow for me to wear.</li>
    <li> It actually clears up your skin fairly fast. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 16 (I&#x27;m 21 now) and I hardly ever have acne. When I do its either around my period or I forget to use this. I can even wear it to bed. I HEAVILY suggest buying this. Once you try it you won&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup! I keep it in my purse and put it on when my skin starts to get oily. I chose this Skin Clearing one because I wanted something that would not cause me to break out because I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t cake and it goes on smoothly. I do not break out from this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Clearing\\&quot;. Anyways, if you want a makeup that looks great on you and doesn&#x27;t make you break out, buy this one!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it has acne medicine in it.  It goes on evenly and gives a nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> I wish the case was a little smaller because I carry in my purse - not a deal breaker.  The products is good.  I use if my face gets a little shiny!</li>
    <li> Really worked for me as a powder to set my foundation and reduce shine</li>
    <li> I came across this while browsing the makeup aisle with my sister in law. I&#x27;ve used a higher end mineral foundation for several years, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about picking this up, however I&#x27;ve had a patch of acne and red marks that&#x27;s been persisting for nearly a year. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;ve had no new breakouts and the patch of red marks is fading a bit. It gives pretty decent coverage...I&#x27;d say medium coverage. My face doesn&#x27;t look quite as bright as with my usual brand of mineral powder, but it still looks healthy and the color of this powder blends well with my skin tone. It also lasts pretty well into the day unless you&#x27;re sweating a lot. I have oily skin and find this powder stays almost the whole day without needing a touch up.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of application and the natural look that is produced by this product.  No high perfumes and any blemishes are covered quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Love it so much I finally wear make-up every single day! Great coverage and helped tremendously with my acne and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am extremely oily an the color after about 4 hrs turns a bit orange even though I ordered Ivory. But I just swipe it off with a makeup cloth and redo it. Simple. I even set it up for auto delivery!!</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products, so I&#x27;ve slowly been converting to them over time. This powder is great! Light but adequate coverage, and never looks strange/cakey on my face. It never feels heavy either. A little pricey, but highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this stuff is really great, I buy mine at my local wal-mart but all the same this stuff covers very well and if you use it a lot along with a face wash it really does clear your skin pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had problem skin so when this was a great thing for me!</li>
    <li> This compact is difficult to use - to get into, and after a short while it fell apart.  While the powder is ok, it did not last nearly as long as other powders.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. I have a very sensitive skin. This powder acctually  broke me out. I m sure somebody else had a different experience with it.The item arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very effective in keeping spots at bay.  It blended with the skin and did not irritate.</li>
    <li> I am in love with Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin Clearing Mineral Powder.&lt;br /&gt;- I have not had many breakouts since I began using the powder about a month ago, in combination with other healthy skin habits.&lt;br /&gt;- It feels velvety smooth on my face, brushes on effortlessly, and is just the right texture (neither oily nor flaky)&lt;br /&gt;- It does not get stuck in my pores (I have very large pores and makeup nearly always gets caked in there - no way!)&lt;br /&gt;- Looks lovely and causes no irritation to my skin, which is sensitive and acne-prone&lt;br /&gt;- Offers light to moderate coverage, and builds easily&lt;br /&gt;- The shade I purchased, Classic Ivory, looks perfect and natural (I am darker than porcelain and lighter than beige)</li>
    <li> If your face is REALLY oily this may work well for you, but otherwise you should steer clear of this product. I used this with the neutrogena face wash and toner - apparently they don&#x27;t work well together  The powder just sat on my skin, not blending. It kinda looked like I smeared tinted flour on my face.  It also dried out my skin and made it flakey and then, since it is a powder, it accentuated the flakes on my face.  This has never happened to me before.  I may use it to dab on areas where I&#x27;m breaking out..  I am now using the lumene BB cream as my minimal every day foundation along with the night cream and LOVE it.  My face is hydrated and breaks out less.  http://www.amazon.com/Lumene-Vitamin-Illuminating-Anti-Age-01/dp/B00AI0ULLU/ Walgreens also carries their products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this powder. I would not buy this again. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it. lol</li>
    <li> Toxic:Concern cancer: ingredients: RETINYL ACETATE (VITAMIN A ACETATE) and DIAZOLIDINYL UREA (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER)</li>
    <li> Perfect for normal skin never breakout after using this... I hav a lot of acne and of any others powders my skin breakout but never from this powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always on the moisturizer</li>
    <li> This powder is loose and blends easily. A nice full powder brush makes application fast and easy resulting in a natural look.</li>
    <li> I hate having to reapply makeup. I hate having blemishes. This powder works all day while I&#x27;m working, and covers my blemishes pretty well without looking &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; or unnatural. I love it.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really live up to its name and &amp;#34;skin clear&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse either, and covers fine.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will order it again.  It is easier to order from Amazon then it is to find it in stores.  It is really that good.</li>
    <li> Not breaking out is still good, but it would be better if it did as advertised and cleared up the existing pimples. :)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena SkinClearing Mineral Powder is an excellent product. It covers well, and prevents (for me, anyway) that awful shine that breaks through as the day wears on. It also reduces break-outs rather than cause them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I strongly suggest that you go to a store and actually look at these colors available, because they are waaaaay different than what shows up on my computer. If I hadn&#x27;t seen it first, I would have purchased a color outrageously darker than the shade I really use.</li>
