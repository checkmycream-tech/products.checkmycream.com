<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Smells so good. This is just a tester size, on the way to get a full bottle from my local store.</li>
    <li> Wife love the smell !!</li>
    <li> Did not expect it to be so small. ...</li>
    <li> Great perfume! I was hoping for a little bigger for the price though.</li>
    <li> Very little in quantity. I have been using this product and have bought bigger quantity bottle in the past for almost the same price. I love the product and have nothing against the quality.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this perfume.</li>
    <li> Toxifying .... in a GREAT way!&lt;br /&gt;The miniature bottle is adorable and a keepsake.  Of course, the scent was not compromised</li>
    <li> Love the sent of this Little Miniature for Women!  It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t get in my way ~ just a nice clean sent for any female, young or old.</li>
    <li> first time trying it smells heavenly i will purchase more</li>
    <li> Came in great condition. It was a gift for my grandmother and she loves it. The smell is not florally but still sweet and fresh! A great perfume for someones whose taste you don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Yum yum yum -- does it ever smell so beautiful and the container it is in -- that too is lovely.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for 2 years for a new fragrance since Bill Blass Classic was discontinued. This is one of the few fragrances I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t turn on me. Its floral with a seriousness about it that is perfect. Will be buying the big bottle. Thanks for selling the small ones to try it out.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite worth the price for such a small amount. I&#x27;ve had cheaper perfumes whose smell I preferred. But to each their own. Does smell really nice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice enough but too much like all the other mainstream scents. Not my scent of choice but smells good enough.</li>
    <li> Nice clean sent and is not overpowering. Very nice spring, summertime fresh smell and it last for most of the day. Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Fake perfume. If I say fake then it&#x27;s fake. Something is definitely added to this perfume was very disappointed. Plz don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Bright Crystal and get complimented everywhere I go when wearing this scent.  I would highly recommend this parfum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bathe in this stuff, if I could afford it.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case.  Sometimes, life just sucks.  Darn.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the bottle is big enough to last. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Terrible buy ! I shoulda never wasted my money ! I don&#x27;t like how it smells at all for it to be Versace perfume! It smells like granny perfume and it literally small like very very tiny probably get 3 wears out of it . like a lil sample. Save your money you guys</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, just the size I wanted. came almost by return mail.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It smelled very good but didn’t last at all. I felt like maybe it was diluted and that is why the smell didn’t last. Other than that, it has a nice scent to it and could be worn during the summer or winter months. Size is good for traveling.</li>
    <li> i honestly think everything is great about this product but personally the smell is not that good. it smells very perfumish.. like when you walk into macys and all you smell is lots of perfume, thats what im talking about. but great product!</li>
    <li> Fade away too fast about an hour</li>
    <li> Not strong very soft nag grows stronger in a nice way leaves a nice scent behind youi have  surprised myself re entered a room and was asking what perfumes that I want it. It was this one I was already wearing it it does not fade no need to reapply stays a long time</li>
    <li> Prompt Delivery, wrapping great a definitly wonderful way for me to send presents to my family Stateside when I am out of country for birthdays or holidays</li>
    <li> I LOE THE SMELL BUT WHEN I GOT IT I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT SMALL.BUT ITS THE NAME YOU PAY FOR.SMELLS GREAT LOVE IT THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too soft in smell. it&#x27;s ok but not for me. The color is nice, and beautiful. good</li>
    <li> Smells great! A small bottle but for the price its great.</li>
    <li> THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT PERFUME, I CAN NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT.</li>
    <li> This product is just lovely.  The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need very much.  I originally &amp;#34;smelled&amp;#34; it on one of those tear-out papers in a magazine and thought it had a nice, light fragrance and I was not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> I got one for my wife. I love smelling this on her...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. A little too sweet and strong for me at first, but after a little time it calms down to a nice floral</li>
    <li> The only complain I have is that it&#x27;s super small but I did get the smallest bottle I could find so I could try it out and decide whether or not I like it. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I got this for a dumb bitch and regret it.</li>
    <li> Love it. So fresh smelling too.my sister in law told me to get it, she lover&#x27;s it too .Quick delivery.thank you so much</li>
    <li> I bought this for her for Christmas, It was the cutest little bottle ever and she loves the Perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;It came just as promised and smells delicious!!</li>
    <li> This purchase was a gift for my niece! Who is very modern or retro ! She works all the time. The name in itself made her smile !  Thanks !!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Soft and feminine.  Good for both day or night.  Tried to see if see I like it enough to purchase the larger size---will be purchasing :0  Also love to collect mini&#x27;s to sit on display on my dresser :0  Thank you for a great fragrance and deal!</li>
    <li> The bottle was smaller then I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last on this at all but smell good for lil while</li>
    <li> Love this scent so much, light, floral and pretty</li>
    <li> Love the mini size.  I had never smelled this fragrance so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money to try it out.  It is not overpowering and it still smells great after several hours.  Hints of jasmine.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have once smelled a tester for Bright Crystal (Versace) &amp; it was a wonderfully unique smell. I fell in love with this scent &amp; would definitely recommend this perfume to my sister Elida Perez.</li>
    <li> This is perfect when yo are not looking for an overwhelming scent. I couldn&#x27;t smell it after half a day. But my family members could and provided their approval as well.</li>
    <li> It was a great price. My wife loved it! and thought it cost alot more than it did. I&#x27;m  very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great smell. I think I will buy the bigger bottle, but this has plenty of uses for the price. a</li>
    <li> one of better ones i have gotten and it was hard to find a good one, most brands i have tried so far sucked so bad maybe they we&#x27;re stale though?</li>
    <li> the smell is very clean , light and yummy .At the same time it is different (in a good way) than other light perfumes. I get a headache from  most of them. This one is good so far. The packaging was perfect- completely sealed, so I knew no one had opened  it before. It is a good buy .</li>
    <li> This was a great way to try a new fragrance.  I was not disappointed.  I am ordering more for gifts and for my daughter.  Just the right size for travel also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent and ended up giving it to my granddaughter.(</li>
    <li> This is so deceiving! Not what the actual bottle looks like. It is pretty much a sample product that you will waste $10 plus dollars on thinking you are getting a good deal. DO NOT BE DECEIVED!.</li>
    <li> I do love this however it&#x27;s a little off for me and I order a small bottle just to try it it wasn&#x27;t really worth the money for me! :( kinda disappointed! Great product just not for me!</li>
    <li> I love nice smelling perfume, and this is one of my favorite, I only bought the small bottle because I didn&#x27;t know what it smelled like so to be safe I decided to buy the small bottle and I love it. So now I can buy a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this and it seems like she&#x27;s loving it so I assumes it is a good product and it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> Came on time love the smell</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something ne win the fragrance department for a while.  I think I have found the one I want!  Nice, feminine, but not too sweet.</li>
    <li> a co-worker came in with this on and I just couldn&#x27;t resist buying it and it is wonderful, try it - very light yet wonderful.</li>
    <li> Like it. The smell is soft. Excellent product. Women who like soft smell should buy this product .love it. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell great price!</li>
    <li> I loved the soft scent and it lasts a long time!! I will be purchasing it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> The bottle size is tiny and didn&#x27;t smell at all: reminded me pink body mist.i would rather pay more at Macy&#x27;s and get original product</li>
    <li> i want a bigger one now im in love with this smell and you should get this if you want try the smell but highly recommend the big bottle fast shipping</li>
    <li> Is practice, is lovely, is delicate my opinion is this item, is very adorable, perfect for the hands and of Paquette</li>
    <li> I purchased the miniature so I could try it out before spending a lot on something I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  I LOVE this perfume!  It has a very clean, feminine scent that lasts on my skin.  I know several reviewers said it didn&#x27;t last long, but that really depends on the person.  For me it is great!  I will definitely be ordering a full size bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I love it and it smells absolutely lovely!!</li>
    <li> great for the price, love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is some long lasting stuff. Just a few drops will last me all day. Very good buy if you don&#x27;t want to shell out big bucks.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> Very miniature, but so very cute too. Smells awesome. Packaging could have been a little better. But it is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased several small sized fragrances for a gift for someone who does a lot of airline travel.  It is a lovely fragrance as well .</li>
    <li> I thought it was fine and I&#x27;m really glad I only got the miniature model. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me and kind of smells like glorified soap. But if you like something, just get it!</li>
    <li> Purfume &#x3D; Amazing&lt;br /&gt;Purchase regular size as a dept. store though.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchases</li>
    <li> it took so long that i  thought i would never get the product. but finally i got it and im very satisfied with the perfume.  tanks very much. u guys helped a lot sending all the information i needed in order to track my perfume.</li>
