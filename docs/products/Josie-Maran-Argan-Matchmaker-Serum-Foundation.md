      <li>I really think they need to work on the formula to have it match better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer...and the price is high for what it does...</li>

      <li>Blends right into your skin colour.  </li>
      <li>Even though this product is pretty pricey, I had some Discover points and used those to cover a portion of the cost, and it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>It is so natural looking and feels so light on...</li>
      <li>It really does work!  </li>
      <li>If you are nomally light but are tan, still use light as it will adjust to the darker tan pigment for as long as you are tan.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>Let me warn you though, at first I broke out for about a week</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>I use one pump first and apply a dot on each of my cheeks, nose, forehead and chin and blend it out with my brush, then I take another pump on the back of my hand, dip the brush in the foundation then dab and blend it on any areas that need more coverage.</li>
      <li>I am using it with a light dusting of bare minerals over it.</li>
      <li>it was still too dark and kind of orange.</li>
      <li>I have an issue with my skin that causes it to get flushed in certain areas.  </li>
      <li>I always have another ready to go, it makes that much difference.</li>
      <li>(I really didn&#x27;t feel the need for a finishing powder) and I was sold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely sold on any skin care products with Argon oil.  </li>
      <li>put a dab on the back of my hand and use the Sephora airbrush pro brush to lightly coat it on my face.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>How it goes on white and instantly transforms into a color to match your own is mind boggling</li>
      <li>The color adapts to mine better than any other makeup brand whether I have a tan or not.</li>
      <li>This little bottle is pretty spectacular, however: a very tiny drop goes a long way, and I love watching it change color to match my skin.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a natural look of real skin.</li>
      <li>well worth the extra.</li>
      <li>You can change your color from season to season as needed, hopefully she will make a few more shades.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried and be loyal to several major brand foundations.</li>
      <li>When I first put this on, it looked a little too dark, but when I looked in the mirror a few seconds later, the color was perfect!  </li>
      <li>Not heavy do not have to use alot.</li>
      <li>so natural.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised that it came out of the pump</li>
      <li>Blends well and easy - not at all thick.</li>
      <li>I could not wear bare minerals very often and usually reserved using it for special occasions because it would dry out my face and cause break outs.</li>
      <li>Generally I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>I had been using Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>I can compare this product with bare minerals which I have been using on and off for a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>I am 48 and have adult acne and have been using mineral powder makeup for years as it is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
      <li>I have found that my skin (even right now in the dead of winter) is softer and doesn&#x27;t flake anymore.  </li>
      <li>Bare minerals helped, but finally while making a purchase at a makeup store I was given a sample of this Matchmaker Serum.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few months, so I&#x27;m interested to see how well it works this summer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing!  How it goes on white and instantly transforms into a color to match your own is mind boggling but it does!  The color and coverage is sheer perfection.  It feels healthy and lightweight while covering all flaws.  It does not clog pores or accentuate age lines either.  My skin just drank this in.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get this I guarantee it.  It is the one foundation that i s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It really does work!  When I first put this on, it looked a little too dark, but when I looked in the mirror a few seconds later, the color was perfect!  Another bonus: it does not get too greasy/oily or cake up and turn dry. The finish is light but just wonderful for the heat and humidity of Kansas.  I am very glad I bought it, even though it is more than I would usually spend on foundation.  Using a foundation brush makes it go on even smoother, and you use a lot less.  I use light/medium on my pink-tinted, medium skin, and it works well.</li>
    <li> This product is perfection! I am 48 and have adult acne and have been using mineral powder makeup for years as it is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Over time I have found it to begin to settle in my fine lines so I have been looking for something liquid that isn&#x27;t matte but doesn&#x27;t make me break out. This is it...makes the skin glowy and takes years off! Let me warn you though, at first I broke out for about a week and then it stopped...now I use this every day and my skin never looked better and blemishes, even old ones, have healed. If you are unsure of color order down a color...DO NOT ORDER DARKER or it will look orange on your skin. If you are nomally light but are tan, still use light as it will adjust to the darker tan pigment for as long as you are tan. The argan oil not only heals but moisturizes and makes the skin look amazing.The only bad thing I have to say about this stuff is that I wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> ...nor does it provide any type of coverage  What a complete waste of $$.  Sephora is giving me the hardest time in returning this item as well.  I wish I&#x27;d never hear of Josie Maran and her crappy overpriced cosmetics!</li>
    <li> The product was fine. I buy many things from amazon because it is easy. In this case I was required to sign when it was delivered which meant I had to make a trip to the post office when they were open which defeated the purpose of buying it fron amazon.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and got the lightest version yet it was still too dark and kind of orange. I was disappointed that I spent a good Mount of money on it.</li>
    <li> You know what your face looks like with just your SPF product on?  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;ll look like after you apply this disappearing stuff....except that you will have every line and crevice in your skin highlighted in beige.  And that&#x27;s much worse than having a naked face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No color.  Slightly shiny.  And you pay big money for that privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down!</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim at Sephora.  I wasn&#x27;t wearing any foundation and I put some on just to see how it worked.  It was strange that it came out white.  Anyway, I put it on and forgot about it.    By the time I got home a couple of hours later, it was really amazing looking.  Very smooth and stayed on even during a really hot day.    You really must try it before you buy, because the color choices are limiting, but I must admit it is my very favorite now.    [...]</li>
    <li> Works really well! Blends right into your skin colour.  Adds a brightness without all of the makeup.  Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine on You Tube recommended this foundation to me so I went to a well known beauty store yesterday to try it out. I have medium skin with cool undertones. I applied the Light/Medium, which is described for skin with more olive to yellow undertones, I thought it would end up looking terrible. I was so surprised that it came out of the pump stark white and as I blended it in, it matched my skin tone exactly! It also gave nice buildable medium coverage, felt very nice on my face (I really didn&#x27;t feel the need for a finishing powder) and I was sold. You only need one pump to cover your entire face and its best applied with your hands or a foundation brush from the top of your hand. I am a faithful user of the Argan Oil now I look forward to trying her other products! You can change your color from season to season as needed, hopefully she will make a few more shades. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Great product, but I can&#x27;t figure out for the life of my how Amazon is charging $63. Josie Maran&#x27;s site and Sephora both only charge $42. A $21 markup seems excessive to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, easy to use, looks great. Don&#x27;t buy from here.</li>
    <li> I like to wear mineral or powder foundations for my oily skin however with the changing seasons it is hard to buy a bunch of different shades so when I saw this I decided to give it a try. I am so impressed with this formula. I use a foundation brush to apply as it is the perfect tool for achieving a natural finish. The light/medium shade is perfect for me and it is truly magic how it just blends in without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all yet it covers. It evens out my skin tone and blurs out any of my flaws. I use one pump first and apply a dot on each of my cheeks, nose, forehead and chin and blend it out with my brush, then I take another pump on the back of my hand, dip the brush in the foundation then dab and blend it on any areas that need more coverage. It leaves a natural look of real skin.</li>
    <li> A great product to use while I&#x27;m waiting for them to come out again with the argan daily moisturizer tinted lotion with SPF 40</li>
    <li> Generally I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup.  This little bottle is pretty spectacular, however: a very tiny drop goes a long way, and I love watching it change color to match my skin.  How does it do that?  It blends in with the various shades of my face, and covers my age spots.  It&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, really I did.  It did not match at all.  I tried using a foundation brush, I tried sponges, I tried just using my hands.  It ended up looking orange every time.  I really think they need to work on the formula to have it match better.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I have used.  It covers without looking like a masque.  The color adapts to mine better than any other makeup brand whether I have a tan or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!  I have not been able to wear make up with out some irritation.  This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all and in fact, it has improved the texture.  I can compare this product with bare minerals which I have been using on and off for a couple of years.  I could not wear bare minerals very often and usually reserved using it for special occasions because it would dry out my face and cause break outs.</li>
    <li> This is very light on my skin.  Would use it again. Blends well and easy - not at all thick.</li>
    <li> I really love this make-up. I had been looking for a natural light base and this one fit. It is so natural looking and feels so light on...so natural. It was a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Not heavy do not have to use alot. Little bit goes a long way. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Matches nicely to my complexion.  Lightweight on skin and leaves a smooth finish.  Goes on better if makeup primer is used.</li>
    <li> No matter what I tried, or how expensive it was, at age 61, I had the dreaded \\&quot;big pores\\&quot; on my forehead, nose and chin. You could count them!!! Bare minerals helped, but finally while making a purchase at a makeup store I was given a sample of this Matchmaker Serum. I tried it and could not believe it blended over my pores, lasting from morning to night!! I love it. If you try it and it turns orangey, you have too dark a shade!! Light/medium is perfect for me. I am using it with a light dusting of bare minerals over it. Love, love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely sold on any skin care products with Argon oil.  It is truly nature&#x27;s miracle. The makeup blends so well with your skin tone and the coverage is superior. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth the extra.</li>
    <li> I have used this foundation for a while and love it.  It lasts for quite a while and although it goes on white, it turns to the shade of your skin tone.  Best applied with the brush  that comes with it at QVC.</li>
    <li> This foundation was totally disappointing with hardly any coverage. It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer...and the price is high for what it does...nothing! I do like the Argon oil...</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried and be loyal to several major brand foundations. I discovered this product about a year ago and it has made a difference in not only my skin but the way powder, shadow, etc go on. It lays a wonderful, light foundation and keeps your skin moist throughout the day. I always have another ready to go, it makes that much difference.</li>
    <li> I went into Sephora to get some advice for my rosacea skin. I had been using Bare Minerals but my rosacea makes my skin incredibly dry and the powder was just not doing my dry skin any favors at all. So, my beauty advisor recommended Josie Maran&#x27;s matchmaker serum and thank goodness! I feel like I&#x27;ve died and gone to foundation heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a dab on the back of my hand and use the Sephora airbrush pro brush to lightly coat it on my face. It covers all my redness and the argan oil moisturizes my skin without clogging my pores!</li>
    <li> This product was reccomended to me by my hair dresser.  I have very dry skin and even though I use moisturizer, by the evening the skin on my face is flaking again.  Even though this product is pretty pricey, I had some Discover points and used those to cover a portion of the cost, and it was worth it.  I have found that my skin (even right now in the dead of winter) is softer and doesn&#x27;t flake anymore.  I also think it works well with changing to my skin tone and good coverage.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few months, so I&#x27;m interested to see how well it works this summer.  Wishing it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, and hoping I can continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have an issue with my skin that causes it to get flushed in certain areas.  This foundation covers without being cakey. It is very light and very little is needed for great  coverage.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, a bit to light.</li>
</ol>
