<li> Her hair is very unruley in the morning and this stuff gets it wet enough without making it crispy.</li>
<li> This is the only stuff that really works to tame my sons hair with his cowlicks and unruliness.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried several other gels and sprays that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
<li> My daughter has very fine hair and every morning no matter what we do the night before she always wakes with up crazy hair.</li>
<li> Some of the other similar products we used ended up having the pump clog, but these have never done that.  </li>
<li> My son has some serious bed head in the morning, and this really controls it.</li>
<li> Dries to look like dry hair - no gel look to it, doesn&#x27;t stay looking wet.</li>
<li> I felt this left the hair a little oily.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to many parents at my kids&#x27; school who have children with bad bedhead too.</li>
<li> My son has horrible bed head in the morning and this stuff works great to tame it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky or stiff.  </li>
<li> I can always tell when he has it in his hair, though - his hair doesn&#x27;t look like he just got out of the bath but doesn&#x27;t exactly look dirty, either.  </li>
<li> Leave in conditioners and detangling sprays are too heavy for her hair and weigh it down.</li>
<li> We couldn&#x27;t find this spray in our local stores and it&#x27;s the only thing that helps my 7 year old son tame his thick crazy bed head in the morning!</li>
<li> did a few rounds with Don King.  </li>
<li> My son uses it at least once a day with no complaints.</li>
<li> It is getting hard to find in stores, so thank you Amazon!</li>
<li> My son always uses this to tame his crazy hair in the morning, but about a year ago</li>
<li> I am so sad I cannot find this in store anywhere.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Suave has discontinued making it.</li>
<li> So sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
<li> Hate it has been discontinued.  </li>
<li> My boys HATE hair products...</li>
<li> I hate that they quit selling the Suave kids</li>

    <li> I have a very blond curly haired child. Her hair is very unruley in the morning and this stuff gets it wet enough without making it crispy. All I have to do is spray it and use a finger to curl it. This is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve bought.  It lasted about a year for me - with using it once a day about 4 days a week.</li>
    <li> I love using this in my sons fine, stick straight hair!! Bed head is a constant battle in the morning for us. A few quick squirts of &amp;#34;Monkey Spray&amp;#34; tames his mane better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. This spray leaves his hair soft, shiny, and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Spray brush and go...... Perfect before school.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for parents in a hurry with boys with bed head.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff for quickly taming my son&#x27;s hair every morning.  He loves the orange (non-girly) smell.  Unfortunately, Suave has discontinued making it.</li>

    <li> Bought this at B &amp; M store a while back and it really worked well for my 5 year old.  My DD has a lot of very fine hair which mats up in the back at night. Leave in conditioners and detangling sprays are too heavy for her hair and weigh it down. This product leaves her hair shiny, silky, and smelling great without making it limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no longer available at any of my local stores so I am very appreciative it is still offered on Amazon!</li>

This is a great product.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky or stiff.  The smell is not overpowering at all.  Some of the other similar products we used ended up having the pump clog, but these have never done that.  Great price for the pack.  I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> This works great for my son&#x27;s bed head!</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any store.  I have 3 toddler boys and this works THE BEST on their cowlicks without being sticky or messy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My son has horrible bed head in the morning and this stuff works great to tame it.  I spray his hair before school in the morning and run a brush through it.  The hair sticking up lays down easily and it dries clean.  There is no residue left and his hair doesn&#x27;t feel stickily or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to many parents at my kids&#x27; school who have children with bad bedhead too.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff works!  My son would wake up looking like did a few rounds with Don King.  This stuff detangled and smoothed out the frizz no problem. Dries to look like dry hair - no gel look to it, doesn&#x27;t stay looking wet. I can always tell when he has it in his hair, though - his hair doesn&#x27;t look like he just got out of the bath but doesn&#x27;t exactly look dirty, either.  Smells good. Used up these 3 bottles and have bought more. Thinking of using it on my own hair to see if it gets rid of mommy-bed-head!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that really works to tame my sons hair with his cowlicks and unruliness. I&#x27;ve tried several other gels and sprays that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  I hate that they quit selling the Suave kids Morning Hair Tamer in the store.  It works great and so I buy it here since this is the only place I can find it.  Thank goodness it is available somewhere.  Everyone that likes this should call the company (Unilever/Suave) and tell them to start manufacturing and selling it again.  I did and if enough people did this, they might sell it again! The # is 1-800-782-8301.  Do it right now while you&#x27;re thinking about it. :)</li>
    <li> Ends morning bedhead for my grandson.</li>
