      <li>Great product but be prepared for the smell.</li>

      <li>This product is superior.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a good smell, like grilling in the woods.</li>
      <li>I imagine it would be good for repelling insects (or people) but I would not want to wash my body with this soap.</li>
      <li>think it really is good for your skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When a friend recommended it I laughed, I&#x27;m not laughing now.</li>

      <li>was good for it and bought it on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a damn good soap, 2.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels SO good and not itchy.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goals soap but smells like a camp fire.  Manly</li>
    <li> I have patchy inflamed skin and after the first few uses my skin has calmed down a lot. Hopefully it will help clear up my skin totally.</li>
    <li> This soap literally smells like beef jerky... but honestly when you need major skin relief, you aren&#x27;t going to care what the product smells like as long as it gets the job done! During my pregnancy I broke out in hives everywhere! More specifically, I had the PUPPS rash. And if you are pregnant/lactating, it&#x27;s not exactly safe to be taking steroids to prevent the intense itching and rash. After a few days of suffering, I came across this product and thought it was worth a shot. I was very skeptical, since I had used camomile lotions, Aveeno oatmeal creams, and a whole array of other products with no relief. However, after using this in the shower one or two times, I noticed a dramatic decrease in the intensity of my rash. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from the same conditions... hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and I got this soap because I heard it works for acne.  The smell is bad but after a couple of uses it hardly seems noticeable.  I used this twice a day and I have seen an improvement. I have only been using this for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps (4.25 Ounces) at a going out of business sale.  I thought I was getting a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [blank].  I had to toss all of them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing soap. Bought to use to help with puppps rash i developed during pregnancy and it cleared it up within a week! Smells like a camp fire but who cares if it clears up the terrible rash!</li>
    <li> This product came up in my search for natural ringworm treatment so I decided to give it another try.  It didn&#x27;t take long to get used to the strong scent and it cleared up the fungal infection.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on the cats yet...  ;) I gave this one a fair shot, despite the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad, just strong and weird.  Within two minutes after taking it out of the box, it permeated the entire bathroom.  I used it anyway and, honestly, I was a bit glad that it leaves my skin very dry.  Tried it for shampoo too, same result.</li>
    <li> The soap smells like you walked into the forest while it was burning down and then you went back again to roll around in the ashes! It is however the BEST product that I have ever found for my psoriasis! I have had this condition for over 20 years and this soap REALLY does bring relief for dry, itchy, scaling skin. Thanks, Grandpa.</li>
    <li> best soap i have ever used for heavy grease removal on your hands</li>
    <li> Smells like you are burning pines in the woods.  Works bell, lathers ok.  But bar melts to fast at $4.00, it is not a soap that last a long time</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.  I don&#x27;t like getting out of the bath smelling like I was sitting by a smokey campfire. My 6 year old daughter calls it the yucky soap lol.  It didn&#x27;t last long either.  However, I will give it four stars because my husband absolutely fell in love with it.  I would say it is definitely more for the masculine side.  He also washed his hair with it and I have to say it was the fullest and softest I have ever seen his hair.  The few times I used it, I have to admit my skin felt cleaner, tighter and smoother compared to other soaps.</li>
    <li> Grandpa&#x27;s has been around since 1876 and some things I guess are just too good to change. This is a soap that gets you clean without all the perfumes you find in todays soaps. It even makes a great shampoo. Try a bar and you will never settle for any other soap in the shower.</li>
    <li> This soap does it all for me. I use it for shampooing, shaving, and bathing. It&#x27;s a black soap that produces a rich white lather. Go figure.</li>
    <li> We got a few bars from an \\&quot;Old Timey\\&quot; general store while vacationing when I was a kid. I remember keeping the boxes because they never lost their pine tar smell. This stuff is great, just like it was 15 years ago: it has an odor like nothing else (I&#x27;ll bet the Brawny paper towel guy smells like pine tar soap), but it doesn&#x27;t leave an overpowering scent on your skin (if you&#x27;re a girl who might not want to smell like a spill-soaking lumberjack). Love love love it.</li>
    <li> i read the very positive reviews about this, about how it helped with acne n was good for dry skin n stuff... well, i bought it based on these reviews and i was unpleasantly surprised by the results. i dont have much acne on my face, and my skins not really that dry, but i figured id try this out. well, this is the driest my face has been in years; it itches and peals a little, its become so dry, all because of this soap. and i stopped using the soap on my face 2 days ago, too, but its still dry -- my diet hasnt change, nothing else has changed. on my body, i had no adverse affects, but i had no positive ones either -- no better than regular soap which you can get for way cheaper. one bar of this stuff is like seven bucks with shipping (shipping was four bucks for me). also, this soap smells like burnt rubber at first whiff. no joke, it really does -- literally. fortunately, the scent doesnt last on you after youve used it; though itd be nice to smell good and clean after a shower like other soaps leave you. anyway, i will never buy this soap again, and i will not recommend it to anyone, ever. i feel as though ive been bamboozled by these reviews. the skin on my face is furious!</li>
    <li> This product, Grandpa Soap Pine Tar is clearing up my son&#x27;s acne!  It was recommended by a friend that happens to be a doctor for it is what he used when he was kid...thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought for my bf. He loves it. I hate the smell.</li>
    <li> The soap is interesting, it smells medical and cleans well. What else can you say about soap.</li>
    <li> After only 3 times of using it, my itchy rash due to pregnancy is almost gone.  Now, I have always suffered from eczema, so, pregnancy has made it worse.  I wish I had known about this soap many years ago.  This is definetely a keeper, and for me is a blessing to have found it, it relieves the itch so very much and my dry skin loves it, with cool or cold water, let the foam sit for a few minutes and then rinse, you will feel like new :).</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help out with some psoriasis. Most natural fragrances are more earthy than the overly sweet, strong artificial ones we&#x27;re used to, so I expected it to be a muted stink. Wow, was I ever wrong! This stuff smells like camp fire, but not the pleasant woodsy variety. It&#x27;s that pungent, man-just-home-from-camping-trip smell... the kind that still lingers on your coat a year later. It fills up the bathroom &amp; hallway and lingers on one&#x27;s person. For someone whose sense of smell has been dampened by injury or years, it&#x27;s probably not a big deal, but for the mom whose bionic nose never disappeared after pregnancy, it&#x27;s like being beaten in the face repeatedly all day long. Every time I twirl around and catch a whiff of my scent- POW! Need to pee? BAM! Curl up on the sofa? WHAM-I&#x27;m over the armrest. By the end of a shower, my head feels like it&#x27;s been in a clamp. The soap itself is mild and lathers well, so I can only assume that scale-removing qualities are from the fumes literally searing off layers of flesh. In short, Grandpa started a Fight Club and the soap is its cover. I recommend this to anyone who just wants to feel alive. You&#x27;ll know when you find other members. Everyone around you will be asking where the fire is, but you&#x27;ll just wipe the blood away from your nose and keep walking.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my mother. She has itchy skin due to dryness. She heard about this soap so I purchased it. She had tried another copy cat brand which did not releive the itching. This soap really worked! She loves it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> product took awhile to get to my house but once i started using it i was so impressed on how quickly it got rid of my pregnancy rash. Love Love Love this pine tar soap :)</li>
    <li> yes, yes, it can happen to the best of us (and I cringe as I say this) --dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this gets rid of it. sure, if you&#x27;re a female like me it will leave you smelling like a pine tree but it gets the work done. just work in some nicely scented conditioner after and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price, easy to travel with and it does the job. good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews, but I can&#x27;t get myself to give it a try because the smell is so awful.  I thought pine tar might smell a little like pine, so it&#x27;s my fault for not knowing.  This soap smells just like liquid smoke that you use when making beef jerkey.  Since this scent is so overwhelming...I cannot comment on the quality of soap.</li>
    <li> Fast and accurate. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for 30 years. Lathers great and smells very fresh. The smell is too strong for some but I love it. I enjoy nature and this soap acts as a cover scent allowing me to gain close proximity to wildlife without being noticed.</li>
    <li> I got diagnosed with PUPPPS during my pregnancy which is a very itchy rash comparable to poison ivy. It was spreading at a very fast rate and there is nothing you can do to stop the spreading. I was recommended Grandpas Pine Tar Soap by my OBGYN and thought I would give it a try since I wanted a natural remedy intead of taking medicine while pregnant. I ordered the soap and when I got it in the mail I was shocked how bad it smelled. It made me want to throw up. I set it down and couldnt even go near it for about a day. I just couldnt imagine rubbing that awful smell all over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband compared it to a dead deer smell. The rash was getting worse so I thought, oh well, and gave it a shot. I held my breath during my shower and lathered up. After a couple days my rash stopped spreading and cleared up! Although it smells like death I can honestly say it worked and would recommend to anyone suffering from any sort of itchy rash!</li>
    <li> At about 34 weeks pregnant, I developed PUPPP. It&#x27;s a nasty, itchy rash that starts as small bumps and turns to giant welts, I had it first on my belly, then it spread to my arms, legs, back, and feet. This soap did offer me some relief within the first day of using it, after 2 weeks of using this soap 3 times a day, my rash is GONE!  So thankful. I would wake up crying in the middle of the night because the itch was so widespread and intense. Now, sleeping like a baby. I used some topical products as well, but the soap is definitely what cleared the rash in the long term.</li>
    <li> This soap provided me relief when no other lotion or soap did.  It makes you smell like a campfire, but if you have this rash you wont care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and early on in my pregnancy, I developed PUPPPS. It&#x27;s the most awful rash ever and there&#x27;s no way to stop the spreading. I did some research and found a lot of women tried this soap. First, it&#x27;s not that bad smelling. If you&#x27;re used to musk, fruit, and flowery scents, it&#x27;ll get a minute to get used to. But besides that, it&#x27;s a very good soap that gets the job done. I noticed an improvement in my skin over a week later and my symptoms were completely gone within three weeks on just one bar. I imagined if I used two bars, the symptoms would&#x27;ve disappeared even sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this soap. It&#x27;s well worth the money and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I can understand why some reviews rate this soap as one star. I can also understand why some rate it as 5 stars, as I am doing, or anything in between. The thing is, everyone has unique skin and a unique sense of smell. To give this soap 5 stars, you have to have at least one of two things in your favor: skin that likes this soap, and a nose that likes this soap. So, assuming this soap and your skin get along nicely, what about the smell? If you enjoy pipe tobacco, campfires in the woods, sitting by and tending to a large fireplace, and perhaps the fresh earthy smell of moss--or all of those--then this is THE soap for you. It smells very similar to a tobacco I used to smoke called Frog Morton, the scent of which is almost identical to this soap. It&#x27;s an awesome, manly, gentlemanly soap--a soap for the sort of gentleman that smokes a pipe (or at least likes the smell of them), who can get a fire going, or who enjoys a tromp about the woods and fields with his dog on a cool Autumn morn. The soap also has a peaty, Celtic sort of scent to it. Given all this, I can only agree with Grandpa&#x27;s slogan: it&#x27;s a soap from a simpler (and more gentlemanly)time, to be sure.</li>
    <li> I had a rash under each breast.  Nothing I tried helped.  Then I tried this, and TWO DAYS later, it&#x27;s almost gone!  It does smell like tires, but it&#x27;s not so overwhelming after the first day, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin smell, but even if it did, I would still use it -- you can call me stinky, but you can&#x27;t call me scratchy.</li>
    <li> Melts away too oooh quickly</li>
    <li> Actually works . Would really recomend this soap.</li>
    <li> After years of the mild scent of the dial yellow bar, I wanted to try something new and seeing the reviews for this gave me high hopes. Overall I was pleased with the bar, made me feel more manly with the scent but be warned it is pretty strong. The other key piece is that you need to make sure to store it in a dry space as it doesn&#x27;t last long at all when in the constant presence of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yes it does indeed smell like pine tar so heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the product aside from the at first overwhelming scent and the lack of longevity. But those can be accounted for as personal mishaps.</li>
    <li> The strong smell of this soap took a little getting used to, but it does the job and eventually the scent grows on you. I&#x27;ll keep ordering it from time to time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those suffering with eczema, like me.  It has cleared up quite a bit!  It has a funky smell but the smell does not stick to you.  For \\&quot;big\\&quot; people out there that have a lot of \\&quot;territory\\&quot; to wash this is perfect.  It kills any odor instead of trying to cover it up with perfumes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and my skin was soooo itchy and blotchy.  I asked my Dr. what he would recommend and his answer was Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.  My itchy skin has been soothed thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> This was  a gift to my husband who LOVED IT! He is an outdoorsy guy and loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like campfire... I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I don&#x27;t hate it either; I would say &amp;#34;somewhat dislike&amp;#34; is how I feel about it. But the smell seems to go away quickly, so the enjoyment that he gets from it is totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the soap is awesome!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but once I started using this soap for my PUPPP rash, which is a benign pregnancy rash that some women get, it started to clear immediately! It took about 2 weeks for it to completely go away, but every thing they claim about this soap is true!! I LOVE IT!!! Also, I do NOT smell like a BBQ once I get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
    <li> This soap smells like a campfire - which is okay by me.  My wife isn&#x27;t a fan, but that&#x27;s okay too, it&#x27;s a good base for some cologne, &#x27;cause for dudes, smelling like you&#x27;ve been in the woods beats the hell out of smelling like a \\&quot;creamy peach.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Than this soap is for you! Seriously smells like some sort of bacon or beef jerky. Great for skin problems like eczema or acne though. If you can get past that initial cured, smoked camp fire/bacon/jerky smell!</li>
    <li> Remember finally noticing the scent of wood smoke on your clothes halfway home from a weekend of camping? I expected this soap to smell of pine, but the dark, resinous scent is more smoky than green. It is quite pleasant on the body, however, lending a slight woodsy edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for three showers, and the combination of this soap and water a bit less hot are calming my itchies marvelously.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice soap. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as well as body. The scent in piney, but not as strong or offensive as some have stated. I would say it&#x27;s a cross between PineSol and Tea Tree oil.  It does not overpower my very small bathroom when I use it.  It leaves my face clean and feeling soft. Unfortunately, I have not seen it radically improve my rosacea, which is what I hoped, but it has not made it worse either.  My face feels clean without feeling overdryed.</li>
    <li> This soap does really well at cleaning. It smells strongly of burnt pine or just pine in general. Does not leave a film like residue either. I feel moist after using this product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent in removing dead skin.  It is especially useful for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim to try. I took a gamble last year and started using DE safety razors to shave, and was astounded by how much better my face feels, how much money I saved, and how much more relaxing it is. I wanted to try the soap to see if I could find a similar experience.   First off, straight out of the UPS package the smell is a little jolting. It smells like a smoldering fire pit, the morning after a bonfire. A very concentrated version of that. It lathers well, and did a decent job of washing, but it left a sticky soap film on my skin. I will probably give it another try or two to make sure I won&#x27;t change my mind. (I try to do this with anything new I try like this.)  If you are interested in it. Give it a try. It is fairly in-expensive, and worth the experience of trying something new, if nothing else.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is the only soap I will use for the rest of my life. It smells awful, but the smell does not linger. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it keeps me fresh much longer than other soaps. The seller is also great. The only negative is the cost. I order 30 bars at this price cause it saved a lot of money considering the shipping.</li>
    <li> I have bad eczema. I have tried everything prescribed over the counter you name it.  I did buy this years ago but I could never find it in the stores anymore. I did a search found it here and I was impressed with the price, s/h, scent, and  how great my skin feels. The smell is strong but it goes away. I don&#x27;t wear perfumes or anything because of my skin being so prone to break out. I feel fresh and clean after shower and I will be a repeat customer. Compared to the $5 bar of soap that was a little bigger then a stamp well maybe bigger :-) from my doctor this is a much better deal. Not to mention that soap was ok but never dried up the scaling my skin goes through with a bad breakout.</li>
    <li> This got rid of my puppps rash during pregnancy!! I tried every other remedy and cream (including steroid creams) and this was the only thing that worked. Thank goodness for this soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap after reading forums on relief for my pregnant belly condition (PUPPP).  The smell of the soap bar is quite strong and reminds me of burnt rubber and quite foul; however once you apply it, you can&#x27;t tell.  I&#x27;m not a fan of bar soap; however I added water and rubbed the soap onto my loofah and it produces a nice lather.  It left my skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and most importantly, it solved my itchy belly problem.  I highly recommend this product even after one use.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and I actually like the way it smells. But my main purpose in writing this review is because many others have claimed that the smell fades quickly and the co workers won&#x27;t mind.   I have to disagree with that. My girlfriend hates the smell but when I used it in the past, before going to work, my coworkers started to tell me that I smell and that I need a shower. Many thought it was BO. Now I theorize that these comments were made because my co-workers are idiots. I&#x27;m not saying you have to like the smell but I am saying that only an idiot would think that pine tar smells like body odor.  \\&quot;It smells like pine trees,\\&quot; fine. \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it,\\&quot; fine. \\&quot;You smell like you haven&#x27;t showered in week,\\&quot; you&#x27;re not that bright.  Great soap, but be warned, others may have a problem with it even if you don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> My wife had itching which started from 37th week of her pregnancy. It started with itching over her tummy and it was spreading all over. I felt so helpless watching her scratching all day and night. We tried everything from benadryl anti itch cream, gold bond, lactocalamine, Sarna and Grandpa pine tar soap. Initially benadryl anti itch &amp; lactocalamine used to give temporary relief but it lasted only no more than 2hrs. Then the GoldBond which gave relief upto 3 to 4hrs. Goldbond used to give immediate relief rightaway but lasted no more than 4 hrs. If you use goldbond, apply very very less since it temporarily freezes the body. Then we got our shipment of the grandpa pine tar soap. We started using this along with the Goldbond and after 3 to 4 days the itching was gone. Am pretty sure that it was the soap that worked wonders. All you have to do is give it 3 days to work. As it was mentioned in other reviews about the smell of the soap, it wasnt bad at all for us. Its just that it doesnt smell good like dove or other soaps which are used regularly. But its not bad like mentioned in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Gynic disagreed that the scratching my wife had was anything to do with PUPPS and she did a test to see if the liver was doing ok and it came out normal. However she didn&#x27;t prescribe any medication for the itching except Benadryl. Many reviewers mentioned that once you start to get itching in your pregnancy, you don&#x27;t have any other choice except to wait until you deliver the baby. I was worried reading all that. Another worry was we had a baby shower planned in a week. And then I came across this soap which just saved us from all the pain, frustration, sleepless nights and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted 3 days trying to purchase this at any store without ordering it online. I was a fool then. This product is not available in any of the stores though it says it is when I do a search. I tried GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Sears and everything. Its only available online guys. I ended up ordering 2 on Amazon and it arrived quickly than what it said. Until this arrived we were depending on goldbond. After using the soap for 3 to 4 days, we even forgot that she had bad itching at some point in her pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me ladies, you dont have to suffer with all the itching in your pregnancy. If you think you will be/are having scratching during pregnancy(PUPPS) around your tummy and spreading all over your body, this soap is your solution. The best part is you are applying this to exterior part of your body. So you and the baby are safe. I understand that this would be the concern for many here as it was for me.</li>
    <li> Long story short. I have had this eczema stuff on my lower legs and feet for almost 2 years. I have tried every soap&lt;br /&gt;and I mean every soap. I also did not want to use the hydrocortisone cream. About 3 weeks ago it was so bad and&lt;br /&gt;I said, man I need to do something and fast. I had heard about Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap but have never tried it. Then I started to read some reviews and I said, hey, I might as well give Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap a try, nothing else has worked.. Well let me tell you IT HAS WORKED ABSOLUTE WONDERS!!! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and this eczema stuff is almost gone. I wash morning and night. And for a moisturizer I use the Out of Africa 100% pure Shea Butter. And as my skin is getting back to normal texture it takes a lot less Shea Butter to moisturize the skin. It is a great combination: Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap and Out of Africa 100% Pure Shea Butter. I am just so thankful something has finally worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a body wash (and shampoo) for a long time that works for me. I would constantly try new products like body gels with manly fragrances but found them to be a bit expensive for what you get and often times left my skin dry. I occasionally get a dry scalp in the winter months and resort to expensive dandruff shampoo that come in very tiny bottles. Then one day I found Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the description it seemed too good to be true. A soap that washes body and hair without all those chemicals found in other products? Sounds good to me! So I bought some. The soap definitely has a smokey smell to it that some of my friends find strange and unappealing but I actually like. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger long either so even if you don&#x27;t like the smell it shouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker. It lathers white like the box says and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my skin after I rinse the lather off like other soap bars I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many showers with this product I wholeheartedly recommend it! Leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier, skin clean and not sticky or dry and I think it&#x27;s quite a bargain for what you get out of it! The only thing I would not advise is to use this as a shaving soap. The box says it&#x27;s good for shaving but I don&#x27;t think it makes a thick enough lather for a traditional wet-shave lather. I would use it to wash my face prior to really soften the whiskers but not as my primary shave lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product! Will definitely continue to purchase</li>
    <li> very good soap good on the skin . cleans good no perfume smell . dose it job .</li>
    <li> I got HORRIBLE excema on my body all of a sudden this year. Between using a tanning bed, aveena eczema lotion and THIS SOAP,and medicated tar ointment, I am getting RELIEF and sleeping at night again.  The soap issue has been a big deal because EVERYTHING FLARES mt eczema and this is wonderful. It does have a strange smell, but because it HELPS ME, ive come to LOVE the smell. Its not a BAD smell though.  It leaves my skin SOFT, notdried out at all, and im very sensitive and i cant even use stuff like Dove or ivory, or caress, because it ruins my skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product for skin rash. I got this soap for my wife that was having a terrible rash during her first trimester for two weeks. She was taking Benadryl for her rash; unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t working, we started to research I came across to this product. Well, we decided to give it a try and believe me that my wife was so happy that this soap works immediately, the rash is completely gone and we are more than grateful for this wonderful soap.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works for rash after first day of use&lt;br /&gt;Fast through prime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;smells like bacon, but since it works wonders for rash it doesn&#x27;t matter</li>
    <li> i purchased a bar of GrandpasPine Tar Soap after reading numerous reviews singing its praise for treatment of PUPPPP rash during pregnancy. True to the reviews, this product smells awful. For a pregnant woman, the odor is almost unbearable. However, it is more effective than any other thing I&#x27;ve used for my itchy rash... Including prescription medicated creams. Just wash off with your normal soap after using this one, and there I&#x27;ll be no strong campfire like smell on your skin after using.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  It was awful.  I felt like I needed to take another shower after I used it b/c I couldn&#x27;t stand to smell myself.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> Good pine tar soap is hard to find.  This product is superior.  I use it every day and find it very effective in cleaning my hair and scalp.  It does not discolor gray hair but rather leaves it clean without tinting it yellow which pine tar soaps oftentimes can do.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks this soap smells disgusting, but I like it.  At first, I admit, it was a bit strong (woody smell), but it&#x27;s grown on me and I use it as a face wash every day on my adult acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> My family has used this stuff for years on humans and animals alike. it works well on fleas and seems to deter mosquitos. I like the smell of it, clean and woodsy. It&#x27;s a great product with many uses.</li>
    <li> I have used Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap for over thirty years.  I used it on all my babies, and now they are using it on their babies!  It has a clean scent, has great healing properties for the skin (your largest body organ).  I wouldn&#x27;t be without a dozen bars in my home!  Make great &#x27;tuck under&#x27; gifts!</li>
    <li> Until I could locate the top of my soap dish I had to walk it outside and put it on the fence post it stunk so bad.&lt;br /&gt;I do use it and it doesn&#x27;t make you smell, it does make you feel clean.</li>
    <li> Pine tar is known by dermatologists for its healing, and protecting of skin. I have had bad skin problems, such as very oily skin which leads to terrible acne. Its the worst type of acne, and since I&#x27;ve been using this soap my skin feels noticeably better. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different soaps, and I&#x27;m sold on this one. Its a little on the high price, but its simply the best out there. The skin feels so clean, and healthy afterwards, and the smell is wild, and rustic like its truly natures soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly.  I&#x27;ve noticed it does help with my skin&#x27;s sensitivity.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying it and isolate certain parts of my body with rashes/irritations.  The only drawback is the smell at times is hard to get used to.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this stuff a couple of years ago in a search to clear up my face completely. I didn&#x27;t really think it would work but I figured it was only $5 so why not try it out. Thankfully it along with healthier food options, more water/tea, some homemade facial scrubs and moisturizer helped to clear my face up completely, all at a much cheaper price then commercial treatments. While it did have a peculiar scent at first, I actually kind of like it now. All in all great product. If you want something stronger another great Grandpa&#x27;s product is the Thylox Acne Soap. The way I used them is I wet my face, then spread some lather on it and let it sit for about 10-20 minutes or overnight. Make sure to use a facial scrub about once a week to remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> really stings the eyes!</li>
    <li> This is a great product I&#x27;ve liked for decades. I like the way it makes my skin feel. One warning - you must be okay with the pine tar smell! It is very strong.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell when applying, but doesn&#x27;t stay after washed out and the beard is dried. A little amount goes a long way with a good solid brissled brush. I&#x27;m now a proponent of this product and will continue to use it after the first bar has run out.</li>
    <li> I was thoroughly surprised at the effectiveness of this soap in removing dirt and grease from all over my body. It gave me a refreshed, moisturized, and clear feeling while improving the overall quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is strong, but doesn&#x27;t linger on you too long. Plus, it&#x27;s a good smell, like grilling in the woods. The downfall is how quickly it... runs out. About half the time compared to similar sized bars of soap. Great for my skin, and beard, but feel that I&#x27;ll be ordering more almost weekly.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the smell of this product I&#x27;m sure that you will love it.  The one time that I did use the product it cleaned well and left a clean feeling.  However I never smelled clean.  Some reviewers say that the product smelled like a lumber yard; another reviewer claims that it smells like a campfire.  Unfortunately my experience was much worse, it smelled like a pine tree puked or smells like someone was burning plastic in a campfire.  What makes it worse is that I smelled like that all day.  Not just a few hours but all way time until I was able to take another shower.  I recommend this product only if you like exotic smells.</li>
    <li> Buy the big bars instead of the small ones.  Store them in a plastic bag because they stink.  The smell of the bar itself decreases after a few days of use.  It will get really soft if water remains on it and you can use this to your advantage. Contains more oil than any other soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Because of the oil it takes hot water to rinse off.  If you can&#x27;t abide with a really hot rinse then use a washrag to help rinse it off.  With really hot water it rinses cleaner by far than any big brand soap.  I don&#x27;t believe it makes you smell like the bar smells if you rinse it off properly.  Because of the oil and its disinfectant properties it makes a great shaving soap.  Been using it for years and I just plain don&#x27;t feel clean using supermarket brands after becoming accustomed to Grandpa&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This will leave your house smelling like concentrated campfire! So if that sounds good to you, go for it. I had to keep it in a Tupperware to avoid spreading the odor. I noticed no improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Most of use have been conditioned to expect fresh, minty, fruity or woodsy smells with bath or shower soap. So waking up in the morning to the smell of a poorly cleaned charcoal grill is challenging. I hesitate to describe this as a chimney smell, because most chimneys smell pleasantly faintly of wood. This smells like you&#x27;re standing downwind of a barbeque grill restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a soap, it works well, and seems to clean adequately. But I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Some may find the smell off putting, but I frankly cannot get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5/5 for that alone.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, I have rather sensitive skin, and it helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that I would use it as a shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Great bar of soap! The aroma takes a few seconds to get used to, but definitely not a deterent. I would buy this soap again, and it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon (of course!).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. My problem is that it feels like it leaves my body... dry or dehydrated? I love the Dove soaps because I feel like it moisturizes my body leaving it nice and soft. This does the opposite. I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my five year old daughter. she has severe plauge Psoriasis. so her dermatoligist said to try out pine tar soap. it worked well took away the redness and itch as well as the appearence looks so much better. only one issue, it SMELLS HORRIBLE! like a tire warehouse and must. not what a little girl should smell like. lol wish there was something that works as well but smells better.. but worked for what we needed it for.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for dry itchy scalp and seborric dermatitis,this product is pleasant to use on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with PUPPS during my pregnancy and suffered from horrible itching. I&#x27;d tried over the counter lotions, oatmeal baths and prescription cream. Nothing worked for more than a few minutes. A friend recommended this soap as she had suffered the same problem during her first and third pregnancies. She warned me that it smelled like burnt pine tree, and it did, but after about 7 - 10 days my itching was drastically reduced! Within 2 weeks it was gone. It is smelly, but the smell did not remain on my skin after the shower. I recommend to everyone I know suffering from itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS SOAP A FEW DAYS AGO AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ALREADY. I LOVE HOW IT LATHES UP SO SMOOTHLY AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL CLEAN RIGHT AFTER A HOT SHOWER. I HAVE A MILD CASE OF PSORIASIS SO IM HOPING THIS SOAP IS GOOD FOR THAT CASE! ITS ONLY BEEN DAY 1 SO LETS SEE IF I PURCHASE MORE OF THEM. I USED THIS SOAP AS A SHAMPOO AS WELL AND I CAN ALREADY SEE THE PSORIASIS ON MY SCALP FADE A LITTLE BIT. BESIDES THE SMELL THIS SOAP IS GREAT. THE SMELL WILL KNOCK U OFF YOUR FEET WHEN U OPEN THE SOAP BOX, BUT ONCE YOU HAVE SHOWERED WITH IT, U DONT NOTICE IT AND THE SMELL ISNT SO BAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:0</li>
    <li> Grandpas Pine tar Soap is a miracle soap!  During my 34th week of pregnancy, my body was covered 90% by the PUPPS rash.  The Drs gave me all of the steriods I could take and nothing worked.  They pretty much told me \\&quot;you&#x27;re on your own, until the baby is born.\\&quot;  I was depressed and miserable!  My mother went online and did some research and found this soap.  I tried everything else known to man for skin irritants and nothing worked, so I broke down and ordered 5 bars of this soap.  Within 1 week the PUPPS rash stopped spreading and by week 2, it was gone.  I could not believe it!  I think the soap works by drying out your skin, because it left me with really itchy dry skin.  But that was way better than an itchy rash.  I used Palmers Cocoa butter lotion to combat the dry skin and now I am back to normal at 38 weeks pregnant.  Stop suffering and buy Grandpas pine tar soap :)I only used 2 bars, so 5 probably isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to see if it would help with my psoriasis, which recently has flared up like never before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, this stuff stinks. I&#x27;ve seen it described as like a \\&quot;pine tree,\\&quot; a \\&quot;lumberyard\\&quot; and \\&quot;sooty.\\&quot; The smell that immediately comes to mind for me though is \\&quot;forest fire.\\&quot; Honestly, it smells strongly of pine wood burning...to the point where your spidey senses make you look around the sky for a telltale plume of smoke. I keep expecting my smoke alarms to go off when I walk by, and my bathroom smells like it burned down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there is a certain manly appeal to the scent. Reminds you of camping trips, sitting around the fire. Ladies, most of you aren&#x27;t going to dig it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe it to be a high quality soap, made old school from oils with no harsh detergents or artificial colors. It definitely leaves you feeling very clean and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like typical deodorant bath bars. Stinky, yes...but clean! I wish I could say it has helped with the psoriasis but I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference after using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very interesting product, although I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying it again. Who knows though, it does have an odd appeal and maybe I&#x27;ll find myself missing it once it&#x27;s gone. (My girlfriend definitely won&#x27;t miss it!!)</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell great, but aroma fades. nothing soothes winter skin better for me</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product. I had heard it did wonders for PUPPP (pregnancy rash) and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I used this for 3 days and my rash is completely gone. My husband is also using it on his back and chest to help with some body acne and it seems to be helping with that as well. I don&#x27;t love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and the results would be worth it even if it smelled terrible. It has an earthy, rubbery smell. Can&#x27;t recommend enough for skin conditions!!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with tinea (fungal) rashes over the years.  On a whim,  I tried this soap and it cleared up my rash.  A friend ended up in the   hospital with cellulitis which he got when bacteria entered his skin through a foot rash.  Now I&#x27;m giving him a bar of this wonder soap.</li>
    <li> Kinda smells like a bbq pit but works well.</li>
    <li> Pro: This soap leaves the skin &amp;#34;Squeaky&amp;#34; clean. It also took care of a fungal/itch problem under my arms that i had developed. Tinactin and other anti fungal powders just couldn&#x27;t quite get rid of it.. (Symptoms would be alleviated.. but it would come back after a few days of stopping the treatment) After a week of using this soap in the shower each morning.. no trace of the fungal ... stopped using it for a weak or so.. and no return. Bar lasts about 1 months of 1 shower/day use. Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Con side:  The smell is definitely different.. not bad.. just not like irish spring or lifebuoy. ... more of a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell...  Again, not a bad thing.. but different.</li>
    <li> Works good, good lather, smells terrible and ok all at the same time.</li>
    <li> I took this on a vacation as a bug repellant and to clear up any bites and allergic reactions I might get.  It works great to soothe my skin but I still got eczema flair up. I also got ate up by bugs but that is inevitable. I plan on getting more because the bar has only lasted less than a month.</li>
    <li> .  My grandparents had this soap in their home when I was a child and I thought it was rank then but... as I went through life and began to replace the inferior products churned out by the Military-Industrial-Consumer-Milking complex with real stuff I moved to this most excellent of products and would not be without it now.    It is sold at Whole Foods but the price with VitaminLife here at Amazon may be much better if you order in quantity.     Try it, you may just find that it is an indispensable product for you and your family.</li>
    <li> I currently use this, and have been doing so since this past summer 13&#x27; because I have moderate acne and I must say that it has worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I have to give this soap five stars, even though my skin did not react well to it, because the quality is truly awesome.  If you are looking for strong pine tar soap, this is it.</li>
    <li> Manly masculine smell is great, lathers great and leaves skin smooth. I really like Grand Pa&#x27;s bar soap! I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> i use this when i currently have acne and it does a great job at drying up the pimples. i noticed that if i use it consistently then i&#x27;ll basically be acne free for the most part</li>
    <li> I remember my father using this many years ago, and I came across this soap searching for another product.  I purchased it and have been using only a week and I am blown away.  I have suffered with very dry skin and eczema for many years and this soap flat out works.  I have tried every moisturizing bath gel and soap known to man.  I am extremely pleased with the result.  The scent is very strong, but personally I like it very much.  My wife, not so much.    Buy it if you have dry skin conditions and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible, itchy rash after giving birth to my daughter. Since I was breastfeeding I didn wanna use steroids to cure this rash. But the itching was unbearable, so I ordered this soap. Be prepared, your bathroom will smell like a bonfire but it works wonders!! Showered twice a day with the soap, itching went away after two days, rash cleared up after 10 days!!! Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  He has rosacea and his skin is very sensitive to other skin products for bathing, lotions, etc.  He is able to tolerate the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, shampoo, and conditioner well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  I will buy him more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is not a shaving soap. I figured it&#x27;d be worth trying, in spite of the warnings... But no. Don&#x27;t. The lather is very thin and by the time you&#x27;re done putting down your brush and picking up your razor, the soap is already drying up. I tried re-milling it as another reviewer mentioned, but it didn&#x27;t help me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Colonel Conk&#x27;s for shaving. It&#x27;s fairly priced and does the job much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I really do like the scent of this soap, and I&#x27;ll continue using it as a general face soap (I already bought it, right?), but it is NOT a shaving soap and should not be advertised as one.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use as a beard soap and it is awesome. Has a manly campfire smell and cleans well without drying out your skin or beard.</li>
    <li> Are you tired of smelling like petunias, cucumber melon or other effeminate scents? Do you hate bathing with dish soap? Are you sick of lather balls and bizarre sponges? If you’ve answered “yes” to any of these questions then congratulations, you just might not be a completely emasculated shill of a male human being. There may be hope for you yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, there is a soap that has been on the market since the time when cowboys weren’t just in movies and samurai weren’t just figures in Japanese lore. A soap that has made men out of boys and won wars from our native soil to Europe and the Orient! So what is this bad ass brick of lathery goodness? Why it is Grandpa’s Original Pine Tar Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the best soap I have ever used. It appears dark brown, almost black, but it lathers white! It smells terrific and upon first sniff in the shower, it flips a switch in one’s head – turning an otherwise ordinary man into an unstoppable mastodon ready to plow through his day, leaving no prisoners and conquering every obstacle thrown his way. It makes mighty heroes out of tiny babies and can transform a chicken-hearted weakling into a beast able to throw whole skyscrapers into outer space to ward off an alien invasion! To an already manly man, this stuff works like the opposite of kryptonite to Superman. This is legitimately “man crack”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, this is the greatest soap I have ever used. In fact, before this, all other soaps were just soap. There is one other soap that I like, which I will review at a later date, but Grandpa’s is the measuring stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing else out there that can set my day in motion with such a level of swashbuckling bad assery as this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pine tar soaps before and they smell like pine needles. This soap smells more like burning rubber and asphalt. It is not a pleasant odor. The scent is so pungent I had to throw it out. I imagine it would be good for repelling insects (or people) but I would not want to wash my body with this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan. At first the smell is a little... whoa, but not unpleasant, kind of like a campfire. Its done wonders for my skin, and I will continue using it</li>
    <li> I am 7.5 mos. pregnant and have this insane rash for almost two mos.  Nothing my doctors recommended worked.  After hours and hours of searching online and reading similar stories from other pregnant women, I decided to try this soap.  Like they said, it smells awful but it does the job.  My rash on my arms, back, butt and tummy have disappeared.  Just working on my legs now.  I continue to use it because I don&#x27;t want my rash to come back as my rash may just be related to my chemical imbalance and hormones of being pregnant.  I use the calmoseptine ointment afterwards, then apply an ointment my doctor prescribed so my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry.  I can sleep better at night.</li>
    <li> Pine tar is amazing! It&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It will clear acne, Dry up poison ivy, Aid in soothing psoriasis, amd many other benefit, to the extent that other than  than Dr. Bronners magic 18 in1 hemp oil and peppermint soap (See my review of that too) this is the only soap I&#x27;ll use! I particularly like it for covering my scent before going Into the woods, It being all natural I don&#x27;t smell like chemicals to the animals when I&#x27;m in the bush.</li>
    <li> i ordered this soap because I had the pupps rash on my belly at 30 weeks i couldnt stand the itch and all reviews I seen on the pupps rash showed this soap as a miracle soap so i ordered and i still tried another remedy because the soap wouldnt come in for another week. I ordered the soap at 32 weeks but at 30,31 weeks i started this hispanic remedy which is make oatmeal like if it was to be eating boil water add the oatmeal once a little thickened let it sit to get cold. once cold my husband pasted the oatmeal all over my rash (use a towel underneath you cause it can get messy) then i laid for an hour and a half and then showered to take it off. The itch is crazy when the oatmeal dries on your skin but its well worth it! i did it for a whole week every night and within a week and a half the rash went away! so when the soap arrived it was too late i had already healed. the soap does smell horrible though lol</li>
    <li> I bought it because i was diagnosed with PUPPP with my 2nd baby. Thanks to the soap my rash is almost compleatly gone and the ictching its almost gone as well. I deffinitely recommend it to any one that suffers from PUPPP or any other skin condition that itches. And as a plus it leaves your skin super soft. The smell its not great but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Grandpa must have been living outdoors in the wild if this was his soap of choice. I can not express how disgusting this smells. When I opened the package from amazon (I ordered a few things in one shipment), I was wondering what that horrible smell was and was shocked that it was the soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s NO way you can wash yourself with this in the morning and then go to work. You&#x27;ll either be raped by a bear confusing you with smoked meats, or you will get fired by your boss for the offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it helps for skin conditions, but I will never find out. Instead I&#x27;ll use the steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars....now I&#x27;m convinced retailers are posting fake/employee reviews.</li>
    <li> Great manly smell, amazing simple natural ingredients--I use it for my hair and body. Much easier than all the nasty plastic bottles and weird scented smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many soaps and body washes tout manliness, or the manly smell, but still come off just as fru-fru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes you smell like a freaking pine tree. Can&#x27;t get more manly than that. Oh, and it&#x27;s actually the smell of pine tar. Not an artificial scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get weird looks from some family, but my wife loves it--she introduced me to it. In all honesty, the scent doesn&#x27;t stick with you--it&#x27;s just like a normal soap. You don&#x27;t get gummy or smell too woodsy--a nice, fresh, manly smell right after you finish, and a great clean feeling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for my back acne and haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes. I still get breakouts this is my second bar. If it doesn&#x27;t work any more I will stop usage</li>
    <li> Definitely a love it or hate it smell. I loved it. Wife hated it. Sounds to me like it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I did not buy this for a skin condition, so I cannot comment here. Bought it solely for smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap Sun and got it by Mon eve. This soap is POWERFUL! I got it for a rash on my arms. The smell is strong but its ability to clear things up fast outweighs the smell. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This soap is mild and lathers great. I have sensitive skin, but I can use this everywhere including my hair without any irritation, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it helped clear up some body acne (back and shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever stood in front of a hardwood smoker, fought a forest fire, or cleaned a chimney, you have a rough idea what it smells like. That being said, it is really subtle and masculine, and still will cover up pretty much any odor you might hapen to pick up... if you spent your afternoon at the cannery, for instance, and don&#x27;t want to go home smelling like tuna, this should be your soap.</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap! Smells manly and great.  Also seems to help A LOT against tinea versicolor! My Spot immediately lightened up!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time ordering. Soap arrived faster than expected.</li>
    <li> The smell of this soap is not that bad. I think it smells a bit like some old fashioned soap, but it did its job. I will definitely buy some more. I think I will try the body wash next time.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. My bearddruff is gone thanks to this soap. However, BE WARNED. This stuff smells like a wet fireplace. It stinks. I keep it in a travel container  to ensure continued marital bliss as my wife finds the odor particularly offensive.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had a bout of &amp;#34;PUPPS&amp;#34; when I was pregnant.  I smelled like an old man/sawdust/factory when I used this - but when I washed my belly with this in cold water, I could go about half the day without itching.  It made my other pregnant friends gag, but it was totally worth it because I&#x27;d have even more scars from the itching without it.</li>
    <li> I found this soap on a list of &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; things, and since I tend to get dry skin in the winter, I thought I would give it a try.  On opening the box, it has kind of an antiseptic/medicine smell, which reminded me of Doctors offices of my childhood.  It isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but if you don&#x27;t like that kind of thing, I would avoid it.  I have only used it a couple of times, and overall I like it as a soap.  To early to see if it helps any with my dry skin, I&#x27;ll try and update this review later on.....</li>
    <li> First off, I am a woman.  I happen to like the smell of more masculine associated fragrances.  I was looking for a pine tar scented product.  I find the scent comforting and I associate it with my dad who always used Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo, which has a distinct pine tar scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is really strongly scented.  I like a hint of pine tar, but this is way too much for me.  I find it too be really overpowering and it has a very sustaining fragrance.  I put it in my husband&#x27;s shower, but I don&#x27;t think it won him over either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I believe this is good quality product and I would like to try several of their other soaps though.  (sandalwood, patchouli, and baking soda)</li>
    <li> Stinky! Smells up the whole bathroom and lingers. Didn&#x27;t seem to make a diffarence in the flakiness in my husbands beard. Had to beg him to throw it away even though I was the one to gifted it to him.</li>
    <li> this wasn&#x27;t some miracle treatment for me, just a really stinky soap.  i don&#x27;t have psoriasis or anything like that but i do have dry itchy skin and i guess it helped, a little.  i mostly wanted to see if it would help clear up some of my acne because some people say it helped with that but it didn&#x27;t for me.  i won&#x27;t be purchasing this again and i don&#x27;t like coming out of the shower feeling stinker than when i went in lol</li>
    <li> Be prepared to smell like tar or smoke or something that&#x27;s been outside for ages man!  Yea I smelled it through the package and just chucked it!  haha I was merely curious.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would help my PUPP and itchy skins after pregnancy.  It smells bad and didn&#x27;t really help at all. It sort of even stung if I had cuts or open areas when I had been scratching.  Disappointment,</li>
    <li> I had a very itchy rash while pregnant. It was called PUPPP. This helped calm it down. It was the only thing that helped.</li>
    <li> This product smells like a campfire and if you are in to the outdoors, you may like the smell. I use it for my eczema rash and for my PUPPS rash pre delivery. It worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it. By the time I got to the second bar, I started to like it. Now that the second bar is half gone, I like it even better. I had to replace the fire alarm in the hall because every time I came out of the bath room, it would go off, it was pretty old. This stuff smells like wet wood charcoal and railroad ties when your using it, but after your done it just smells clean. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film that I&#x27;ve noticed and feels quite refreshing. I haven&#x27;t found a wood tick since I started using it even though I bashed around in the brush several days. The only real complaint I have is, it goes away a little faster than Dial and the price is a bit high. Like I said, it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;iffy\\&quot;. You won&#x27;t know for sure until you try it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I KNEW this soap had a very unique smell, described by other reviewers as being similar to a campfire. I thought that would be fine, since I love camping and campfires. Unfortunately, the soap I received smells nothing like a campfire; rather, it smells like a pile of burning tires. Or like burning garbage. (Having grown up in the country, I know what both of those things smell like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, despite the awful smell, I tried using this soap several times. Contrary to what is written on the packaging, it did not lather white; the lather was more of a brownish-yellow. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t seem to leave any discoloration on my skin. But the main reason that I won&#x27;t be using this soap again is because the smell stayed on my skin for a very long time... 8+ hours. I could have lived with the brown lather and the nasty smell IF the smell had not stayed on my skin... but there is no way I&#x27;m going to go out in public smelling like a trash fire. Not gonna happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really wanted to like this soap. I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would help with acne and seb derm, and this soap seems to get a lot of good reviews from folks with those conditions. I&#x27;m wondering if the manufacturer changed the formula or something, because the soap I received is just nasty and is not like the soap described in the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, give it a try, but be prepared to smell like ashes and cinders.</li>
    <li> As a fellow Ron, I consider my mentors to be Ron Swanson and Ron Burgundy, and this is the soap that I would imagine both of them would use.  It lathers well and leaves you squeaky clean, but many soaps do that.  What sets Grandpa&#x27;s soap apart is the fragrance.  There isn&#x27;t another like it.  Someone described it as &amp;#34;lumberyard&amp;#34; pejoratively, but to me thats a plus.  It is a fine manly smell.  Since using the soap my wood-working skills and my non-regional diction have improved.  I have also taken up jazz flute and saxophone, so I am feeling stupendous.  Thanks Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap!</li>
    <li> Read the other one star reviews. This soap smells horrible, just like a campfire burning something horrendous. I&#x27;ll bathe with Ajax before I use this again. Grandpa must&#x27;ve smelt like ass.</li>
    <li> I HATE the way this smells. Every time my husband has it out, I think somebody is smoking some bacon out back. With that said, I gave it 5 stars, because my husband  LOVES it. It&#x27;s a fun scent that makes him feel manly. It lathers nicely too, so he uses it with his shaving brush for a nice smooth shave. In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice manly scented soap, that lathers nicely, this is the one for you! If you prefer peonies and lemon scent, this one is for your husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant. Life has been rough lately. I got into some poison ivy while working on my yard (ugh), which then got infected (diagnosis: cellulitis), and just as that *started* to clear up a little (thanks, antibiotics!), I was just lucky enough to get PUPPP. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to being pregnant. The skin on my belly and legs was itchy, inflamed, tight, and awful. I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well because of the intense itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap. I am on my fourth day of using this stuff twice daily. Each morning and night, I work up a nice pine tar lather in the shower. Then, I turn off the water for a couple of minutes, and massage the lather over my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if this step is really necessary, but I feel like it might make the itch relief last a little longer. Finally, I rinse off and go about my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap. This stuff has totally controlled the itch (for about 8 hours after use) and really faded the appearance of the rash. I can sleep through the night again. My only problem now is that I&#x27;m terrified to STOP using it. If I stop using it, I might grow scales and die, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells like Ron Swanson&#x27;s hunting cabin, set ablaze. It&#x27;s not really a bad smell though. And if you&#x27;re uncomfortable enough, you won&#x27;t care. Plus, you really only smell it while you&#x27;re using it. Once you dry off, the pine tar scent disappears from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were just slightly crazier, I would get a tattoo of the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap logo on my left butt cheek to prove my total devotion to this product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of pine but the smell of pine tar is like a cross between pine and fresh asphalt... not too yummy.  The smell didn&#x27;t just burn off after a few minutes either... it would stick with me the whole day.  Did not clear up any skin issues.  I like that it is retro and different.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a sealed plastic pouch.  As soon as I opened the plastic, the room was filled with a nearly eye-watering stank of hot tar.  Having read a bunch of reviews of this soap, I was expecting this to some degree, but this was a little more... aggressive... than I had been anticipating.  Two weeks later, and the smell has only slightly abated, much to the displeasure of the females in my house.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I find this to be an excellent soap.  In the dry winter months, I have some problematic skin issues.  I have been looking into solutions, and I kept running into recommendations for this soap.  I&#x27;ve had pretty decent success with coal tar shampoos, and I thought I would try this stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it gets my skin and hair \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; without the harsh drying that I get from other soaps.  Also, I had read many reviews of men saying that it was good for their beards.  That seemed weird to me, as most soaps tend to make beards dry.  Well, I can now verify that this has seemed to make my beard much more manageable without being greasy or whatever... just better.&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell on my skin, I have found that after I get out of the shower and dry off, it is noticeable, but not bad.  After about an hour, or so, it fades to a smokey/sweet smell that isn&#x27;t offensive or pronounced, but still not entirely desirable to me. Hours later, if I press my nose to my skin, I can still detect it.  I was happy to note that no matter how much I sweat (I&#x27;m a runner and I do hard physical work), I do not notice that smell of tar.  I also have noticed that no matter how much I sweat, that body odor is practically nil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers good (I have very hard water, and some soaps are not good in this regard)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin and hair remarkably clean feeling, yet soft and not dried-out.&lt;br /&gt;Oddly good beard cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Good for a variety of problematic skin issues/ blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a very long-lasting deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a tire fire.&lt;br /&gt;Really expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Has anybody mentioned the smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to purchase this, although I will probably store it in the basement between showers...&lt;br /&gt;Despite not being a fan of the smell, I have been extremely happy with the effectiveness of this soap.  It has definitely lived up to the reports of its skin-clearing ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add, 2/4/14:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are not nearly as cracked/chapped as they normally get during the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve found a store local to me that sells this soap, and I noticed that the packaging was not sealed in plastic, like my Amazon purchase.  I guess with some \\&quot;airing out\\&quot; and age, the pungent aroma does calm down quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Also, also, I found out that this is made in Erlanger, KY.  Which is not too far from me.  I like supporting business as local to me as possible, so that is a nice little \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; that I hadn&#x27;t initially realized.  Doesn&#x27;t affect my rating, just thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally:  Why am I writing this much of a review for a bar of soap?  Weird.</li>
    <li> Very unpleasant smell! My sister had a baby, so indicating her skin becomes very poor! Leg skin itch! To improve this washed with! Hope that the product can do it better and better</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my protocol to alleviate my placque psoriasis.  It really helps.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell (I noticed some people don&#x27;t care for it) and due to changes in my diet, I hardly have the psoriasis.  I still use the soap, because I like the way it makes my skin feel.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Got this for Father&#x27;s day as kind of a teaser. My dad nor I ever used it but the scent is strong, not bad, but strong</li>
    <li> I had a pregnancy related rash that nothing would help.  I did some research and noticed that some women had tried this soap, so I decided to try it as well.  It didn&#x27;t totally get rid of the rash, but it really helped stop it from spreading, and really helped the itching. I would buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say, but I am very pleased.  I ordered my stuff, it was processed and shipped fast.  The order was well packaged.  I will buy from this reliable store again.</li>
    <li> A lot of people have been commenting on the smell of this soap, but quite frankly it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. It smells like sawdust or freshly cut pine for the obvious reason. By the time u wash it off its ok, after about an hour you wont smell it anymore. One time I showered and got in the car for work I turned on the A/C, but I had to make a small stop at the roadside shop, buy the time I got back in the car it was smelling like a sawmill. It seems to be having an effect on my psoriasis, i&#x27;ve actually cut down on the amount of medication I had to use before, i.e. a mixture of coal tar and Salicylic acid every night in my head before bed, since using the soap I haven&#x27;t used that mixture in a while, so this soap i&#x27;ll gave a 4 out of five. N.B. Do not use this soap as a substitute for your regular medication.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and cleaning power of this soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s remarkable how many chemicals we consume in our modern society when a product like this has, and always will, exist. I have sensitive skin and pay pretty close attention to my hair and it&#x27;s health. I have to tell you, I&#x27;m better off using this one silly bar of soap for everything than I ever was using expensive and very specific products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of natural ingredients, no unnecessary beautifying (I love that it&#x27;s just dirt brown), and effective cleansing without drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want from a bar of soap?</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I feel clean and manly smelling after use!  No foofoo scent, its like rubbing burnt wood that lathers onto yourself!</li>
    <li> It smells like a chemical landfill. Awful. Whatever this soap&#x27;s virtues are... they&#x27;re not enough to overcome it&#x27;s offensive stench. Save your money, find something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a terribly uncomfortable rash on 25% of my body (unknown cause but unrelated to the outdoors) for the last week or so and I scrounged Amazon for some itch-relief products while waiting for my doctors appointment. I had this soap overnighted and I have to say, it worked even better than the over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.     Unfortunately, the effects are temporary (I can feel it begin to wear off within a few hours) but it lasts slightly longer than the relief from the itch creams, and the smell is pretty horrible. Sort of like tar or burning rubber. I also felt a light film on my skin but I guess not much more than I do from the average moisturizing soap. Honestly, for a couple hours of peace it&#x27;s beyond worth it, and if you rinse well the smell doesn&#x27;t really linger on your body.</li>
    <li> The scent was awful. I was expecting a pine forest scent. What I got was a terrible plastic smell, I actually took another shower after to get rid of the smell and then through the soap in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great, great product.  A favorite for skin problems such as fabric sensitivity, allergies, or psoriasis relief.  Arrived quickly, priced right</li>
    <li> Fairly standard cleaner as soap goes, but could compromise air quality when used indoors. A number of the cheaper olive oil soaps including the kissmyface have similar problems.</li>
    <li> Very rarely do I come across a product that I like enough to take the time to let anybody know about it or write a review or anything. I stumbled across an add for some Grandpa&#x27;s Wonder Pine Tar Soap in a Dr. Leonard&#x27;s catalog that my mother gave me. I didn&#x27;t like the outrageous shipping, so I looked around on the web to see where I could find it locally (the only place that carries it here in Vegas is GNC) So I went and picked up the two bars they had in stock. How the heck have I never heard of this product before? As somebody with problem skin, this stuff is amazing! It should be sold in regular stores such as Walmart! I just love it! Been using it for a week now and I&#x27;m extremely impressed!</li>
    <li> Works very on adults and children 4 and up, good smelling and very natural product. The best I have found for a child&#x27;s skin condition</li>
    <li> Great soap. Leaves you smelling like a man, not a bucket of chemicals and perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that controls my perleche and seborrhea. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it.</li>
    <li> It was ok but it dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it works for my pimple because I didn&#x27;t use it for long time.&lt;br /&gt;It has very strange odor.</li>
    <li> On my third trimester I was having a bad case of rash and itch around my belly. It kept ma awake at night and i was so uncomfortable. Read about this soap from the blogs and decided to try it. After three days I noticed some improvement. I got rid also of my cocoa butter and bio oil and just used this soap and Aveeno. Now after two weeks of using this soap, my rashes are gone, less itch. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear from all the other reviews that the scent of this soap is pretty polarizing, but I love it. It has the smell of slightly charred bacon and a pine wood campfire. The smell was strong when the bar was fresh, but it diminished pretty quickly. It lathers really well even in hard water, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around long after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find lots of online commentary saying that one of the ingredients is sodium tallowate (made from animal fat), BUT THAT&#x27;S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE! I contacted Grandpa&#x27;s to ask about it, and they say they don&#x27;t use animal parts or do animal testing. I further asked what the difference between \\&quot;Original\\&quot; and \\&quot;Vegetable Based\\&quot; bar soaps are on their website, and their representative Kim Greer kindly responded with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;All the pine tar soaps are the same formulation.  At one time, this was not the case.  We did have 125th Anniversary at the top of the 4.25 oz. bar but when it became outdated we change the description to \\&quot;Original\\&quot;.  This is the only difference.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, vegetarians/vegans/compassionate folk: Grandpa&#x27;s does not use animal products, or do animal testing, contrary to what you may read online.</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended online as beard soap. I don&#x27;t know how effective it is for that. My husband hasn&#x27;t used it yet. Be aware that anything you read about how bad it smells aren&#x27;t exaggerating. Can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting it near your face. Maybe it&#x27;s better once you start soaping up?</li>
    <li> Around 30 weeks pregnant with twins, my stomach suddenly burst into red, fiery, itchy, sad stretch marks. They woke me up at night, demanding to be itched, and the rash spread to my hands and arms, and certain areas formed blisters. (Gross.) Although it&#x27;s not over yet, these itchy days and nights were definitely the most uncomfortable and dark of my entire pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some Googling and found that this soap comes up as recommended for PUPPPs rashes frequently on message boards, and thought it was at least worth a shot. I ordered [[ASIN:B001E0X09S Grandpa&#x27;s Soap Pine Tar Soap - 4.25 Oz, 3 pack]] of the soap and started using it with [[ASIN:B001441QCW Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Unscented, 32-Ounce Bottle]] four times a day on the affected areas. After about three days, it started getting a little better. I went and saw my OB, and she also recommended [[ASIN:B002DUDEQ2 Sarna Sensitive Lotion, 7.5-Ounce (222 mL) Bottle]] lotion, and either topical or oral Benadryl and topical hydrocortisone cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued washing with the soap and using Sarna Sensitive and the Alba Botanica lotion after each washing, and now, after ten days, my rash has completely cleared up and I just use the soap once per day in the shower, and follow it with the Alba Botanica lotion. If I get itchy during the day or night, I use more of the Alba Botanica and it stops itching usually right away. It took about a week of this routine to get the itching and rash under control. I took half an oral Benadryl at night a couple times, and didn&#x27;t find the hydrocortisone to be that effective in the long run. I discontinued using both and the Sarna lotion because I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid using medicines during my pregnancy. I also stopped wearing full-panel maternity jeans and pants for a couple weeks, because the elastic panel seemed to make the rash feel worse. I can&#x27;t say for certain that the rash was solved by this soap (which does admittedly smell like a campfire, but whatever it&#x27;s October it&#x27;s kind of a cozy smell), but it DEFINITELY SEEMED to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And those super red, painful stretch marks have faded a lot and lost their scaly gross texture. I&#x27;m still pregnant, but my skin at least feels normal again! My OB said since the rash cleared up, it probably wasn&#x27;t a PUPPPs rash, but if you are itchy and pregnant, this soap is totally worth a try.</li>
    <li> So I got this for beard and body, it smelled great, all pine tree like,felt like a lumberjack that bathed in pine oil, I liked it. But not enough to buy it again, nice to try out, it wasn&#x27;t my bag...</li>
    <li> I am an adult with acne so I&#x27;m always trying new soaps.  I don&#x27;t have breakouts all the time, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this pine tar soap is effective in controlling my acne.  I can say for sure that it hasn&#x27;t led to any new breakouts.  The soap also makes a great lather and feels nice and refreshing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential downside is the smell.  I have never had any experience with pine tar before purchasing this soap so I had no clue what it would smell like.  While my grandpa never used pine tar, the smell certainly evokes an old-timey feel.  At first, I even thought that it smelled a little like some sort of old, herbal medicine.  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t dislike the smell at all.  In fact, I dare say that I enjoy it; in my opinion, it smells very manly.  That said, I understand that other people might think that it smells a little funky, so for that reason, I only use this soap at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> This product is an absolute lifesaver for women suffering with PUPPPS....</li>
    <li> Ordered this for our dog who has so much going on by way of allergies.  I remember my parents bathing my sister with this stuff after the doctor recommended it for Psoriasis.  i hope it works.  Too early to tell but it has to help some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is hard to find!</li>
    <li> OK, it smells kind of bad but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. It&#x27;s just while you are using it. I think it&#x27;s helping my daughter with her rough skin quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has psoriasis when the weather turns cold.  It has really helped this winter.  There are still red places around where his clothes touch when he goes out into the cold for any length of time, but not near as inflamed or angry looking.  And it clears up much faster.  It does have a scent to it that is a little bit strong when it is wet, but he said he likes it.  I do not smell it on him when he is out of the shower.  He just smells clean.  The soap is brown, and will some off a little brown on the wash cloth, but lathers white and does not leave a residue.  It has really helped his skin.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t really remember why i bought this.  i have psoriasis and i must have read this was good for it and bought it on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis, but it was a pretty good soap for general use i would say?</li>
    <li> This soap is truly a miracle product. I&#x27;ve been using bit daily for the last 3 days and my skin seems to be improving after each use. I saw some reviews that suggest the smell of the soap is an issue, but my nose likes the woodsy sent. It is a robust scent, but doesn&#x27;t linger on your body after shower. I even use the bar of soap for shampoo, shaving, and just general cleansing in shower, its great stuff. Ive been singing its praises to anyone who will listen and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Get some and be glad !</li>
    <li> Smells like a hobo and cleans like an angel!  Loved by hippies and loggers for generations!  I cannot say enough about grandpa&#x27;s soap.  It cleans very well, works as an amazing shampoo/conditioner (pine tar moisturizes as it conditions and  strengthens leaving my hair shiny and manageable), shaving soap, and it has cleared up my itchy shin problem in less than a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be forewarned, you, like the soap, will smell like a campfire loving hobo after standing around a burn barrel full of christmas trees.</li>
    <li> This soap made me smell like pine trees and dirt. It&#x27;s not for me. The scent really sticks to your skin too</li>
    <li> My fiancee says it smells like rotting ham. I have a small bathroom and my entire bathroom smells like this soap. I think it smells more like a campfire, but it&#x27;s definitely not something you want in your bathroom when guests come over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it really is good for your skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the main ingredient is coconut oil however - you may just want to try that. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
    <li> I had PUPPPS while pregnant (Hives, terrible itchiness I would never wish on anyone). This was the only soap that would calm the itchies for a few hours. I definitely HATED the smell but it did its job and I&#x27;d do it again if I ever decide to go through the torture of pregnancy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll spare the details, but I&#x27;d been having a deep lower fungus condition for months, a maddening, burning, itching, raw, seeping and generally disgusting misery that nothing seemed to help. Powders, cremes, salt baths, I tried it all to no avail. Then I remembered a scalp and ear condition my son had years ago that we used pine tar shampoo on -- we called it \\&quot;Burned Wood Juice\\&quot; because of the scent -- that seemed to clear it up. I bought it in bar form, and two weeks later all the aforementioned symptoms had diminished significantly, and I expect them to be gone in the coming month. I&#x27;m so glad I remembered this stuff, just wish I&#x27;d thought of it earlier before my summer was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d do a commercial for pine tar soap or shampoo in a heartbeat. I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it really fights fungus infections like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried. And I find the scent very agreeable, makes my bathroom smell like a forest. I&#x27;ll be stocking up, as my skin is prone to breakouts, and I can&#x27;t seem to find the soap in any retail stores, even here in L.A. At less than half the cost (at least here online) of other products that claim to work, but don&#x27;t, pine tar seems to qualify as one of those Best Kept Secrets. Highly recommended for skin conditions most of us would rather not talk about.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to find this soap on Amazon.  A friend had brought a bar to me.  She found it in a small store in the mountains of Arkansas.  It has worked out well for eczema.  I had patches on each side of my nose and in my eyebrows.  I use only this soap to wash my face.  A friend recently told me that most people with Eczema shower with the pine tar soap.</li>
    <li> I have Palmar-plantar (hands and feet) psoriasis.  While my soles require a much more labor intensive regime of creams, tar oil, and everything else that goes into managing it, I find this soap is all I need to keep at bay the small patches on my hands.  I wash my hands and feet with this soap at least in the morning and before I go to bed.  The smell, however, is strong.  It smells like my wood smoker!!!  I know it works because I was having trouble controlling the small flair ups on my hands, and that stopped as soon as I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there is a silver bullet cure for this pesky and painful ailment, but I met with a dermatologist who took the time to discuss supplements.  He led me to some medical reviews of Omega 3 fish oil and Vitamin D supplements as they pertained to Psoriasis treatment.  My previous dermatologist ran an assembly-line office where he looked at the Psoriasis, prescribed some skin softener and steroid cream, and was out the door to his next patient.  On my questions regarding alcohol and diet he said \\&quot;anything that promotes a healthy lifestyle is good.\\&quot;  However, when I met with a doctor who actually sat down and discussed long term treatment, I came up with a better plan.  I&#x27;ve been taking the supplements for a few weeks and there is a considerable decrease in flair ups, though managing my Psoriasis is a never ending process, even if it is mostly cleared up at the moment.  The second I neglect treatment, back it will come.  Don&#x27;t despair;  through some trial and error, Psoriasis can be managed a lot of the time.  This soap can be part of the solution.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Pine Tar Wonder soap for a week now, and I do not think it is as bad as some have made it out to be. Yes, the scent is very strong and it takes some getting used to, but I have found it is strongest at the time I&#x27;m using it in the shower. The scent is present on my skin for the remainder of the day, but I got used to it after a day or two. The scent is difficult to describe, but it reminds me of wood smoke -- like when you step outside on a crisp winter night and you can smell burning wood from a neighbor&#x27;s fireplace. I do not have any skin issues, so nothing to report there. The lather is smooth and goes further than you would think. I really like the moisturizing effect this soap has on my skin. No more after-shower-itch from commercial soaps. I found this stuff at a local shop which was cheaper than the price here online.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers but the trade off is that it does not dry your skin and is good for a lot of skin issues.</li>
    <li> I like this soap and the smell is one of my favorite things about it.  It is very woodsy and rustic.  It is log cabin-esque.  I used it to its full potential and even washed my hair with it.  A colleague standing near me said she smelled smoke.  The smell is of burning leaves and you&#x27;re standing in the line of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is dark brown and lathers white.  The wash cloth shows brown residue.  It washes clean away.  In a tub of water, you will see brown tinted water around you.  This soap is nice.  It&#x27;s what your Grandpa would suggest.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and it smells so manly.  definitely recommended for washing a beard.</li>
    <li> Bought this in an attempt to battle PUPPS.  I wanted this to work so badly but...it didn&#x27;t.  Didn&#x27;t make one bit of difference!  To be fair, I did have one of the worst cases of PUPPS my doctor had ever seen so...if you fall into that category, this probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the manliest soap out there. Yes, the bar itself does have a strong scent that I imagine is reminiscent to what the Simpsons tire fire must smell like, but what&#x27;s left of the scent on the skin after showering with it is mellowed down heavily. It&#x27;s earthy and very pleasing. I find myself wishing it was even a little stronger since it&#x27;s just such a refreshing and clean scent.</li>
    <li> If you have PUPPs, I am so sorry. I&#x27;ve been there. So bad that when my husband was putting steroid cream on me, I turned around and he was actually crying. My midwife at one checkup called the doctor and didn&#x27;t realize she left the door open a crack and I heard her say, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen it this bad! Ever!\\&quot; So yeah. Bad. And it can last for a few weeks after you deliver (mine did) which I didn&#x27;t know until my doula told me -- so in the end I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get induced early, but I certainly considered it. A lot. The oral steroids which I held off until week 38 (I wasn&#x27;t sleeping much by then so there was not much choice) did help a ton, but before then this soap helped (although it was terribly drying so use a very rich bath oil and cream afterwards). And to sleep a few hours I actually would take a hot bath scrubbing with a brush and this soap -- which would make the itch worse (the theory is, when that much histamine is released all at once, your body then fights it for a few hours at least) and that is how I was able to sleep. But I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you&#x27;re about to lose your tentative grip on reality. The steroid cream really did nothing (but make my husband cry lol). The oral steroids were amazing and I&#x27;m glad I waited so long because my DD has no ill effects. I also have NO scarring despite my itching in my sleep wherever I could reach. So it will not last and you will barely remember it a year or more down the road. And even though mine lingered in a few areas after delivery, it was nowhere near as bad as week 35-38! Hang in there, Momma! Try this. And try to remember, it does get better!</li>
    <li> PUPPP is so itchy and annoying, I bought this after reading on many pregnancy sites that this helped other women who got PUPPP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells pretty stinky, but who cares if it works!! I got it in my second trimester, so I was past the \\&quot;every smell makes me nauseous stage\\&quot; - a must order if you have PUPPP.  Lathers into a brown foam, leave it on for a few minutes, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available in some health food stores, but Amazon shipping is quick so I decided to go that route rather than drive around until i found it.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap however, the smell is very strong.  Some people may think it a bit too strong.  I first saw the product at the Adirondack Museum.</li>
    <li> Returned. Smells like a wood stove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what tar smells like, but this soap must smell like pine, because it makes me think of the fish that my uncles make on the grill, which is an awesome scent to take a shower with. As others have said, the smell is not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin for a long time. It does leave a perfume in the bathroom for the rest of the day, but again, I enjoy the smell of burning wood in a grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that I ordered this soap from is highly professional, and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the condition that my soap arrived in, but they offered me a discount when I e-mailed them.</li>
    <li> I love grandpa&#x27;s soap. My father&#x27;s barber gave some to me for free and I was reluctant at first to try it because it smelled weird. My dad said that he used it for his acne and it worked wonders so I tried it. Upon first use I noticed that it made my face alot smotther. Now of course you still have to use a facial lotion in addition to the soap because it is SOAP (DUH) but with the combination it really works! My friend had a very dry spot on her scalp in the front of her head and was so embarrassed by it that she kept her hair covered. She had been trying to get rid of it for weeks and nothing was working. I told her to try the soap that night and the next day the spot was gone! I got my friends using this soap and we all love it! The smell is odd but that&#x27;s because it is made of tar. For those people complaining of the smell, common sense would tell you that tar already has an awful smell so that should have been expected. The smell DOES NOT last all day. Just put some facial lotion on, like oil of olay and things will be fine. I really do love this product! I have been using it for 1 year.</li>
    <li> I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps (4.25 Ounces) at a going out of business sale. I thought I was getting a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [blank]. I had to toss all of them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
    <li> If you search amazon for \\&quot;shaving soap\\&quot; this one comes up in the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably shouldn&#x27;t because it is not good for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make a lot of lather, but that lather evaporates on your face and what remains doesn&#x27;t do much to protect from nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the shaving soaps containing the most noxious chemicals seem to make the best lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap, on the other hand, has a very \\&quot;green\\&quot; list of ingredients and it&#x27;s made in the USA.  If you need soap for other reasons than shaving, it is likely a good buy for those reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As so many other reviews have noted, this soap also has a pine tar aroma which, it seems, you either love or hate.  The aroma lingers after use, but eventually wears off.  You will mostly notice it as your bathroom&#x27;s latest \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good soap, but not for shaving.</li>
    <li> my husband actually found this and I was very skeptical. I have bouts where my exzema goes crazy and this soap actually does the trick to help relieve the itching.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to help out with my son&#x27;s psoriasis and it works. It does have that tar smell in which I do not mind and neither does he. As long as it gets the job done to loosen and remove those scales.</li>
    <li> I do like this soap, it really makes lots of suds, also it supposed to be  healthy for your skin, I use this soap most always..</li>
    <li> I have never used pine tar soap, so the jury is still out. I have been using it for shampoo and a beard wash for the past week and it truly does a great job at cleaning but definitely smells like old fashioned soap that my grandpa would use!! I will for sure be keeping a bar or two under my bathroom sink at all times.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with flaky skin under my beard and some other dermatitis. This stuff really helped. It makes the whole bathroom smell like smoke, but the smell doesn&#x27;t really stick to you. Very nice lather. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Grandpa always was a true man.  Not just a guy, but a concentrated form of masculinity and testosterone caged within a framework of bulging muscles, battle scars, perfect facial hair, and slick slacks.  Maybe it was his pleasantly infectious scent of Old Spice and beer I remember most, or maybe it was his enthralling stories he always told.  I remember one story particularly well which lead me to this review; it went a little like this.  Grandpa lived in a time where the work was tough, the women were gorgeous, and everyone&#x27;s voice sounded like they were speaking really fast into a soup can.  One day on his way home from the coal mine, he found himself in an unfortunate predicament:  His pickup truck broke down quite far from home and it was quickly becoming dark and cold.  With an empty stomach and an aching body soaked in sweat, his instincts lead him to venture out into the pine forest and survive.  His first order of business was to construct a fire.  After chopping down a rather burly pine tree (with his bare hands I might add), he used only the wood and a little wisdom to build a roaring fire.  What he heard next was either a godsend or a deathwish.  The roar of a mountain lion that echoed through the hills and valleys made him realize that there were two hungry animals in that forest, and only one was going to be eating dinner.  Like the hardguy that he was, he tore out into the forest after the beast.  After an hour of tracking and sneaking, Grandpa pounced on the beast and dismantled it (also with his bare hands).  Unfortunately for the powerful mountain cat, it really was a one sided battle; it didn&#x27;t stand a chance.  After dragging the 150 pound carcass to his fire pit, he expertly carved up the animal and had a feast that couldn&#x27;t be rivaled even by today&#x27;s standards.  Grandpa&#x27;s final problem for the night quickly became evident: an itch all over that even the best nails couldn&#x27;t scratch.  Was it the caked on coal soot?  Or was it the salt deposits lefton his battered skin from a day&#x27;s worth of sweat?  I&#x27;m not sure and it really doesn&#x27;t matter, but Grandpa had to get a good washing.  Using some of the pine tree ashes, some mountain lion tallow, and the local river, Grandpa fashioned one of the best soaps of all time.  He bathed in the nearby bustling rapids and felt like a new man.  His skin was left as soft as a baby&#x27;s rear without any odors of perfume.  In fact, he smelled even more manly than before, just like a roaring campfire.  He was shortly thereafter rescued by a pack of beautiful, nude tribal women and lived on to share his great new invention with generations to come.  Times have changed and Grandpa&#x27;s famous Pine Tar Soap is no longer made with mountain lion tallow, but more environmentally friendly vegetable fats.  The important takeaway is that the legend lives on.  Every time you use this soap, you will find yourself in that brisk forest just like Grandpa on that evening many, many years ago.  Your skin will be left soft, supple, and rejuvenated thanks to Grandpa&#x27;s all natural formula.  And you will honestly find yourself smelling not like a bright flowery meadow, but a live crackling fire.  Grab this bar of soap and relive the legend of ol&#x27; Grandpa.  Who knows, maybe you&#x27;ll find out there&#x27;s a little bit of Grandpa in you.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people like this. I used it twice and it completely dreid out my skin.  Was horrible.  I am sure it works for some people.  If you have rosacea think twice before using.</li>
    <li> After trying dozens if not hundreds of different soaps in my lifetime, I came upon Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.  I was sick of the perfumed crap that passes as a man&#x27;s body wash.  Most soaps are full of chemicals and scents that do nothing except dry out your skin and leave you smelling like a Miami gigolo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definitely different, but having grown up in the country it is a welcome and familiar smell.  My wife&#x27;s first comment was &amp;#34;wood burning fireplace?&amp;#34;  For some this might be a turn off, but the smell reminds me of Autumn and the outdoors.  Also, that smell fades fairly quick, leaving you with nothing but clean, fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to be clean and smell like a man, I suggest you stay away from Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap.  Since you want to smell like your grandmother&#x27;s boudoir, your best bet is Axe or one of the multitudes of other chemical concoctions pushed on consumers.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes that Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap would help with my psoriasis, but after using almost daily for 3 weeks, I can&#x27;t say it helped all that much if any at all.  If anything I would say that the soap leaves the skin feeling dry, and I found myself using more lotion to compensate, but would still end up itchy towards the end of the day.  Psoriasis is a weird thing though, so you may have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviews note, the odor is very strong and takes some getting use to, but it is not entirely offensive either.  Kinda manly actually, and not too dissimilar from the smell of coal tar shampoo.</li>
    <li> It smells funny, yeah. A little bit. BUT dang it is some good stuff! I use it as a shampoo for my very dry itchy scalp. My hair feels so clean and bright. My scalp feels SO good and not itchy. I have tried like 3 other special shampoos and they worked but smelt WAY worse and were full of really nasty toxic chemicals that long exposure to you know MIGHT cause CANCER. They also made my hair all dry and icky. Like after you&#x27;ve dyed your hair too much and it gets all gross and fried. But this stuff, with a nice conditioner afterwards that kinda funky pine smell just smells clean and fresh. Like cleaner than you&#x27;ve ever been. I have super model hair now. It&#x27;s amazing. Bonus as a really good soap too. Skin feels awesome! You wont find anything better than this stuff. And you know what you&#x27;re putting on to your body is safe. Check out all the ingredients on [...] A great resource for knowing how safe the things your use everyday really are. This stuff is SAFE and GOOD! USE IT!</li>
    <li> Love the soap.  Works wonders on your skin as others have said.  The problem is the ladies in your house---wife, girlfriend, daughters (whatever you have).  At some point they are going to put the hammer down on your new smell--you&#x27;ll either have to get rid of the soap or them.  Be prepared for that.</li>
    <li> Rinses squeaky clean; smells strong to use, but after use, there is no ordor.</li>
    <li> I had a rash after my c section ony belly and read online that this soap might help.  As soon as I used it the rash went away over 3 days.  However I also stopped taking the Norco pain killer and used a steroid cream at the same time, but I do feel like the soap made a big difference.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis. This has helped keep new spots from breaking out. I had bad itching, using this I&#x27;m good till my next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell at first took some getting used to. Not on me, just the bar of soap sitting there. After a couple of uses that subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband a ton of different man soaps for Christmas. This one was an impulse buy on Amazon. I bought him at least four other different brands, and this was, by far, my least favorite. I don&#x27;t think it smells good, and the smell is STRONG. If I left it out, it would stink up the whole room. The other pine tar soaps I bought didn&#x27;t bother me like this one did. If I&#x27;d bought it at a regular store, I probably would have taken it back (or better yet, not have bought it to begin with). I had to put it in a zipper bag when I got it, so it wouldn&#x27;t stink up the house and so he wouldn&#x27;t know what it was. I reluctantly gave it to him, and I&#x27;m not looking forward to him actually using it. Additionally, when I received it, the box was all mashed up and open, so the soap never stayed in there correctly. This is my least favorite purchase from Amazon in a long time.</li>
    <li> Soap is not something I thought I would be writing a review about but this soap is worth it. This soap is nothing like what I&#x27;ve gotten from the grocery store. It small great, keep in mind it has a heavy woodsy musk smell to it, but if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for it is great. The scent will fill the shower and while it is a really strong scent it won&#x27;t come off on you too much. As an unexpected benefit it helps with finicky skin.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers wonderfully and cleans well without over drying skin.  The only thing I can say to beware of is the smell.  It is NOT subtle.  You will come out of the shower smelling like you bathed in Pine Sol.  It has a VERY strong smell of creosote like wooden railroad ties.  It&#x27;s not a light pine scent.  If you are OK with that then by all means, get this soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap on review recommendations when I was looking for a product to help my unknown skin ailment.  It has worked wonderfully and eased my problem a great deal.  I also use it every few days on my face to help with my occasional break-outs.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell and have found that it fades over time-or maybe I am getting used to it!  Since I love more natural products, I also bought some of the other Grandpa&#x27;s soaps and gave them to my friends and family to try.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell, but my girlfriend does not. It does smell STRONGLY of the woods, so be prepared. I have mild eczema, and really hoped that all of the reviews weren&#x27;t lying. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t seem to have any affect, either positive or negative. Perhaps I am an anomaly, or perhaps other users have encountered this. The soap itself lasted awhile, but I chose not to purchase it again. I know some people use this to wash their face and hair, but given my long hair, I decided against it, and have no comment as to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I would say that for the price, if you&#x27;re looking for an aid to your skin conditions, this is worth a shot, although as with anything, results will vary. The smell is strong, and you will probably either love it or hate it, but there is only one way to find out really.</li>
    <li> I tried grandpas because I am always looking for the simplest, greenest, cheapest way to keep my home and body clean and because of my moderate dandruff. I have passed this soap several times at the store over the last few years and wondered if it would work but figured it would make my hair a nasty mess like the Dr. Bronners castile soap does in our hard water. In my desperate search to be greener by way of eliminating plastic out of our lives as much as possible and getting rid of my itchy scalp I finally gave grandpas a try. I am very pleased with it so far, if this changes i&#x27;ll update ASAP. It does smell like rubber tires but also has a hint of earthy to it. I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell. Also I have shoulder length hair and had no problem getting it to lather up all over my head. I actually mis-judged it and used way more than I needed because I assumed it would be hard to work through all my hair.</li>
    <li> i use this soap for when i am hiking and camping or hunting. it has a nice natural pine smell and it is just all around good soap.</li>
    <li> Lathers good and rinses clean but literally I can smell this soap from outside the bathroom.  It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend and he seems to like the way the soap works. It does smell but he said  it is working slowly. The service from the seller was super good and fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this old-fashioned product appeals to people who grew up with it or are familiar with it. And maybe the strange smell is appealing to some. But neither I nor my wife liked the smell of this soap. And it smells nothing like pine - it may smell exactly like pine tar, but we realized we don&#x27;t know what that is...</li>
    <li> Pupps gone ... So glad I order this soap .... Had Pupps at 32 weeks at 36 it&#x27;s was almost gone .... 39 weeks and enjoying my prego belly....</li>
    <li> I first began using Pine Tar soap as a medic in Vietnam to treat all kinds of skin conditions. It just seemed to work like magic on everything from rashes to eczemas to itchy scalp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, it seemed to disappear from the shelves and I thought they had stopped making it.  However, every now and then I would find an old drugstore somewhere that carried a few bars and I bought whatever they had.  Now I see that Amazon carries it and at a great price too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from any kind of skin condition, you should try one bar. Some people complain about the smell but personally I like the smell.  It has a woody odor and even that disappears within an hour.</li>
    <li> I purchase items on Amazon several times a week and have never written a review, but I had to write about how much I love grandpas pine tar soap! I bought it because I have terrible psoriasis on my scalp. Not only does it clear up the psoriasis patches on my scalp 100% my hair has never been so soft and healthy! Buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I will ever use again! (You may wonder about using a bar of soap to shampoo your hair but it works very well and I have hair almost to my waist)</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because I have a number of skin issues.  Admittedly, it smells like a smokey fire, but this stuff works!  Totally has cleared up my eczema, and I don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer any more - and after only 3 uses.  I don&#x27;t like taking a bunch of medicines, and this stuff is so effective that I don&#x27;t need to use many of them any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this even if I didn&#x27;t have so many skin issues - it leaves my skin moist and smooth, but not greasy.  It&#x27;s better than even a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you could argue that this stuff is a bit expensive, but when you consider that it really replaces moisturizer (for me), then it is cost-effective - and that&#x27;s without factoring in prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL ISNT THAT GREAT BUT MY SKIN LOVES THIS! I SUFFER FROM PSORASIS AND IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL CLEAN AND HYDRATED. A MUST HAVE PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WITH DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> My favorite soap.  I use it for my hair mostly, it smells great and it helps keep my hair feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> Great soap just can&#x27;t get past the smell</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap for my daughter who was tormented by the very terribly itchy and painful PUPPS rash. In her final month of pregnancy she was suffering beyond belief. She was taking cold showers 6-7 times a day to find some semblance of relief. The pain was so bad we initially thought it may be shingles. The steroid cream prescribed by the doctor didn&#x27;t help and neither did Benadryl. This rash coated her body from her neck down...no area was off limits! She was frantic, scratching incessantly causing her to bleed. Within a week of using this soap her doctor thought the rash had cleared! It went from a flaming red to a light pink. In some areas it cleared up completely. She is only showering twice a day. She gets in the shower, lathers up this not-so-great smelling soap, puts it on her skin and waits 5 minutes to rinse off. The second time she used the soap she was noticing a significant difference. Unexpectedly, her deep red/purple stretch marks (she has a lot--she was a size double zero when she got pregnant) have paled and some are now invisible! If you know anyone who has that pregnancy rash, you need to get them this soap!!</li>
    <li> After previously buying another product from the same manufacturer, I was looking forward to this soap for the fresh pine smell I experienced previously. Unfortunately, the smell is more like the actual pine tar, not pine trees. Smells like stale campfire smoke, or tar, or burning rubber, and the smell is very strong... not just when using the soap but all the time. Made the entire bathroom stink. Had to find different soap and throw this one out.</li>
    <li> Used this product mainly on my long beard.  Beard has always been rough and&lt;br /&gt;dry but this has softened it and the aroma is not overpowering (opinion from Mrs)</li>
    <li> Holy smokes! This soap is magnificent. Talk about lather! Smells like reality too. I recommend it highly for the shampooing of long beards. I&#x27;ll never go back... Can&#x27;t even remember what I&#x27;d go back to...</li>
    <li> Still using it on a regular basic.I feel in time I will see a result.</li>
    <li> Helped post pregnancy rash. I had a PUPPP rash and a reaction to the pitocin. My entire body itched worse than ever before. Tried RX steroids and lost milk supply so I quit that and this was the ONLY thing that gave me relief. Still use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the water makes a difference with how much it smells.  I found the smell pretty mild and it rinses well.  Definitely better than the soap I&#x27;ve been using and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.  I like the &amp;#34;campfire/bacon&amp;#34; smell myself, but glad it isn&#x27;t any stronger.  Nice to have a soap that is &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve also used Bay Rum soap, but that smell lingers more.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap smells! If you&#x27;ve ever been around a real bonfire, you know the way your clothes smell for until you wash them. It smells like that. Maybe some people don&#x27;t like it, but I love it. Reminds me of home.</li>
    <li> I have a 2 Foot (Jack Passion)  plus beard. I&#x27;ve tried other pine tar soap.  Out of the the many other brands I&#x27;ve used none of them have kept my face without flakes or my beard so soft.  If you want to grow a beard,  grandpas pine tar is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it - I think it smells awful.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not used to this soap you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised at the smell and tingly feeling that you get. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Saw this on artofmanliness. So you now its what you want. Its Awesome. Cleanses very well. I was tired of smelling like a teenage boy with irish spring and all of old spices new crazy scents. DONT BUY IF YOU DONT WANT GIRLS UP IN YOUR BUSINESS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOUR INTRIGUING SCENT.</li>
    <li> At first it smelled a little like a freshly blacktopped road but the smell grows on you.  Women may not care for the smell.  It lathers up great and rinses off well.</li>
    <li> This soap has been around for nearly 150 years, unchanged, and I can guarantee it&#x27;s been around in other forms for hundreds, if not thousands of years.  What is great about this soap is that the company still puts its main focus on it, having released other types of soaps over the years.  Their Pine Tar soap is still their flagship product.  That says a lot about this amazing soap.  Now I must admit, at first I was taken aback by the smell of this soap.  It smells like a mixture of campfire and the smell of a new pair of leather boots.  I thought it might be too powerful a scent.  After a few showers, however, I found myself strangely loving it.  Now I even keep a bar at my sink to wash my hands with.  The smell is purely masculine.  It&#x27;s not the smell of Old Spice or your grandfather&#x27;s Pinaud aftershave.  This smell predates that by at least 50 years.  It makes old bay rum aftershave smell fru-fru.  This soap is the smell of your great, great grandfather after a long day on the wagon trail, sitting by the campfire sharpening his hunting knife.  It wreaks of the scent of reward after a hard day&#x27;s toil.  In fact, it&#x27;s THE perfect compliment to a cool shower after a long day in the heat, working under the hot sun.  Irish Spring?  That&#x27;s the stuff of salesmen and accountants.  This is the stuff of cattle ranchers and loggers!  Use it and you will feel like a man (or at least smell like one)!  So do you think the scent might been too much?  You&#x27;re in luck because, after your shower, the scent will not last long.  After 10 minutes, it will be a faint, smokey smell and after a half hour, your natural body scent will prevail.  All that will be left is clean skin and a strong sense of being part of something that&#x27;s been around a LONG time before you.  I recommend it for shampooing and washing but not for shaving.  It doesn&#x27;t give enough lather for shaving.  So buy this stuff!  Get a bar for the shower and one for the bathroom sink.  Once you use it, you won&#x27;t use anything else.lse.</li>
    <li> Best Beard Soap Ever!!!! My wife tells me my beard smells like a campfire everytime I get out of the shower after lathering up with Grandpa!!! It turns me on Soooo much knowing she thinks of camping with me after she sniffs my scent!!! THANKS GRANDPA!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in lieu of the expensive steroid cream my doctor prescribed for my PUPP (Pruritic Urticarial Papules &amp; Plagues of Pregnancy).  It took a few days to clear all of it up but with consistent use (1-2 showers a day using the soap) it has cleared up and has prevented me from being a severe itchy mess.  Definitely recommend to any pregnant women with PUPP!</li>
    <li> Nice soap to use if you want to smell reminiscent of a back woods camp fire.  It&#x27;s not the most economical soap out there for regular use.</li>
    <li> AGAIN - THIS BAR OF SOAP SMELLED SO BAD WE THREW IT AWAY IN GARBAGE CAN: IT KEEPS THE WILDLIFE AWAY FROM THE CAN.</li>
    <li> I had rashes on my legs for 8 months following the birth of my first baby. Prescription creams from the doc did nothing to improve it. I recently got an allergic reaction to something and my arms were covered in ichy red splotches. When my PCP was going to take 10 business days to approve a dermatologist referral, I hit the blogs to find a solution. Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap to the rescue! The first few days of use made it look worse and then the rash started drying out! I am blown away - no more itch and the splotches are slowly disappearing. Always moisturize after using this soap - I used my baby&#x27;s eczema cream Babyganics with colloidal oat. Grandpa&#x27;s soap was around $4 at my local GNC. Great product, great value!</li>
    <li> Great product but be prepared for the smell. It got rid of my rash in no time but the smell is so bad and strong. It took over my whole bathroom even when it was put in a bag and cabinet.</li>
    <li> I am now 37 weeks pregnant with twin boys.  I bought this soap at 32 weeks to relieve the symptoms of a pregnancy rash called PUPPPS.  It was VERY itchy and uncomfortable (to say the least).  My OBGYN said there was nothing we could really do to make the rash go away until delivery.  Just to be sure, I googled it and found that Grandpa&#x27;s soap supposedly would help, so I decided to try it out.  Within a  week, the rash was gone!  I am now on my 2nd bar and will KEEP using it until the twins are born, just in case it decides to come back.  Not the best smelling stuff in the world, but it works!!  If you have a rash of any kind, try it out!  It can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleansing products targeted for sensitive/rosacea/acne prone skin and most leave me feeling dry and/or break me out afterwards. The pine tar soap does a great job at cleaning the skin, while not over-drying. I also believe it helps with breakouts. I have just recently purchased several bars because it is dirt cheap!!</li>
    <li> The scent is a little strong but it does the job and the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around too long.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing and not a commercial version.  It has a strong piney order but this is what you want to reduce inflammation and itching.</li>
    <li> Started using this a few days back. It feels awsome when washing my beard and it smells great. But it leaves a few things to be desired when using it as a body soap. Guess I&#x27;m just too used to modern soaps.</li>
    <li> I need something to wash my face that won&#x27;t make my skin breakout. I heard about Pine Tar Soap, so I gave it a try. It works! My face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, it has a strong odor​, but not a bad one. It keeps my face smooth and smelling nice. I only use this soap on my face. If you have a problem with other soaps like the name brands on the market affecting your skin, try Pine Tar Soap!</li>
    <li> Good stuff if you can stand the smell</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap - gentle, pure, and natural ingredients mixed with the smell of outdoorsy manliness ;-)  Gets used up a bit fast but otherwise great soap</li>
    <li> use it for my psoriasis works great, took about 5 days to calm my psoriasis but it worked.  has a faint smell but does not last on you.</li>
    <li> I am rating this 4 stars with a warning, prepare for the smell. I do like it, but it is incredible intense. So intense, it may be the strongest smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Though it does reduce over a week or so. Be warned!</li>
    <li> A good, solid clean, especially for pregnant bellies where itchy skin is an issue.  Clean, non-irritating.  The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me, even though it is strong, it&#x27;s not a fakey perfumey smell.  I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while.</li>
    <li> This is for the mamas out there suffering from PUPPS. Buy this soap now!  It came recommended by my midwife, and as the rash and discomfort spread, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to take their advice. From first wash to relief it was probably about 5 days, and that was washing at least twice a day. Be sure to avoid hot water, which will exacerbate, and cleanse/rinse with cold water. I have also been taking Dandelion and I think the combo did the trick. Look it up - and get relief!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I can understand why the ONLY reason people don&#x27;t like it is because some don&#x27;t like the smell so much, because other than that there is nothing to complain about!  When I initially opened the box, the smell was VERY strong.  I was almost apprehensive to try it, so I waited until the weekend in case the smell stuck.  I was very, very pleased with what I found - which was that the smell is not quite so strong once you have used it.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have gotten used to it, but it doesn&#x27;t stick with your skin all day long.  It leaves you smelling clean and fresh, at least in my experience.  My husband said he couldn&#x27;t smell the &amp;#34;campfire-y&amp;#34; smell after I used it either.  I have extremely dry skin especially in the winter in MN, and have only used my soap a few times so I will update with results once I have been using it longer, but I am hoping it will help to clear up the dry patches I get on my upper arms.</li>
    <li> When I got this soap for my boyfriend we were both very excited to have our bathroom smelling like pine and woods and campfires, as other reviewers have described. While the soap works great, the smell is not a pleasant outdoorsy one. It is straight up beef jerky smell. And it doesn&#x27;t dissipate after the shower...the first time he used it, it smelled very strongly of beef jerky for the next two days! I don&#x27;t know if we got a bad batch or what. We don&#x27;t want to waste it, but until we figure out how to use it best, it&#x27;s just sitting in the shower.</li>
    <li> This soap gives me the &amp;#34;squeakiest&amp;#34; clean I&#x27;ve ever had.  The lather is rich and thick as well.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this soap. If you think it&#x27;s just for men, think again. The scent is very clean and the soap suds up really well. If you are looking for a new soap to use, then this one is worth a try!</li>
    <li> This soap, its just plain awesome. I always felt a little vain having so many skin/ hair products in my shower, and after a solid week of using this I have replaced them all. On top of that, it smells so damn manly. I had read most of the reviews on here about this soap before buying it with the notion that most of the people enjoyed bath and body works products before using this soap, but I will admit that the first time this soap got wet the resin smell was more than I bargained for. I got used to it the second shower though, and I could hardly notice a scent 30 mins after i dried off. I also suffer from mild eczema on my forearms and eyelids, and this soap has subdued most of my symptoms much to my relief. It should go without saying to steer clear of your eyes, but consider yourselves warned. It hurts. Like the fires of hell, it hurts. My only complaint about this soap is that after using it for a week, it seems to have diminished very quickly. Maybe I used too much. Idk. But I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I guess it&#x27;s great for hippies since you don&#x27;t have to kill any trees. and best of all its&#x27; not made of animal fats anymore. Thanks Grandpa!</li>
    <li> I read the existing reviews and didn&#x27;t put to much stock in the product since I have used most products on the market for my issues. But this product, is just simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;With the first use you will see an improvement. Highly recommended product can&#x27;t wait to get more, very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I like this soap, works for me and has helped with my skin condition. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad and fades quickly.Check out the Grandpas Soap Site as you can get it at a better price.</li>
    <li> The 4.25 ounce box is just one bar of soap, but I had thought it might also come as soap flakes, sicne it doesn&#x27;t specify that it is just a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is nicer than &amp;#34;zest&amp;#34; bars, but dries out your skin more than &amp;#34;dove&amp;#34; bars. It smells very nice, and like &amp;#34;a deep wood smell&amp;#34;. Definitely a manly, outdoor type scent, but after you wash it off, it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong, so would be fine for women as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it less than dove for moisturizing, but much higher on the scent. I&#x27;ll still stick to dove, but it was a nice change, and better than your average bar of soap.</li>
    <li> MAN! BEARD! FLANNEL! BEARD! SOAP! CLEAN MAN! CLEAN BEARD! MAKE BEARD SOFT FOR LADIES! YOU BUY! BE MAN! GET LADIES!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how well it works.  When a friend recommended it I laughed, I&#x27;m not laughing now.</li>
    <li> The smell grows on you. You have to re-train your brain to think of tar as something clean and pleasant. Once you do this its not bad, its actually quite nice. Will say that your bathroom will smell like this soap the whole time you have it. It really is quite pungent. If you buy this soap, you wont regret it, but just realize you are doing it for you, not for anyone else. Just you.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap on the recommendation of a friend who,like me, has very sensitive skin. The soap lathers nicely, cleans well, and seems to leave my skin a little less dry than other soaps. So why three stars? Frankly this soap smells appalling, and the smell is overwhelming.  The closest thing I could compare the smell to is a lump of charcoal and the smell permeates the whole bathroom. If you are someone bothered by strong smells give this soap a wide berth.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for da beard. Also reduces redness on skin</li>
    <li> Greatest soap in the world</li>
    <li> For over five dollars, I&#x27;d expected this soap to be a bit more . . . awesome? I had heard great reviews of it on Art of Manliness and other places, mostly about the rustic scent. And I like the scent, very nice, but when it comes down to it, it&#x27;s just soap. A  nearly six dollar bar of soap. The smokey scent isn&#x27;t really worth the ridiculous price, and I can find other soaps that don&#x27;t over-dry my skin for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The stress of a week long hospitalization for a pulmonary embolism set off a nasty, nasty itchy rash I&#x27;d never heard of: rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis. (I have rheumatoid arthritis and have read extensively on it, but this was definitely a new one on me.) Anyway, after staying bonked out on benadryl for a week thinking it would pass (it took a month) I remembered how much pine tar shampoos help for scalp itching and started searching. This stuff was such a gift to help the itching - and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. To me it smells like a snuffed out campfire or fireplace, which might not be a wonderful smell, but it is a nice nostalgic smell for me. A cousin visiting recently tried it and loved it - no objection to the smell. I now use it even when the rash isn&#x27;t flared up, though I&#x27;ve got a lot of body washes to work through before I re-order this. Once I work through those, this might become my regular soap. I always feel guilty about the plastic bottles used for body washes, even though I recycle them!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find this great old time soap locally for a while and I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  It keeps my husband&#x27;s psoriasis in check and keeps my allergy prone sensitive skin clean and protected. Thrilled to find it on amazon. The soap works for so many things, from acne to heat rashes, couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It can really resolve skin issues on the scalp. I have used it for years and I find it to work better than more well known products. Grandpas also has a shampoo too. However, I find that this product works great on both skin and hair. Smells natural too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the good and bad reviews on here and here&#x27;s my input. 1. It&#x27;s a damn good soap, 2. If you&#x27;re a real man and not one of these Metrosexuals then you&#x27;ll like it. It smells manly not like that of most soaps today. 3. My girlfriend loves the smell (that of a campfire in which pine trees were used) me I love the soap, the smell, and how it leaves me feeling. Thanks Grandpas Brand.</li>
    <li> My husband has dermatitis on his feet so I surprised him with this soap which I hoped would help with some of the itch, albeit I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be a cure or anything.  The first thing I noticed about it was the SMELL.  Wow.  It is really pungent and nasty.  It bothered me, but I thought if it would help my husband I would somehow shower with it in the same stall.  But I actually couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell and would have to remove it everyday and if I even went into my bathroom my nose was assaulted.  My husband said he could barely smell it, so maybe it&#x27;s just my sensitive nostrils.  After a week of daily use he had no benefits whatsoever from the soap and we gave it up and put it into the trash.  I give it two stars because obviously they&#x27;ve put time into putting some sort of active ingredient into it and maybe it would help some people.</li>
    <li> In her 3rd trimester, my wife was diagnosed with a horrible case of PUPPPs (or PEP if you are in the UK).  The rash spread over the majority of her body, leaving only her hands, feet, and head unscathed.  Not quite on board with early induction and with no relief from the prescription steroid, we began trying a plethora of remedies (see below).  The only relief came in the form of a little brown bar of soap that had the added bonus of smelling like BBQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pine Tar Soap provided the best relief and within a very short amount of time.  Using the bar in the shower once a day, the rash lightened and disappeared within 3 days.  3 days!  If you have PUPPPs, this surely sounds like a dream, but it is true.  On top of the lightening rash, the itching diminished immediately after the first shower and never returned as much more than a small itch here or there.  Given that this particular case was deemed the worst the midwife’s office had ever seen (one of the midwifes had also had PUPPs), we were skeptical of any improvement, but this was amazing!  Indeed, the office now carries Pine Tar Soap to give to any woman that suffers (and I do mean suffers) from PUPPP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have PUPPPS absolutely do not hesitate to buy this soap.  In fact, buy it right now and pay for the fastest shipping you can afford.  And use a washcloth to apply – nothing that will be abrasive or work to scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other remedies we tried and our experience with them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarna Cream – Fairly effective when applied at least twice a day.  This, in conjunction with the soap, seemed to be the ideal remedy.&lt;br /&gt;Dermoplast Pain Relieving Spray – About 10 minutes of relief.  It’s medicinal smell and sticky residue were most off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;Prescription Steroid Cream – Relief for a matter of moments. Not effective enough to warrant further use.&lt;br /&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar – This one’s supposed to work when sprayed onto the rash.  Nope.  Absolutely no relief.&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal Baths and Oatmeal Soap – These both worked to make the rash and itching worse since they dry the skin., the last thing you want to do if you have PUPPPs.  The only relief felt was in the water.  As soon as she was out, itching was worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;Poison Ivy Soap – Again, intensifies itching as it dries the skin.  Use at your peril.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera – Not effective on a serious case of PUPPPs.  May work for small rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you may have luck where we struck out or you may not find the Pine Tar Soap effective. Talk to your doctor and make the right choice for you.

    <li> Exceptionally strong smell, but not too bad when you apply it to skin. My girlfriend hates it, so I won&#x27;t be using it except on camping trips and such. Oh well :)</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this and mostly the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice to bathe with and to treat yourself to something a little unusual.&lt;br /&gt;So i highly recommend Pine Tar Soap i think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for skin irritations.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I always seem to get a weird eczema on my hands when I&#x27;m pregnant in the winter.  This was recommended to me by someone at Sprouts (it&#x27;s about $4 there) and sure enough, it works.  It won&#x27;t work overnight but within a few days, you will see an improvement.  I cut them in half, have them by the sinks and don&#x27;t let anyone else use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells manly (otherwise it&#x27;d be a 5 star product).  It took awhile to get used to, but having clear skin definitely outweighs the funk.  I&#x27;ve even started using it on my baby&#x27;s bottom when he has terrible diaper rashes and it clears it up faster than regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.  I recommend it to everyone I know with skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit like bacon or jerky, definitely not for the fru fru girls bathroom, but for the man cave it&#x27;s great.  Great lather, excellent cleaning and clearing up/preventing of psoriasis issues</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely fashion and it was just like advertised. This is a good product and I am very satisfied with this company</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a man should smell. Every girl I&#x27;ve gotten close to has noticed it and liked it. I&#x27;ll use this for a long time!</li>
    <li> does the job, manly, simple soap</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> I primarily got this soap to try and help my Psorasis. It did not help with it and it has a very strong smell.  The smell goes away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soap it does its job. Anything else your expecting don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
    <li> Have to deal with the smell, but great results. I need to buy more. Thank you</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry skin that has problems with shedding, eczema, or icthyosis, this is the best soap you can use. I bought the shea butter one too, but found this one most effective and moisturizing. It&#x27;s the best soap you can use for icthyosis.  Edit/ update: I&#x27;ve stopped using soap completely now, except in bubble bath. Now I use a korean italy towel, and it basically is the only thing I need. The dirt comes off and my eczema and dry skin cracks visibly reduced by at about 1/3 in one session. My skin glowed.</li>
