<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These sponges are AMAZING! I have been using it in the shower every day for a week and my face is so clear and bright. Is evenade my pores appear smaller!  Seriously I haven&#x27;t stopped talking about them or telling my friends and family to buy them. I never want to be without this sponge 💜</li>
    <li> Greatly improved the texture of my skin after a week of use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves them and the way her skin is much less oily.</li>
    <li> These sponges are awesome and i received them really fast! Been using them since i got them and wow they clean your face extremely well, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I have been using the black one for about a month and I can still tell a difference before and after use. My skin feels much smoother and cleaner and I absolutely love not having to use any soapy products! I even use it on my lips for extra exfoliation as they tend to be chapped in my dry climate. I am really enjoying it so far and am looking forward to using the white and green ones as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, thought they just wiped off my cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love the soft feel against my face. I am finally now an avid (morning and night) face washer! A wash cloth simply does not compare! I am so pleased with these sponges that I will soon be purchasing more for gifts. This is a fabulous company -great costumer service- and a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The sponges are great! I saw the difference in my skin  after the first use. I have only used the black one and will use the others soon. Ordered again and I use each sponge for about one month before replacing.</li>
    <li> love, love, love these sponges. gentle efoliation for my easily irritated skin and bioegradble too. awesome seller...stellar product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different konjac sponges and these have to be my favorite. They are so cute and work really well for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These sponges work as the perfect gentle exfoliator for my moms skin &amp; for my skin to! I would definitely buy these again :)</li>
    <li> I like the sponge, it holds up well but I do wish it were larger.</li>
    <li> These sponges are excellent and I have used them with  or without cleanser and my skin feels clean and soft afterward. A great alternative or even use in between clarisonic type cleaners. I found my clarisonic too much for daily use so I use this sponge on off days and it&#x27;s perfect! Make sure to wet the sponge really well until it softens and then cleanse with it.</li>
    <li> Loving them. Only been 2 days, but I have the most sensitive skin and this makes it glow and feel firmer, pores are tighter. Great deal 3 for $15, I will definitely purchase again! I loved them so much I sent a some to my friend!</li>
    <li> Okay products, and if you&#x27;re buying them for yourself they&#x27;re rather small so it&#x27;s probably overpriced and I&#x27;d go for the regular ones.  If it&#x27;s a gift for someone who&#x27;s never used these sponges but who likes baths and/or spa stuff, it&#x27;s probably nice.</li>
    <li> Love the Konjac sponge. Very good quality! Fast shipping and highly recommended. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These sponges are a very good value but they aren&#x27;t as high quality as some that you will spend more $ on. However, with that said, these do just as effective a job of cleaning and exfoliating than ones you&#x27;ll spend twice as much on. I did notice a difference in the texture between these and one I spent a little more on ($10 for one). These felt less like a natural plant based sponge than the other however, they weren&#x27;t as slimy feeling and to me that&#x27;s a plus. These also seem to have a little less porosity however they lather quite nicely. I included a picture so you can see the difference in porosity between these (the green tea one) and the more expensive one. I can&#x27;t attest to the claims of green tea (protectant) or charcoal (oil absorbant) infused sponges because it seems after the first use, once you rinse them, you would rinse away any additives that it&#x27;s infused with. But, in case there is some additives still left after rinsing I only use the plain white konjac sponge to apply my facial soap. The others I use when my skin is too dry for soap but needs a wash anyhow and I can say they leave my skin feeling very soft and clean even without soap. I don&#x27;t use the charcoal one much because I recently moved to a very dry climate and don&#x27;t want to further dry out my skin but the green tea one does leave behind a nice, clean feeling. All in all, these are great exfoliating sponges to use and they&#x27;re a great pick for those just discovering konjac sponges so you can figure out which works the best for your skin. No need to spend a lot of money on one sponge if you&#x27;re not yet sure which is the best one for you, so a triple pack is the more economical, sensible product to choose.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my product, service, and delivery. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  My face has never felt so clean and smooth.  My son also has been using one and likes it very much as well.  i intend to order more as needed.  Update:  Have ordered more sponges and have given a couple more to family members.  They all love them.  It is the best thing i have ever found for getting my face super clean and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars, Awesome Products</li>
    <li> I only just got my sponges and have used  the green tea one a couple of times. I have to say it seems to leave my skin very soft. The sponge is hard when you get it but once it has soaked up it&#x27;s first bath and expanded it stays soft and does not need to be soaked again - just wet. I have not used any product with it yet so can&#x27;t comment on how that is.</li>
    <li> After using for only a week there is a noticable improvement in my skin. Really like these sponges!</li>
    <li> I have had my sponge for about five days and find it just fine. My face feels and looks somewhat better. More to come at the end of my three month trial. Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought these as alternative to buying chemical filled face wash. However, I was disappointed even after hanging it to try as suggested it wouldn&#x27;t dry fully and started to smell after a few days of use and caused me to breakout.   Update: After reading about my bad experience with the product customer service reached out in order to address my complaints. The customer service representative Beth was working for almost an entire month trying to assist me with getting a refund, which was difficult because I bought the item through Amazon Warehouse. She kept in constant contact updating me on the progress. Unable to assist in a return they sent me a gift card with the cost of item. Some of the best customer service I have experienced in awhile</li>
    <li> I am very happy I purchased these sponges. They appear small at first but they expand to the expected size once they are saturated, and they feel quite good on the skin. I use mine for face washing. I&#x27;ll likely get more once these have run their course.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE SPONGES, I HAVE USED THEM BEFORE BUT NOT BY THIS COMPANY BECAUSE I GOT MINES IN JAPAN WHERE I LIVE. THE QUALITY WAS THE SAME, GREAT! ITS NICE AND SOFT ON MY SENSITIVE SKIN. I USED A LITTLE OF MY FACE WASH AND MY SKIN FELT EFOLIATED AND SMOOTH. I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I bought these instead of buying face wash. I assumed since the black one was infused with charcoal that it would be relatively cleansing. It also states in the description that the sponges are naturally cleansing. I washed my face 3 times before realizing that it was not going to get my face clean. I used it again today with soap and it left a strange residue on my face. The face wash I was using was not new so I knew it wasn&#x27;t my soap leaving the residue. Let me be clear- nothing about this sponge will leave you feeling squeaky clean. I was especially surprised because I have good skin and am not excessively oily. I appreciated the consistency of the sponge and like using it instead of a washcloth but I will definitely not be purchasing again. If returning things wasn&#x27;t such a hassle, (I live far from the post office) I would return these for a refund.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but it&#x27;s seems average when compared to others. I like the three kinds, regular, charcoal, and green tea. They are individually wrapped which is also nice. They&#x27;re small for whole body use, but my problem skin is my face, shoulders, and upper back and it&#x27;s just fine for that.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised - good variety, shape</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these sponges! The charcoal one I use myself and my skin appears smoother already. The white one has improved my daughters eczema on her arms. The green one i gave to my mother and her skin is glowing! I will purchase again. the sponges are larger than I expected. Perfect size. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> These sponges are the truth! By it self they work fine, I use mines with black soap. The green sponge really help with lightening up your skin. I have used the green and the black one (the only reason why I changed is because someone decided to use it and I don&#x27;t using sponges after someone). A great inexpensive investment for your skin.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. My face feels so clean after using</li>
    <li> Great product for a nice price! Fast service and packaged neatly. So far the charcoal is fantastic! Cannot wait to try the other two!</li>
    <li> I LOVVVVVVE these sponges! They&#x27;re absolutely awesome! My skin is super sensitive so I&#x27;ve been using the white one. I gave my teenage brother the black one (for his acne), and I gave my mom the green one. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin! My skin is so much clearer and smoother.</li>
    <li> I love that these sponges are gentle, but still scrub nicely. Adorable/excellent packaging. Officially my Buff Puff replacement!</li>
    <li> Really loving these sponges.  I use the charcoal on my face and have noticed a dramatic improvement in the texture of the skin on my face.  I use with or without a cleanser.  It seems to aid in increasing the effectiveness of my daily cleanser, but works well by itself. I&#x27;ve used the natural white on my 4 month old during bathtime and he loves it. Very gentle on his skin.</li>
    <li> They do an amazing job clearing up the pores! I do notice difference in the mirror after using them.  They last for a month or so (used twice a day).</li>
    <li> Arrived in a beautiful package (wasn&#x27;t expecting that). Great idea for gifts now that I know. I have been using the Green sponge and very happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Just enough buffing. I gave the black one to my teenage son as he is developing acne.  It seems to have improved and it gets him to use something other than his fingers with his cleanser.  I plan to get another for my teenage daughter and she can switch between the black and the cream.  Size is just right and I love the string to hang it for drying.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sponges every days and they are amazing..... Just loving it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this i am going to re-purshase i think I&#x27;m going to rave about this everywhere,  just waiting to see how long it last quality wise as time goes by but so far it works great!&lt;br /&gt;worth the price thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of konjac sponges, but there aren&#x27;t any that seem to work better than others. I got this because it&#x27;s way cheaper for each sponge (five versus ten bucks!) and you get a variety of types&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the types don&#x27;t have much to do with the effectiveness of the product. As much as it can be claimed they are &amp;#34;infused,&amp;#34; they&#x27;re mostly just dyed. Maybe if the charcoal ones were using activated charcoal, but eh.&lt;br /&gt;They all work fantastically and the heart shape is great for cuteness AND exfoliating in tight spaces like along the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I enjoy the colored ones better than the white variety pretty much exclusively for aesthetic value. But if they do something, then hey! Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product!</li>
    <li> I have only used the Charcoal sponge but I love it. Thank you for the opportunity to get the sponges. I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love the sponges. My face feels like velvet after each use. I bought them for my seborric dermatitis - so far so good.</li>
    <li> great item. just a FYI each sponge has its own unique smell when wet. also it does not come with a hanger for it to dry.</li>
    <li> Not much to get excited about. Nice idea, but a washcloth works equally as well.</li>
    <li> Nice Sponges , will buy them again , also use it as a sponge for the body .</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using these lovely little sponges.</li>
    <li> The sponges are great, and I enjoy the brand&#x27;s commitment to making sure I like their product and ensuring my happiness.</li>
    <li> These sponges are nice; they come very well packaged and could be given as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!!! They work excellent with getting off dead dry skin!!</li>
    <li> so far i love these sponges, Charcoal, Green Tea &amp; Natural Facial Cleansing &amp; Exfoliating Beauty Sponges . i have been using the charcoal one and just loved it so much that i ordered a set for my God daughter to try . when they came i could not wait to try them to see what everyone else was raving about and now i know . they are a nice fit for your hand and you don&#x27;t have to use anything else with them but since my skin is oily i use mine with an African black soap . my skin is clearer then it&#x27;s ever been before and seeing less of my yucky black heads . and for those who said to soak it first the were right . i can&#x27;t see myself cleaning my face with anything else ever again .</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Sponges arrived fast and in good condition.  They arrive hard but quickly soften when immersed in warm water.  The charcoal sponge I gave to my daughter, she has nice skin but her nose is rough and gets blackheads once in a while.  The sponge leaves her skin feeling smooth and glows right after use.  She does need to put moisturizer after to keep the skin from drying but her nose looks like it is starting to clear.  I use the green tea sponge.  It definitely leaves skin smoother and softer right after use, and the massaging motion is a nice de-stresser. I have not noticed any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; effects yet.  I haven&#x27;t used the white sponge yet, so I cannot comment on that one.</li>
    <li> Love these. They arrived dehydrated, but as with any konjac sponge they puff up quickly once wet. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any particularly significant difference between the colors, but it works out great for sharing- I use the green, my daughters get the black and white ones. They have a string attached so you can hang to dry.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the sponges for very long but I have already noticed a change in the texture of my skin! Really cute packaging, shipped out immediately and arrived within a week, exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend these sponges to anyone interested in trying konjac sponges but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I like these sponges so far and feel they help me clean my face better. The seller sent them out promptly and the customer service was also very good.</li>
    <li> String fell off shortly after using it a couple of times. Felt a little slimier than expected. Thought it would feel more like an exfoliater type sponge, but still early.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed testing and reviewing these products as they have opened my eyes to a completely new experience.  They gently exfoliate your skin, leaving it soft and smooth.  They help to diminish any current breakouts by working deep to eradicate them.  Since I started using these sponges, I have noticed fewer breakouts.  Of all three sponges, I prefer the charcoal and green tea sponges for basic cleaning and I like to use a little bit of cleanser with the white one.  I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this 3-pack so that I could get a good sense of what to expect from  the different types.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how long these cute sponges last.</li>
    <li> Really love the sponges and the company! They emailed me on the day of delivery to make sure I got it and how to best use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the black one for myself and the other two I&#x27;m giving as gifts. I am really glad I kept one for myself as it is a great makeup remover. I use just foundation but it&#x27;s so effective and soft, I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges and they are a great price!  I started with the green sponge as I had some sun burned skin and have been using it for over two months and it&#x27;s still going strong.  About a week ago I also started using the black one just to test it out.  I have not used the white one yet.  I don&#x27;t notice a big difference between the green one and the black one, though the black one seems a little bit more coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges arrived in the lovely heart-shaped box shown and I loved mine so much I order another box to give as a gift.  It makes a very nice gift for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been careful to not wring the sponges as per the instructions, but squeeze them hard to remove excess water.  I still a window in my shower and it&#x27;s still cool enough to leave it open to let the sponges dry.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with mold or mildew and they dry almost completely in 24 hours.  I hang them by the string from a suction hook I put on the window glass.  About every week I let them soak in real hot water to help with any potential bacteria and have even put a bit of alcohol in the water I rinse them with occasionally without any noticeable harm.  I do notice after over two months of use, the green one doesn&#x27;t fluff up quite as much as the newer used black on, but it is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  mostly use these on my face.  However, I have used them on my body and they work great, I just prefer a larger sponge or cloth.  I find it helps to put your fingers through the string when using so it doesn&#x27;t get caught on the sponge/</li>
    <li> Have been using the charcoal sponge every night for about 2 weeks and I can say I notice an improvement in my skin.  I combine nightly cleansing with the Oz Naturals vitamin C and hyuraliac acid serum.  No breakouts save tiny blemishes in that time!  And I normally get at least one during &#x27;that time&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t feel like any other sponge and require some coaxing, I usually run it under the warm water while I brush my teeth to get it started, but after a few minutes it&#x27;s to full size (at least double dry size)&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying a box as a gift for family.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! Great quality at a reasonable price. Lovely presentation.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with these! They exceeded my expectations. They are the perfect size and the quality is fantastic! So far I have only used the green tea sponge but it is amazing with or without your favorite face wash on the sponge. They take your facial makeup off and have a great gentle exfoliate to them. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing them again :)</li>
    <li> First off the seller was amazing! I received multiple emails with their concern for me loving my product and receiving my sponges on time! Not something you see everyday! Now to the sponges themselves, at first they don&#x27;t really look like they will do a good job of cleaning but I was SO wrong. I literally will not be able to live the rest of my life without these sponges. My face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt after using these lol!</li>
    <li> I really love these sponges, I got the trio of charcoal, green tea and plain.  It really does exfoliate and clean thoroughly.  It leaves your skin very very soft.  I have one hanging in the shower and one by my sink.  The only thing to note is that you do have to soak it before every use but it only takes a moment and is not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected. it&#x27;s gentle to skin and cleans better</li>
    <li> These are so cute. I kept the Charcoal for myself and gave the other two to family members. They plump up nicely after soaking in water and shrink right down when left to dry. They have a small thread on them so you can hang it up in your bathroom. They do have a slight slimy feel, but in a nice way. The seller was very nice and sent emails asking me if I liked the product and if it arrived ok which is always really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite time to use it is after I do a strong mud mask. The mud mask usually leaves my skin a little red and because its a new layer of skin it feels a but sensitive after. Using the sponge right after leaves my skin feeling soothed after the mask and seems to make the redness go down as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great Product, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I love this sponge! Very different than any other facial cleansing sponge that I have used. Soft textured sponge that leaves skin silky smooth &amp; beautiful.</li>
    <li> The Konjac Sponges were a gift for a friend and she is delighted with them. The customer service with &amp;#34;The Beauty Shelf&amp;#34; is exceptional and I will definitely purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I was on menocycline, adapaline gel, and prescription strength benzoyl peroxide for over 2 years.  All of this seemed to help a little, but these sponges help the most.  I love these things.  One thing that was kind of a extra bonus was that there are great for prepping for a shave.</li>
    <li> These did not get my face clean, with or without additional cleanser added.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughters are using these and after only a few days are noticing a difference!</li>
    <li> sponges fit the description and appearance in the listing i only used it once but it looks promising and i really liked them</li>
    <li> I recommend these sponges highly. They really helped my skin feel great! Easy to use and the helpful email from the company added to the experience!</li>
    <li> The trio of sponges arrived promptly in a cute heart shaped box. I received an e-mail before their arrival explaining how to maximum the life of the sponges, which I really appreciated. I will definitely purchase from the Beauty Shelf again.</li>
    <li> These are great value, perfect size- as good quality as the one konjac sponge I bought for 12! Would purchase again :)</li>
    <li> These Konjac sponges arrived quickly and were exactly as described. I have used the Charcoal and Green Tea sponges and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Oh my these sponges are brilliant and oh my god heart shape case and heart shape sponges. As a girl, I&#x27;m in love with the designs not to mention the quality of these sponges and what they do for me. I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life and I thought I&#x27;d give these little ones a shot. They have been doing great on my skin. Though I only use it on my face, you can also use them on your body. You can use them without any cleansers and soaps but that wouldn&#x27;t be refreshing when washing your body, would it? I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and I like to separate what I use on my face and body. Plus my body&#x27;s skin is doing fine with body wash and wash cloth. But my face&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that whatever I use, I&#x27;d get these little acne. It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin. Look at me going on and on about stuff and forgetting about these brilliant sponges. Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, they are just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub.They have never give me any acne. they clean my face well. I don&#x27;t use it with cleansers because I want to know how these little sponges do without a cleanser and they are doing wonderful. After using it, I can feel my face being so soft. Also I started noticing my acne being gone a bit. I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin. I love the scent of the white one and the green one. Although,  the charcoal one does have a little charcoal scent which makes me feel like I&#x27;m cooking my face (lol), it&#x27;s a wonderful sponges. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone. Give these little ones a chance to do some miracles on your skin ~ :D Oh and I got these little ones in exchange of an honest review from the wonderful seller &amp;#34;Beth&amp;#34; ~</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the charcoal one once but it was a great feeling. My skin felt very smooth afterwards and you dont need much of any cleaning product. I definitely recommendthis product.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smoother and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for two weeks now and they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Described accurately and with a house full of teens with different facial needs the 3 pack is perfect!  I have found a new staple to our skincare routine!</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of konjac sponges and these are my favorite. They are softer than other konjac sponges I&#x27;ve used and last longer. I buy the white ones for my 9 month old and like the green ones for myself. I love the shape - aside from being cute, the heart shape allows you to really get into the contours of your face. I also love the beautiful box they come in - perfect for gift giving and repurposing!</li>
    <li> Great sponges, did what I expected them to do. Have not had any breakage or tearing yet. I have only used the original and charcoal so far but I like them a lot.</li>
    <li> Nice soft exfoliation</li>
    <li> I gave these to my mom after she had laser resurfacing done on her face.  She had to wash her face every two hours.  A wash cloth hurt her face but these sponges did not hurt her at all.  They were very gently yet they removed all of the dead skin and vaseline.  We will both continue to use the konjac sponges. This 3 pack was the best value I could find and they expand to the perfect size for facial use.</li>
    <li> You can use it every time you wash the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love to use it to wipe off the mask, without hurting the skin. So smooth and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> The main reason I bought the sponges is because I ran across them on line when trying to find something for my mother in law for a gift. However I bought these for myself to see if I would enjoy them. I have some small bumps on my legs I get during the winter months and when I exfoliate they seem to go away and make my skin look better. I was curious if these natural sponges would work instead of beaded soap or lotions.  I have to say so far I enjoy the feel of the sponges and they have worked on helping my skin. I do not use soap on my face but just use these sponges with a lotion of my choice.</li>
    <li> The sponges are wonderful.....My daughter gave me my first one, (not this brand) ....so I researched the reviews of other brands and find this one is a great deal for 3 sponges including the green tea. It has changed the texture of my skin and now my face feels so clean and beautiful all the time. I use it night and day. I do not use my cleanser with it....the reviews for this item were very informative.....hope this will be too..!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t squeeze the water out of the sponge when finished&amp;#62; I actually put in between a wash cloth that is folding in half ...lay it down flat ...then put pressure with the palm of my hand pushing down and it absorbs from the sponge without cracking or tearing the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face and make sure i splash away all the cleanser the splash cool water on my face (this helps close the pores) then i take the sponge and let it absorb water, then rub lightly in circular motions all over and make sure you don&#x27;t miss your temples, the rim of you chin and down your next...it normally takes me 10 minutes....then splash my face with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;It fees so clean and fresh ....amazing ! great choice....</li>
    <li> These sponges are soft and smooth but exfoliate well.  I really enjoy them.</li>
    <li> Only used the charcoal one so far but it&#x27;s great. Three for a good price. Prime shipping. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Great sponges. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Soft, easy to use, and the perfect size. I am used to rougher exfoliation from creams or brushes, but these sponges are soft and it almost feels like I am not exfoliating at all. I am waiting to see if there is any noticeable change to my skin as I continue to use my sponge.</li>
    <li> Lovely and soft, I love the gentle exfoliation! they have kind of a funny smell that stays on my face, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much</li>
    <li> Love Konjac sponges! I usually buy the Boscia brand but these are basically the same thing and price is much more reasonable. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> We are very happy and pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt; After using it for couple of days we&#x27;ve noticed a big change , the skin looks more smooth,  nice , rejuvenate. ....&lt;br /&gt; It is a very good product and we&#x27;ll worthed it .</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time, and these sponges are incredible! I really love how they heal my face, are so gentle, and are fun to look at and use! I would recommend these to anyone who struggles with acne or simply wants an adorable and natural facial cleanser :)!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they are adorable little hearts...how could you not buy them, haha :)!!</li>
    <li> I have used the basic sponge and like it very much. It has taken some getting used to, because it&#x27;s not an exfoliator in the way I&#x27;m used to a more abrasive brush or scrub, but it does seem to take makeup off. It also has a strange texture that does take some getting used to, but once you get past that hurdle, it works very well. I also use it to remove eye makeup- it seems to be gentle enough to use around the eye area. I have not yet used the green or charcoal sponge. I believe I will buy more of these sponges in the future.</li>
    <li> I love how they feel on my skin . All my friends will get them for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love these!  Right now I&#x27;m using the charcoal one.  I use it on my face every morning before I put my lotion/sunblock on.  I read the reviews before buying and I&#x27;m not sure how some people said theirs feel apart after a short while, it seems really sturdy and I don&#x27;t see how it would unless you actually tear at it and don&#x27;t follow the care instructions. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. They are very soft and gentle and cleans well. Both my dughter and I are using them now. The service is also great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I stared using this product after seeing a blurb about it in Glamour Magazine.  I loved them and bought some for my daughter at Christmas and she felt the same way.  She bought some for my granddaughters,  ages 10 and 12 at that time,  and we all continue to use and enjoy them.  I reccommend them for people of all ages and skin types.</li>
    <li> I love my sponges! I was using a different brand in the past, but these ones plump up quicker and last longer than those. I usually put a bit of water in the sink, and then place the sponge inside for about 30 seconds to allow it time to absorb the water. As long as you treat your sponge gently, and let it air dry all the way, you will get at least a couple months of use out of each one. I also gently squeeze out the excess water using a towel, before hanging it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed over the last few months of using the konjac sponges that my skin is brighter. I also had a very stubborn tiny cyst that I was able to exfoliate out because of the sponges. My skin feels cleaner than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Clean and smoother skin! Never heard of these before seeing here and very glad I get them....will reorder Mahalo!</li>
    <li> until now I only used the black one , I LOVE IT .. its so good and I can feel the difference .. I did recommend it to many people already , an I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I let my kids use the natural white and I use the charcoal one. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Right now, only a four star because i am not sure if i see a difference. It is very convenient when i am at the sink and i use the sponge and there is no soapy mess everywhere. It is gentle on my face and it does leave my face soft.</li>
    <li> I have used the charcoal sponge for about a week. The string that&#x27;s connected for hanging ripped off already. So far the black is the only one I&#x27;ve used as I was looking for something a little more abrasive. Not sure this is really doing much? It will take more time to try them all and see if these specific ones are worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! Love the sponges! would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it for me and my baby.  I switched her to natural products on  her skin.  I love the black one for me.  I use the green and the white one on her like a wash cloth.  Not just her face.  Just a note...  To keep from mildewing,  don&#x27;t it keep in the shower.  Hang it up on your mirror or somewhere like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sponges for about a week and really like them.  They have enough texture to help gently clean my face without causing redness  I would highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses the sponges and loving them! Kids love to wash their face now thanks to the feel and look of these sponges. I tried the black sponge on myself and I have a normal skin, and I definitely noticed that my skin was drier. So use it only for oily skin or acne. The green sponge is perfect, my skin feels so soft and moist after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the charcoal sponge and so far I&#x27;m loving it. Definitely will purchase more!</li>
    <li> Konjac Sponges are my new go to DAILY &amp; NIGHTLY,  actually anytime I need a quick refresh. They are gentle enough for my sensitive skin yet sturdy and durable enough to remove a days worth of desert dirt and grime. I would 100% recommend these to anyone I know. These are BEAUTIFULLY wrapped in a heart shaped box, perfect fpr gifts. Im actually going to stock up for Christmas gifts now!!! GREAT JOB BEATY SHELF!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my sponges! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try konjac sponges forever and I wish I didn&#x27;t wait so long! I still use my clarisonic and facial cleanser, but I use a sponge at the end and my skin has cleared up and feels amazing. The green tea sponge is my favorite! Great pricing as well!</li>
    <li> Fair product, looks like the picture. Good on cleansing your face not the body.</li>
    <li> Will be buying more. I will never use a harsh wash cloth on my face ever again. I add just a drop of soap on mine and lather up quite nicely. Unlike other products that takes a few pumps. A must buy for anyone who wants to maintain a healthy face.</li>
    <li> Top Notch in every way!  EXCELLENT: product, packaging, customer service (delivery &amp; follow-up).  Great job!  I will be happily repurchasing over and over for me as well as gifts for my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love these so much, my face is always smooth after I use them! I&#x27;m currently using the green tea sponge, and I love the gentle exfoliation. These are perfect for when you&#x27;ve already done chemical exfoliation on your face, and you need something more gentle. They get the job done without being harsh on your skin. The price was nice, too. :)</li>
    <li> I love the konjac sponge , my skyn is more better  and feel soft</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and two of my family members. I&#x27;m personally using the white sponges, and they&#x27;re great. Perfect for daily exfoliation before I go to bed. We all have rather small faces, so it&#x27;s rather nice that the sponges aren&#x27;t overtly large (yet not too small to feel like a waste of your money). It&#x27;s also a plus that they come in packs of three; I bought three packs, and the three of us are using one sponge type each. It should last us for a while.</li>
    <li> These are soft and pleasant to use, but do not clean my skin very well.  I have dry skin and feel like I have to scrub and scrub with a cleanser to get my skin relatively clean.  They are much less exfoliating thana wash cloth or even my finger tips.  They are an ok size, but sippery.  They are a little hard to hang onto and canʻt really be used as a body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are adorable and I like that they hang up.  My kids will use them, but I will not repurchase.  I bought a natural sea spong that is like heaven instead.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Have just been using the black one and like it. Seems very sturdy. Love the little thread to hang it.</li>
    <li> These are great - a nice gentle way to cleanse</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to really say whether or not I think it works, but was being hounded for a product review. So far no issues. I have only tried the black sponge.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the sponges sometime ago and i&#x27;ve been using 2 of them ever since. I am using the black one for my face and the green for my body. You should know that i have a very sensitive skin that is easily irritated, but the black sponge did not irritate my skin in the slightest, i feel my face, fresh, clean, and glowing after using it. It is soft and gentle on the skin! The black one is good for my body, i massage my body with it after drenching it in my lavender body wash! The feeling is priceless for such a price!</li>
    <li> liked it so far, only tried the charcoal one. takes a while to dry, need to hang them up so there&#x27;s air circulating on both sides</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! They are very gentle and easy to use. They&#x27;re bigger than they appear in the photo, but I was happy about that. I use the charcoal one when I have acne flare-ups, the green tea one when I have sunburn, and the original every day! The box they come in is adorable, too. I don&#x27;t regret buying these.</li>
    <li> These sponges provide just the right amount of exfoliation for my sensitive skin and produce a great lather from a small amount of cleanser. I especially like the green tea sponge. These will be great gifts for my daughters who also have sensitive skin. The packaging makes for a nice gift presentation.</li>
    <li> They do not exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the charcoal and the green tea sponges so far and love them. They are gentle and make my face feel much cleaner and more smooth. They each have a string so they can be hung to dry, which I like. The only problem is that they are a little bit small and awkward to hold, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> The Konjack Sponge Exfoliating Beauty Sponges set is a great deal!  The heart-shaped design is, in fact, easier to hold and simply prettier to look at . . . I know that I&#x27;m doing something good for myself and smile when I see them.  Because our skin regenerates approximately every 28 days, part of my beauty regimen is to use products that will help me remove the dead skin cells.  I alternate between facial cleansing brushes and sponges.  These sponges are amazing.  They work gently and effectively. With the 100% satisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to lose, except those dead skin cells!</li>
    <li> These are great for moisturizing and for sensitive skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend so much for the cleaning or exfoliation but if you want to treat yourself to a soft massage on your face, and hydrate your skin this is great!  Would definitely say the white one would make a perfect baby gift!</li>
    <li> These sponges are perfect!!! The price and quality is outstanding and I now prefer the sponges over cleansing clothes!! Highly recommend this product and company!!!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I wish I have discovered this sooner. It really helps with my skin without irritating it.</li>
    <li> I got the sponges for a gift basket I put together for a friend. She loves them. She says they&#x27;re too pretty to use! She&#x27;s using them right now as part of her bathroom decor.</li>
    <li> Great natural sponges..I am currently trying out the white/sensitive sponge for my rosacea..really liking it with my natural soap so far.My teenage son is using the green tea sponge and he&#x27;s enjoying it..received 2 white and 1 green..not sure why..really wanted to try the black/charcoal one for my son..still a great product.&lt;br /&gt;****Update January 2015****...If you&#x27;re hesitant about ordering these  sponges..don&#x27;t hesitate.. They are amazing!.. The company is so wonderful and sent me a new 3 pack with a green/black/white to fix the problem previously mentioned..Highly recommend ordering as it&#x27;s a great product with exceptional customer service!..Sponges work wonderfully for my rosacea and my sons teen acne..the list goes on!..My youngest son &amp; husband are now using them and loving them as well..Happy customers in my house..will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> sponges are packed separately which is very useful. I bought 1 sponge off another company on amazon and spent $10 so this is definitely a way better price for less money. I love these sponges, they are great for exfoliating and getting the dirt, oil, and makeup off your face at the end of the day. I like the charcoal and green clay the most. I use the white for exfoliating my body.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Exactly as described and at a great price. &#x3D;) Would definitely purchase again when I need it!</li>
    <li> Loved the sponges! I suffer from back breakouts and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price. Will continue to purchase. Skins feels cleaner and brighter.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I actually had no preconceived thought of what these sponges would be like. I was very pleasantly surprised. They are like the cutest heart shaped exfoliating sponge. They even have a small loop of thread to hang aroung your face wash and let it dry till the next time. Love them.</li>
    <li> Got these sponges for my wife, she says they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> so far I have only used the black charcoal sponge. I have noticed a change in the texture of my skin, but i am also pairing it with honey soap day and night. My skin looks smoother, not dramatic but where people have noticed a good change in my skin. I do love the way it feels on my face, I feel a new kind of clean without scrubbing but massaging gently where it doesn&#x27;t leave ANY makeup or dirt behind.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality! I&#x27;ve only used the green tea sponge so far, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from a konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!  They leave your face feeling and looking very clean, even without the use of cleanser. I&#x27;ve used all 3 and none of them irritated my skin. They are the perfect size and come with a cord attached to the top for hanging them to dry.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin, but the feel of the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good company. Main focus is the satisfaction of their customers. If you were to work with them you would not have to worry about having any problems.</li>
    <li> These are great, and seem to be working well so far! I&#x27;ve been using the green one and my skin feels soft and refreshed but not stripped after use. So easy to use, and helpful in overcoming that aversion to washing your face because you can minimize the water you actually splash on your face and still feel clean. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with sensitive skin or who has a hard time coaxing themselves to wash their face at night.</li>
    <li> I had run across these sponges while looking at face products. They seemed interesting and so I purchased. I have only used the white one and it is nice, I do have a nice feeling on my face after using. My granddaughter is starting to have a little acne and so I am sending her the other two sponges for her to try.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! I actually bought all 3 sets at once, based on the review at Fifty Shades of Snail. The packages are super cute and easily storable (and stackable) and they look pretty in your bathroom (no need to hide them for fear of embarrassment). I especially like that I can hook the sponge on my faucet or the pump of my cleanser to air out and dry between uses. The heart shape is especially practical for holding in your hand and washing your face. The attention to detail in packaging and shipping is extraordinary. I will reorder from these guys as soon as I run low or if my sister steals a box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of konjac sponges. This 3 pack was just ok. I felt they were the middle of the road, meaning just average. I have another brand of konjac sponge I reach for much more often. I am going to use these ones on my body instead of my face. They&#x27;re not as soft or &amp;#34;jelly-like&amp;#34; as my favorite. I do appreciate the company sending emails out making sure you like the product and how to best use these sponges. I&#x27;d say the customer service is definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the sponge&#x27;s so far. I am a 58 year old woman and have oily skin even after going through menopause and this with a cleanser has helped me with my skin that I seem to feel I have blackheads and a bumpy feeling on it, I now feel my skin softer, smoother and have gotten some compliments on it. Thanks</li>
    <li> great price and service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a more gentle physical exfoliation alternative to the harsh scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past and konjac sponges seemed like the ideal replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges arrive in a cute little heart shaped box with each sponge dehydrated and individually wrapped in shrink wrap. When soaked in water they expand quite a bit to around the size of my palm and have a surprising bouncy, gelatin like jiggle to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart shape of the sponges are nice because you can use the pointed part to get into the spaces around your nose and eye area and the rounded top part covers larger parts like your cheeks well. The string that&#x27;s threaded through the top is also handy to have since it allows you to hang them up and dry them completely to minimize any mold or other nasties that like to live in damp places.</li>
    <li> They remove all my make up when i wash my face and still leave my skin soft and smooth. I even use the white one on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are great and I am really enjoying using them. So far the green tea is my favorite. They leave my skin feeling fresh and clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve used other brands ranging from super cheap to overpriced, and find that these have lasted a little longer than other konjac sponges.  I&#x27;ve found that one sponge lasts me about a month when using once a day, though they may last longer for others as I&#x27;m rather rough with mine.  My only complaint would be that they take a while to dry, even in a well ventilated area, but that&#x27;s not specific to just this brand.  I found out through an accident that these can be dehydrated really quickly if you sprinkle a couple drops of rubbing alcohol over them and wait 15 minutes or so, and pop right back to normal with a soak in water.</li>
    <li> Works well! Arrived Quickly!</li>
    <li> I love the sponges, they work very well</li>
    <li> The packaging these come in is lovely and sanitary: 3 individually wrapped sponges in a nice box.  There are instructions and additional information included as well.  Each sponge has a small string attached so you can hang it so it dries properly between uses. I also squeeze it gently in a towel to help with the drying process. I&#x27;ve only used the white sponge so far on my sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all.</li>
    <li> so soft! really left my skin feeling soft too.</li>
    <li> Adult acne sucks! So opposed to trying the latest acne-clearing fads that end up having your skin reliant on their chemically toxic ingredients the past two years I have been training my skin to embrace natural methods. My acne clearing - natural face clearing method started with paraben free facial cleansers. After my japanese friend suggested and provided me with the biodegradable konjac sponge my face was relieved! I use it morning and evening daily for an easy exfoliation paired with my facial cleanser. Every two weeks I would sterilize the sponge to release what has accumulated from my daily use. The following week I would dispose the old and use a new sponge for cleanliness &amp; best skin results. One recommendation - place sponge in an area that will allow it to air out/dry up the attached string may hang on a shower clip - also a good indicator when its time to replace the sponge because it may get loose or come off the sponge due to decomposing process.  My face started to feel very smooth, scaring was reduced and the heart shaped sponge delights my morning regime. To know what you are putting in &amp; on your body is to truly Love Thyself.  Buy it! You will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy these sponges! Great price for three, fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the sponges....a different way to wash your face.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Wish we could buy a box on heart shaped charcoal sponges.  The shape is great, and these sponges do wonders for skin; it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m polishing my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the charcoal one I have adult acne.  After using it for a few months I see no difference in my skin. These also do not do a good job exfoliating I can scrub and scrub and still see dry flaky skin immediately after use. My husband gave up after a few days and went back to his old face exfoliator.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the charcoal one and it has helped to give my face a cleaner feeling after washing it. It isn&#x27;t a good replacement for soap, at least for me. But using it wet and wiping my face afterwards instead of just using water makes a noticeable difference in feel.</li>
    <li> LOVE these sponges!!! I will NEVER use washcloths again!!! My skin has definitely benefited from using them!!! I like having 3 to allow rotation and complete drying between uses to keep bacteria at bay!!! Comes with a strong to hang dry!!!! Love love love them!!!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this famous konjac sponges and thanks to beauty shelf for giving me a sample to review their products.  I think the heart design is really cute, it makes me realize that i have to love my skin since it&#x27;s a part of me.  I love how it helps to achieve a more smoother skin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by weeks i can see the difference it done and the most important part is it&#x27;s natural and organic and after 2 to 3 months of use, it&#x27;s biodegradable so i can just leave it on one of my plants or soil in our garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to my friends and readers.</li>
    <li> I have been using these sponges for two weeks and I love them. My skin feels softer and looks smoother.  I use the green tea sponge in the morning and the charcoal at night.  I haven&#x27;t tried the sensitive sponge yet.  I just placed another order.</li>
    <li> These are so cute!  I love the shape, and the box, and I was thinking these would be great gifts for friends.  I do use both the charcoal sponge and the white konjac sponge to wash my face.  They work well.  I am saving the green tea one for summer when I will probably need it.</li>
    <li> I am truly enjoying using the Green tea Konjac Sponge on my face. Also, I use the Natural white sponge with a little bit of the cleanser on my son who has eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these sponges, and can&#x27;t do without them in my skin care cleaning regime. This seller provides a wonderfully packaged item! Great for a girlfriend gift!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be better quality ,but the green one fell apart quickly ,quicker than another Konjac songe I had purchased from another seller,idk they&#x27;re really flimsy. I wanted to like these but they weren&#x27;t the best....</li>
    <li> I first tried the Konjac sponge a few months ago when I ordered one from a fancy organic website. I paid $10 and while I loved how clean it made my skin, the sponge only lasted a few weeks before falling apart. It was with trepidation that I ordered this set, but from the get go I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these sponges feel more substantial. They are firm and dense, and plump up beautifully when wet. Second, they have already lasted longer than the first sponge I got, and I didn&#x27;t pay much more for these three than I paid for that initial one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all three sponges, but my favorite is the charcoal. It makes my face look and feel amazingly clean. Love the set, and will repurchase once these wear out!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I was skeptical, but these are very nice!</li>
    <li> These sponges come in a pouch and are all individually shrink wrapped. They also have a string to hang them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used one, I soaked it in a bowl of very warm water. It ended up just about doubling in size over the course of a half hour or so. I then gently squeezed out most of the water and rubbed it around on my face just to test it out. The sponge felt soft and slick, almost borderline slimy, but not in a gross way. I noticed right away that it left my skin feeling almost moisturized and very smooth like I had exfoliated. It is a very soft sponge, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s exfoliating at all, but it is. It does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few more days of usage, I think I love this sponge more every day. Every time I use it, my skin feels even better than the last time. I don&#x27;t soak the sponge before I use it anymore. Just that first time. Now I just wet it in the sink and make sure it fully expands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these sponges. They are amazing! I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to any other method of cleansing my face. It&#x27;s THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;If you use a cleanser with these sponges use only a small drop. Otherwise you will be rinsing your sponge forever trying to get the cleanser out. A very tiny amount goes a LONG way with these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wring out the sponges!!! You will ruin them. They are made from a plant and are fairly delicate. I gently squeeze with one hand to get water out. Or you can press them between both hands. But don&#x27;t be rough with them and twist or wring them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always hang them up to air dry.</li>
    <li> After using sponges for a few months I have seen a very noticeable difference in my skin. Sponges are only good for 4 - 6 weeks so I am always up for using another brand or type. I  am  not extremely loyal to many brands because I never know when the next best thing will come along.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to the Beauty Shelf sponges because they are unique in their adorable heart shape. Plus you get three in a pack compared to one sponge from the other guys. They are also unique in the fact that they are soft and squishy during shipment.  Most of them are very hard until wet so I found that interesting. It is also a set of three so you won&#x27;t need to buy replacements for a few months even if you replace every  4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I opened the black sponge first, they all have the same shape and benefits. I love the shape it makes it easy to hold and use. There is a string to hang it and that means a lot more to me than it should. I have one without a string and I have to find a place to put it.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is soft and not as coarse as others I have tried. Being wet during shipping also makes it a faster to use than other sponges. I didn&#x27;t have to soak it in water and wait for it to expand and soften. It was soft and ready to use when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased how these sponges hold up even with a few weeks of use. The black one is not torn or ripped in any way. I would recommend trying these sponges! They come in a three pack which is a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
    <li> What a great collection of Konjac spongers! I love these things. Talk about  a beauty deal, these Konjac sponges are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Once each of these sponges has been soaked according to directions they are super soft on the face.I love how they remove all the dirt and gently exfoliate my skin! Feels so good when I do it and my skin feels so soft when I am done. I like all three sponges.. though I like the  white one the best. There is a touch bit of difference between them  (check the package descriptions) but I would happily use them all. I like that there is an assortment of 3 which would make great stocking stuffers for friends and family</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry. So far I have only used the green tea sponge on my face, but I love it! I have used my face wash one with the sponge; however, now I&#x27;m not using any face wash. My skin feels so soft and now it doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
    <li> I ready good reviews on these things. But I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin. I was thinking at least my skin would be smoother. Not sure they are doing anything. Been a few weeks, and nothing.</li>
    <li> Cute box, if you are thinking of purchasing this product as a gift.  I have not tried two of the sponges, but I have tried the green one.  Love it so far.  This 3 box set will make a great gift for my daughter .</li>
    <li> These sponges are really gentle. This 3 pack is a pretty good deal compared to other konjac sponges. I have not tried other brands, but these seem to be nice and see a good size. I do not see a difference in the different color sponges, even though they are each supposed to target different skin types. If you are looking for a super gentle exfoliator this works great. I still use a microfiber washcloth to clean my face, because the konjac sponge doesn&#x27;t remove my eye makeup the same way. I think the sponges are a nice addition to my cleansing routine, however I don&#x27;t think I really need them.</li>
    <li> So far i have only used the charcoal sponge and seen an improvement in my oily skin. It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! You&#x27;ll need a very little amount of soap or facial cleanser, so they are ecological, good for your skin and for your wallet ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Konjac Sponges to anybody interested in their skin care... and our planet care!&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is amazing, too! Thanks, Beth &amp; The Beauty Shelf!&lt;br /&gt;Live well and be green.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleaning sponges. Super soft - they work really well and I love how they have a string so you can hang them to drive.</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging with easy to understand directions.  I love these sponges, they are so gentle and feel luxurious.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Customer service was excellent and very kind. Must be soaked prior to use. quite pricey for limited benefits..</li>
    <li> I love these konjac sponges. The pointy bit of the hearts are great at scrubbing in around mg nostrils where regular shaped sponges are too round for this. These also stay nice, plump and soft!</li>
    <li> Nothing to get excited about.</li>
    <li> These sponges are top quality. I had a newborn son a couple of weeks ago and he did not like bathing with washcloths. However,  since getting the sponges I have noticed he is much happier at bath time as well as cleaner</li>
    <li> I previously got the two-pack of konjac sponges from Beauty by Earth and found them a little too harsh on my face, but since konjac sponges are supposed to be gentle, I brushed it aside and continued to use them until they tore/were unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set to replace those two and am currently using the Green Tea one.  I soaked it in water for 30 minutes before use and found that it expanded quite a bit - it&#x27;s a little bit larger than the palm of my hand.  But what impressed me the most was how soft it was - it was truly gentle on my face and made me think &amp;#34;so this is what a konjac sponge is supposed to feel like&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s also very easy to squeeze all of the water out of, which is another problem that I had with my other sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase from The Beauty Shelf once I finish up this set, and I&#x27;m almost positive that the other two sponges (Charcoal and White) will be just as good.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges and will be ordering more. The point of the heart at the end of the sponge really gets around your nose :) love that I don&#x27;t have to use any product on these as well and my face still feels clean just with warm water and the sponge. Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I dont know if these actually work- but the packaging is great and they are super cute.  I do use them all- just not sure if they actually do anything.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a better way to cleanse my acne prone skin and this works so wonderfully. It&#x27;s gentle but makes your face feel so clean and soft. It&#x27;s also like a massage for your face that I actually look forward to washing my face.</li>
    <li> These are so cool. I love the way they feel and really like the black one. Just hang in the shower and use each day. I will order more and these are as good as any. I recommend this pack b/c you can try all the colors and see what you like moving forward. The get about 2x their size after first soak.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this seemed to irritate it and still didn&#x27;t clean makeup off my face completely. Amazon was great about the return though. Maybe this was just not good for my particular skin type, since other reviews are good.</li>
    <li> I received my sponges quickly. There was a bit of a discrepancy with my order but the company was very responsive and sent me a new package right away. Beth, the Co-founder, is very thoughtful and I appreciated her emails to follow on my order. The sponges are a nice, natural alternative to chemical cleansers and exfoliants. I used the green tea sponge on my arm after I was burned by boiling water and it helped soothe the area a great deal. It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got these for my sweetie at her request. She knew what she was looking for, and the specifics of the sponges. The report is that they work better than other sponges. The quality is superior, and that they hold up under repeated use. The price here on Amazon is good as you would expect. These sponges are top notch for the gentle exfoliation of the skin. They are super absorbent and will double in size when soaked in water.&lt;br /&gt;Konjac Sponges are made from 100% Pure Konjac Glucomannan Infused with Natural Ingredients</li>
    <li> My favorite one is the charcoal sponge. these little guys work wonders! My face is much less prone to oiliness and my skin is softer and i even get less pimples! I use them everyday in the shower and then after im done, i just hang it up to dry. When i went out of town and forgot to bring one with me, my face started acting out agaim...(oiliness, pimples) and when i started using them again it was an instant fix! Will definitely be buying more of these!</li>
    <li> Although this is my first Konjac sponge, I have to say these are very nice. The packaging, for one, is adorable. The customer service is top notch. These little sponges are great for low ph foaming face wash, as they give you tons of beautiful bubbles.  I also use just the sponge with water in the morning and they feel lovely. The little string to hang it to dry is a great feature. I will definitely be buying more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price, very nice sponges. The seller was very nice as well.</li>
    <li> I have only used the charcoal one but it made my skin feel smooth and clean. I do have some breakouts so I will update later if they help. They are weird little sponges though. They puff up really fast.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my SO. he really likes them and the shapes are really cute.</li>
    <li> Just received these this week, but so far I really like them.  Make my face feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> Great price. They work well and the packaging they came in is soooo cute they are lasting well and feel great</li>
    <li> Wonderful in the morning for gentle but thorough exfoliation. Leaves skin feeling perfectly polished and smooth... and my skin cannot tolerate even a microfiber washcloth without suffering irritation. This sponge is much gentler than that, but still effective. Customer service, shipping, etc. all perfect. Will order again once these are done. Bravo!</li>
    <li> I am familiar with konjac sponges; I have been using them for a few years;( I also live in Japan, and they are very common here).  Prior to ordering this set, I was using a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; konjac sponge from a Kyoto brand, made with a special white charcoal etc etc.  Even though I love konjac sponges, I honestly was not impressed with that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also wanted a smaller one to carry with me when I traveled (I pop it in a mini-ziploc) and I liked the choice of having three interesting types for my own skin type (combination, break out easily, gettting older) so I ordered this set; so glad I did, I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they are real konjac sponges, so despite the cutesy shape, you&#x27;re getting an efficient sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next: the shape- although I didn&#x27;t personally care about it being heart-shaped or not, I&#x27;d still totally order again because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is perfect for holding in your hand, for getting to smaller areas of the face...one side is flatter, the other side more rounded, there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; etc.... it just works.  You can smooth and rub all over every part of your face and around your nose and mouth and behind your ears....you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the texture; as you probably know, konjac sponges have a particular texture; these are perfect- not too squishy or slippery, but smooth.  They feel absolutely wonderful on the skin- you can just wash and wash your face as much as you want and your skin gets brighter and cleaner and smoother and there is no irritation or redness or &amp;#34;scrubbing off&amp;#34; feel.  Konjac sponges are amazing; they are so gentle, but they are powerhouses.&lt;br /&gt;And this set is just fab.  I use the green one in the morning to wake up my face skin, the black one for &amp;#34;proper cleansing&amp;#34;...but I often take one in each hand and massage my whole face, and it is the BEST feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Also, big bonus point; they don&#x27;t fall apart;  It is humid where I live, I use these every day, I hang them up after but they don&#x27;t necessarily ever get totally dry.  My other konjac sponges would have been falling apart by now, with the same amount and type of handling, so another reason to reorder.  I also plan to get some and have them available for guests/gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed- they are gentle, wonderfully efficient skin conditioning tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, great customer service- they wrote me an email to explain the konjac - since I knew what to expect, I was fine with it, but they are different from what a lot of people are used to so that could be helpful.&lt;br /&gt; So yes; highly recommend, all around.ssarily ever get totally dry.

    <li> Fad item.. do not count on exfoliation</li>
    <li> Fast service and good products.  No problem.</li>
    <li> They arrived completely dried out, unlike other brands where they show up a little moist.  I feel like these are sturdier, but it makes me think they aren&#x27;t quite 100% konjac.  I dunno, they feel different from the Boscia and MY Konjac brands, which makes me think that&#x27;s the way they are supposed to feel.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me these hearts simply cuz they looked so cute and different, once he read what they contain he knew I would love them. He was right, my face has felt smoother, softer, fresh, lighter, cleaner and so much more. I will continue to buy this my hearts for sure.</li>
    <li> These are super handy.  They feel good on your face. I&#x27;m encouraged to wash my face more often with them. For some reason they feel easier to use than a washcloth, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll wash more often.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using konjac sponges, and I love these little guys! The shape is easy to hold, the string makes it easy to hang to dry and they dry completely-- I have a problem with moisture in my apartment and these little guys still dried up and shrank back to their original size just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, and my reason for picking up these sponges was that they were exfoliating but far gentler than a scrub, and I find that to be true. My overall skin texture is better, I&#x27;m not having problems with flakes despite it still being cold and dry here, and after rubbing on my cleanser with these sponges my skin /isn&#x27;t/ red or irritated-- and my skin gets red and irritated if you just look at it wrong, it seems like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each sponge is supposed to last for two months with proper care, which means I&#x27;m getting six months worth of exfoliation for the price of three months worth of commercial face scrubs. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a couple weeks with no sign of wear, despite using it daily, sometimes multiple times, for both cleanser application and to help with make up removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend on repurchasing and am working on converting my friends, so if you&#x27;re looking for a package of &amp;#34;potato scrubbies&amp;#34; (as they were dubbed by my roomie) pick these up!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a sponge could be so awesome, I mean, what was the big deal, it&#x27;s a sponge!  But I was so wrong!  These sponges are super soft and the texture exfoliates without scratching up the skin.  I do notice that it keeps my blackheads at bay!  I have very large pores so they aren&#x27;t hard to notice, but using this sponge (especially the charcoal one) seems to keep them clear.  I love them and will buy more. :)</li>
    <li> Package arrived in two days and the heart shaped box and individual sponges were vacuum sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only just started using the green sponge just two days ago. I still can&#x27;t see any difference but the side of my face that I have used the sponge on definitely feels exfoliated. I didn&#x27;t notice while massaging my face with it, but I felt it right after I finished. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> These sponges are one of the best purchases I have made. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size; they expand a lot when wet! The heart shape is perfect as the pointy end is good for reaching around the nose and under the eyes. You only need a small amount of cleanser as the sponge foams it up considerably. The sponges were much softer than I expected so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it being too harsh. Although they were soft, I noticed that my skin became less flaky and much smoother, making it easier to wear make-up. I also like that it comes with a hanging string so I don&#x27;t have to worry about contamination while it&#x27;s drying (PSA don&#x27;t hang it in a humid room or else it won&#x27;t dry properly).</li>
    <li> I was slightly skeptical, but being somewhat of a health &amp; beauty aids junkie, I decided to try these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, I love them and the results I have seen on my skin in just a few days. I use one in the shower as a body sponge and the green and black on my face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; - love them!</li>
    <li> These are high quality and feel lovely on the face. I got three for the same price I have gotten one for in the past!!!</li>
    <li> Received 3 sponges. So far I&#x27;ve only tried the charcoal. After using it, it leaves my face so soft.  I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 days so far so I&#x27;m not sure how it will handle my acne yet. So far I like how it makes my face feel. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Sorry, for a poor review on what could be a wonderful product. I purchased a 3 sponge set for different purposes. The sponges began to deteriorate and crumble after only 4-5 uses. I&#x27;ve gone through two sponges in one week. The sponges feel nice on the face but too pricey for such a short usage period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m revising my review on this product with an additional two stars. Sometimes in a batch there&#x27;s possibilities of imperfection. Customer service has rectified the issue with a speedy replacement.</li>
    <li> Wish it is 1 more inch bigger, only about 2&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great item, have only used the black one so far but after use it leaves my skin very smooth and i don&#x27;t need cream afterwards. Great product, great price. Also arrived quite fast.</li>
    <li> Loved them! Good quality and they make your skin feel so smooth after using them. I would recommend! I will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> These came and looked so tiny.  I followed the instructions and placed them in water t o soak...wow they almost tripled in size.  They are incredibly gentle on the face...the company was so nice they even emailed directions on what to do with them and how to correctly use them.</li>
    <li> I split the three pack with my boyfriend who has a severe acne problem (charcoal), my sister who has sensitive skin (white), and I kept the green tea for myself since I&#x27;m always in the sun. Upon one use of the charcoal sponge, my boyfriend&#x27;s skin was noticeably clearer and less red. My face was also much smoother..waiting to hear back on how efficient the white sponge works but so far so good for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last very long. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought the 3-pack to try it out because I have ichthyotic skin and finding something new that actually works for me is a serious godsend. So far I&#x27;ve only tested the white konjac sponge - I use it while I shower, soaking it in a little container with warm water to let it expand and do its thing until I&#x27;m ready to clean my face. I&#x27;ve been using it without face cleanser for about 2 weeks now and while the sponge doesn&#x27;t really work too well as an exfoliator, it&#x27;s a very gentle and convenient way of cleaning my face and much preferable to washcloths.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really seen much overt improvement in the dryness of my skin (which is super dry with flaking) but it&#x27;s a decent alternative and I like it. I maintain the sponge well by hanging it on a coat hanger to dry thoroughly in between each use and it&#x27;s been holding up well for me with no crumbling or flaking. I do still have to try out the other 2 sponges, but overall I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s curious about konjac sponges, the 3-pack is really economical!</li>
    <li> Very soft on  the skin and cleanse really well with foam cleanser</li>
    <li> You get 3 sponges for the same price of one bought from sephora, and it&#x27;s basically the same thing. They come in a cute heart shaped box too!</li>
    <li> These sponges are great!So my whole family useing them.I&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon,since I&#x27;ve been giving them away for them to try.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:98c04505fb3b338f0fcb8ba9864e2c79]] I really loved these konjac beauty sponges!</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges!  They are soft to the touch and the perfect size for cleaning your face.  It has a small string imbedded in the sponge which makes it easy for you to hang it up to dry.  I&#x27;ve used it with my facial cleanser and it works great, are easy to rinse out.  They seem fairly durable and since it comes in a pack of three I&#x27;m sure they will last a while.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with these sponges. They make my face so so soft after I use them. Not sure if the different colors mean anything, but the are awesome!</li>
    <li> Good for facial but quite small for baby bathing</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. Sephora sells 1 for $15, so here you get 3 for the price of one. They work really well, they are gentle yet the skin feels nice and exfoliated, leaving it clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> The black sponge worked better than the rest.</li>
    <li> The first batch I received wasn&#x27;t durable but the manufacturer was kind enough to replace it and give me instructions on how to make them last longer. I like how easy it is using them and how my face feels when I wash with them.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love, love, love these! Shipping was fast and I love the packaging they came in too... I highly recommend them and this seller... Great job!! These are like nothing you&#x27;ve ever tried... :)&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> effective and easy 2 use!!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and easy to hold sponges. So far I&#x27;ve used charcoal and white with cleanser. Love them both.</li>
