      <li>What a great way to get my 6-year old to floss!</li>

      <li>Our pediatric dentist had similar flossers and our daughter loved them, so we got these.  </li>
      <li>Every dental check up has come back cavity free and healthy gums!</li>
      <li>Shipping was really quick and the product was as described.</li>
      <li>I wish I could get my kids to use normal floss, but this is way easier and more fun for them.</li>
      <li>They are fun, comfortable to hold, smell nice and the different animals keep the kids interested every time.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product before and think they work great for little hands, mouths &amp; teeth.</li>
      <li>Very qiuck and accurate service.</li>
      <li>My 2 and 3 years old kids love them.</li>
      <li>Way more scraping action.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So bummed...I suppose it is my fault because I didn&#x27;t look at the picture closely, but these have fluoride on them, which is not in the description.  I&#x27;d just return them if I could, but, while there is no evidence that you will be unable to return unopened packages, you are indeed not allowed to do so.  I wish the description was better and the return policy posted.</li>
    <li> Kiddo loves these; lets us floss her teeth with them. Haven&#x27;t had one break yet, and we&#x27;ve used one a day for over 6 months.</li>
    <li> I use these with a 2.5 year old who has a full set of teeth. They slip easily between the teeth, are easy to hold and my son loves the bright colors. We haven&#x27;t had any break. I docked one star because they&#x27;re fat (depth) and therefore hard to get far enough into a small mouth to reach the back teeth.</li>
    <li> Kids are very happy with these. Two years and they floss every night without a reminder.</li>
    <li> What a great way to get my 6-year old to floss! The floss comes with 4 different animal shapes and he looks forward to a surprise by grabbing one floss from the bag. Now I have trouble making my son to stop flossing. Shipping was really quick and the product was as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this for a long time for my son. It does its job.</li>
    <li> My kids love to use these flossers. Perfect size for little hands.No cavities yet!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old enjoys picking which glosser to use. It&#x27;s very helpful to get his teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I hesitated in buying these because of the plastic wasted with each use. But they encourage my kids to floss independently, which they now do without complaint, so we are sticking with them for a while. We have been using them for about a year after a bad report from the dentist on both kids&#x27; flossing habits. Much better reports now.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 3 year old daughter, for practicing good oral care, and discovered these work better than the adult ones I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;ve tried several brands, and 20%, the floss would break...Also, nice not having the toothpick feature, as the flatten handle, gives me better leverage, for getting those tough spots.</li>
    <li> My son loved the characters and the scent he was excited to start using the floss thank you for making floss kid friendly</li>
    <li> My daughter flosses all the time now because of the flavor. awesome</li>
    <li> These are great. Easy for my son to hold and use.  He likes the taste of them as well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Floss your two year old&#x27;s teeth&amp;#34;... hahaha, okay, doc, sure.  Turns out, these make it super easy and my son asks for them every night.  He guesses the shape that I&#x27;m going to pull out and we&#x27;ve never had one break!  Definitely continue buying these.</li>
    <li> Kids love the animal shapes and they do what they are supposed to for a good price.</li>
    <li> My 2 and 4 yr olds still enjoy picking the shape or color, and this is well into our second bag.  Much easier to use on someone else&#x27;s mouth than regular flossers.  Sturdier than another brand I tried, so made it easier to get to the molars.</li>
    <li> I wish I could get my kids to use normal floss, but this is way easier and more fun for them. They&#x27;re all excited to floss - ages 7, 4, and even the 2 year old.</li>
    <li> These are the only flossers my young kids will use. The floss is durable and thin, and slides between the teeth easily.</li>
    <li> Great product and the kids enjoy flossing everynight! Good fit for the adult hand... Little clumsy for the kids to use, but way better that the leading name basic flossers.</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t think the quality is that amazing. I prefer Crest Glide Flossers because they are soft and work well. However, these are not minty, this is hugely important as my 4 year old refuses to use anything minty. The most important thing though is that my daughter looks forward to picking the animal that is going to floss her teeth. Every dental check up has come back cavity free and healthy gums!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old loves using these and they work great. Her favorite are the monkey flossers, they are always first to go. I&#x27;ve even flossed with her and they work for me too.</li>
    <li> My son loves these. These are perfect flossers for kids. There is fluoride in them and they smell quite fruity. Very easy for my son to grip and use to floss.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best flossers for children. They do not get stuck in their teeth and glide smoothly.</li>
    <li> my 3-year-old like this.  this makes flossing fun to them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve thought of everything-- these have fluoride, they&#x27;re fun colors, fun animals, and a great berry taste. Makes flossing my toddler&#x27;s teeth possible.</li>
    <li> My sister is a dentist and uses these in her practice. We got them after visiting her and haven&#x27;t had any fights from our 3 and 4 year olds about flossing before bed since.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes the flavor and the animal shapes.  Some of the handle shapes make it hard for her to get to her back teeth, that&#x27;s why I dropped one star.  Price is great.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my niece and nephew (their parents were using old school floss putting their dirty ass fingers int their kids mouths) and ended up buying another set for myself. I know they&#x27;re for kids but why not? They work well, haven&#x27;t had one break on me and I had braces and have rather tight teeth, and the berry taste or whatever it is is kinda nice.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and think they work great for little hands, mouths &amp; teeth. Not super wild about the fact that they are flavored. But the last bunch that I got must have been defective. Almost every one in the package broke as soon as our kids used it between a tooth. The floss just pulled right out of where it is attached. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> After my 1st grader went to the dentist and found out she needed to start flossing, the dentist recommended these types of pick-type flossers. It&#x27;s much easier for younger kids to use than regular dental floss. It also has fun animal shapes so there is variety during each brushing session. It&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> My sun likes it. Easy to handle and the floss is not too thick/thin. I wish there was no fruity scent to it, but I can live with that. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Be aware, these are 48 packages of 4, individually wrapped, like something you would get as samples at a dentist office. Despite that, these are probably the best type of these flossers on the market. They are much better than the dentek brand.</li>
    <li> These are better than the string. Way more scraping action. Never going back to floss!</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this product. This is one way to get the kids to start flossing at an early age. They get excited everytime it is time to brush their teeth. The different designs and berry flavors top it. They came in the mail quickly, packaged nicely and we are completely satisfied with the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The floss is strong and holds up on my 5 year olds tight molars. He complains the flavor is not strong enough. They smell good at least. I can floss my 2 year olds front teeth (where hers are tight) with these without complaints. She insists I let her keep hold of it and continues to try to floss herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My broken floss experience was with DenTek brand but was only an occasional problem.</li>
    <li> My 3-year-old LOVES &amp;#34;slossing&amp;#34; his teeth every night.  He also doesn&#x27;t mind when my husband and I do it.  I love that the actual floss is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt his gums.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Flavor was good for our 7yr old and he liked the shapes. Could be a little easier to slide between some of the tighter spots, but overall good.</li>
    <li> Love these things. Colorful enough to entice my 3.5 year old to floss (and then let me re-floss...) and strong enough for a few uses. Flavor is added bonus I guess but not a huge incentive. Bought these for my boss and VP for their young ones!</li>
    <li> Our son likes the creatures on some of the other kid flossers better, but Mom and Dad like these as the floss is thin and we can actually get it between all of his teeth - and that is the purpose! Love them.</li>
    <li> overwhelming fruity smell but they work</li>
    <li> could be smoother floss like the tape models but these are great and any kid 4 and up can probably learn to floss with these.</li>
    <li> Took my 2 yr olds to the dentist recently and was told they should start flossing.  I purchased these because they are colorful and have cute animal designs.  The kids love them (for now...)!  Easy to use....the kids now try to do it themselves.</li>
    <li> Great price. My 2 and 3 years old kids love them.</li>
    <li> These have been really helpful in getting our 3 year old to floss.  I wish there was a mechanism to make the plastic part reusable because it feels wrong to throw them out after once use (so we don&#x27;t  we use them 2-3 times).</li>
    <li> My son loves to floss with these things. Anything that can get a 3 year old to floss deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I am still flossing my daughters teeth and these flossers are very easy to hold and maneuver around in her mouth. They look great. The one star is missing only because she says they taste bad. She loves the mint flossers and has requested we go back to those. They are not as thick and are harder to hold when compared to these ones but get the job done with no fuss.</li>
    <li> I loved the sample 4-packs I received at the dentist, but was very disappointed in this purchase. Each of the 4 packs of 48 flossers had many broken or frayed strings, and there were large blobs of wax (?) hanging off the majority of the strings which would flake off when touched. I decided to return them and had a good experience with the return (easy, credit card refunded quickly)</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended flossing for both children (ages 2&amp;4), and suggested something along this route for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both kids love the &#x27;animals&#x27; that are represented on each flosser. It&#x27;s made flossing fun, and in my book as a parent that&#x27;s a win. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> My kids (3 and 6) always look forward to flossing their teeth with these.  They are fun, comfortable to hold, smell nice and the different animals keep the kids interested every time.</li>
    <li> Made in China.  Maybe all these sorts of things are.  Makes me a little nervous with something I&#x27;m putting in my kid&#x27;s mouth.  But they are easy for him to use</li>
    <li> These are well made, and I am able to reach the back of my three year old&#x27;s mouth. She likes the colors and animals.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing a toddler&#x27;s teeth a piece of cake! She loves to pick the color each night and match it to the package. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Fits between tight fitting teeth.  The other kids brands that we have tried get stuck between both of my kids teeth.  These work well.</li>
    <li> We use this every night on our toddler, he loves it and isn&#x27;t intimidated by it.  Lots of fun colors and doesn&#x27;t taste bad!</li>
    <li> Plackers have strong string. I like them and the bright colors and character (as well as them not being mint flavored) helps my kids actually use these every time they brush.</li>
    <li> They are happy to pick out their colors and happy to let me floss them.  My son likes it so much that when I&#x27;m done, he starts pointing, &amp;#34;You missed a spot, Mommy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use one myself, it works better than any other flosser I&#x27;ve tried on my teeth, so even though I feel a bit silly buying a kid&#x27;s product for me, I buy them for myself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only request ...

    <li> Love these, they hunt for the crab shaped flossers every night!</li>
    <li> The kids love the colors and animals, and they make flossing so much easier!</li>
    <li> Excellent flossers.  I recommend these over the Dentek animal ones.  They feel more rigid, the thread is definitely higher-quality, and my 5-yr old has a much easier time flossing her own teeth with these rather than with the Dentek ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small plusses (kids care about these things) - they smell good; the animal shapes are fun and notable - the colors are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cost more - noticeably more - but if you don&#x27;t mind paying more for better quality than do it.</li>
    <li> My five year old has been using them for over a year.  He seems to like them.  Buying these from Amazon is usually cheaper than buying from Walmart. I will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> These flossers are easy to use and make it a bit more fun for the little ones.  I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because the string is a little loose (as compared to the adult ones I have used) which makes it a little tougher to get between tight teeth.  Also, in case you are wondering, there is no pointy end.</li>
    <li> Great price, my daughter loves the variety &amp; ease of use.</li>
    <li> After only a few weeks of using, my 4/5 year old could already properly floss by herself.</li>
    <li> Standard nothing great to talk about</li>
    <li> These are great. My 5 year old uses them twice a day independently. It&#x27;s a great healthy habit. He brushes, flosses, and uses mouthwash and enjoys the routine. I have used these flossers as well when I run out of my adult version and they work just as well.</li>
    <li> My kid just 2. And he knows the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I always use flossers after eat. My kid learns the behavior.&lt;br /&gt;He will take me and wanna me open the bag.&lt;br /&gt;He wanna use flosser by himself.&lt;br /&gt;And he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I glad to buy this item.</li>
    <li> Effective and simple to use.</li>
    <li> My child loves these things.  I actually have to hide them from him because he&#x27;d stay in the bathroom and floss all day if he could.  I tried one and the flavor is good.  You can actually smell the berry smell through the bag before even opening them.  I definitely plan to buy these again.</li>
    <li> The best kids&#x27; floss I know. The handle is very sturdy, unlike its competitor&#x27;s. And the floss is very thin, so it gets in between teeth easily. Love the different colors.</li>
    <li> they were everything they said they would be and they make flossing for kids much easier</li>
    <li> Good quality. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Teaches my son good dental hygiene early and he loves to floss and it allows me to help him get into those hard to reach areas much easier!  1 pack last a little over a month.  Much cheaper than in the store.  The flavor is also a plus!.  He likes the taste.</li>
    <li> I have seen a significant increase in flossing in my kids since I brought these home. From zero to flossing, how about that? I tried the regular ones for adults that sells everywhere with not or very limited success at best, it was way too boring. The four shapes, different colors and smell make them very attractive, every night is a novelty that needs to be tried. What color should I use? What shape? Would it smell differently?. Quality is also very good, the dental floss itself is thin enough to go through the small spaces kids teeth have, without breaking or the handle bending&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clarify the packaging as it might be confusing, it is a big bag with 4 packets of 48 flossers each, for a total of 192 flossers pieces. They are not individually wrapped as samples as another reviewer suggested, maybe she or he got them that way but in my case I got this bag with 4 packets of not individually wrapped pieces inside, didn&#x27;t look like samples to me</li>
    <li> Great product 5 year old loves using them everyday!</li>
    <li> Kids like the taste so they are prone to use them more often.</li>
    <li> We use these for my two year old toddler. These are great because it&#x27;s fun for her to pick out which one we use each night. I think these are easier to hold on to for the parent and less scary pointy than other brands.</li>
    <li> They do their job, not my favorite flosser for the kids.  I bought this because the flossers with the long handles were sold out and I thought I would give these a try.  Just a personal preference that we like the long handled ones better.</li>
    <li> My kids love these!!!!</li>
    <li> Cute and easy to use. My 2-year old likes using them. Bad thing is that I have to fight for it to help her flossing since she just wants to do herself.</li>
    <li> It was meant to keep my daughters interest so she could learn and keep good dental hiegene habits. She loves picking the color/animal. Mommy approved!</li>
    <li> The Plackers make it easy for my two children--both under 9--to floss their teeth, and they love the berry flavor.</li>
    <li> These are great for my toddler, and were recommended by our dentist.  Our 3 year old can use them himself too.</li>
    <li> Our pediatric dentist had similar flossers and our daughter loved them, so we got these.  She doesn&#x27;t mind them because they look like the ones she used at the dentist, and so we floss nightly without an issue. (Except sometimes she wants more dolphin flossers!)</li>
    <li> They work well, but the flavor is a little strong.</li>
    <li> These are dependable flossers.  They don&#x27;t break on tight teeth like all the other ones we&#x27;ve tried.  The kids love the animals, so flossing is never a chore.  I just wish it weren&#x27;t made in China.</li>
    <li> These flossers are great! My 5 yo really likes them.</li>
    <li> Great flossers. My kids love them and flossing is never a battle with these.</li>
    <li> Very qiuck and accurate service. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Our pediatric dentist recommended. We use nightly.&lt;br /&gt;(the dentist said that they can be rinsed and re-used as well)</li>
    <li> These are a must for my kids so I buy them in bulk. They&#x27;re the right size for their little hands and the designs keep them interested in using them. They like the faint berry flavor too.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Gets my little girl to floss and brush her teeth.  My only issue is that I think it is a bit pricey</li>
    <li> My kids love flossing with these.  My now 3-year-old has been using these since he was not even 2 yet.  The floss on these are very thin, so they work great for small teeth.  I personally can&#x27;t taste the berry &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; on these, but the fun colors and animal shapes of the flossers are enticing enough for our children to want to use them.  I can&#x27;t find these in any of the chain stores and pharmacies, so I&#x27;m delighted to be able to get these here for a decent price.</li>
    <li> got these for our 3 year old to learn how to floss, since she&#x27;s always asking for the regular Plackers we use, and she loves them. the colors and the shapes allow for identification learning as well!</li>
    <li> my kid loved them.  good for kids</li>
