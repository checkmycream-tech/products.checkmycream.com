      <li>Touch Up Veil is a better product to take in the purse.  </li>
      <li>I love the convenience of the compact.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>Wish I had gotten Medium instead of Fairly Medium, check your color at a store first before buying.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
      <li>easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>I love the Ready Foundation!!</li>
      <li>great make-up, a little goes a long way and gives you flawless glowing skin.</li>
      <li>New, unopened, authentic product!</li>
      <li>love the quality, but I went from fairly light to fairly medium to get a darker shade, and it was exactly the same color,  </li>
      <li>true to color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love the coverage and the soft finish of this product!  </li>
      <li>love bare mineral products.  </li>
      <li>if your not careful can be more wasteful.</li>
      <li>I love the Bare Escentuals makeup, and decided to try this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been waiting for a long time for this product, and was thrilled when I saw it online.  </li>
      <li>And it has an odd smell which was a bit surprising to get used to.</li>
      <li>Can be slightly drying so just use a good moisturizer if you need it first.</li>
      <li>First time buying the compact version.</li>
      <li>I am very very pleased with all of the bare minerals  products, and especially the foundation.</li>
      <li>It is much more loose than I exptect</li>
      <li>I like the loose powder foundation better then this.</li>
      <li>but when I&#x27;m done, there isn&#x27;t make-up on my bathroom counter because of the nice little compact (like pressed powder).</li>
      <li>It was not, it was very cakey and did not hydrate my skin at all.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped this would be a good item in my purse, but it doesn&#x27;t have the glow of the powder formulation, and goes on rather thick.  </li>
      <li>I love the bare minerals loose powder but wanted something I could touch up with throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money, I have been using this makeup for several years and would not use anything else!!</li>
      <li>I apply it with a normal compressed powder poof because since I bought this to go in my purse, that is all that is practical.  </li>
      <li>but I have dry skin and felt that the description on the Ready foundation would be better for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I ended up not returning it because it was honestly too much hassle for such a small item.</li>
      <li>It couldn&#x27;t survive the shipping, which tells me that (even if it had arrived intact), there&#x27;s no way it could live in my purse the way that I need it to.  </li>
      <li>even the number on the back was the same as the fairly light.</li>
      <li>You barely need one quick brush worth of foundation to do half your face.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t disappear as quick as the loose..</li>
      <li>I tried it the first day I received the product and then tried it the second day</li>
      <li>It arrived when expected, couldn&#x27;t be happier.....and reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>I really recommend getting the shade matched at a shop - this totally did not look the same in person as it did online.</li>
      <li>I might buy this product again or might go Barack to the original- not sure</li>
      <li>Finally a Bare Escentuals product that can go with me!</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals never disappoints.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals foundation does everything the commercials and adds say it does.</li>
      <li>I use the bare minerals powder foundation</li>
      <li>and it does last, does not dry out or crack..</li>
      <li>Too bad the Ready Foundation couldn&#x27;t have been better as well.</li>

    <li> A little bit cakey compared to loose matte powder. Builds up around my nose, unlike loose powder. And it has an odd smell which was a bit surprising to get used to.</li>
    <li> The compact does not come with any type of applicator.  I apply it with a normal compressed powder poof because since I bought this to go in my purse, that is all that is practical.  It does not seem feasible to put a big cosmetic brush in my purse.  Note that the compact leaves no room for a poof inside either, which means my poof was separate which just makes a big mess.  With the poof it goes on so thick and cakey that I had to wipe it off.  I love the bare minerals loose powder but wanted something I could touch up with throughout the day.  I will NOT be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be a good item in my purse, but it doesn&#x27;t have the glow of the powder formulation, and goes on rather thick.  Touch Up Veil is a better product to take in the purse.  Too bad the Ready Foundation couldn&#x27;t have been better as well.</li>
    <li> for people who don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; look:  i found that a little goes a long way.  if you brush it on and brush it all over your face, it will have the cakey look.  tap a couple times, and just sweep across your face.  and you can repeat for more if you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the coverage and the soft finish of this product!  it doesn&#x27;t break me out even when i forget to wipe my face before bed. :)</li>
    <li> love bare mineral products.  had the brush already to apply.  easy to travel with.  true to color.</li>
    <li> I use this product to cover up redness on my nose and cheeks and it works wonderfully.  Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this brand in some of the things they have, this one is a great product..it doesn&#x27;t disappear as quick as the loose..it was a little lighter than what I like but I can highlight with it and it does last, does not dry out or crack..</li>
    <li> Wish I had gotten Medium instead of Fairly Medium, check your color at a store first before buying.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great make-up, a little goes a long way and gives you flawless glowing skin.</li>

    <li> I love the convenience of the compact. Until recently, I only used the loose powder foundation. I feared the oiliness of pressed powders would cause breakouts. This product is an ideal modification of both. It is lightweight and I apply it with a brush (like loose powder) but when I&#x27;m done, there isn&#x27;t make-up on my bathroom counter because of the nice little compact (like pressed powder). I use this product alone or after applying Bare Escentuals Correcting Concealer for flawless coverage that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love the Ready Foundation!! Finally a Bare Escentuals product that can go with me! You barely need one quick brush worth of foundation to do half your face. Wonderful coverage. Can be slightly drying so just use a good moisturizer if you need it first.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this item.  It seemed to fill in creases and over emphasized them. I tried many ways to use this, but it went on feeling greasy and made my face appear shiny.  It may work for other skin types, but it didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
    <li> Love this brand. I use it with my Amazonian clay foundation and it seems to blend perfectly. My face looks pretty flawless with this product!</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals never disappoints. You do need to use the brush recommended for this product which is also wonderful. Score.</li>

    <li> Does not cover like I thought it would</li>
    <li> Like the product. First time buying the compact version. I like the convenience but it&#x27;s a little messier to use and if your not careful can be more wasteful. I might buy this product again or might go Barack to the original- not sure</li>
    <li> This foundation is by far the best on the market.  It glides on smoothly and gives great coverage.  Always get color matched prior to buying though.</li>
    <li> New, unopened, authentic product! Worth the money, I have been using this makeup for several years and would not use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I love the Bare Escentuals makeup, and decided to try this. I was very thick and didnt spread well at all. Just after applying a little bit my face looked like i used a putty knife to apply my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t spread out like the powder make up, it literally &amp;#34;Presses&amp;#34; on your face.</li>
    <li> I use the bare minerals powder foundation but I have dry skin and felt that the description on the Ready foundation would be better for dry skin.  It was not, it was very cakey and did not hydrate my skin at all.  I tried it the first day I received the product and then tried it the second day and it was the worst foundation I have ever used.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I like the loose powder foundation better then this.</li>
