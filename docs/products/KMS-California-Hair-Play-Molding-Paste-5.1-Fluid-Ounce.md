      <li>One of these bottle lasted me more than a year.</li>

      <li>I have been getting many compliments on my hair since using this product.</li>

      <li>Eh I love it</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>love the product.good service.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair more manageable, easy to style.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on your head.</li>
      <li>It was recommended on a YouTube video for working with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It holds up my hair perfectly fine for hours on end- there is a distinctive smell</li>
      <li>Oh, and it has a distinct fragrance (not my favorite) that fades a bit as the day goes on.  </li>
      <li>It has great consistency for my hair not to heavy or greasy but really allows for great control.  </li>
      <li>Great product, I use it daily.</li>
      <li>Great thing about this molding paste that it styles your hair, but it still makes it look pretty natural.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily, too, leaving no unpleasant residue on your hair.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite hair molding paste, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands.</li>
      <li>Wonderful paste, does not give that crusty and hard look</li>
      <li>It has low shine and good amount of strength.</li>
      <li>If you are super sensitive to that kind of thing, beware.</li>
      <li>I love that I can hop out of the shower, throw this on my hair, and know it&#x27;s going to dry nicely while I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
      <li>Great for the active lifestyle.</li>
      <li>These bottles last forever and the pomade is a great quality for the price - washes out easily, matte natural finish.</li>
      <li>I use this as the first layer of product when styling my extremely fine hair.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this at a super cuts years ago</li>
      <li>As a male, it gives my short hair awesome hold while being flexible and not being crunchy or too shiny.</li>
      <li>Product is good for  fine thick hair</li>
      <li>Keeps hair exactly as molded all day without residue or flaking.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product for years on my short hair and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>The pump didn&#x27;t work at all, and I didn&#x27;t have any left, so I cut the plastic container off at the top and had to put it in a Rubbermaid bowl.  </li>
      <li>I used to use American crew, but I think this is better in terms of price and quality.</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to find this on amazon, cause my local salon charges at least 30% more.  </li>
      <li>Very picky about what product I use.</li>
      <li>Doesnt hold as much as I hoped.</li>
      <li>Product is a great value beacuse a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than other molding pastes out there.</li>
      <li>If u want a messy look without looking greasy or wet, this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it weighs it down too much and robs the shine.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I use on my hair for last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet and dry application works and gives you good natural holding power</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>It also reactivates easily with a little water and a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>look-- not a stiff holding paste.</li>
      <li>The paste is starting to get hard, and I won&#x27;t be able to use it much longer.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described and what I expected.  </li>

    <li> Glad I was able to find this on amazon, cause my local salon charges at least 30% more.  Great product, I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well. Leaves your hands a little sticky though.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has great consistency for my hair not to heavy or greasy but really allows for great control.  Other products I have tried leave me hair looking greasy or wet.  You actually can achieve a wet or dry look with this product depending on how you apply it.  It also reactivates easily with a little water and a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Bit of an oily texture on hair, not quite what I was looking for. Smell needs to be taken a notch down.</li>
    <li> Best hair molding paste out there</li>
    <li> This paste is the best I have tried so far. It definitely provides texture that lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Works on my stubborn hair.  Great price</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more manageable instead of a paste but this is a bit stiff. KMS does make good some good stuff so I guess I just have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite as nice as Aveda&#x27;s Control Paste, but it&#x27;s cheaper, and unlike Aveda&#x27;s formula, this works well on damp hair. I love that I can hop out of the shower, throw this on my hair, and know it&#x27;s going to dry nicely while I&#x27;m out and about. It washes out easily, too, leaving no unpleasant residue on your hair. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> A good hair product for styling men&#x27;s hair, specifically for shorter hair styles. It has low shine and good amount of strength. Great thing about this molding paste that it styles your hair, but it still makes it look pretty natural. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product. I used to use American crew, but I think this is better in terms of price and quality.</li>
    <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work at all, and I didn&#x27;t have any left, so I cut the plastic container off at the top and had to put it in a Rubbermaid bowl.  The paste is starting to get hard, and I won&#x27;t be able to use it much longer.  Can&#x27;t believe they didn&#x27;t design a better container.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I would recommend it to anyone.😊</li>
    <li> Eh I love it but then again I don&#x27;t. Using too much makes my hair feel weird . Leaves a &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; like residue &amp; leaves a weird sticky residue in your hands too. But has amazing hold &amp; texture</li>
    <li> Works great. Holds hair longer without crispifying it.</li>
    <li> Great hold and not to greasy. Product is a great value beacuse a little bit goes a long way. I have shorter hair and 1 tube of this lasted 4 months!</li>
    <li> Was recommended by hair stylist and now can&#x27;t use any other hair product in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of hair product on the market and I find this has the best value and strongly recommend California Hair Play molding paste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 8 or 9 years. It&#x27;s my favorite! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they stop making it. I&#x27;ll have to walk around with no style....</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and what I expected.  This is the ONLY hair molding paste I use and it never disappoints!  Forget about heavy gels, sprays and hair wax.  I have tried many of those type of hair molding products but once I tried KMS Calif Hair Play Molding Paste, it is now the ONLY hair molding product I use.  Keeps hair exactly as molded all day without residue or flaking.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair. As a male, it gives my short hair awesome hold while being flexible and not being crunchy or too shiny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful paste, does not give that crusty and hard look</li>
    <li> the best product to manage short salt and pepper hair</li>
    <li> Doesnt hold as much as I hoped. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big hair product guy. I was introduced to this at a super cuts years ago and it&#x27;s the only thing I use in my hair. If you want a california, sufer type look it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Terrific product! Helps me keep my short hair spiky but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> love the product.good service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing to work on my sons hair that is very fine it holds without getting stiff or sticky good price also</li>
    <li> By far my favorite hair molding paste, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands. Doesn&#x27;t leave ugly flakes like gel,doesn&#x27;t make your hair ridiculously greasy or heavy, washes out easily, and does well with my stubborn hair. Also this stuff is hard to find in brick and mortar locations. I&#x27;ve been using other, more expensive, brands because I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere. Happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product is good for  fine thick hair</li>
    <li> I use this to style my hair everyday. One of these bottle lasted me more than a year. Doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to get good hold, and the best part is that it does not leave a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look in your hair. Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> It is heavy and goopy feeling in my hair.  I have fine hair and it weighs it down too much and robs the shine.  It was recommended on a YouTube video for working with fine hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> the best hair product for men. not greasy and not smelly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six years, and recommend it for anyone with short, spiked hair.  It makes your hair more manageable, easy to style.</li>
    <li> These bottles last forever and the pomade is a great quality for the price - washes out easily, matte natural finish. Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! Apply to wet hair for greasy look. Dry&#x3D; dry look-- not a stiff holding paste.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place without giving it the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  2nd time ordering so that about says it all!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Not too goopy or oily and has just enough hold for my coarse hair. Been using this stuff for over five years now and can&#x27;t find suitable alternative, so why bother?!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 years ever since my wife made me start getting haircuts from her beauty salon.  I stopped going, but never stopped using this.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this as the first layer of product when styling my extremely fine hair. It adds some &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; and builds up my hair for other product to hold onto it.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold with a pliable and soft appearance. I&#x27;ve been using KMS hair play moulding paste for about a decade now.</li>
    <li> throw away your gatsby and get some kms. good hold, good texture, no need to blast hairspray. just the best product i&#x27;ve ever used. i usually used the green and pink and purple gatsby and i&#x27;ve never been as thoroughly satisfied. This worked well with my thin asian hair.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found so far to control my hair and keep it in place all day.</li>
    <li> This product has been a daily hair product for quite sometime. For a time I thought they quit making it, and I tried 3 others that just could not compete. Love it! Keeps my thick frizzy hair manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair has never behaved so well before. I have been getting many compliments on my hair since using this product. If you have curly hair, I suggest you try it.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever. This will keep your hair styled without turning your hair hard. I remember once, I was hanging out with a bunch of idiots. One of them decided to \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; my hair by pressing it down. He marveled out how my hair could look so stiff and be so soft. It triggered a conversation about the product and an uncomfortable memory. Also it won&#x27;t dry out your scalp like other hair products. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Holds hair in form you want well all day.  No grease or residue film either.  Girls can still play with your hair with the product in it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my hair for last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet and dry application works and gives you good natural holding power</li>
    <li> works great. good paste</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years on my short hair and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and waxy for my hair.  Tried a few times with different amounts and just didn&#x27;t have any luck with product.</li>
    <li> Best product with great hold and does not feel like you have anything in your hair. Great for the active lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Very picky about what product I use. This stuff is great. Allows me to move it how I want but leaves a matte finish.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. My favorite hair product and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different ones over the years.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says it will do.  Be careful how much you use, it can weigh your hair down into an oily mess if you goop too much on.  Oh, and it has a distinct fragrance (not my favorite) that fades a bit as the day goes on.  If you are super sensitive to that kind of thing, beware.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the KMS CA Hair Play Molding Paste for years now and have never any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds up my hair perfectly fine for hours on end- there is a distinctive smell but it&#x27;s better than other molding pastes out there. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s because you are getting a quality product here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> Terrific repeat purchase!</li>
    <li> If u want a messy look without looking greasy or wet, this is a great product.  It&#x27;s also easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on your head.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Holds great and washes out easily.</li>
