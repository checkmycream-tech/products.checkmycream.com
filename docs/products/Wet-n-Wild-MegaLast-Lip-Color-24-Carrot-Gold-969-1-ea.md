      <li>If you love orange lipstick and don&#x27;t mind having it feel</li>
      <li>More of a peachy orange-ish gold lipstick, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>Combined with a nude color and it brights up even more.</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>i love this lipstick</li>
      <li>I read a review where this was one of the top lipsticks</li>

      <li>Love this colour.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and it is very bright and vibrant - exactly as I hoped it would be!</li>
      <li>Its a true orange!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but after some searching the web, I found swatches!</li>
      <li>AWESOME I&#x27;M DARK SKIN AND THESE ORANGE LIPSTICK IS THE BUM SPECIALLY WHEN I WALK IN THE CLUB</li>
      <li>It is a nice vibrant orange.</li>
      <li>Well worth it and cheap too.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long-lasting, but easy to remove with basic make-up remover (or even just soap and warm water.)</li>
      <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>#34;blank space.&amp;#34; It was not until i applied a very large amount on myself that my lips looked fully colored.</li>
      <li>I like this lipstick very much.  </li>
      <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
      <li>I got this lipstick because i am really into orange lips for Spring</li>
      <li>Well yesterday i found a whole lot of them</li>
      <li>At this point the orange was too much for me.</li>
      <li>But the main thing i enjoy&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
      <li>I do have a very sensitive face, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even though I used it on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>this color looks great mixed or worn as is and im carmel complicated</li>
      <li>i would definately repurchase this lipstick, only thing is that it makes the lips looks dry at first but its not noticible.</li>
      <li>So as I applied this lipstick I noticed that it did not conform to my lips, if I would glide  a second layet over the first layer, it would mess up the bottom layer</li>
      <li>She wants other colours!</li>

    <li> Love this colour. It is a nice vibrant orange. Seems moisturising on my lips. Will be buying more</li>
    <li> Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on. Simply loves it! She wants other colours! Definitly sa great product!</li>
    <li> I got this lipstick because i am really into orange lips for Spring and i couldnt find it in my town stores. Well yesterday i found a whole lot of them and i hate that i overpaid. But its a great lipstick, stays on me well and is very bright.</li>
    <li> this color is so bright more for light complexion woman. if you like that bright chalk look this is perfect for you</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick very much.  It stays on and lasts for hours.  But the main thing i enjoy&lt;br /&gt;is the color - 969  24 carrot Gold.  Beautiful and a perfect color for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the lipstick to take a driver&#x27;s license photo. I didn&#x27;t want anything red, so I opted for this shade. I did, however, get some compliments for my &amp;#34;looks.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this color ANYWHERE. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but after some searching the web, I found swatches! Its a true orange! Exactly what I was looking for :D</li>
    <li> More of a peachy orange-ish gold lipstick, but I still love it. Combined with a nude color and it brights up even more. My fav summer lipstick buy.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Not available in stores so ordered it online. Like its orange shade, but u need to moisturize your lips prior to applying this lipstick</li>
    <li> AWESOME I&#x27;M DARK SKIN AND THESE ORANGE LIPSTICK IS THE BUM SPECIALLY WHEN I WALK IN THE CLUB I&#x27;M LOOKING JUST LIKE WHAT I EXPECTED ON MY LIPS DIAMONDS ITS THE BEST OF THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I love this color--I ordered 3 and will order again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s chalky and not smooth</li>
    <li> I read a review where this was one of the top lipsticks so thought I would try it.  To me it&#x27;s very dry on the lips.  It has no moisture base which is probably why it will last longer.  Ill stick with my Revlon lipstick.</li>
    <li> i love this lipstick i would definately repurchase this lipstick, only thing is that it makes the lips looks dry at first but its not noticible. great for people of color and everyone else! love it</li>

    <li> Really what it&#x27;s called a carrot color perfect what I wanted !!</li>
    <li> I needed this for a Halloween costume as a scarecrow. I used it to draw circles on my cheeks, and on my lips, and it looked great! It goes on smooth, and it is very bright and vibrant - exactly as I hoped it would be! It&#x27;s long-lasting, but easy to remove with basic make-up remover (or even just soap and warm water.) I do have a very sensitive face, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even though I used it on my cheeks. Great product, great price!</li>
