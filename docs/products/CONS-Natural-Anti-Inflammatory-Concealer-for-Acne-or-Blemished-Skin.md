      <li>Happy to have found it.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff.</li>
      <li>Cons LightBeige has good coverage without showing.</li>
      <li>They also offered a replacement product after it was reformulated, which is an improved product with a better consistency and no PG!   </li>
      <li>I was really impressed with this concealer when I tried it today for the first time.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted to feel nice.</li>
      <li>The cream is very easy to spread on a blemish or an area that tends to break out--in my case, my t-zone.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed by the product on that both counts, and was pleasantly surprised by the coverage and long-wear of the concealer.</li>
      <li>The color is quite light which is exactly what I wanted because I am very fair.  </li>
      <li>When I use it over a blemish, it serves well as a concealer too which I love.</li>
      <li>I love how the ingredients are so nourishing and safe.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer/acne treatment.  </li>
      <li>and if they ever create a lighter version of this, I&#x27;m buying :)</li>
      <li>The founder reached out to me and said he wanted to refund me if I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied</li>
      <li>They need to degrease the formula and put more in the pot, container for the price you are paying for it.</li>
      <li>It also contains propylene glycol, something most people in search of organic products try to avoid.  </li>
      <li>I am sure most have will go through that feeling.</li>
      <li>It provides pretty good coverage for blemishes, pimples and does not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>I am pretty fair skinned</li>
      <li>I love the way it conceals - not greasy, blends right in!!</li>
      <li>I use this product along with CLNS, SALIC, RETIN and the MOIST (maybe available on amazon soon) and my skin looks better now than it did 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>Happy with it so far</li>
      <li>I think if you are darker than fair, you can still use this product by putting it on sparingly before your foundation or powder, and then blend it in really well</li>
      <li>The color looks like dark peach in the container but blends into your skin perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic for covering up blemishes or blemish-prone areas.</li>
      <li>Excellent coverage without being heavy or cakey.</li>
      <li>like it very much.:-)</li>
      <li>It kind of works, but to me it doesn&#x27;t make any real difference compared to the cheap tea tree concealer I got in a sale from The Body Shop which surprisingly STAYS ON for the entire day.</li>
      <li>After my original review, this company contacted me and stated that they would consider reformulating this product to remove propylene glycol as an ingredient.  </li>
      <li>Updating my original review here.</li>
      <li>Original review:  </li>
      <li>It has a soothing, cool, creamy consistency and the dry-down has a light non-shiny finish.</li>
      <li>I received my package quickly and with no damage during shipping.</li>
      <li>I had the light beige originally, and had to switch to the medium beige for the new formula.</li>
      <li>and so blotchiness is way more apparent on my face.</li>
      <li>When I dip my finger in the pot, I&#x27;ve learned to use a very light touch as it&#x27;s easy to get too much on your finger (or a q tip or other dipping tool).  </li>
      <li>and then I applied my regular make up on top, I was so tickled.</li>
      <li>This is my first review of a product on Amazon</li>
      <li>Many products have shown initial promise that fades.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I like the new formula (in the glass jar) better than the old (in the stainless steel tin).</li>
      <li>I usually have to lightly spread it around the area too to make sure it&#x27;s blended well.  </li>
      <li>It covers pretty good, but it&#x27;s very greasy, I sweat in the late Spring and Summer.</li>
      <li>It may be too light if you are using it over a large area though, but even then, if you put foundation over it (and you can add a regular concealer in your skin tone over it as well), it still should work.  </li>
      <li>I do not wear much of it.</li>
      <li>4.5 really.</li>
      <li>Have not noticed if it&#x27;s clearing my skin up or not yet as I&#x27;ve not been wearing it much.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate this product because its medicinal and it appears to help speed the healing time of blemishes while keeping them covered.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It covers really well</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>This is the lightest color they have which doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
      <li>This company has fantastic customer service, they&#x27;re based in the CA Bay Area, and they make such wholesome, quality products.</li>
      <li>I have light skin with yellow undertones</li>
      <li>While it is not the *most* long-wearing I have ever used, the fact that it is natural and covers/blends well is enough for me!</li>
      <li>I have been going natural for a long time but decided to even more with my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s &amp; I still break out a lot as if I was a teen, but it&#x27;s mostly hormonal and stress related!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it over a couple of pimples as well as a concealer on areas of my chin that get plugged pores and so far it healed the 2 pimples really fast and prevented any plugs on my chin whether I wear makeup or not.</li>
      <li>When I am feeling hormonal outbreaks coming on, I always switch out using my normal cover-ups and concealers for this product to help thwart oncoming blemishes.</li>
      <li>The coverage just a bit shy of total but still very good.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and can tolerate this.</li>
      <li>Also, just a note - I had to buy my first order on the Skin By Pom website, because it was out of stock on Amazon at the time that I finally decided to try it.</li>
      <li>I still used it as I really wanted this product and it arrived full other than the mess I had to clean up.  </li>
      <li>For me, the new formula was a shade lighter than the old.</li>
      <li>So far, it shows the most promise for actually healing my condition than anything I&#x27;ve previously tried.</li>
      <li>Amazing for under the eyes, or for healing a pimple which has broken the skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t actually diminish my acne and it doesn&#x27;t really stay on my face</li>
      <li>I have tried CONS Organic Natural Anti- Inflammatory Concealer when we had planned a night out</li>
      <li>I think this product has really considered what make-up for acne prone skin should be and that it should be performative rather than simply cosmetic!</li>
      <li>It looks fairly natural and I like the fact that its organic.</li>
      <li>This stuff does help pimples to calm down and heal.</li>
      <li>Not highly recommended because if these 2 main factors!</li>
      <li>it is just a number, but I do want to feel and look decent as long as I can do something about it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I wanted (1) something natural and (2) something to use on blemishes that would not further irritate them.</li>

<li> The color through me off a little</li>
<li> but I do have small black heads that will come up around my lip.</li>
<li> In a lot of ways, blemishes are like small wounds, and you wouldn&#x27;t rub MAC cosmetics in a wound.</li>
<li> This is thick and hard to spread evenly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Updating my original review here. This is great stuff. Amazing for under the eyes, or for healing a pimple which has broken the skin. I love how the ingredients are so nourishing and safe. I like the new formula (in the glass jar) better than the old (in the stainless steel tin). For me, the new formula was a shade lighter than the old. I had the light beige originally, and had to switch to the medium beige for the new formula. (I&#x27;m half &amp;#34;calico&amp;#34; Caucasian, quarter Spanish/Native American, and quarter Norwegian. I have average &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; skin, a bit on the olive side.)  This stuff does help pimples to calm down and heal. It lasts all day if you set it with a little powder or mineral foundation. Sometimes I have to reapply after eating, or after getting attacked by my toddler. Haha. Also, just a note - I had to buy my first order on the Skin By Pom website, because it was out of stock on Amazon at the time that I finally decided to try it. Pom has a larger selections of their items on their website than they do on Amazon. This company has fantastic customer service, they&#x27;re based in the CA Bay Area, and they make such wholesome, quality products. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received my package quickly and with no damage during shipping. I recently lost my job and don&#x27;t wear make up day to day like I did before. Maybe that is why I have noticed must how splotchy my face has became. I feel that even when I do wear make up it doesn&#x27;t cover it up like it used to. I am sure most have will go through that feeling. Yep it just sneaks up and bites you in the bottom. But you play the hand you are dealt, so I am dealt dry skin, splotches and wrinkles. I am not a person who focuses on my age. it is just a number, but I do want to feel and look decent as long as I can do something about it. I don&#x27;t have severe breakouts but I do have small black heads that will come up around my lip. It seems when I put make up on it just made it look worse. I don&#x27;t know if it was because it is around my lips or what.  I have tried CONS Organic Natural Anti- Inflammatory Concealer when we had planned a night out and I wanted to feel nice. The color through me off a little but as put it on in the areas I wanted to blend in with the rest of my face and then I applied my regular make up on top, I was so tickled. It looked very good.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, feels great and smells great</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried. 4.5 really. The color is a 5. The coverage just a bit shy of total but still very good. Happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> This seems to work to camouflage pimples a bit and also seems to reduce the redness.  I have very sensitive skin and can tolerate this.</li>
    <li> Update!  After my original review, this company contacted me and stated that they would consider reformulating this product to remove propylene glycol as an ingredient.  They also offered a replacement product after it was reformulated, which is an improved product with a better consistency and no PG!   Their customer service and willingness to listen to feedback gets an A+ from me and the concealer is a great product.  Original review:  This is thick and hard to spread evenly.  It also contains propylene glycol, something most people in search of organic products try to avoid.  I will be returning it ASAP!</li>
    <li> It covers pretty good, but it&#x27;s very greasy, I sweat in the late Spring and Summer. I am in my 50&#x27;s &amp; I still break out a lot as if I was a teen, but it&#x27;s mostly hormonal and stress related! This product covers well, but it being so greasy. I do not wear much of it. Have not noticed if it&#x27;s clearing my skin up or not yet as I&#x27;ve not been wearing it much.  Y face looks shiny in those spots where I use it on,y after 3 hours. They need to degrease the formula and put more in the pot, container for the price you are paying for it. Not highly recommended because if these 2 main factors! It&#x27;s expensive and it&#x27;s too greasy!</li>
    <li> I am pretty fair skinned and so blotchiness is way more apparent on my face. This is the lightest color they have which doesn&#x27;t really work for me but maybe if they had lighter colors. UPDATE: The founder reached out to me and said he wanted to refund me if I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied so I took him up on it. I&#x27;m very impressed with this and if they ever create a lighter version of this, I&#x27;m buying :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted (1) something natural and (2) something to use on blemishes that would not further irritate them. I was very impressed by the product on that both counts, and was pleasantly surprised by the coverage and long-wear of the concealer. While it is not the *most* long-wearing I have ever used, the fact that it is natural and covers/blends well is enough for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer. I really like it. It looks fairly natural and I like the fact that its organic. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually diminish my acne and it doesn&#x27;t really stay on my face (the concealer is on the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and creamy side, so it definitely wears off in hotter weather), so that&#x27;s kind of a disappointment. It kind of works, but to me it doesn&#x27;t make any real difference compared to the cheap tea tree concealer I got in a sale from The Body Shop which surprisingly STAYS ON for the entire day.</li>
    <li> very good product. like it very much.:-)</li>
    <li> Cons LightBeige has good coverage without showing. Happy with it so far and I have been using it for several weeks now.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage without being heavy or cakey.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to treat a stubborn weepy rash. So far, it shows the most promise for actually healing my condition than anything I&#x27;ve previously tried. Many products have shown initial promise that fades. Over time. Fingers crossed for this one.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer/acne treatment.  The color is quite light which is exactly what I wanted because I am very fair.  I&#x27;ve been frustrated in the past trying products like these that are always way too dark for my skin.  They always made the area I was trying to cover and heal look worse.  Not this one--it&#x27;s perfect.  It is a relatively thick cream, and a little goes a long way.  When I dip my finger in the pot, I&#x27;ve learned to use a very light touch as it&#x27;s easy to get too much on your finger (or a q tip or other dipping tool).  The cream is very easy to spread on a blemish or an area that tends to break out--in my case, my t-zone.  I dot a little where I want it, then pat the cream in until it is evenly distributed and covers well.  I usually have to lightly spread it around the area too to make sure it&#x27;s blended well.  I think if you are darker than fair, you can still use this product by putting it on sparingly before your foundation or powder, and then blend it in really well so it isn&#x27;t too thick anywhere.  It may be too light if you are using it over a large area though, but even then, if you put foundation over it (and you can add a regular concealer in your skin tone over it as well), it still should work.  When I use it over a blemish, it serves well as a concealer too which I love. I&#x27;ve used it over a couple of pimples as well as a concealer on areas of my chin that get plugged pores and so far it healed the 2 pimples really fast and prevented any plugs on my chin whether I wear makeup or not. The only problem I had with this is that when I got it, the concealer had leaked all over the lid and sides of the small jar.  It did not come sealed either.  I still used it as I really wanted this product and it arrived full other than the mess I had to clean up.  Always room for some improvement, eh?</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for covering up blemishes or blemish-prone areas. It has a soothing, cool, creamy consistency and the dry-down has a light non-shiny finish. It provides pretty good coverage for blemishes, pimples and does not irritate the skin. I really appreciate this product because its medicinal and it appears to help speed the healing time of blemishes while keeping them covered. When I am feeling hormonal outbreaks coming on, I always switch out using my normal cover-ups and concealers for this product to help thwart oncoming blemishes. I think its great stuff and I highly recommend it!! In a lot of ways, blemishes are like small wounds, and you wouldn&#x27;t rub MAC cosmetics in a wound. I think this product has really considered what make-up for acne prone skin should be and that it should be performative rather than simply cosmetic! I use this product along with CLNS, SALIC, RETIN and the MOIST (maybe available on amazon soon) and my skin looks better now than it did 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of a product on Amazon but I buy from them all the time.  I was really impressed with this concealer when I tried it today for the first time.  I have been going natural for a long time but decided to even more with my makeup.  This is one of the products I decided to try the other day.  It covers really well and you only need a little so it will go a long way.  The color looks like dark peach in the container but blends into your skin perfectly.  I have light skin with yellow undertones so I&#x27;m impressed it blended so well.  If it helps with my blemishes also I will never want to run out.  I will try to update if it helps reduce my blemishes also!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for those not so perfect days!!!! I love the way it conceals - not greasy, blends right in!! Definitely a keeper!!!</li>
