      <li>They both have a very pleasant, mildly vanilla/coconut aroma.  </li>
      <li>Phenomenal product!</li>
      <li>The top of the line !</li>
      <li>While there&#x27;s a lot to like about this shampoo, it didn&#x27;t do great things for my fine hair.</li>

      <li>My hair felt clean and still moisturized my hair was easy to detangle and that was awesome</li>

      <li>so the scent kind of turns me</li>
      <li>It suds nicely, smells like baked goods, and increases my hair&#x27;s shine.  </li>
      <li>I find with Fekkai that it&#x27;s like having a salon treatment plan in my own home.  </li>
      <li>I remembered someone telling me once that if you want to sell your home that the vanilla scent is one of the most successful to waft through the house because it reminds most people of childhood, etc.  </li>
      <li>They have a light, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I need a good shampoo that gets out styling products easily to keep my hair from breaking off.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received samples of this and the conditioner, as well as the masque, complimentary via a Vox Box on Influenster.com. Unfortunately the sample size for the shampoo and conditioner were so small that I could only use the product once and hence cannot form an opinion. The only thing I can say is that its smells nice.</li>
    <li> Received this as a sample from influenster to try and I absolutely love it. The shampoo was so rich and lathery and my hair felt squeaky clean but soft. I could actually feel it working to make my hair better. The shampoo also smelled so good. Along with the conditioner and the masque I felt that my hair had a brand new cut and looked so good. I am so happy I was given the opportunity to try the Fekkai Prx shampoo and will be incorporating it into my daily hair routine.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff. I constantly dye my hair so shampoo with good qualities is a must for me!! It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!! Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, and incorporated it into my daily hair routine.  I received a very small sampling of this, along with the conditioner and the masque.  I will, of course, review these separately.  This shampoo, first and foremost, smells amazing!  I am one that purchases many products based on smell.  However juvenile that may be, its hard for me not to base some of my decisions on smell.  I would definitely recommend this based on smell alone.  It is simply amazing, and really stays with you for awhile after your hair has dried.  I only had enough of the sample to use for 2 or 3 days.  Those 2 or 3 days were enough for me to realize it works great!  My hair is dry, damaged and colored many times over, and I found this shampoo worked amazing!  It left it feeling silky, healthy and shiny, and BOY did the color pop!  My hair was so drab, but this shampoo and conditioner combo really brought the color out!  I would definitely purchase this product!  I would also recommend to use this shampoo with the corresponding conditioner, along with the masque!  Wow, your hair will love you!</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample in my Influenster box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this shampoo! I have very thick, coarse hair. It is a very thick formula, but for me it was perfect. Not only does it smell AMAZING (vanilla scent), it also left my hair feeling soft and clean. I might not recommend for someone with thinner hair, but if you have a lot of hair to control -- this is awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Usually I don&#x27;t use shampoo but one a month and co wash with conditioner once a week because shampoo makes my hair feel dry and stripped but not with this shampoo. My hair felt clean and still moisturized my hair was easy to detangle and that was awesome I massaged my scalp with this product and my hair felt so good.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free samples from influenster.</li>
    <li> This Prx Shampoo is essential no matter what other shampoo you care to switch it off with.  I switch it off with the Fekkai Shea Butter and the Fekkai Apple Cider so as to take care of all bases in the proper treatment of my hair.  This makes my hair squeaky clean and so soft while letting my natural curl take nice form and not frizz out.  The fragrance is heavenly and light, a mixture of vanilla and something else.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of this if your hair is short as it goes a long way so you will be getting more than your money out of it.  I find with Fekkai that it&#x27;s like having a salon treatment plan in my own home.  I&#x27;m more than happy with this.</li>
    <li> I have always Liked  this</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this shampoo. I originally tried this through a sample that I received. It does burn your eyes more than any other shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> it smells good and lathers well. however, I don&#x27;t see any repairing this shampoo does. (I am using the Prx conditioner too) Also I am surprised to know this shampoo contains SLS and Paraben. I thought for the price we are paying, this should be a higher quality shampoo but it&#x27;s NOT.</li>
    <li> Coconut scented shampoo which works fine, but I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s special about it.</li>
    <li> Quality product with budget price.</li>
    <li> I use to like the old PRX smell a lot more. Quality still the same though.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have chemically treated hair (colored) and I am in my 40s so my hair is more brittle and drier than ever before. My hair is shoulder length, naturally wavy to frizzy, and I do not do anything that is abusive to hair such as teasing, curling, straightening, tight little braids, etc. I have used many shampoos and conditioners that were created for people with colored hair or chemically treated hair. I only wash my hair every couple of days to help my hair color to last longer and stripping the hair of natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on with my review.  While we all know that scents and fragrances do not make your hair any cleaner, let me just say the vanilla scent in this shampoo makes you want to eat it. It smells so good. Lathering it up in the shower, made the whole bathroom smell like vanilla and I love scented shampoos that do not smell like perfume.  However, this was the only benefit to this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care whose name is on the bottle. I guarantee that Fekkai allowed his name to be used and that he was not in the lab concocting this product. However, this is what you are basically paying for it since I did not see any huge differences in the ingredient list in contrast to other store shampoos. I had to use a ton of the product to get it to lather. I normally use a walnut sized amount or less. This product, I had to use at least 2 walnut sized portions. This means, I am not going to get many uses from this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the thing that bothered me most as I was rinsing my hair, my hair developed the texture of straw. It was so dry looking and felt like the hair was stripped of moisture. While, this might be a good thing for a clarifying shampoo, I wanted one that was gentle for frequent washing and safe for colored hair. I looked on the bottle and nowhere did I see that it is safe for colored hair so I went to the web site and a lot of women were saying that they used it with their color hair, it does make me wonder if it is intended for colored hair or chemically treated hair. I have to believe that if it stripped my hair of so much moisture to give it a straw like feel that it also took a little of my hair color with it. This means that I will need to reapply my hair color more and deep condition my hair which will coat the hair and make it look lifeless and flat possibly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to buy this product and I am glad that I did not have to buy this bottle to test it.  While the smell of the shampoo grabbed me and would have made me a loyal customer right then and there; the dryness of my hair and how awful it felt and looked afterwards has driven me away from this shampoo forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month now, and I LOVE it!!! My hair is soft and shiny without any weighty, gloppy feel. I wash my hair every other day, and with most hair care products, my hair feels limp and flat on day two, but I see a significant difference in how full and bouncy my hair looks and feels on day two. It may seem like a pricey product, but this shampoo, like all Fekkai hair care products, a lil&#x27; dab will do ya - really - you only need dollop about the size of a quarter. I&#x27;ve also noticed the color of my hair is not nearly as drab and washed out looking (it&#x27;s going white). Phenomenal product! I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with this one!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It only takes a small dollap (less than a quarter size) to work up a rich lather. The scent is refreshing without being heavy or cloying. And my hair still feels and looks great the next day -- most of the time I shampoo every other day. I will likely purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, rich lather, you can actually not use conditioner and hair will still feel silky and untangled.  Luxury product for your hair and worth the price!  This shampoo is such a treasure and treat to use!  You will feel spoiled!</li>
    <li> I am a Fekkai fan and have been for years.  I love the quality of their products and how your hair looks and feels after shampooing.  This one has Argan oil and is vanilla scented.  It leaves your hair feeling silky.  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand.  I thought, from reading the description, that it might be a shampoo I could use without conditioner - it says it detangles as well as cleansing and protecting!  It has Argan oil in it, of course that helps detangle, right?  Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;I use shampoo+conditioner 2 in 1&#x27;s on lazy nights when I don&#x27;t want to be in the shower forever.  I really wanted this to do what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;I have 3/4 down my back length, EXTREMELY (I&#x27;ve been told by many beauticians they&#x27;ve never worked with hair like mine) THICK hair.  It&#x27;s also color treated, which takes 3.5 boxes of color to do.  The first time I used this shampoo the scent was what got me first, it smells wonderful!  Then I found out how thick it is, NICE!&lt;br /&gt;Being that it is so thick I thought maybe I wouldn&#x27;t need as much as I usually use.  I was wrong.  Super thick turned out to mean harder to spread through hair, at least for me.  I kept in mind that that could have been because of my huge volume of hair, though.  I finally got it through my hair, lathering along the way.  As usual I do my best not to scrub the length of my hair too hard so I don&#x27;t do damage.  The shampoo felt nice and smelled great while I was doing that.  Then I found out the big downside of thick, thick shampoo!  It takes forever to rinse it out!  Just when I thought it was all out I&#x27;d twist my hair just to see that it wasn&#x27;t all gone!  So, rinse again!  Must have done this 3 times before it was rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;Even after it was all rinsed out, my hair smelled great!  Big PLUS, there!  I love when scent doesn&#x27;t disappear (if I like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say this.  After I get out of the shower I just turn my head over, let my hair fall and wrap it in a towel, leaving the towel on for quite a while to get the water out.  I don&#x27;t rub it or anything.  I don&#x27;t brush it while it&#x27;s wet at all, I don&#x27;t do anything to it other than wrap a scrunchie around it a couple of times just to keep it out of my face, and remove the scrunchie when I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got up in the morning to a headful of what felt like straw and looked even worse!  My hair isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;, the only thing I do to it is coloring and put it in a scrunchie.  I don&#x27;t comb it, blow dry it, use curling irons, get perms - heck, I rarely even brush it!  This shampoo by itself might be wonderful for someone who has shorter hair or hair that isn&#x27;t SO thick but it&#x27;s not for me!  If you hair that&#x27;s &amp;#34;easier to work with&amp;#34; it might be great for you!  Good luck!!  I gave it 3 stars because it smells so darn good I could eat it!  LOL</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Fekkai hair products, and I am really happy with the Prx Shampoo as well as the coordinating conditioner.  They have a light, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  The shampoo feels very rich, and even though I have quite a bit of long hair, I don&#x27;t need to use more than a quarter-sized dollop.  After shampooing, my hair feels clean and free of build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s too warm to bother with the hair dryer, I use a bit of curling product and let my hair air-dry into waves.  With some shampoos, my hair ends up crazy frizzy, but with the Fekkai I get nice waves and no frizz, even on humid days.  When I do blow dry my hair, it looks sleek and smooth and feels very soft.</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly, but unfortunately, the product itself fails to impress.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean, and it cuts down on volume compared to the other shampoo I normally use.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair makeup, but I won&#x27;t be using the rest of the bottle after giving it a few tries.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a great scent and does a great job on my daughter&#x27;s medium-thickness hair.  I tried it with my fine hair and I was a frizz ball.  Her hair looks beautiful and smells great though!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every item from the Fekkai line. This shampoo performs right on par with the rest of the line - a good solid brand but no miracle products here. It gets your hair feeling soft and clean, and is complementary to any conditioner. I tend to like shampoo that has softening effects, and this has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a strong vanilla scent. The scent stays in your hair long after you wash it. I personally do not like the scent of vanilla but if you are a fan of the scent I would say you will be satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for my hair type. My hair was amazing until I decided to have an ombre style a year ago. since then it has been a disaster, dry, breaking etc. I have invested a lot of money in expensive products and nothing seemed to work. This shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;m glad I discovered Fekkai products. I use this shampoo and Fekkai Prx Reparatives Mask 7 oz, they leave my hair soft, shiny and smelling delicious. If you have dry/frizzy ends I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It smells so delicious. It has a subtle Vanilla scent that is not at all overwhelming. The shampoo lathers well and leaves my hair smelling and feeling fabulous.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo and since using it I&#x27;ve been receiving many compliments about how shiny my hair is and I&#x27;m 60 years old.  I found this product on Amazon and much less expensive than the department stores.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I tried two Fekkai shampoos, this one and the Shea Butter one. This one worked out better for me. My hair is softer and fuller, though I still get flyaways. It lathers well and rinses off well for me. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell. It smells extremely sweet, like really strong cookie dough or something. I don&#x27;t mind fragrant but I usually prefer something more floral or citrus-y. All in all, I like best that my hair looks thicker than it used to.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried Fekkai products.  I used the shampoo and conditioner in the PrX Reparatives line.  Both products are very concentrated and less is needed than typical shampoos or conditioners.  The both have a pleasant vanilla scent.    The shampoo forms lots of luxurious lather (need to add additional water) and does a good job cleaning hair.  It is a bit difficult to rinse out if you use too much.  The bottle claims \\&quot;Repairs &amp; Protects\\&quot; - I have no comment on if this is true.  I did not notice much difference compared to my regular brands of shampoo.  It did not strip my hair or cause it to tangle up.    I have used the PrX shampoo and conditioner both separately and as a system - they work fine either way.  The price is very expensive (eighteen dollars for eight ounces) but very little product is needed for each wash, so it may not be too much worse of a value compared to standard salon brands.  Rating 3 1/2 stars, rounded  down to 3 stars, mostly due to price.</li>
    <li> All of the ladies in my household (all three of them) tried this shampoo and loved the smell of the shampoo. They were not particularly convinced that it &amp;#34;gives weak hair the strength to resist future damage&amp;#34; but that is more a of long-term thing and this is one little 8 ounce bottle. They were impressed with the way it sudsed up and quickly and easily rinsed out and did not feel like their hair was being weighed down at all.</li>
    <li> I generally love Fekkai products, and this shampoo is no exception. It lathers well and rinses out cleanly, leaving your hair clean and shiny without feeling heavy. If you&#x27;re like me and have hair with all the moisture of a Brillo pad, then this formula really helps soften and smooth even coarse, brittle hair. Love it, and it&#x27;s definitely become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Our family has all tried this pricey conditioner, as well as its companion shampoo.  They both have a very pleasant, mildly vanilla/coconut aroma.  For the conditioner, use a decent-sized amount and make sure you don&#x27;t rinse it out right away, and it will do exactly what you would expect a conditioner to do.  These types of products always encourage you to use them with their companion product (the shampoo bottle suggest you use the Fekkai conditioner, etc.), and doing so seems to be helpful, especially in terms of the way your hair smells!  And, at the very least, my frizzies have been reduced...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not investigated the ethics of this company, I know many folks are concerned about this; it is, however, my understanding that Fekkai is owned by one of the giant corporations now, so it would be worth looking into. [Review also used for the shampoo]</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this Fekkai Prx shampoo the Prx conditioner and finishing oil.  She has thick, dark hair, that can be a bit dry and these products leave it brilliantly shiny, smooth, and soft to the touch.  They have a great scent, if not a little overpowering with the finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price of this product, it&#x27;s a bit of an indulgence; however, if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, it&#x27;s a good line of products to do that with.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, a light slightly vanilla scent that lingers in the hair all day.  This shampoo left my hair soft and shiny all day long - which I admit surprised me.  I generally find most shampoos to be about the same.  I would happily purchase this again depending on the price.  The bottle is small but I found that I needed far less of it to wash my hair than I do normally.  I would pay up to about six dollars a bottle for it based off of what a great job it did on my hair.  It&#x27;s maybe a half step down from salon shampoo.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but any vanilla scented body cream or wash gets on my radar. I had to try this one and am glad I did. If not for the decided excess of lather, I would give it five stars. It does the job though after much rinsing out of my thick hair, and it felt and smelled good doing it. Pair it with [[ASIN:B00FRDPSE8 Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner 8 Fl Oz]], and you have a wonderful combination. It is not the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is up there. It contains SLS, which some users may want to avoid. I have no such compunction and my wife likes it as well for her color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> I received this in a VoxBox to review. I used it and it helped give my hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again (I used the reparative mask for my hair and the conditioner as well). Don&#x27;t use too much or too often. It was difficult to rinse out and my hair did feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; after so per instructions on shampoo, I&#x27;d definitely mix up your hair care regime with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this shampoo. It is very rich and emollient. A little is enough to work into a big lather. I also like the scent, which is mostly vanilla to my noise. However, I think it is subtle enough that a gent could easily use without any issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my hair is softer with use. I have quite a bit of volume and curl in my hair, and my hair was not heavier or weighed down. In addition, my hair can get a bit brittle and sometimes it breaks. I have not noticed a lot of breakage, although I am not really certain either this shampoo has helped reduce breakage or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sulfate-free, which matters to me, so I&#x27;d never use it as a daily shampoo. Regardless, it&#x27;s a rich shampoo that seems to work for my hair, even if it seems a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to sample before investing in a full bottle? The three-letter drugstore has a 2-ounce size available. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Note - This is a P&amp;G product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really good!  And cleans your hair really well...it is a bit drying/striping.  What I did not like is that it stripped more color out than I would prefer (my hair is dyed darker), especially for a salon brand.  Also, it made my scalp get tiny dots of dandruff like stuff when I use it consistently.  Don&#x27;t think this will be a regular shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I didn&#x27;t feel like this actually repaired my hair at all. The smell was heavenly, and it lathered really well, but my hair felt just as damaged after</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo! I&#x27;ve been a Fekkai fan since 1999 and love his products. I received a complimentary sample of this shampoo via Influenster and loved how it made my hair look and feel.  In fact, i&#x27;ve already purchased the full size!  My hair looked healthier, shiny and bouncy!  Loved it.</li>
    <li> Lovely, they look like china and are sturdy, not like cheap plastic dishes.  I am very pleased.  I alternate this shampoo with Fekkaii brilliant glossing shampoo.</li>
    <li> *Smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Vanilla Lace&amp;#34;. If you don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s like, think semi-70&#x27;s vanilla with a musky overtone. You will either like it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice, gentle shampoo---don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still great! But it doesn&#x27;t do what I need it to. If you don&#x27;t need a shampoo to remove styling product residue *and* be gentle, this one is great. It&#x27;s almost as good as the Pureology Hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes go 3-4 days between shampoos now due to damage from bleaching out my hair. I&#x27;ve found a few products (Fekkai Shea Pot de Crème, Christophe Serum, Fekkai Glossing serum, Tigi Rockaholic Dirty Secret dry shampoo) that let me fake silky hair for 3 (sometimes four) days. At the end of 3 or 4 days however, between my oily scalp and the products that&#x27;s a lot of work to expect from a shampoo. This PRX Shampoo is so gentle, I have to use it at least twice if I have any kind of styling product residue. It does leave my hair tangle-free, soft, and easy to manage. For that I&#x27;ll give it five stars. For having to wash twice, there are other shampoos from Fekkai that will do the job just as gently but can also get out your styling products.  (My favorite would be the Shea, followed by their Color Care)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with two shampoos this leaves my hair pretty smooth and soft. I would recommend this to any of my friends who had damaged hair, who maybe didn&#x27;t use much product in it. I don&#x27;t like Vanilla Lace/Vanilla musk so the scent kind of turns me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, quality high-end-feel packaging. Easy flip top cap if you have a hard time messing with bottles in the shower like I do.</li>
    <li> I have long, very fine blonde hair and since it can be prone to breakage, I thought this sounded like a great shampoo to try. However, over the past week, I&#x27;ve found it to make my hair feel dull and oilier than usual and took longer to comb out after washing because there were more tangles. It was also difficult to get all the shampoo out of my hair, probably because of the SLS (sodium laurel sulfate), which is what makes shampoo suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells very lovely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not good for fine, thin hair&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to rinse out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: the Fekkai PRX Shampoo is a product I probably won&#x27;t finish using and am unlikely to purchase for my own use.</li>
    <li> I love not only how it (and the matching conditioner) make my hair feel silky and lay smoother with less flyaways, but it works well over time. I&#x27;ve noticed some shampoos feel good the first week or so and then your hair starts to get dry underneath all the coatings it puts on your hair. With this, I don&#x27;t seem to have the same build-up and my hair stays well moisturized. Also, while it is pretty expensive, it only takes a very small amount so it lasts longer than less expensive shampoos I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s still more expensive, but this does help me not mind as much :).</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It not only has helped with my dry hair issues , it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> While there&#x27;s a lot to like about this shampoo, it didn&#x27;t do great things for my fine hair. As another reviewer pointed out, sometimes you can have too much lather, and that can make it hard to rinse all the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice fresh vanilla smell and you don&#x27;t need much to get a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I know too well that I have difficult hair. I&#x27;m sure this would probably suit someone who has a more normal texture to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;ll be tempted to try a Fekkai shampoo that would be better suited to my fine and highly-processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t bad either, when you consider that a bottle will surely last a long time. So I can recommend the product, with the caveat that there are other formulas that are better suited for fine hair. All in all, a very nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> Use this when your hair is dry and fried. My salon used the wrong color on my hair so they then had to bleach it to get the right shade and this really helped the over processing.</li>
    <li> Love, would purchase again. I have thick, coarse hair and this really cleaned my hair up good and made my hair feel better.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair magical, but it has tamed my hair BETTER than other shampoos. Better volume.  Use sparingly in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, maybe once a week-you don&#x27;t want to overdo it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and I love the light sent.</li>
    <li> Performance5 of 5&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious Experience5 of 5&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance5 of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better every Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My hair actually looks better every time i shampoo with this product. I am totally in love with it and am blown away with the amount of body it gives my hair each time it is used. The amount of luster, body and shine are amazing. I will be using this shampoo and conditioner from now on.&amp;#34;I recieved this as a free product to test for my opinion and give feedback</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from  Influenster to review.  I liked that the shampoo was thick with a clean, vanilla smell.  It lathered really well and the real test came when I rinsed it.  Because we have hard water, most shampoos leave my hair stiff.  This shampoo left my hair feeling clean and softer than usual.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo from Influenster to try out. I really loved the vanilla scent but unfortunately that scent does not stay in your hair afterwards. It has a very thick creamy texture that suds a medium amount. It took a while to rinse out but it was fine. It left my hair feeling soft and smelling like argan oil.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well. It has a subtle vanilla scent- it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too. The only drawback was that since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, I only got 2 uses out of the sample they sent me. Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product- this did not weigh my hair down whatsoever it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change. I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair! It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
    <li> I love the vanilla scent of it, but it left my hair a little dry after a few uses. \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo, it left my hair feeling silky, smooth, and clean. I doesn&#x27;t hurt that is smells really good too. I was able to try out a complimentary sample from Influenster!! The next day my hair was still looking great!</li>
    <li> Being mixed of italian and mexican genetics, my hair is about as dry thick and curly as it gets. Due to my constant need for change and something new I am a frequent colorer of my hair. I received this product complimentary to test and was really thrilled with the results. the shampoo was a smooth creamy texture with a nice smell that made my hair noticeably softer after drying and styling. I would recommend using with conditioner and reparative mask for a mind blowing change in softness of hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, a little goes a long way for my super long bleach highlighted blonde hair. It left my hair clean but not stripped.  It has a very slightly oily feeling ( which I liked) while cleansing and almost feels as if you are not completely rinsing out the product.  Because of this, my hair was left hydrated (preferred) and not raw squeaky clean (here comes the straw).  I also felt that I didn&#x27;t need to use a super damage remedy conditioner afterwards. Good product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others that I would not recommend this Fekkai shampoo to anyone with thin to normal hair.  Its best for dry hair types.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my hair moisturized in the dead of winter. My hair stylist said that I have no residue left in my hair meaning that the quality of my shampoo is high.</li>
    <li> This has a very good smell and leaves your hair hydrated without frizz. Lightly musky with a mysterious under-note, I always gets compliments on the smell when husband gets close!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this shampoo.  I felt like I was pampering myself to try such an expensive shampoo, and I reminded myself that with the higher quality hair care products, you usually need much less of the product, which means a bottle will last a lot longer than the cheaper shampoos that empty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with the scent.  It&#x27;s a really soft vanilla smell.  I remembered someone telling me once that if you want to sell your home that the vanilla scent is one of the most successful to waft through the house because it reminds most people of childhood, etc.  So no argument on the scent, it&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that&#x27;s on the thick side, but tends to be dry and flyaway.  I&#x27;ve been trying to solve this problem for a few years now, and so I was thrilled to give this fancy-schmancy shampoo a good try.  The first few times I used it, I loved it, but my hair started to get that &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; feeling, sort of heavy and uncooperative.  I did my usual trick for this, rinsed my hair with a vinegar/water mixture, to get the waxy feeling off of it.  Then I used one of my heavy duty conditioners overnight under a shower cap, to get it back in gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my regular rotation of a few different shampoos and conditions, for almost 2 weeks, then gave the Fekkai Prx shampoo another try.  I&#x27;m so sorry, I hate doing negative reviews, and I had hoped that on my second round of using it, I could report better results, but it was just so darn heavy on my hair, and felt yucky.  The best part about it was the awesome scent, but obviously that is little comfort with my hair looking awful and feeling awful, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it may work for someone else, possibly my hair type wasn&#x27;t a good match for it.  And because I have tried a couple other products from the Fekkai line (the Brilliant Gloss conditioner and styling creme) and I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> My hair breaks off very easily, so I decided to try both the Fekkai Prx Shampoo and Conditioner together as a set to help the condition of my hair.  I have natural blond hair that is baby fine but I have a lot of it.  It has a texture that can sometimes almost be like bleached hair.  This means that it breaks off very easily.  It also tangles easily because it is fine.  I have to use heavy conditioners, but I also have to be careful what type I use so that it doesn&#x27;t look weighed down and greasy.  However, if I don&#x27;t use a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough conditioner, my hair is very tangly and looks dried out. Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products, so it&#x27;s not only the cheap stuff).  I need a good shampoo that gets out styling products easily to keep my hair from breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My favorite shampoo has turned out to be Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing Shampoo.  So that is the shampoo I compare others to.  I didn&#x27;t like the vanilla scent of this Prx shampoo.  I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  The Prx shampoo lathered very nicely and rinsed out easily.  I had trouble combing the Prx conditioner through my hair.  I can&#x27;t be certain if that was a result of the shampoo or the conditioner, since I used them several times as a set. My hair looked very dried out when I finished drying it, but it did look nice when I fixed it the next morning (I used extra hair oil when styling it).  Because of the good lather and clean rinse-out, I am rating the Fekkai Prx shampoo 2 stars (as opposed to 1 star for the conditioner), because I can&#x27;t overlook the fact that I didn&#x27;t like the smell and my hair was very tangly and difficult to comb out.  A reconstructive shampoo (&amp; conditioner) shouldn&#x27;t leave your hair all tangly to be broken off when trying to get out the knots.</li>
    <li> What I really love is the vanilla fragrance. It is so heavenly! I tried this shampoo with and without using conditioner for 3 weeks. The first half with and the second without. When I used conditioner which was a different brand, my hair had this really weird gross feel to it and I could not get beyond two days without encountering that feeling. Without conditioner I could go four days before I noticed any weirdness with my hair. No fly-aways or lack of lustre. I have long thick hair which is past the middle of my back, so I played with the amount to use beginning with pea sized and moving up. I had to use a quarter sized amount of shampoo in order to get a decent lather. We have really hard water here and I didn&#x27;t notice a problem with rinsing the lather and residual soap. Again, loved the scent.</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of these argan oil products in the mail and although I have long hair and the sample wasn&#x27;t enough to use properly I loved the smell. I was quite reserved when I saw the price but I bit the bullet and bought the shampoo and conditioner anyway.  What a waste of money. Although the smell was great the shampoo left my hair dry as can be and the conditioner barely got the moisture back. What a disappointment. I will never waste my money on your products again. I expected so much more for the name it bares!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner.  My hair is damaged as I am growing out and my next step was to cut it but after washing, my hair is soft and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Took away my flyaways!</li>
    <li> Fekkai Prx shampoo is a delight for the senses starting with the delicious vanilla scent.  This delightful shampoo lathers up into a soft, creamy lather that pampers the hair and scalp.  It left my hair soft and moisturized.  My chronically dry scalp felt nourished.  I didn&#x27;t notice any exceptional shine (but I went on to use the Prx oil which left my hair with an exceptional sheen).  Unfortunately the lovely vanilla scent did not linger.</li>
    <li> My hair is a natural dark brown which I&#x27;ve recently been bleaching to aide in the fight against grey.  It tends to get crispy.  And though I like the color, I hate the crispy texture.  This shampoo kept my hair soft for days. My hair felt transformed. It suds nicely, smells like baked goods, and increases my hair&#x27;s shine.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers and rinses well, and it doesn’t have an offensive perfume smell either during or after application.  Your hair will feel “lighter” or smoother.  A little goes a long way, so you can really make this bottle last which is important given its $17 price tag here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The top of the line !</li>
    <li> Got this complimentary from influenster. After just one use of the shampoo conditioner and mask, my hair had felt better than It had in years. I am def buying this. Thanks fekkai and influenster</li>
