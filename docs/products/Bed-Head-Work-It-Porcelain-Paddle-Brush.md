      <li>Prestige manufacturing, sturdy material, and fashionable color makes this brush the ideal brush for any female in your life.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I put it on my Christmas list.</li>
      <li>Best girls brush for fine and corse hair hands down.</li>
      <li>I love that brush so much, it makes my hair very smooth and it&#x27;s practical because of its size.</li>
      <li>The head looks huge to me, but she says it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;AAAAAAA+++++</li>
      <li>The material the brush is made out of is also great, comfortable to hold for long periods.</li>
      <li>For the first couple of uses the brush held a lot of static but after some spray it did go away.</li>
      <li>I have long and wavy hair, it does a great job untangling all my knots.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.</li>
      <li>I love that it has both natural and plastic bristles and the cushion makes it easy on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Helps gets my tangles out easily and has a large paddle for hair like mine.</li>
      <li>I love the mixture of natural and synthetic bristles.</li>
      <li>and this is the first brush that doesn&#x27;t pull a ton of hair out when using it.</li>
      <li>I first tried it at a salon.</li>
      <li>Works great for thick hair and also for long fine hair.  </li>
      <li>where the head and the handle join it&#x27;s got a huge gap where it was not seated properly</li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely loves this brush.  </li>
      <li>and the bristles are really sturdy.</li>
      <li>It works beautifully to straighten my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
      <li>My original brush is now almost 5 years old and was starting to show its age.</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine hair that tangles easily, this brush smoothes it right out with far less pain than any other I&#x27;ve tried including all the so called detangeling combs and brushes.</li>
      <li>I always buy a new one annually.</li>
      <li>I actually came to the page to buy a second one because my first one has really started to show it&#x27;s age</li>
      <li>I use a comb when my hair is wet, but once it is dry, I only need to use this brush 3-4 strokes and everything is perfectly smooth.</li>
      <li>I rarely use a blowdryer, so not sure how it performs as a styling brush.</li>
      <li>Once it was broken in it was fine.</li>

    <li> I love that brush so much, it makes my hair very smooth and it&#x27;s practical because of its size. If you don&#x27;t like bigger brushes that&#x27;s not the one for you.</li>
    <li> Best Paddle Brush Ever! I had to order it online because it is not carried in stores anymore. My original brush is now almost 5 years old and was starting to show its age. It works beautifully to straighten my long, thick, curly hair. I love the mixture of natural and synthetic bristles. This is the only brush I will use when blow drying my hair. The grip is comfortable too! I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. Thank you Amazon for stocking this! I may have to buy another in case it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes. I used it once and fell in love with it and had to have it. I now use it everday :D</li>

    <li> Love this brush! Never has my hair been softer! It really gets knots out and it feels wonderful on my scalp. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this brush.  She says it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair.  The head looks huge to me, but she says it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;AAAAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> This brush leaves my hair noticeably smoother. I use it for every day brushing and when blow drying my hair. For the first couple of uses the brush held a lot of static but after some spray it did go away. The material the brush is made out of is also great, comfortable to hold for long periods.</li>
    <li> Best girls brush for fine and corse hair hands down. My daughter has fine hair that tangles easily, this brush smoothes it right out with far less pain than any other I&#x27;ve tried including all the so called detangeling combs and brushes. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>

I love it</li>
    <li> where the head and the handle join it&#x27;s got a huge gap where it was not seated properly so when it breaks loose which it will i&#x27;ll be fixing it properly. that&#x27;s the last time i buy any bed head products!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a solid brush but initially, it&#x27;s a little hard on the head.  Once it was broken in it was fine.</li>
    <li> Besides the great neon pink color, I&#x27;m not too impressed with this brush. It collects dust SO easily and makes the cleaning upkeep really difficult. I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and have tried a million hair brushes.  My sister is a beautician and I&#x27;ve had plenty of access to all the best stuff throughout the years.  Brushes, detanglers, combs, conditioners, and don&#x27;t forget brush hair starting at the ends.... you name it.  All the tricks and all the know how and way too much money for expensive beauty outlet exclusives (where you need a beauticians license just to buy!) forget it!  Brushing hair has never been this easy :)  Good for you Bed Head! I LOVE this brush! :)</li>
