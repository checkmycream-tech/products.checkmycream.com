      <li>only does it make my hair healthy &amp; shiny, it also works as an amazing de-tangler for both my 5 year old daughter and myself.  </li>
      <li>This really worked to smooth the damage and save my hair.  </li>
      <li>It really works for me, it makes the ends rally smooth and healthier</li>
      <li>It keeps the frizz out of my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and leaves the curls soft to the touch, rather than having to add gel which makes her curls &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;  I love it.</li>
      <li>i found a huge difference and improvement on my hair after the first time i use this, and the result became not as strong as the first time, maybe my hair had been fixed?  </li>
      <li>My hair looks better when I use this product - I generally air-dry, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it protects hair from heat.</li>
      <li>Feels a bit greasy at first.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time about a year ago.  </li>
      <li>Lots of friends noticed it the first day I used it (</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight.  </li>
      <li>Hair is much easier to comb through with product</li>
      <li>but I end up using it about once per week depending on how much I notice the split ends.</li>
      <li>The retail price is reasonable and I&#x27;m not the type to spend $15+ on beauty products.  </li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s really unruly and frizzy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t help with blowdrying, it doesn&#x27;t really help protect your hair, it just coats it without helping mend my split ends.</li>
      <li>I loved it the first time I tried it because it made my hair straight and silky, but then when I washed my hair the next few occassions I noticed that my hair was really tangled and dry at the ends, so I used more conditioner.</li>
      <li>I smooth it on my curls once my hair is dry, and it takes the frizzies out and separates the curls without flattening them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular product for a couple years now and for the price</li>
      <li>I used this as directed at first: 2 pumps after showering for the first application starting at the tips and working it half-way up the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to tame my wavy hair for years, thinking it&#x27;ll look better straight.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product..</li>
      <li>They sell it in packs of two for the price of a little more than one item.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to mend your hair, look to Nexxus&#x27;s new ProMend line.</li>
      <li>Less is more with this, one pump or less for full face, neck and hands.</li>
      <li>Overall, use it for a special occcasion, but don&#x27;t depend on it for daily use</li>
      <li>I like how it makes my hair soft and also helps detangle the ends.</li>
      <li>And they all left much to be desired.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with my naturally wavy/curly hair every since I chemically straightened it 2 years ago.</li>
      <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this BEFORE I cut off so much of my hair.</li>
      <li>and I suggest to buy it directly from Pantene distributor here.</li>
      <li>I have dyed my hair a lot and use heated tools to style my hair, this product really helps with my split ends and ultimate softness.  </li>
      <li>so normally the directed amount  is never enough and</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone :) the cold dry air of the mountains plus the elements are really harsh, my hair looks and feels so much better after using this!</li>
      <li>I guess it helped my split ends a little, but the heaviness of the product wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I just 2 pumps each day to smooth my hair, but I have very thick hair.  </li>

<li> I just 2 pumps each day to smooth my hair, but I have very thick hair.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any additional changes except it weighing down my hair (I have medium, not thick hair, so this may have something to do with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products, but this is the only one that has ever allowed my hair to grow long!  </li>
<li> It all so leaves my hair soft feeling and slightly  shiny looking.</li>
<li> My hair is really thick and pretty dry, but after using this it&#x27;s a lot softer and prettier.  </li>
<li> After lots of years coloring/ damage to my hair, I was looking for something to smooth it, work well wet dry and help to repair my poor hair.</li>
<li> have wavy to curly hair which I usually dry and flat iron.  </li>
<li> However, due to a lot of straightening treatments and coloring, my hair was totally damaged</li>
<li> I used to spend an hour straightening my hair to look presentable, but with this I can just let it air dry</li>
<li> As the treatment has grown out, the ends of my hair have become so brittle, dry and split.</li>
<li> Had to throw it out or put up with my husband calling me the old lady with green hair!</li>
<li> use 2-3 pumps (long hair) on the last few inches of my hair, after showering everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
<li> BUT  I&#x27;d advise anyone whose hair is turning white (around the usual front face line) to steer clear, at least if you ever want to pull hair back.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years to take care of my frizzies, and everything seemed to work for about a week, then it left my hair either limp or once again frizzy.  </li>
<li> I have only had this a few days</li>
<li> I bought this to try as a split end treatment, and ended up using it daily to tame my frizzy hair.  </li>
<li> I use the minimum amount and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
<li> so I had to grow it all out and stick to my wavy black hair.</li>
<li> Use the hair dryer an it speeds up the tight feeling.</li>
<li> Was a little apprehensive given that it&#x27;s cream based -worry of weighing my hair</li>
<li> I prefer to buy this in the store, as it is a little bit cheaper, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a store that will continuously carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I did over do it a few times.</li>
<li> I have DARK brown hair and was trying to go platinum and (duh)</li>
<li> My daughter has very tight spiral curls.</li>
<li> Mine, a dark brown greying mix now, very white in that area, turned an ugly olive green, very hard to wash out even with several shampoos.  </li>
<li> I tried this product on both wet and dry hair, but it just left this nasty heaviness to my ends.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately.  </li>
<li> have medium to thick hair.  </li>

    <li> i found a huge difference and improvement on my hair after the first time i use this, and the result became not as strong as the first time, maybe my hair had been fixed?  :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Seriously, it&#x27;s magic in a bottle.  My hair is really thick and pretty dry, but after using this it&#x27;s a lot softer and prettier.  It also helped bring back my waves that bleaching has taken away.  I used to spend an hour straightening my hair to look presentable, but with this I can just let it air dry and it looks good!</li>
    <li> I loved it the first time I tried it because it made my hair straight and silky, but then when I washed my hair the next few occassions I noticed that my hair was really tangled and dry at the ends, so I used more conditioner. But then by the third use I noticed that my hair was actually getting frizzier because it was damaging it...I suppose it&#x27;s cause of the alcohol content in it. Overall, use it for a special occcasion, but don&#x27;t depend on it for daily use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product quite often and it&#x27;s the only \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; product that has worked for me.  The retail price is reasonable and I&#x27;m not the type to spend $15+ on beauty products.  I have dyed my hair a lot and use heated tools to style my hair, this product really helps with my split ends and ultimate softness.  Not the best, but not the worst.  It&#x27;s a temporary fix that has no lasting results.</li>
    <li> Liked this product a lot,leaves hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my naturally wavy/curly hair every since I chemically straightened it 2 years ago. As the treatment has grown out, the ends of my hair have become so brittle, dry and split. I&#x27;ve even found several strands that look like wheat stocks on the end. Yuck!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hair conditioners, lotions, home remedies, expensive leave-in, etc. And they all left much to be desired. In fact, much to my dismay, I&#x27;ve had to chop of inches of hair at a time to get rid of the nasty locks.  Then, one day, I was at the drugstore and saw this split end treatment. I though, \\&quot;hey, why not??\\&quot; I&#x27;m sooooo glad I found this product. My hair feels softer than it has in years. And, although I still find some split ends, overall my hair no longer looks nor feels damaged. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this BEFORE I cut off so much of my hair.</li>
    <li> After lots of years coloring/ damage to my hair, I was looking for something to smooth it, work well wet dry and help to repair my poor hair. Ths product is fantastic. It smells great, is not greasy at all, and is very affordable compaired to similar salon products. I would highly recommend this to anyone :) the cold dry air of the mountains plus the elements are really harsh, my hair looks and feels so much better after using this! Hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> I had another competitive product that I had finished using, so I figured I would try this one, based on the reviews.  I am very happy with the results, this product really works, it smells great, &amp; leaves my hair straight &amp; soft without the \\&quot;clumping or stiffining\\&quot; that I would get from other products.  Now that I have this, I will not go back to the others!</li>
    <li> Just what i needed. Keeps my splits from showing.</li>
    <li> I have DARK brown hair and was trying to go platinum and (duh) fried my hair.  This really worked to smooth the damage and save my hair.  My stylist balked at the fact I was using Pantene but I love this stuff.  Great heat protector as well.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on both wet and dry hair, but it just left this nasty heaviness to my ends.  I guess it helped my split ends a little, but the heaviness of the product wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I have only had this a few days but I can say it does make my hair look better. I use the minimum amount and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. It all so leaves my hair soft feeling and slightly  shiny looking.</li>
    <li> This is won&#x27;t ding I love the way my ends are nice and laded down. And it&#x27;s no fly aways</li>
    <li> I bought this to try as a split end treatment, and ended up using it daily to tame my frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years to take care of my frizzies, and everything seemed to work for about a week, then it left my hair either limp or once again frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair daily for over a year now, and it works perfectly every time!  I smooth it on my curls once my hair is dry, and it takes the frizzies out and separates the curls without flattening them.  Then I just finger comb once later in the day, and I&#x27;m set.  It&#x27;s not sticky like some styling products can be, and it&#x27;s not at all greasy.  It&#x27;s also very lightweight.  I just 2 pumps each day to smooth my hair, but I have very thick hair.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately.  I hope Pantene hasn&#x27;t discontinued it!</li>
    <li> Very nice for shine and smooth ends BUT  I&#x27;d advise anyone whose hair is turning white (around the usual front face line) to steer clear, at least if you ever want to pull hair back.  Mine, a dark brown greying mix now, very white in that area, turned an ugly olive green, very hard to wash out even with several shampoos.  Maybe it&#x27;s the avocado oil or the grape seed oil? Had to throw it out or put up with my husband calling me the old lady with green hair!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair feel great and smells wonderful. Does what it says it should do. Will buy again. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been trying to tame my wavy hair for years, thinking it&#x27;ll look better straight. However, due to a lot of straightening treatments and coloring, my hair was totally damaged so I had to grow it all out and stick to my wavy black hair. But, it&#x27;s really unruly and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product while looking around in drugstore stalls and just decided to try it out. It really works for me, it makes the ends rally smooth and healthier so I can grow my hair longer. PLUS i get to have really nice waves without the frizz... Lots of friends noticed it the first day I used it (no kidding &#x3D;) ) BONUS Really nice smell too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.. and I suggest to buy it directly from Pantene distributor here. They sell it in packs of two for the price of a little more than one item. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Overall, I was disappointed with this product. I didn&#x27;t notice any additional changes except it weighing down my hair (I have medium, not thick hair, so this may have something to do with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t help with blowdrying, it doesn&#x27;t really help protect your hair, it just coats it without helping mend my split ends. Disappointed. If you&#x27;re looking to mend your hair, look to Nexxus&#x27;s new ProMend line.</li>
    <li> I prefer to buy this in the store, as it is a little bit cheaper, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a store that will continuously carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy to curly hair which I usually dry and flat iron.  My daughter has very tight spiral curls. This product works great for both of us.  It leaves my hair light and silky and smooth.  It keeps the frizz out of my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and leaves the curls soft to the touch, rather than having to add gel which makes her curls &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;  I love it.</li>
    <li> Pantene is the only thing I use,so I thought I would buy this. Its nice, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! My hair is in great shape</li>
    <li> Less is more with this, one pump or less for full face, neck and hands. Feels a bit greasy at first. Use the hair dryer an it speeds up the tight feeling.</li>
    <li> I think for what its worth this product works pretty good. I do how ever want to warn you about something. Do not over apply this product! It will make your hair look horrible! I have very thick hair so normally the directed amount  is never enough and I did over do it a few times. I just want to let people know this products works great if you use it properly.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this product smooth my curls and it is good for split ends.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do s*** for my split ends, but I still love this product! I like how it makes my hair soft and also helps detangle the ends. I like!</li>
    <li> I use this product after every shower, as it helps detangle my hair and prevents frizz. I&#x27;ve been using this particular product for a couple years now and for the price I think it&#x27;s super. My hair looks better when I use this product - I generally air-dry, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it protects hair from heat.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed at first: 2 pumps after showering for the first application starting at the tips and working it half-way up the hair shaft. Now I basically use it as needed/remembered, meaning basically when I look in the mirror and see a bunch of split ends, and then I use 1 pump of the stuff after I shower. My split ends are bad enough that I put the product all the way up to my roots but I try to use most of it on my tips. I find that it looks great when I use it and see a huge difference, and if I used it regularly I would probably see permanent repair but I end up using it about once per week depending on how much I notice the split ends. It smells fantastic and leaves my hair feeling silky :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products, but this is the only one that has ever allowed my hair to grow long!  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time about a year ago.  Was a little apprehensive given that it&#x27;s cream based -worry of weighing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to thick hair.  I am happy to report that it did not weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;I use 2-3 pumps (long hair) on the last few inches of my hair, after showering everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it make my hair healthy &amp; shiny, it also works as an amazing de-tangler for both my 5 year old daughter and myself.  Hair is much easier to comb through with product in.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
    <li> i didnt notice any difference</li>
