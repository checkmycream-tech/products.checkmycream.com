<li> the reviews, maybe I&#x27;m obviously in the minority here, so perhaps it works wonders for some, and not so much with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This worked pretty well, dried up my acne fast.</li>
<li> Two weeks later, it&#x27;s still dry in those areas.  </li>
<li> only difference when you have pimples at a later age is that they are bigger, tougher and last longer and usually leave a scar&lt;br</li>
<li> Dry&#x27;s up the pimple.</li>
<li> It will dry out your skin, so if you have dry skin already, be careful.</li>
<li> So when I use this literally the next day the Zit has gone down by a lot</li>
<li> Weird smell, dries up quick, and didn&#x27;t do squat for my acne.</li>
<li> It showed up white after it dried -- not what I want my husband to see at night in the bed.  </li>
<li> otherwise it makes the pimple flat and hard to get all of the way out later.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I can put this directly on a pimple, whether popped or not and it shrinks it over night without irritating my skin.  </li>
<li> I used it and its hard to wash off after you putti on for too long.</li>
<li> Dried out my skin but not the pimple.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed after wearing this a few days on and off, that eventually, the pimple would have pus or pustules come out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t break out often, but when I do it&#x27;s pretty bad because of my period.</li>
<li> I am a middle aged woman who sometimes suffers from a pimple breakout from time to time</li>
<li> ( i usually put it on before bed)</li>
<li> so i usually will break it&lt;</li>
<li> The paste is thick and dries really hard</li>
<li> Only bad thing is that it&#x27;s a little tedious to wash off.</li>
<li> It also smells horrible.  </li>

    <li> I am a middle aged woman who sometimes suffers from a pimple breakout from time to time&lt;br /&gt;the only difference when you have pimples at a later age is that they are bigger, tougher and last longer and usually leave a scar&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to let a pimple run its course I want it gone and I want it gone now so i usually will break it&lt;br /&gt;this product is great for after you have a broken (popped) pimple&lt;br /&gt;just apply it ( i usually put it on before bed) it dries and stays on!&lt;br /&gt;it helps the pimple go away much faster I&#x27;d say about 3x as fast as using nothing</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on my skin. I used it and its hard to wash off after you putti on for too long.</li>
    <li> I love it makes me feel like this little bottle is working when the paste hardens. Only bad thing is that it&#x27;s a little tedious to wash off.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Just needs to be bigger and way cheaper. Also it peels off if you sleep with it. But it works. Dry&#x27;s up the pimple.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most incredible tube for pimples. I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t break out often, but when I do it&#x27;s pretty bad because of my period. So when I use this literally the next day the Zit has gone down by a lot and it dries it up. I absoultely cannot live with out this thing. I got very upset when they didn&#x27;t have these at the stores anymore. I was so discouraged because this tube is the only thing that works for my skin. I was so happy they have it on amazon! So please don&#x27;t ever take it off from here ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the Clean &amp; Clear product that I know works, Clean &amp; Clear Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, 0.75-Ounce Tube.  -That stuff is amazing, and actually DOES work to quickly shrink and clear up acne. Highly suggest it!  As for the &amp;#34;popped pimple&amp;#34; paste, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  It dries WHITE, so there&#x27;s no hiding the fact that you&#x27;re wearing pimple cream.  I put it on a the noticeable pimples I had before going to bed, but in the morning, absolutely nothing had changed.  I tried again, and wore the paste during the day, but still, no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the reviews, maybe I&#x27;m obviously in the minority here, so perhaps it works wonders for some, and not so much with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it&#x27;s 7/15, and the one I received expires in 11/15, so only 4 months from the expiration date.</li>
    <li> This has been helping.  When I used this, product, I think it was eventually making this cystic pimple come forward.  The pimple was extremely deep and sore and I used this on and off since the duration of the acne (almost a year!!).  I&#x27;ve noticed after wearing this a few days on and off, that eventually, the pimple would have pus or pustules come out.  I used this, rubbing alcohol, some hydrocortisone and all, anything I can get my hands on and this has helped it.  I think it is drawing it out a bit as well as a drying effect on it.  I will try it one more time and see if he finishes the job.  I had a while back removed some of the ....in it, but still it&#x27;s deep and took time for it to come up and out.  Have tweezers, massage area and then I saw the white, took and a ot pulled out, like plugs it is...I think again, more will happen soon, great product, just make sure you are trying to get rid of the problem watch about smashing the area as well.</li>
    <li> It worked It I Love It So Much</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin but not the pimple.  Also, it wasn&#x27;t very discreet.  It showed up white after it dried -- not what I want my husband to see at night in the bed.  They advertise that as a positive thing -- that it turns colors to show it&#x27;s working.  It also smells horrible.  I stopped using it after 3 days.  My normally nice skin was so dry and looked crepey and wrinkled.  Two weeks later, it&#x27;s still dry in those areas.  I&#x27;ll stick to my CVS acne treatment gel (benzoyl peroxide 10%) which works great at $4.79.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I am a pimple picker and when I just can&#x27;t help myself this product saves me! You do have to get all of the gunk out of the pimple before you use this though otherwise it makes the pimple flat and hard to get all of the way out later. This is also the best product I have found for unpopped pimples. The paste is thick and dries really hard so it stays on overnight. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Helps get rid of zits faster. It also brings forming zits to the surface right away, which is nice. It will dry out your skin, so if you have dry skin already, be careful. My skin is pretty moist so I don&#x27;t have a problem. I like it!</li>
    <li> This product its great, it does exactly what it says,popped pimples disappear whitin days</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I will definitely be buying more when I&#x27;ve used it up. It dries pimples overnight and they disappear within two days. The only downside is a bright white spot appears after you put it on so you can&#x27;t go out in public but at least it washes off in the morning! :)</li>
    <li> I always use the Clean &amp; Clear Persa Gel, which is amazing, so I wanted to give this a shot since I ocassionally get pimples that don&#x27;t go away as fast as I hope. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the healing time for pimples.</li>
    <li> Came right on time and works amazingly. Thought I was going to have complication with delivery and the the product itself but it turned out to be the complete opposite great job !!!</li>
    <li> Weird smell, dries up quick, and didn&#x27;t do squat for my acne.</li>
    <li> This worked pretty well, dried up my acne fast. A little goes a long way. I have had good experience with all clean and clear products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have much issues with zits until recently and have sensitive skin.  I can put this directly on a pimple, whether popped or not and it shrinks it over night without irritating my skin.  I recommend this to anyone having breakouts</li>
