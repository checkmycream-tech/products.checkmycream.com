      <li>Kind of tropical.</li>
      <li>It even effectively removes stubborn waterproof make up.</li>
      <li>and I was really impressed with how clean and fresh it made my skin</li>
      <li>Best cleanser ever for sensitive, acne-prone oily skin.</li>
      <li>The product leaves my skin so soft and is excellent at removing makeup.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought this product was great...</li>
      <li>It might not the be-all-end-all of face washes for all of humankind, but I find it pretty wonderful and definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>I bought this cleanser because I love the face cleaning wipes.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>even the lovely packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is sulfate free, which is awesome, and is made up of natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this face wash.</li>
      <li>I Love it, and look forward to using it every evening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and i am so glad that Amazon has it now.</li>
      <li>Because of the price I wanted to use up the tube, but I was sort of glad when it was gone.</li>
      <li>I love majority of Pacifica products, but this one I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
      <li>There was nothing I enjoyed about using this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Though I still love the Origins product, I will certainly alternate with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Pacifica, for yet another great product!</li>
      <li>It seems to work a lot better for people with combination/oily skin.</li>
      <li>A pea-size is all it does for me to get clean, and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>You get a large amount of product for the price and it smells amazing too!</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the pros: it is great at removing makeup, it smells good, and it lathers up better than any other face wash I have tried.</li>
      <li>Light refreshing scent, soft bubbles, and a bright face.</li>
      <li>Nice and gently!</li>
      <li>The product itself is doing a great job keeping my skin clear, I feel so refreshed and clean after using it, but I find myself looking forward to washing my face in the morning just for the scent alone.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful scent, is gentle and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this face wash: it smells like mild pina collada.</li>
      <li>I have used it as my evening cleanser (because it was so good at removing makeup) for about two weeks so far.  </li>
      <li>its perfect for my face and just a small drop will do the job -</li>
      <li>If I have waterproof makeup or a lot of makeup on, I might use something more first.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very nice and mild on my skin so a big thumbs up.</li>
      <li>drying out the skin only makes the skin produce more oil, hence leading to more breakouts.</li>
      <li>Takes off makeup  quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleanser, especially if you look for natural (no parabens etc) and cruelty free products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a month and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful for improving my complexion, in combination with using an essential oil serum I use for moisturizing day and night, and occasionally using Pacifica&#x27;s Dreamy Youth cream (on top of eating well and drinking water, which always affects complexion in my opinion).</li>
      <li>But the wipes are fantastic, they certainly detox my face.  </li>
      <li>(Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I would use a separate toner.  </li>
      <li>leaves my skin soft and hydrated :)</li>
      <li>This wash smells amazing and does seem to get my face clean, but it leaves my skin very dry and irritated.</li>
      <li>short, use and results can largely vary between people depending on one&#x27;s own body chemistry and beauty habits.</li>
      <li>Overall Pacifica is a good natural brand, cruelty-free and vegan.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and never caused my skin to break.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle, and I love the fact that the ingredient list is short and with organic products.</li>
      <li>(thanks city pollution!)</li>
      <li>The packaging is SO pretty too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>Sometimes I find that natural products like that are less effective, but I actually think this did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is vegan and gluten free and free of sulfates, parabens, and other ingredients that a lot of people are avoiding these days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with using coconut oil which removes make up better, heals blemishes, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
      <li>Probably because this is largely coconut-oil based and I prefer my toners to be</li>
      <li>this bottle last a long time, it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin--doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
      <li>Nice smell, a little drying, but</li>
      <li>I think it could be a little drying, but my skin is kind of combination oily.</li>
      <li>I find this to be a gentle cleanser</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone, really.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite gentle.</li>
      <li>I was so upset because I really wanted to change cleansers.</li>
      <li>face wash is clear and froths up, leaving your skin feeling hydrated and fresh.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I also didn&#x27;t feel like it was any better than using regular old body wash on my face.</li>
      <li>I love the natural ingredients in this face wash and would definitely</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, lathers nicely with just a small amount, and cleans off makeup and dirt very well.</li>
      <li>have combination skin that can get dry and flaky very quickly if I don&#x27;t moisturize enough, so I take special care to select moisturizing cleansers.</li>
      <li>That being said, it does foam-up a lot and removes all traces of make-up if that&#x27;s mainly what you want in a face wash.</li>
      <li>They also have fantastic natural perfumes, and lots of different scents to choose from.</li>
      <li>2 more days passed and my entire face is peeling and red!</li>
      <li>I think the price is fair considering a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I thought I would love this because I like the coconut wipes (they smell so good), but this left my skin dry and tight and not soft at all.</li>
      <li>So far I really like this.</li>
      <li>Then I used it a few more times and found my skin to be burning and itchy.</li>
      <li>Many people don&#x27;t realize but a single bottle of perfume can contain over a hundred different chemicals and toxins that the manufacturers are not required to list on the labels.</li>
      <li>Who knows, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and this might be the right wash for you.</li>
      <li>Pacifica uses essential oils to make their perfumes so they are more natural as far as fragrances go, and they&#x27;re actually affordable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The scent is INCREDIBLE! The product itself is doing a great job keeping my skin clear, I feel so refreshed and clean after using it, but I find myself looking forward to washing my face in the morning just for the scent alone.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Target. I have combination skin. Sometimes when I use this face wash, it dries my face. I continued to use this for two months until I developed dry, scaly skin. I never had this type of irritation before. Even though it is sulfate-free, I believe the foam dried out my skin too much, and over time, I got scaly skin. At this point, I threw it away and switched to Cerave.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser ever for sensitive, acne-prone oily skin. Does not irritate or dry out skin like other foaming cleansers do. It is very gentle, and I love the fact that the ingredient list is short and with organic products. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a gentle cleanser but still effective at removing oils.  I thought it was especially good at getting rid of liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite the name and product description, it did not foam for me at all.  That&#x27;s not a deal-breaker if it cleanses my face.  But I figured I should mention it.  (Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I would use a separate toner.  I&#x27;m not convinced this tones, despite what the tube says.  Probably because this is largely coconut-oil based and I prefer my toners to be water- or alcohol-based.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is vegan and gluten free and free of sulfates, parabens, and other ingredients that a lot of people are avoiding these days.  Sometimes I find that natural products like that are less effective, but I actually think this did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the product page.  I really like that Pacifica identifies the sources of the ingredients because there are a lot of products in industry that can come from multiple processes/organisms.  I appreciate having it all laid out in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not dry out my skin at all.  In fact, I found it fairly moisturizing.  (I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.)  I have used it as my evening cleanser (because it was so good at removing makeup) for about two weeks so far.  Usually if I am going to have a negative skin reaction, it would have happened before now.  I&#x27;m happy I tried this!</li>
    <li> This face wash is a good match for me; I have combination skin, but I think this will still be good during the winter. The smallest amount works into a rich later, the scent is lovely, and it cleanses my face really well even if I don&#x27;t remove all makeup prior to washing, which I usually do. I think the price is fair considering a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This face wash is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; in my opinion. The scent is pleasant and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, burning, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face. That being said, I also didn&#x27;t feel like it was any better than using regular old body wash on my face. Because of the price I wanted to use up the tube, but I was sort of glad when it was gone. I love majority of Pacifica products, but this one I won&#x27;t be buying again. Who knows, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and this might be the right wash for you. My skin is usually dry and sensitive, but I used this in summer when I am far less prone to dryness and irritation.</li>
    <li> An amazing face wash!</li>
    <li> Smells Soooo gooood!  However, I read the reviews and alot of people said it did a number on their faces.  I opted to try for myself.  Turns out within seconds after drying my wet face after washing my skin instantly dried and nearly shriveled.  It was tight and I could see the dryness.  I can&#x27;t explain in words how dry it got.  Only after one use.  I can&#x27;t see myself using it again.  I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin or dry skin by any means.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this product was great... Then I used it a few more times and found my skin to be burning and itchy. I stopped using it. 2 more days passed and my entire face is peeling and red! I was so upset because I really wanted to change cleansers. Needless to say I returned this item... Something in this does not agree with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> this bottle last a long time, it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin--doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
    <li> This wash smells amazing and does seem to get my face clean, but it leaves my skin very dry and irritated. It&#x27;s just too stringent for every day use. I now use it as a body wash because I do like the smell, but my poor, sensitive face just can&#x27;t take it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon I saw it was on sale at target but wanted to leave a review!! My skin feels so amazing after one wash! I usually make or buy natural products for my skin (usually burtsbees) my skins sensitive and get stubborn blackheads/breakouts from this Vegas heat and I was really impressed with how clean and fresh it made my skin I&#x27;ll be trying out other Pacifica products!</li>
    <li> Nice Smell and great cleanser</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd bottle of this stuff, you can normally only find it at Target and i am so glad that Amazon has it now. its perfect for my face and just a small drop will do the job - this size tube will easily last 4-6 months, if not longer. my face comes away cean, refreshed and soft without being dry and tough.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and severe gluten and chemical allergies, so I bought this with my sensitivities in mind. On the SkinDeep scale, Pacifica is very low and they seem to use mostly natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a month and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful for improving my complexion, in combination with using an essential oil serum I use for moisturizing day and night, and occasionally using Pacifica&#x27;s Dreamy Youth cream (on top of eating well and drinking water, which always affects complexion in my opinion). I&#x27;ve tried many different sensitive skin face washes, and none take such a little amount and take off as much makeup and day-grime (thanks city pollution!) as this does. Then again, I also try use only natural, toxin-free makeup. A pea-size is all it does for me to get clean, and it smells amazing. The packaging is SO pretty too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, use and results can largely vary between people depending on one&#x27;s own body chemistry and beauty habits. It might not the be-all-end-all of face washes for all of humankind, but I find it pretty wonderful and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Origins &#x27;Checks And Balances&#x27; face wash for years.  However, after recently discovering the Coconut Pacifica Facial Wipes, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.  I give this product a five-star rating in all counts:  the scent, the texture, the efficacy, how it makes my face feel, and even the lovely packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash is clear and froths up, leaving your skin feeling hydrated and fresh.  Though I still love the Origins product, I will certainly alternate with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Pacifica, for yet another great product!</li>
    <li> Love the texture of the soap, its thick and it smells amazing, leaves my skin soft and hydrated :) I just use a little bit and it cleans my face and neck!</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash among with wet towelettes and the BB cream. I love the smell of this face wash: it smells like mild pina collada. It&#x27;s very gentle and never caused my skin to break. It foams up pretty well too and a little goes a very long way. I love the natural ingredients in this face wash and would definitely but it again. Target carries Pacifica products and if you come across this definitely is worth every penny (of course you can order it online too and pay a shipping half the price of the product)</li>
    <li> I saw this product in All You magazine and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It was very difficult to find in stores, so I tried Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did.  It has a wonderful scent, is gentle and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.  The nicest surprise is that it takes very little of the product to work, less than the size of a pea lathers and cleans my whole face.  I&#x27;m buying it again, and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Light refreshing scent, soft bubbles, and a bright face.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and my daughter. I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This dried out my skin like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin that can get dry and flaky very quickly if I don&#x27;t moisturize enough, so I take special care to select moisturizing cleansers. I thought I would love this because I like the coconut wipes (they smell so good), but this left my skin dry and tight and not soft at all. Plus it smells weird, like alcohol and watered down coconut. There was nothing I enjoyed about using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back to my summer Bioderma acne cleanser and winter Emma Hardie balm!</li>
    <li> I really like this, it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful. I mix in a bit of baking soda if I want to exfoliate. I would buy this again just for the smell alone but it&#x27;s very nice and mild on my skin so a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that this face wash strips the skin and irritates dry and sensitive skin types. It seems to work a lot better for people with combination/oily skin. That being said, it does foam-up a lot and removes all traces of make-up if that&#x27;s mainly what you want in a face wash. Overall Pacifica is a good natural brand, cruelty-free and vegan. They also have fantastic natural perfumes, and lots of different scents to choose from. Many people don&#x27;t realize but a single bottle of perfume can contain over a hundred different chemicals and toxins that the manufacturers are not required to list on the labels. Pacifica uses essential oils to make their perfumes so they are more natural as far as fragrances go, and they&#x27;re actually affordable.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser, especially if you look for natural (no parabens etc) and cruelty free products. It is very moisturizing, lathers nicely with just a small amount, and cleans off makeup and dirt very well. Sometimes I skip other makeup remover and just use this. If I have waterproof makeup or a lot of makeup on, I might use something more first. Simple everyday makeup definitely comes off with this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any reaction or harshness. You get a large amount of product for the price and it smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I want to  like this, it came as a trusted recommendation. Here&#x27;s the pros: it is great at removing makeup, it smells good, and it lathers up better than any other face wash I have tried. The cons? It seemed harsh on my skin, I had to use a lot of moisturizer, and even then my face still dried out a bit. I heard this face wash was good for acne prone skins, but drying out the skin only makes the skin produce more oil, hence leading to more breakouts. Or at least in my case that is what happened. I&#x27;ll stick with using coconut oil which removes make up better, heals blemishes, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> Thought this product was a bit expensive considering it felt like I was washing my face with hand soap.  Smelled good and was foamy. Didn&#x27;t do much for me but it wasnt terrible.  Id rather use freeman face washes and masks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and the smell is wonderful. Takes off makeup  quickly. I Love it, and look forward to using it every evening.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells amazing and makes my face feel wonderful! It even effectively removes stubborn waterproof make up.</li>
    <li> Love it. My faces feels so much cleaner and clearer every night and before i go to sleep a little bit definetly goes along way.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser because I love the face cleaning wipes.  Nice smell, a little drying, but overall I like it.  I travel often, so the flip top tube is perfect.  But the wipes are fantastic, they certainly detox my face.  I might buy this again for oily breakouts.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this product!!</li>
    <li> Smells so nice! Kind of tropical. It has done a nice job drying out blemishes. I think it could be a little drying, but my skin is kind of combination oily. So far I really like this. Nice and gently!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me, but the ingredients are great! If your skin agrees with it definitely five it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is sulfate free, which is awesome, and is made up of natural ingredients. The face was has a great coconut scent. The product leaves my skin so soft and is excellent at removing makeup. I would recommend this to anyone, really. It&#x27;s quite gentle.</li>
