    <li> Looks really beautiful</li>
    <li> This was a little too big for my daughter and there were strings sticking out from the flowers. It&#x27;s ok but I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable putting it on my daughters head. So, I decided to use it for myself. Not for a baby but if you are a hippie like me, you can use it.</li>
    <li> Ehhh very cheaply made, you get what you paid for</li>
    <li> Like it fits just wright</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my 5 year old and matches everything! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for girls over the age of 9 as it is a very tight fit.</li>

    <li> This headband is so cute and my daughter loves it! It came almost 2 weeks early so that was awesome!</li>
    <li> Service was good but the quality of the product was mediocre. There were lots of unfinished threads that needed to be snipped. All in all, ok...</li>
    <li> So cute!  Fit my 15 month old perfectly!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and worth the longer wait to get it.  It says it is for an infant but is 16+, my 4 month old&#x27;s head is 15+. So she has this to grow into.</li>
    <li> Super cute and fit perfect!</li>
    <li> This item is intended for adults, not children. It&#x27;s a huge headband.</li>
    <li> They looked a lot cuter then I thought they would be. My two girls wear them and everyone had nothing but good things to say about it. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Very cute!! Too big for my 3 month old but will keep for when she gets bigger.</li>
