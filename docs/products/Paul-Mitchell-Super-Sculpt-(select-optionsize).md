<li> It&#x27;s not thick and will not hold thick, Asian hair types.</li>

<li> If the hair is finished with hairspray or any other finishing product, it can last even longer.</li>

<li> Without adding any other additional styling products, my hair maintains it volume and style for about 6 hours ( the style endured trips about town, chores around the house, cooking and baking, etc).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but it&#x27;s increasingly hard to find at local salons for some reason.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s watered down or something.</li>
<li> forgot about it and tried every other product on the market to tame my mane with out stripping my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> At first, I was skeptical because I hardly ever use styling products, but I have been using this now for 4 years.</li>
<li> Does not weigh my hair down does not leave hair stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> mom used this on my hair when I was a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Cheaper on Amazon then in ANY other store!!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make it too stiff and crunchy.</li>
<li> gives your hair body and bounce and doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff</li>
<li> As usual , Paul Mutchell products don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
<li> This product can be difficult to find.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t think that you got a bad product or that it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t hold up like a gel.)</li>
<li> and if I do it is in a salon and is  expensive!</li>
<li> Note: if you receive a bottle which contains watery horrible smelling glop - it&#x27;s NOT authentic.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> gives your hair body and bounce and doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff</li>
    <li> The best hair gel by far. It&#x27;s not sticky, it holds (even my fine hair) and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> always love Paul Mitchell...always will. Superior products  !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but it&#x27;s increasingly hard to find at local salons for some reason.  Nice to be able to find it here at Amazon.  This is more of a styling lotion than thick gel; it leaves hair soft and flexible and never feeling overly dry, stiff or sticky like some gels and mousses.  I use a dime-sized amount applied at the roots and use a styling brush to make my hair appear thicker (I have a shortish inverted bob).  The 8.5 oz. bottle lasts for months (at least more than 6 months) used in this way.  It&#x27;s the only styling product I use and I highly recommend it for thinner hair.</li>
    <li> perfect for curly hair</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for years.  He loves it and uses it daily.  He has very curly hair and is pedantic when it comes to every curl being in place.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this at my hair salon from my stylist (with whom I am a close friend) for a special occasion. At first, I was skeptical because I hardly ever use styling products, but I have been using this now for 4 years. It&#x27;s great for a piece-y layered look and it&#x27;s also great for volume. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. And, unlike some counterfeit product I have bought elsewhere on Amazon, this appears to be the authentic Paul Mitchell item. Note: if you receive a bottle which contains watery horrible smelling glop - it&#x27;s NOT authentic. Stick with reputable sellers.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market for men. Cheaper on Amazon then in ANY other store!!</li>
    <li> I have curly dark hair and This is by far the best gel I&#x27;ve tried on my hair and i have tried almost every brand out there from salon gels to drug store and this is the best gel.. Leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Love the product.  This particular model works best with my hair type.  Love it, love it, love it!!! Thx thx</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I rotate between mousse and this glaze on  my curly/ wavy hair. It has amazing hold and makes your hair super shiny!</li>
    <li> Love for my curly hair, no other hair products makes my curls so pretty as the Paul Mitchell sculpting gel does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; look, but want my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; to move with the breeze. This is my preferred product to achieve that end.</li>
    <li> As an Asian woman with straight, limp, thin hair, I am always looking for ways and products to increase the volume of my hair while keeping it soft, flexible, manageable, and healthy looking. I walked into a beauty supply shop, asked someone for a product recommendation, and they recommended the Super Sculpt Gel. (Note: the consistency of this product is not like a traditional gel. It is slightly more fluid so it will pool in the palm of your hand instead of mounding up. Don&#x27;t think that you got a bad product or that it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t hold up like a gel.) I used about quarter sized shape of the liquid (along with Matrix Biolage Hydra Seal Leave In Creme) on damp clean hair, combed it through, and then set my hair into rollers. I either go about my house chores with the rollers in my hair or, if I am in a hurry, I blow dry the hair with a diffuser attachment. The end results produce soft voluminous hair that feels great when I run my fingers through it while keeping the volume consistent and manageable. Without adding any other additional styling products, my hair maintains it volume and style for about 6 hours ( the style endured trips about town, chores around the house, cooking and baking, etc). If the hair is finished with hairspray or any other finishing product, it can last even longer. (Once, I did my hair as stated above in the morning around 9am . I got ready for a party around 4pm. All I did was freshen my hair with a bit of hairspray and a quick blow out with the dryer, my hair was nice, flowing, yet with a lot of body till I got home from the party around 11pm.) Super Sculpt Gel is a great product if you are looking to a setting solution to use with your rollers.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Perfect lightweight product  Does not weigh my hair down does not leave hair stiff or sticky. and does not leave a residue.  Perfect product for my fine, curly hair...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and Amazon is the only place I can find it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Paul Mitchell and its a pretty good light weight get and it has a pretty nice smell of Apple , its good for a every day gel one the go ..</li>
    <li> Works well.  Price could be better.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this gel for years.  We both really like how it conditions, shines and keeps the style in place, even with blow-drying.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for curly hair, fix the curls but it&#x27;s not greasy nor stiff, easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. If you have curly hair like me, this glaze gives you the right control and the perfect wet look.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product I have been using for years! It&#x27;s watered down or something. It doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to in my hair and barely has a scent. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This gel is too watery. It&#x27;s not thick and will not hold thick, Asian hair types.</li>
    <li> Great brand, good price. Enough said.</li>
    <li> This is glaze, not gel.  It&#x27;s not the same thing.  It won&#x27;t hold your hair the way gel would.  They are misrepresenting their product.</li>
    <li> This product can be difficult to find. I am happy to purchase it on Amazon. It is great for my curly hair but my husband also uses it as well.</li>
    <li> Always loved Paul Mitchell products.  I highly recommend Paul Mitchell products they always work great.  Would by again and again..</li>
    <li> My old standby.  I suspect that it is not made anymore.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair- like Mega-Mega Curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have 2 pet peeves: STICKY looking curly hair. And frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I needed a product that could give my control, shine, bounce and flexibility. The answer- Styling Glaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom used this on my hair when I was a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot about it and tried every other product on the market to tame my mane with out stripping my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I remembered how good this smelled and felt in my hair when I was a youngin&#x27; and POW- they still sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have purchase many gels and because by hair is fine, this work great. It doesn&#x27;t make it too stiff and crunchy.</li>
    <li> As usual , Paul Mutchell products don&#x27;t disappoint. I have curly hair and this sculpting lotion gives it a sheen and style like no other. I shampoo every other day and the styling lotion allows me the freedom to get up on alternate days and have worry free hair. In fact, on those days I have a softer looking curl. Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon pricing makes it more affordable then buying in a salon &amp; even better pricing than most beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> could not dry my hair without it!!!  Lots of BODY!</li>
    <li> I like Paul Mitchell products but, being from a small rural community, cannot always find it locally and if I do it is in a salon and is  expensive! Amazon prices are much cheaper, it came packaged perfectly, and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Great Product and quality. Delivered on time and in perfect condition!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, gives just the right stiffness to my hair.......I use a curling iron on it after it dries, and&lt;br /&gt;the product holds my curl.  Combs out nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s best product to little curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great gel doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.Paul Mitchell products rock!</li>
    <li> I am devoted to this product and have used it for some time.  It&#x27;s great for my very curly hair...gives it sheen and definition.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products, but always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a detangler. Warm water and scupting gel, helps loosen the tangles.</li>
