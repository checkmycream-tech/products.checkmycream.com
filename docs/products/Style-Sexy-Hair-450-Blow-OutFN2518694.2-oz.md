    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used. I actually use it more as a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; product. A squirt or two and my naturally curly locks are easily detangled leaving the hair so soft!</li>
    <li> great product....will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Keeps me hair shiny</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Love the way it makes my hair feel and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> used this product before, love it! got here fast and in tact!! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy dry hair and I use this with wet hair, dry hair, before and after styling and it never makes my hair feel greasy or heavy with product. It was first used on me by my hair stylist and I loved it so much I went out and bought it for myself! I have tried other products from this line and love them.</li>

    <li> This is a great product, keeps your hair smooth, shiny and frizz free! I Love this product very very much!</li>
    <li> Got this in a makeup subscription bag. It&#x27;s AMAZING! Buying the full version for sure!</li>
    <li> Review from Burkey&#x27;s Wife: A friend of mine that is in the beauty business gave me a sample of this. I don&#x27;t know why but I expected this spray to be greasy. It is not. I have an oily scalp with fine color treated blond hair and it gives it a nice shine and body. I will definitely purchase the full size. I am very pleased with this product when I blow dry my hair and it does not make it look flat and limp.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the product I thought I ordered. I thought it was. 450 blowout 7/1. And it was 450 5/4 or something. It doesn&#x27;t do what I thought. I guess it is my fault. I don&#x27;t see real well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fairly new, but it works amazing. You put it in your hair when wet, and blow dry. I personally feel like it takes me half the time to blow dry my hair and half the time to straighten it afterwards because its not as frizzy. I squirt a lot in and it does NOT make my hair feel greasy or oily at all. I feel like its actually protecting my hair because my hair doesnt get to hot to touch when blow drying or flat ironing. I have fine hair but a lot of it, and this really works for me. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray oil for curling your hair ! Spray on , curl hair and your curls do not look fuzzy .</li>
    <li> I got a a sample of this in my ipsy this month... Holy cow my hair looks like I just got a salon blow out! When the sample runs out I will DEFINITELY be getting more!</li>
    <li> Love the product but delivery was awful.</li>
    <li> I first tried this through a sample in my Ipsy subscription box. I love how my hair is softer, smoother, and more manageable when I used then on it.  Once applied, I then blow dry and then straighten my hair. There is a big difference on the days I use that and the days I don&#x27;t.  If some gets on your bathroom floor while spraying, it will make it slippery.</li>
    <li> This bottle of product is nothing like the product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and isn&#x27;t shiny and taming of my hair like previous orders.  Pretty sill move considering I won&#x27;t purchase hair care products from Amazon any longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use in combination with s factor lusterizer and blow my hair out almost every day. I feel like my style holds better when I use this. Smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of this in an Ipsy bag and HAD to buy it.  It is amazing!  It keeps my hair soft after blow drying/straightening, prevents frizzing and just overall makes my hair easier to manage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  It smells wonderful and it makes my hair so shiny.  I would highly recommend this product if you straighten your hair.  My hair is so smooth after using it and stays smooth all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product, great price.</li>
    <li> Speedy. Accurate. Thanks!</li>
