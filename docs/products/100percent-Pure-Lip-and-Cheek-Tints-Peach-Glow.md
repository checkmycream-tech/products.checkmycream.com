### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say excellent for more lip than cheek color.</li>
      <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
      <li>Unless you are extremely fair complected.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this for summer!  </li>
      <li>This tint is a nice color.  </li>
      <li>perfect color natural looking with a pop of color.</li>
      <li>I have this tint in another color and love the product.</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite company for skin care and cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I like many products from this company including another pot blush.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, I use it on lips and cheeks</li>
      <li>Great product and color is very complementary to my strawberry blond complexion.</li>
      <li>I have used many of this company&#x27;s products, from the skin care lines  to the makeup,  and I am always pleased.</li>
      <li>I wish they did have a more peachy colored one though.</li>
      <li>That being said I do love these products</li>
      <li>and i think has a better contrast.</li>
      <li>Beautiful soft peach colour.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it would be very good as lipstick-not enough color,</li>
      <li>First up, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and light, yet colorful enough to pinch up my cheeks!</li>
      <li>100% pure is certainly a much better brand than most cosmetics.</li>
      <li>This goes on smooth and creamy, and blends well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok too light to really notice</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s not a bad color.</li>
      <li>but luckily this worked well for me.</li>
      <li>It is a great color when you have a little bit of a tan already.  </li>
      <li>This probably comes as no surprise to you, dear reader, but I kind of skimmed the product info and had a completely different idea of the size.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice overall glow and &amp;#34;dew&amp;#34; to your cheeks, lips, and eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright, hot pink without the orange component that &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; suggests.</li>
      <li>I rarely buy makeup without testing it first</li>
      <li>more of a light pink....</li>
      <li>It gives a light and natural glow!</li>
      <li>Perfect for travel and a little product goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It blends really well!</li>
      <li>First of all, it is NOT peach.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I really like the product!</li>
      <li>It has few ingredients, which indicates true, effective quality.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I personally feel it gives me a more natural and clean look.</li>
      <li>I bought this purely based on the reviews I read here.</li>
      <li>This color is not peach at all; it is a VERY light pink.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>so I really like it.</li>
      <li>very creamy and also gentle to the skin (as all the products are).</li>
      <li>and that is more pink</li>
      <li>People with very sensitive skin may, but I found the texture pretty dreamy.</li>
      <li>The color was true to the picture, but the package is tiny and I didn&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
      <li>It is a very fair pink and you can hardly see anything on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>just wouldn&#x27;t do this particular color again.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a \\&quot;tint\\&quot; not actual solid color pigment.  </li>
      <li>However, it is a little more of a light color than the expected peach.  </li>
      <li>I have normal skin, and don&#x27;t find it at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>I always wished I could go back to something so basic and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pale with yellow undertones (MAC NC25) and this suits my skin nicely.</li>
      <li>They are all natural and high quality.</li>
      <li>I love how small and compact this is.</li>
      <li>I generally don&#x27;t wear much makeup and I prefer a dewy natural look.</li>
      <li>I like a natural looking blush with my foundation.</li>
      <li>This particular color doesn&#x27;t clash with red hair and its not overdone</li>
      <li>The scent, though vaguely middle-school lip gloss-ish, is mild and not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>A sheer, natural looking blush of color.</li>

<li> The company has 100% money back guarantee, so you cant really go wrong.</li>
<li> Not sure.  </li>
<li> Not sure how I am going to recycle this.</li>
<li> Think of approximately twice the diameter of a chapstick</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> crap.</li>
<li> I like the shade but its freaking expensive now that I realized!!!!</li>

    <li> I love this product!  It gives a light and natural glow!</li>
    <li> I love this for summer!  It is a great color when you have a little bit of a tan already.  It gives a nice overall glow and &amp;#34;dew&amp;#34; to your cheeks, lips, and eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say excellent for more lip than cheek color. If you have drier skin maybe a cheek tint. But those of us with oily skin may want to stick to using this on lips. No scent or taste noticeable.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft peach colour.</li>
    <li> I bought this purely based on the reviews I read here. I rarely buy makeup without testing it first but luckily this worked well for me. I like a natural looking blush with my foundation. I generally don&#x27;t wear much makeup and I prefer a dewy natural look. I&#x27;m pale with yellow undertones (MAC NC25) and this suits my skin nicely. I apply this on my finger tips and swipe it on my cheeks and I&#x27;m ready to go. I love how small and compact this is. Perfect for travel and a little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> more of a light pink....i should have listened to the other reviews but I figured since I&#x27;m so pasty white in skin tone that it might actually look peach on me.... I was wrong. It&#x27;s pink. I have the grapefruit one as well and that is more pink and i think has a better contrast. That being said I do love these products just wouldn&#x27;t do this particular color again. I wish they did have a more peachy colored one though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pastier to apply than I expected. The color was true to the picture, but the package is tiny and I didn&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
    <li> I have used many of this company&#x27;s products, from the skin care lines  to the makeup,  and I am always pleased. They are all natural and high quality. The company has 100% money back guarantee, so you cant really go wrong. The color is a light pink rather than peach, has a very subtle glow to it, not a sparkle, but a hint of shimmer...nothing overboard. very creamy and also gentle to the skin (as all the products are). This has become my favorite company for skin care and cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I like many products from this company including another pot blush.  But this blush does not work for me at all.  First of all, it is NOT peach.  It is a very fair pink and you can hardly see anything on my cheeks.  If you see it, the color does not fit me at all and it is greasy (because I had to apply it a lot to show).  I don&#x27;t like the whitish-pink that it makes on my lips either.  Not sure how I am going to recycle this.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it on lips and cheeks perfect color natural looking with a pop of color. Helps skin appear smoother. I&#x27;m 50 and this creamy product helps skin look younger adds moisture without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. A sheer, natural looking blush of color. Only wear for blush but I don&#x27;t think it would be very good as lipstick-not enough color, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and creamy, and blends well.  I wear it everyday with just some tinted sunblock.  It&#x27;s wonderful and light, yet colorful enough to pinch up my cheeks!</li>
    <li> I have this tint in another color and love the product. This color is not peach at all; it is a VERY light pink. Unless you are extremely fair complected.</li>
    <li> I like the shade but its freaking expensive now that I realized!!!! Not worth it at all...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok too light to really notice and I have fair skin.</li>
    <li> First up, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The scent, though vaguely middle-school lip gloss-ish, is mild and not unpleasant. The tint has a consistency sort of like a lighter, less sticky chapstick. I have normal skin, and don&#x27;t find it at all overpowering. People with very sensitive skin may, but I found the texture pretty dreamy. It blends really well!

This probably comes as no surprise to you, dear reader, but I kind of skimmed the product info and had a completely different idea of the size. Second, the color isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d describe as peach. It&#x27;s bright, hot pink without the orange component that &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; suggests. I don&#x27;t mind the color, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting. Nonetheless, I really like the product! You can&#x27;t beat multipurpose makeup for practicality.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I was expecting more of a \\&quot;tint\\&quot; not actual solid color pigment.  I will give it to my niece.  She might like it.</li>
    <li> 100% pure is certainly a much better brand than most cosmetics. This particular color doesn&#x27;t clash with red hair and its not overdone so I really like it. plus its not full of nasty chemicals like most. totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product and color is very complementary to my strawberry blond complexion.</li>
    <li> In my teens we used to use lip and cheek tints all the time. I used them into my twenties then they disappeared. I always wished I could go back to something so basic and easy to use. I personally feel it gives me a more natural and clean look.</li>
    <li> This tint is a nice color.  However, it is a little more of a light color than the expected peach.  Maybe the word glow means something?  Not sure.  But, it&#x27;s not a bad color.</li>
    <li> crap. This stays on for about 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It has few ingredients, which indicates true, effective quality. This is a brand that cares about their customers, and delivers what they promise!</li>
