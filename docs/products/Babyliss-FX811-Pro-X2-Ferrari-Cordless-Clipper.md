      <li>/&gt;- cuts hair amazingly.</li>
      <li>It is awesome to have a cordless clipper, it does come with guards but be gentle as you get the one set.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect, high quality.</li>
      <li>I also own the Ferrari blowdryer and love that.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t blend my taper fades flawlessly like my old clippers which had a 1/2 guard.</li>
      <li>Cuts amazing, holds charge, very powerful motor!</li>
      <li>And they arrived very quickly and for an amazing price.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re light and easy to work with, ergonomically superior.</li>
      <li>Love this clipper.</li>
      <li>These are awesome clippers, I only charge them every 5-6 weeks and do tons of haircuts.</li>
      <li>Love that these are cordless and contain all clipper guards (1-8).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also handsomely designed and looks like a piece of art sitting in the cradle on my station.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>But I love these.</li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>My kids love this product</li>
      <li>They are light weight, easy to handle, and will cut through anything!</li>
      <li>great item, ecxellent product and lighter and faster than most professional hair clippers in the market.</li>
      <li>Blending is made unbelievably easy.</li>
      <li>strong and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>One of the things I like best about the Babyliss is that it uses Lithium Ion batteries that should have a longer life and less of the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34; you get with Ni-Cads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons- hooks up to a cord instead of a charging station, doesn&#x27;t fit in your hand as well as a wahl sterling, and doesn&#x27;t seem to blend as well.</li>
      <li>So light they drastically reduce fatigue</li>
      <li>and this clipper being light weight has saved me from quitting or leaving my job.</li>
      <li>and she decided to start complaining about her new set of CHI clippers that are now nice closet space eaters.</li>
      <li>( Most fades take me about 10- 15 mins max, so if youre taking more time take that into consideration with any clipper as far as maintenance its not the amount of cuts</li>
      <li>I was actually so happy with this clipper that I purchased a second one after receiving and using the first pair.</li>
      <li>As a hairstylist these are my dream come true.</li>
      <li>Even when I had other new trimmers they were never this good out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;- amazing attachments included.</li>
      <li>The unit itself stays cool in operation, is quiet and mostly vibration free.</li>
      <li>This shaver has worked great so far for both head hair, facial hair, and body hair.  </li>
      <li>Works better as a blending free hand tool than actually removing bulk with guard combs.</li>
      <li>The cordless part makes them worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Cuts amazingly quick and fast.</li>
      <li>its not very heavy, designed well, I&#x27;ve always used wahl clippers and this fit right in.  </li>
      <li>I have shaved for a month now on the first charge and</li>
      <li>There is a second feature that allows the blades to be lowered and raised which can help achieve a better fade.</li>
      <li>I have used many personal trimmers and this the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the Babyliss a lot - definitely worth a look if you want a high quality cordless hair trimmer.</li>
      <li>Motor runs smooth and quiet, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet after a number of lengthy sessions.  </li>
      <li>Cutter lengths 1 through 8&lt;br /&gt;- fast charge, works even with cable plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cut is much faster and smoother than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I have read reviews complaining about the quality of the plastic guards, well as a professional barber, most plastic guards are the same quality.</li>
      <li>I just love it so sharp ,it has a lot of energy  that lasts over 4 days</li>
      <li>But i will spread the love to other barbers out here in Asia to get on these Ferrari.</li>
      <li>It is slightly too large for that, nut the guards are just not quite good enough.</li>
      <li>The build quality seems high otherwise.</li>
      <li>fall for me is that these clippers do not cut as close as most do, and they feel a little aggressive without a guard on them.</li>
      <li>The reason shes in love with these clippers is primarily that they are lighter and she no longer has a tangled mess which allows her less to worry about and lessens fatigue.</li>
      <li>Its still new, but two of us in the salon bought these and I did have to immediately return one as it would not charge, they immediately sent a new one.  </li>
      <li>I replaced an older rechargeable trimmer with this, and so far no regrets.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a professional, I have high standards for the tools I use for my clients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve shaved my head for 10 years and as most know cordless clippers usually don&#x27;t make it 2 years.</li>
      <li>This clipper performs very well, is quiet and maintains a charge during a busy work day.</li>
      <li>I have yet to have these die even in the midst of a busy shift.</li>
      <li>the hair gets caught in there but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems so far after owning them for about 3 months</li>
      <li>Her review was that The weight is very well balanced and lighter than traditional clippers the motor has plenty of power and the battery has tons of life.</li>
      <li>I m a professional hairdresser and thought it would be up to par.</li>
      <li>And when the battery runs down, it recharges really quickly so you can be up and running in no</li>
      <li>High priced but overall a must for hairstylist!</li>
      <li>/&gt;- well built, solid feel in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;- incredibly fast blade, definitely faster than traditional cutters</li>

<li> Quick effective clipper, but am very disappointed in the product not having a 1/2 guard .</li>
<li> Highly recommend, only down side is the buttons pushing them up and down..</li>
<li> I use them on my 3 yr old to give a tight fade.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not the worst by any means; just not the best due to the exorbitant price.</li>

<li> I wish it had the same guards as my previous Baby Pro as they were double headed and contoured on the end instead of the sharper tipped guards.</li>
<li> The charge lasts a long time!</li>
<li> /&gt;- can&#x27;t think of a single con, maybe premium price.</li>
<li> other thing the Babyliss batteries provide is really long run time - seems like the three hour runtime advertised on the packaging</li>
<li> she&#x27;s a professional hairstylist at an upper end salon and kept complaining about her clippers trimmers and various other hair stylist tools getting tangled up and being virtually useless.</li>
<li> U do have to oil it after every other haircut  </li>
<li> /&gt;Otherwise, the cutting performance it topnotch - works quickly and evenly.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> older unit had built-in Ni-Cad batteries that were impossible to replace, and after a few years, it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge anymore - got to be really frustrating.</li>
<li> too heavy...</li>
<li> Cut wet or dry, thick our thin hair no problem.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not sure it would survive a drop on a hard tile floor, but it&#x27;s at least as rugged as other brands</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Clippers cut great. Have used every brand and have been working at a salon for ten years. Highly recommend, only down side is the buttons pushing them up and down..the hair gets caught in there but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems so far after owning them for about 3 months</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever. They cut great. They are quiet and lightweight. Cut wet or dry, thick our thin hair no problem. Holds a charge forever even with use in the salon. I love them. And they arrived very quickly and for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers, I only charge them every 5-6 weeks and do tons of haircuts.</li>
    <li> Amazing cordless clipper, cuts through hair amazingly. Works better as a blending free hand tool than actually removing bulk with guard combs. I have read reviews complaining about the quality of the plastic guards, well as a professional barber, most plastic guards are the same quality. It is perfect, high quality. The charge lasts a long time! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been a stylist for 9 years. This is probably my sixth set of clippers. They are amazing and the best. The cut is much faster and smoother than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. They&#x27;re light and easy to work with, ergonomically superior. Blending is made unbelievably easy. I also own the Ferrari blowdryer and love that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with them!</li>
    <li> As a professional, I have high standards for the tools I use for my clients. This clipper performs very well, is quiet and maintains a charge during a busy work day. It is also handsomely designed and looks like a piece of art sitting in the cradle on my station. I was actually so happy with this clipper that I purchased a second one after receiving and using the first pair.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. I use them daily. Great add to my clipper collection.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older rechargeable trimmer with this, and so far no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older unit had built-in Ni-Cad batteries that were impossible to replace, and after a few years, it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge anymore - got to be really frustrating.

The unit itself stays cool in operation, is quiet and mostly vibration free. It fits in your hand well and isn&#x27;t awkward to hold, even for extended times. The build quality seems high otherwise. Yes, it&#x27;s plastic and I&#x27;m not sure it would survive a drop on a hard tile floor, but it&#x27;s at least as rugged as other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the Babyliss a lot - definitely worth a look if you want a high quality cordless hair trimmer.</li>

    <li> Quick effective clipper, but am very disappointed in the product not having a 1/2 guard . I can&#x27;t blend my taper fades flawlessly like my old clippers which had a 1/2 guard.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife she&#x27;s a professional hairstylist at an upper end salon and kept complaining about her clippers trimmers and various other hair stylist tools getting tangled up and being virtually useless. So I visited her for a hair cut one day and she decided to start complaining about her new set of CHI clippers that are now nice closet space eaters. I took the Hint and started reading reviews and decided that these were the solution. I Bought them and had them delivered to her salon and she has been using them ever since and she loves them. Her review was that The weight is very well balanced and lighter than traditional clippers the motor has plenty of power and the battery has tons of life. There is a second feature that allows the blades to be lowered and raised which can help achieve a better fade. The reason shes in love with these clippers is primarily that they are lighter and she no longer has a tangled mess which allows her less to worry about and lessens fatigue. This is a great product that she would recommend to any hair dresser/barber.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved my head for 10 years and as most know cordless clippers usually don&#x27;t make it 2 years. I have shaved for a month now on the first charge and the battery still seems to be well charged.&lt;br /&gt;Down fall for me is that these clippers do not cut as close as most do, and they feel a little aggressive without a guard on them.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist these are my dream come true. I have yet to have these die even in the midst of a busy shift. You will not regret this purchase. Hair does get stuck in the buttons that&#x27;s why they get 4 stars instead of 5. But I love these. I will never buy anything except these again. The cordless part makes them worth every cent. They cut through any hair type with ease.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve had in my 20+ year career. So light they drastically reduce fatigue</li>
    <li> Its still new, but two of us in the salon bought these and I did have to immediately return one as it would not charge, they immediately sent a new one.  It is awesome to have a cordless clipper, it does come with guards but be gentle as you get the one set.  I would recommend this to anyone who does a lot of barbering.  its not very heavy, designed well, I&#x27;ve always used wahl clippers and this fit right in.  U do have to oil it after every other haircut  ( Most fades take me about 10- 15 mins max, so if youre taking more time take that into consideration with any clipper as far as maintenance its not the amount of cuts its the time you actually have it on)</li>
    <li> The product was not anything  have purchased from Amazon or the conair babyliss company. If I didn&#x27;t distroy the box I a would have sent it back. I actually forgot about the clipper and put it in the drawer at work. I m a professional hairdresser and thought it would be up to par.</li>
    <li> great item, ecxellent product and lighter and faster than most professional hair clippers in the market.</li>
    <li> Love that these are cordless and contain all clipper guards (1-8).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- cordless, lightweight and holds a charge forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- hooks up to a cord instead of a charging station, doesn&#x27;t fit in your hand as well as a wahl sterling, and doesn&#x27;t seem to blend as well.</li>
    <li> They are light weight, easy to handle, and will cut through anything! I love them and have been doing hair for 7 years!</li>
    <li> I use this like I would a neck trimmer. It is slightly too large for that, nut the guards are just not quite good enough. If this thing had blades I would give it 5 stars .Quite strong and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Cuts amazing, holds charge, very powerful motor! I wish it had the same guards as my previous Baby Pro as they were double headed and contoured on the end instead of the sharper tipped guards. High priced but overall a must for hairstylist!</li>
    <li> too heavy... it take some work out to hold it long enought to cut one  person hair</li>
    <li> works great. I use them on my 3 yr old to give a tight fade. Love them!</li>
    <li> These clippers cut with very good precision. With plenty of changeable guards. Love them!!! I think i&#x27;m the only person in Japan with these. But i will spread the love to other barbers out here in Asia to get on these Ferrari.</li>
    <li> Love this clipper. Cuts amazingly quick and fast. Also I have tennis elbow which hurts badly and this clipper being light weight has saved me from quitting or leaving my job. Thanks so much. Denise Danielson</li>
    <li> This shaver has worked great so far for both head hair, facial hair, and body hair.  Motor runs smooth and quiet, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet after a number of lengthy sessions.  I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity and durability of the unit, but 2 months in and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I just love it so sharp ,it has a lot of energy  that lasts over 4 days and it blinks  2 hour before the battery is about to run out</li>
    <li> My kids love this product</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Dog got a hold of charger though and I can&#x27;t find a replacement cord. They are that good that I&#x27;ve been waiting to find a replacement cord for over a year.</li>
    <li> I have used many personal trimmers and this the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;- well built, solid feel in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;- incredibly fast blade, definitely faster than traditional cutters&lt;br /&gt;- cuts hair amazingly. Even when I had other new trimmers they were never this good out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;- amazing attachments included. Cutter lengths 1 through 8&lt;br /&gt;- fast charge, works even with cable plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;- can&#x27;t think of a single con, maybe premium price.</li>
    <li> It works beautifuly and the charge runs for the long time. Just love it.</li>
