    <li> Beautiful box arrived just as shown</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the original a while ago and still had some perfume left and the box left. I made SURE this wasn&#x27;t a fake and it wasnt. It matches the one I bought in the store down the colors and text of print. Smell is lovely for any season. A little goes a long way. Very clean.</li>
    <li> This was a blind purchase based on the reviews and the ingredients. I think the scent is pleasant but somehow I have not used even 1/5 of the bottle yet. So it is not my go-to fragrance... I think it&#x27;s just \\&quot;nice\\&quot; but not \\&quot;me\\&quot;. It is very mild and sweet and not too overpowering. I can&#x27;t pinpoint any notes to describe it, maybe the tuberose as the only one. I would suggest to others to try this one in a store before buying online.</li>
    <li> A very light, powdery and pleasant fragrance...very pretty!  However, it doesn&#x27;t linger at all and requires at least three to four spritzes throughout the workday.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Great Price and fast delivery! A+++</li>
    <li> Rich smelling and long lasting. I love it. The bottle is beautiful too. Looks lovely on a vanity or dresser.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for many, many years.  Hope I never have to change.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is soft and appealing. Many compliments are given when I wear this. I&#x27;m trying not to be too generous because I want to have for awhile.</li>
    <li> I recommend excellent product and fast delivery thanks</li>
    <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work well. fragrance is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for myself and enjoy the scent tremendously. I also turned around and purchased one for my daughter in law for Christmas. It&#x27;s a very becoming, pleasant scent to wear anywhere and the price is better than anywhere I shop.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, I think she smells great, and the price was just right. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever!</li>
    <li> ME ENCANTA ESTE PERFUME TIENE BUEN OLOR.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mother who just recently started using this fragrance. Not for everyone smells great on her but smells awful on paper. Should check your nearest fragrance store to see if it matches your skin chemistry. Happy with the quality, shipping and price was AMAZING!</li>
