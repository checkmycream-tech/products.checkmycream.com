      <li>I have been satisfied with the results.</li>

      <li>On warmer days, I primarily use in the evening under my moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this product overall.  </li>
      <li>If it could be purchased scent free, I would buy again.</li>
      <li>Given the successful smoothing/diminishing of my marionette lines, I&#x27;m now applying the deep wrinkle treatment to my crows feet and forehead lines.</li>
      <li>Originally got for face but didn&#x27;t care for it and started using on neck</li>
      <li>BUT THIS LITTLE TUBE WORKS GREAT...</li>
      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t good for my skin,&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Im using Ponds  &amp; other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Then  </li>
      <li>I find that it isn&#x27;t waxy and that it blends right in.</li>
      <li>IT IS NOT A FIXER OR PLUMPER-IT IS A TRUE FILLER AND REALLY WORKS...</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>While the product may not be noticeable, the improvement in my marionette lines most definitely is.</li>
      <li>While browsing on Amazon,I located Garnier Ultra-Lift Daily Targeted Deep Wrinkle Treatment and noticed that it had received pretty good reviews, so I tried it.</li>
      <li>an it hasn&#x27;t really done much but moisturize my skin.</li>
      <li>I USE COTTON TIPS TO GENTLY EVEN IT ONTO MY LINES...</li>

      <li>I can see some improvement but not as much as I would like</li>
      <li>It definitely reduces the appearance and feels smooth on your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early twenties and am starting to see some fine lines</li>
      <li>but I think the skin in that area is tighter and the lines are less prominent.</li>
      <li>At first, I applied it under my tinted Olay moisturizer but thought I was likely moving the Garnier from its intended target.</li>
      <li>and people say you look young, when I tell them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 60s and have always used moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Garnier deep wrinkle treatment has been very helpful to me.</li>
      <li>I have been using this stuff for few years, it helps with the wrinkles, I use it where ever I have them, it fills them from showing as much if you deep ones, if you have light one you can see them, I&#x27;m over 50</li>
      <li>Around eye area and also the harder to diminish smile lines.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and just recently found the Roc brand of Retin A for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I buy this because after washing my face with a gentle cleanser, I still have the dry look under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>an this I can only use at night because it makes my skin super oily even if I just use a little.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the results immediately! It is effective in helping my skin and the price is great!  It helped my skin immediately!  This product is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Works great at minimizing forehead lines</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a like and a really like. It fills in lines better than the Garnier Ultra-Lift Targeted Line Smoother for Lines with Crow&#x27;s Feet, 0.5 Fluid Ounce. However, I usually need to apply it twice to fill. But does work good for the day!</li>
    <li> They substituted Ultra-Lift daily targeted DEEP Wrinkly treatment INTENSIVE  for Ultra-Lift Daily Targeted Wrinkly Treatment.  They did not send what I ordered!</li>
    <li> Does a nice job smoothing out your skin. Not greasy, hides lines and wrinkles around your mouth and your eyes.</li>
    <li> Garnier deep wrinkle treatment has been very helpful to me.It definitely reduces the appearance and feels smooth on your face.I have used NuSkin wrinkle treatment and I didnot find it was as effective as Garnier.The cost is very affordable.I  do not planon using any other wrinkle treatment in the future.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t good for my skin,&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Im using Ponds  &amp; other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Then  i was my face with zoxema  really good</li>
    <li> I tend to use this is the winter instead of serum.  On warmer days, I primarily use in the evening under my moisturizer.  I have been satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT-HAVE USED THIS FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL YOU COULD NOT BUY IT IN THE DRUGSTORES...I LOVE WHAT IT IS MEANT TO DO...IT IS A WONDERFUL FILLER FOR DEEP LINES..YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT -THEN LET IT DRY..I USE COTTON TIPS TO GENTLY EVEN IT ONTO MY LINES...IT WORKS AND STAYS THERE ALL DAY..WHAT A DIFFERENCE..THIS IS NOT FOR FIXING YOUR LINES-BUT FOR FILLING THEM IN..I HAVE USED MANY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS-LANCOME-ESTEE LAUDER TO MENTION A FEW FOR THREE TIMES THE PRICE-BUT THIS LITTLE TUBE WORKS GREAT...HOPE THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT..&lt;br /&gt;PS-IT IS NOT A FIXER OR PLUMPER-IT IS A TRUE FILLER AND REALLY WORKS...</li>
    <li> I honestly can see visible difference in fine lines. Around eye area and also the harder to diminish smile lines. Good product.</li>
    <li> I buy this because after washing my face with a gentle cleanser, I still have the dry look under my eyes.  It moisturizes the area (about 1/2\\&quot; below eye) and I can workout without getting \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  I have very sensitive skin and just recently found the Roc brand of Retin A for sensitive skin.  They advise to use every other night, so to fight actual wrinkles I would recommend that.  So, if it&#x27;s just a bit of moisture you need Garnier is fine and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.  After using this product for over a year I&#x27;ve never seen a change in fine lines; therefore 3 stars - for I like it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she is very satisfied with the product. Almost impossibe to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties and am starting to see some fine lines so I decided to try this. I can see some improvement but not as much as I would like an this I can only use at night because it makes my skin super oily even if I just use a little. Their is more in the tube then I thought would be which is nice and for the price you cant beat it its double this price in stores. Also it has a very pleasant smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all after washing my face. When this is gone I&#x27;m goin to try something else if I cant find something different I&#x27;ll purchase this again. Arrived in a timely fashion that was a big plus if you have really deep wrinkles I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend this because I have very faint ones an it hasn&#x27;t really done much but moisturize my skin.</li>

    <li> This stuff works great on the lines on my forehead. i have been using it for yrs now and I love it</li>
    <li> little to Waxy for my liking</li>
    <li> Love it! will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60s and have always used moisturizer and sunscreen. Not too long ago, I noticed that my so-called marionette lines (long vertical lines between the mouth and chin) were looking really deep, which made me feel really sad. I tried various Clinique products but nothing helped. While browsing on Amazon,I located Garnier Ultra-Lift Daily Targeted Deep Wrinkle Treatment and noticed that it had received pretty good reviews, so I tried it. At first, I applied it under my tinted Olay moisturizer but thought I was likely moving the Garnier from its intended target. So, now I apply it on top of my tinted moisturizer. I find that it isn&#x27;t waxy and that it blends right in. While the product may not be noticeable, the improvement in my marionette lines most definitely is. Given the successful smoothing/diminishing of my marionette lines, I&#x27;m now applying the deep wrinkle treatment to my crows feet and forehead lines. People I know have recently started remarking about how nice my face looks, which is very nice to hear! I like this product a lot and anticipate that I&#x27;ll be using it to combat gravity in the future!</li>
    <li> I like this cream, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again.  It has a strong &amp;#34;perfume smell&amp;#34; that irritates my sinuses.  If it could be purchased scent free, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Tried lots of products....but I keep coming back to this one. Works well over or under foundation too. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I think it keeps the wrinkles from getting deeper.</li>
    <li> I got this product and have been using it for a couple weeks and I have noticed no difference at all so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> They no longer sell this in the stores. this is a nice product..it goes on smoothly and takes away some fine lines. Kudos to the seller for actually having some to sell..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I use it only on one spot on my face, furrow lines. It hard to tell but I think the skin in that area is tighter and the lines are less prominent. I&#x27;m saying it hard to tell because I have been using it together with another Garnier anti-wrinkle product. So, I guess together these two did the job.</li>
    <li> Love this for firming and smoothing neck area. Originally got for face but didn&#x27;t care for it and started using on neck and actually people commented that my neck looked great. Well worth the price considering other neck creams at $100 and up.</li>
    <li> It seems that for my comparison between this item and one other, the only difference is the price. The more costly one works just like Garnier product.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product overall.  It appears to smooth out fine lines.  I have used this product for several years now and have seen a difference.  I don&#x27;t want to stop now.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product! I used it regularly until it was gone just to give the product time to work. It did absolutely nothing! It felt greasy when I put it on and didn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed when I needed it.  I recommend the product (although that said, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and this works for *my* skin) and I&#x27;d order it again from this vendor.</li>
