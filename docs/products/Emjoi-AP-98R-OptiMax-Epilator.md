### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Oooo that hurts, but I&#x27;ve learned to pay close attention and learned how to best move the OptiMax over the contours of the underarm.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>So, I am HAPPY, happy, happy to avoid that altogether.     </li>
      <li>I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I am totally happy with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great invention.  </li>
      <li>Iam so happy with the Emjoi</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great product.  </li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good and reliable.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>then I tried it on my face and was successful getting most of the hair out.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled that it gets so close.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also wanted one with a cord and liked where the cord plugs into this model.</li>
      <li>this comes at a cost - it is not as effective and you would have to go again over the area.</li>
      <li>If it was faster, I&#x27;d be thrilled.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It does not work nearly as well as the Remington (best I have used) or Epilady (circa 1989!)</li>
      <li>so I have to make many more passes before it gets them.</li>
      <li>I have gone a week or more between hair-removal sessions and</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the long-term hair growth yet, by not epilating or shaving for a month or more.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for my face..but have use for under arms and legs.</li>
      <li>I definitely think that Emjoi does make the best epillators.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>like it better for these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so if u want the best for the same money, dont get this one , get the AP99 MODEL INSTEAD.</li>
      <li>I think this is such a wonderful thing.</li>
      <li>, I feel I get better results when I stand and epillate my knees</li>
      <li>This product is just ok.</li>
      <li>As it is, I&#x27;m pleased with this product after a year&#x27;s use.</li>
      <li>I have been hair free in my pits for 2 weeks now and it has been really nice.  </li>
      <li>but I know it gets better over time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i was okay</li>
      <li>and I am glad I chose this model.</li>
      <li>like i have to do so many techniques</li>
      <li>I had a Gently Gold Emjoi for many years and loved it.  </li>
      <li>so i now use the braun for legs, and the emjoi for sensitive areas and this works great for me.    </li>
      <li>The slim line is easy for me to hold.</li>
      <li>The power and speed of the tweezers isn&#x27;t as strong when it has been charged, so I always use it plugged in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the original Epilady (loved it) and the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress.</li>
      <li>as far as i remember, and its been a good decade and more, for me it took about couple of months and now it feels kinda like lightly scratching with nails.</li>
      <li>but before that it was working fine.  </li>
      <li>And my husband would be fine if I let all my hair grow in, so I don&#x27;t do any hair removal for him.</li>
      <li>but is it just me or does anyone think it takes forrrrever to jest one limb hair free?</li>
      <li>what I like best is that even when some hair starts to grow in, in a few days, those are the from the follicles you&#x27;d plucked two weeks ago.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how smooth they were after I was finished.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure onesession with the Emjoi takes longer than a week&#x27;s worth of shaving time added up.</li>
      <li>The Emjoi units work great, but don&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>i still have to shave my legs to get them perfectly smooth.   </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product, it works like it said.</li>
      <li>My friend liked mine so much I bought her one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
      <li>The pros: smooth legs forever.</li>
      <li>depending on your hair growing cycles, to stay hair free (as in completely smooth), you have to use it appx once a week.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d never consider using the OptiMax on my arms, where my hair color is light.</li>
      <li>and I know that eventually I will not have to use it every day to remain smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is worth it!  </li>
      <li>It may be telling that beautychoice.com no longer sells this product, which is where I had purchased this originally.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to dig around to brush them clean.</li>
      <li>Neat, clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have  the patience to part with a razor, this model is a gem at full price.  </li>
      <li>they are painfull, and its more then &#x27;a pinch&#x27;, HOWEVER the pain really does subside after you have used it for a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to take care of my legs quickly and it seemed to do a real through job on one week growth.  </li>
      <li>one more thing, although should be obvious - the thicker and denser your hair the more its gonna hurt and the longer its gonna take.</li>
      <li>It seems that I have to go over and over the same area more and more.</li>
      <li>Overall I am really pleased with this product, the price is very good and it performs just as expected.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I ever feel quite as smooth as the first hours after shaving, but that feeling is so fleeting.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find the OptiMax more effective than the other two, but</li>
      <li>first of all, let me say that since i started to need to concern myself with body hair i have always used epilators, first brauns then emjois and currently i use both, so i am rather experienced (about 15 years worth of experience).</li>
      <li>I purchased this model based on a Consumer Reports review and overall I would say this is a pretty good epilator.</li>
      <li>I used to get itchy razor burn on my lower legs and bikini area, so the trade off of a few ingrown hairs is one I&#x27;m happy to make.     </li>
      <li>(That is the only region where I have problems with catching my skin.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results so far</li>
      <li>Yes, it does hurt some when you start using it, but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Much better and closer than my old machine.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job of removing  hiar with minimal discomfort.</li>
      <li>The plug is in a good place and does not get in your way like some other models.  </li>
      <li>I am pretty much hair free for 2-3 weeks.</li>
      <li>after i had this one alone for few months and wanted something more efficient even if it be more painfull</li>
      <li>im very much de-sensitized)</li>
      <li>so i really like this!</li>
      <li>i love emjoi products because they last for years!  </li>
      <li>I did lots of reading before I decided on this exact brand</li>
      <li>and then we are back :)</li>
      <li>After my first session on my armpits, I called it \\&quot;self-induced armpit torture\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>although this epilator, which i have had since 2006, is great for beginners and sensitive areas (it really is less painfull!)</li>
      <li>First time on the legs didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as under my arms.</li>
      <li>i love this epilator, i had the older version before had it for 5 years before i made the mistake of plugging it into an international outlet</li>
      <li>back to the emjoi - i would recommend it for beginners, sensitive areas, very very fine hair types.</li>
      <li>the braun IS powerful and consequently, more painful but definitely faster and more effective</li>
      <li>This was a problem with the Gently Gold model.</li>
      <li>It still works, but it is much slower.</li>
      <li>and I really like the results.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t grab hair very well</li>
      <li>Thanks Tana</li>
      <li>Just be sure to read the directions carefully and follow them to a \\&quot;t\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Did not work very well, zero stars.</li>
      <li>It is still time consuming to remove hair completely, but worth it to me.</li>
      <li>Not only are ingrown hairs rare, it is close to painless!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Does a good job of removing  hiar with minimal discomfort.</li>
    <li> It took over a month to get use to it, after the first couple of tries I decided I would never use it again, but after seeing too much hair on my face, I went ahead and give it another try. This time I put it on low try it on my arms, I prefer this feeling then I tried it on my face and was successful getting most of the hair out. Its not 100% efficient but helpful and I think using this and Vaniqa seems to reduce the unwanted hair somewhat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 36 year old woman with average skin sensitivity. My only previous hair-removal experience is with shaving. And my husband would be fine if I let all my hair grow in, so I don&#x27;t do any hair removal for him. It&#x27;s just for me and I&#x27;d never consider using the OptiMax on my arms, where my hair color is light. A year ago, I started using the OptiMax, hoping for the long-term benefit of less hair growth after follicles stop producing over time. I haven&#x27;t tested the long-term hair growth yet, by not epilating or shaving for a month or more. I have gone a week or more between hair-removal sessions and what I like best is that even when some hair starts to grow in, in a few days, those are the from the follicles you&#x27;d plucked two weeks ago. The hair comes back in at different rates. And sometimes hairs do just get broken off (more like shaving) instead of plucked, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Overall, it&#x27;s VERY UNLIKE the re-growth after shaving, where you feel all your stubble, all at once, after just a few hours. I don&#x27;t think I ever feel quite as smooth as the first hours after shaving, but that feeling is so fleeting.    It was painful at first. After my first session on my armpits, I called it \\&quot;self-induced armpit torture\\&quot;. It was so painful I started sweating and it doesn&#x27;t work on wet hair/skin. After a few sessions though, when less hair is getting removed because of different growth cycles, even armpit removal is tolerable and no longer torturous. (That is the only region where I have problems with catching my skin. Oooo that hurts, but I&#x27;ve learned to pay close attention and learned how to best move the OptiMax over the contours of the underarm. I generally use it once or twice a week, and even after hair starts to grow back, it is thin enough that I feel comfortable wearing tank tops in public. (I guess I am careful not to walk around flashing my pits, but it isn&#x27;t like I ever did that anyway. And again, I&#x27;ll highlight the big difference compared to re-growth after shaving, where I wouldn&#x27;t wear a tank top in public 24 hours after shaving.)     First time on the legs didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as under my arms. And after a few sessions, the little pricks of pain are subtle enough not to be a bother. (A hint, contrary to the directions, I feel I get better results when I stand and epillate my knees so the skin is a little loose, rather than when bent or pulled taught.) I do get a few ingrown hairs on my legs. Both types -- the ones I can see growing under the skin and the pimple-like bumps. I scrub and scrub with a mitt during longer showers. But I put up with them for the benefit of thinner hair between sessions. (Plus, I&#x27;m vain about the veins in my legs and never wear shorts or short skirts.) I used to get itchy razor burn on my lower legs and bikini area, so the trade off of a few ingrown hairs is one I&#x27;m happy to make.     I&#x27;ve never used it on my face and I only use it on the hair growing outside my swimsuit line. I hated having to shave that area all year, when months and months go by in MN when I don&#x27;t wear a swimsuit. But I really hated the razor burn I&#x27;d get with the first few shaves in the summer or for an unexpected stay at a hotel with a pool. So, I am HAPPY, happy, happy to avoid that altogether.     I almost rated this item with a 4 instead of a 5. I&#x27;d give it a 4 1/2 if I could. The power and speed of the tweezers isn&#x27;t as strong when it has been charged, so I always use it plugged in. It still works, but it is much slower. In my opinion, it is like using the low power setting that is recommended for using it on your face. I didn&#x27;t buy it for that sort of use, but it does mean I have to bring along the power cord when traveling. Also, I wish it did the job faster. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, the Emjoi seems faster than some other brands, but it feels like it takes a long time to me. (Then again, I&#x27;ve never taken the time to drive to a spa for waxing or to a dermatologist for laser hair removal.) I&#x27;m sure onesession with the Emjoi takes longer than a week&#x27;s worth of shaving time added up. I&#x27;ve never timed a full session because I usually get interrupted. I bet a thorough session takes 20 minutes -- arm pits, outer bikini area, and lower thighs on down. If it was faster, I&#x27;d be thrilled. As it is, I&#x27;m pleased with this product after a year&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> The product works wonders, my only gripe is it creates in-grown hairs. It does hurt the first few times, but gradually you get used to it, and then its only a tingly sensation. Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product, it works like it said.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok. It does not work nearly as well as the Remington (best I have used) or Epilady (circa 1989!) that I have purchased in the past. Doesn&#x27;t grab hair very well so I have to make many more passes before it gets them. I thought that the two heads that allow bi-directional passes would be worth the extra cost but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The product is disappointing. It does not work for facial hair as stated, does not shave well your legs.</li>
    <li> This model is the only one I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it, but as long as the hair is long enough for it to grab, it does the job. Pain is middling, not too bad.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now and though I don&#x27;t use it that often- really just during the summer- it has held up well and works as new.</li>
    <li> first of all, let me say that since i started to need to concern myself with body hair i have always used epilators, first brauns then emjois and currently i use both, so i am rather experienced (about 15 years worth of experience). as far as my hair type - i would say average or just slightly less, there is not an awful lot but still needs regular grooming.   although this epilator, which i have had since 2006, is great for beginners and sensitive areas (it really is less painfull!) this comes at a cost - it is not as effective and you would have to go again over the area. so i use it for sensitive areas only. after i had this one alone for few months and wanted something more efficient even if it be more painfull (again, i am not a beginner so by now im very much de-sensitized), i did some research and went with Braun SE7281WD Xpressive. the braun IS powerful and consequently, more painful but definitely faster and more effective then the emjoi is. so i now use the braun for legs, and the emjoi for sensitive areas and this works great for me.    couple of side notes:   1. depending on your hair growing cycles, to stay hair free (as in completely smooth), you have to use it appx once a week. i don&#x27;t care what the package claims. those claims are based on the fact that after a hair is pulled from the root is takes 4 weeks for that hair to grow back. true that may be but it doesnt account for all hairs, in all different stages in their individual growing cycles. so yea, there you have it.   2. whoever claims that epilators are &#x27;pain-free&#x27; is a liar. they are painfull, and its more then &#x27;a pinch&#x27;, HOWEVER the pain really does subside after you have used it for a while. i don&#x27;t know if it is the body getting used to it or what but it works. as far as i remember, and its been a good decade and more, for me it took about couple of months and now it feels kinda like lightly scratching with nails. also, i noticed that there is a &#x27;re-learning&#x27; curve as well - if i go without using the epilator for a few weeks then the first one or two times it feels worse then before. and then we are back :) one more thing, although should be obvious - the thicker and denser your hair the more its gonna hurt and the longer its gonna take. sorry gals whose genetics favor that. my sister&#x27;s hair is like that and she has a harder time then me.  3. and if you were wondering, yes, overtime hair gets softer and less dense. don&#x27;t expect miracles tho. i&#x27;d say that i am no more then 15% less &#x27;hairy&#x27; now after about 15 years. its not a big percentage, but its there. please note that this is all my experience only, not a scientific fact.     back to the emjoi - i would recommend it for beginners, sensitive areas, very very fine hair types. if you are a &#x27;pro&#x27;, have thicker, denser hair, then go for something else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know on what surface this epilator is supposed to work because it did nothing for my underarms or legs. I&#x27;m also no novice at epilation, having used the same machine from France since I was 13, and for those of you who are looking to experience it for the first time, I would recommend getting the cheaper version from your local drugstore to see if you can withstand the pain (there is no difference, when hair follicles are plucked, they&#x27;re plucked...). The only reason I tried this was for the convenience of having a cordless epilator.  It may be telling that beautychoice.com no longer sells this product, which is where I had purchased this originally.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot! it definately plucks your hairs out but it doesnt take a while. yuo have to keep on goign in circles until all the hairs are finally out. it will probably take an hour to do both legs. but the hairs grow back slowly and thin so i really like this!</li>
    <li> I received this little gadget just after Christmas and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Yes, it does hurt some when you start using it, but it is well worth it. I now only epilate my underarms and can go a week without hair growth. I&#x27;ve done my legs several times, still have some nubs, but I&#x27;ve also shaved them in between epilating. If you&#x27;ve ever had electrolysis, you&#x27;ll appreciate that this is less painful.</li>
    <li> I think this is such a wonderful thing. I should have bought this along time ago. I do wish it worked a little faster. It seems that I have to go over and over the same area more and more. Do you recommend another product or is there another attachment to help me out. Thanks Tana</li>
    <li> I have never had an epilator before and I really like the results.  I can go about 2 weeks between use.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to shaving.</li>
    <li> I had a Gently Gold Emjoi for many years and loved it.  It broke and I began researching getting another one.  I decided on the AP-98R OptiMax because of its size and it also has the dule opposing heads eventhough it is small. I also wanted one with a cord and liked where the cord plugs into this model. This model can be charged and used with out the cord but so far I have used it with the cord. I am happy with it. It is a little different with the opposing heads than my previous model but I am getting use to it. It works great. The slim line is easy for me to hold. SW</li>
    <li> Hey, there&#x27;s no way around it. Using this will be a little uncomfortable the first few times. I kept a cold, wet washcloth nearby to use as a cold compress. But it really works and after a few uses it does become less and less uncomfortable. Much more thorough and infinitely quicker than tweezing, and you need to use it less frequently over time.</li>
    <li> batterry is very short time.  every time to use it will be charge 14-16 hours.</li>
    <li> When my old emjoi from 1982 finally stopped working I thought I would never find a replacement. I went on line and decided it was time to try a new model.  Iam so happy with the Emjoi AP-98R.  Thank you for a great product.  I use it mostly for my face..but have use for under arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I definitely think that Emjoi does make the best epillators.  I have been using them for years and have tried other makes. I like this one because you can use it either plugged in or charged.  The plug is in a good place and does not get in your way like some other models.  It works fast, but sometimes I do have to go over the same area multiple times.  I have yet to find one that works faster than this though.  I will be keeping this one for awhile.</li>
    <li> I researched and read all of the scary reviews saying \\&quot;IT HURTS\\&quot; well it does hurt a bit but you really get used to it, unfortunately I have not had mine that long so I am needing to use the epilator every day.  I am pleased with the results so far and I know that eventually I will not have to use it every day to remain smooth.  It is worth it!  Just be sure to read the directions carefully and follow them to a \\&quot;t\\&quot;.  If you do not, you will not like it when your skin gets caught in the tweezers, OUCH!!  This only happens when I am not really paying attention to what I am doing and I am using it on anyplace other than my shins.  Overall I am really pleased with this product, the price is very good and it performs just as expected.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Have been epilating for 20 years. I started with the old wire version and several years ago, moved onto the Emjoi OptiMax. I love it.  I also use it on my face (use only one edge of the epilator) because I am at that age. The pros: smooth legs forever. Even when hair begins to grow back, it is soft. Ease of use. I am pretty much hair free for 2-3 weeks. Everyone may be different in this regard. Cons: Because it does take the hair out from its roots, the first few sessions are painful. \\&quot;Ouch. Ouch, Ouch.\\&quot; But each treatment is less painful than the last and after 3 or 4 treatments, you don&#x27;t feel a thing. If you are used to waxing, it may not be painful at all.</li>
    <li> My friend liked mine so much I bought her one.  None of the mess of cream hair removers, no razor stubble. We use it on our faces, for us over 40s when the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; starts getting too long.  Also grabs those single \\&quot;whiskers\\&quot; that are so hard to find and tweeze.  Do shave the day before you use it for the first time, so you aren&#x27;t pulling out a whole lot of hair at once - or use it when grow-out from your current method of epilation starts to appear - then use it every few days for the first week.  Neat, clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  Great invention.  Now I want the eyebrow one.</li>
    <li> Replaced my *old* painful epilator with this one.  I did lots of reading before I decided on this exact brand then I narrowed my choices down to this model.  I am totally happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to take care of my legs quickly and it seemed to do a real through job on one week growth.  I could not believe how smooth they were after I was finished.  Much better and closer than my old machine.  I have used it each week since I got it, to get the little strays and tiny new growth and my legs have remained smooth since I got it.  I am thrilled that it gets so close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my underarms with this.  I normally get them waxed once a month, but I thought I would try this to see how it worked.  I think it was a little more painful than waxing, but it did a good job.  I like the fact that the heads rotate in opposite directions and keep the skin tight.  I have been hair free in my pits for 2 weeks now and it has been really nice.  Not looking forward to doing it again, but I know it gets better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my bikini line, but I think the head is just to large to do the fine precision work I need down there.  I will continue to wax that area or I will get another epilator with a smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this and I am glad I chose this model.</li>
    <li> i do like this product and it does do a decent job of keeping you hairless. but is it just me or does anyone think it takes forrrrever to jest one limb hair free? like i have to do so many techniques and then int he end i still have to shave my legs to get them perfectly smooth.   also don&#x27;t even think of plugging it into an international outlet even if you have a converter. my darn charger couldn&#x27;t handle it.  and then after a year of using it my emjoi wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. i was okay w/ it because i could at least use it while being plugged to an outlet.  now it just broke again!! ahhhhhhhh i&#x27;ve only have it for 1.5 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model based on a Consumer Reports review and overall I would say this is a pretty good epilator. Things have come a long way since I first bought one 8 years ago. It removes hair better and is less painful than the other unit I previously had (Epilady). It is still time consuming to remove hair completely, but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> After suffering through a Braun after my old epilator died, I saw a review for this one rating it very high in preventing ingrown hairs.  I was able to get one for close-out price on HSN as too many customers were disappointed in epilating in general.  If you have  the patience to part with a razor, this model is a gem at full price.  Not only are ingrown hairs rare, it is close to painless!  I think that hair follicles must be traumatized by pain with other brands, and then retract when pulled.  This OptiMax is gentler enough to use underarms, and you barely feel the plucking on legs.  I have no idea how they did it, but BUY THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised.  With sensitive skin in leaves red marks  where hair is removed.  On legs it does not remove hair.  Only makes it shorter.  Save your money.  I would send it back if it wasn&#x27;t too late.  My face is a mess.</li>
    <li> For the thin-skinned among us an epilator is manna from heaven.  This is my fourth epilator and it&#x27;s good and reliable.  Why have I had four?  Because they&#x27;re presumed to be COMPLETELY IRREPARABLE (even by Emjoi)--no questions asked.  For that reason, they should come with a warning label.  BUT--if razors and depilatories take off as much skin as hair and you can&#x27;t indulge in laser hair removal--they&#x27;re the only game in town.  I&#x27;ll buy a fifth when I have to.</li>
    <li> works well. not too harsh, doesn&#x27;t hurt much especially after doing it a few times.</li>
    <li> One of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. Not only was it painful to use but the battery wouldn&#x27;t stay charged for more than a day. I also had to go over the same area two or three times for it to even work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as my old Gently Gold from the same company.   (Although mine is over ten years old, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that the quality now is up to the quality of my old one.)</li>
    <li> Beibg using this product for years, wax is not good for skin in the long run, it breaks small vein s , and that is nooot attractive!</li>
    <li> Did not work very well, zero stars.</li>
    <li> i love this epilator, i had the older version before had it for 5 years before i made the mistake of plugging it into an international outlet but before that it was working fine.  i love emjoi products because they last for years!  this new one with the dual epilating head is so convenient, faster than the previous models, being able to take it anywhere without having to plug it into an outlet is so convenient.  i&#x27;d definitely reccomend it to anyone who&#x27;s been an epilator user like me, for those tyring it for the first time, yes it does hurt but it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and i found the motor power to belacking and the tweezer heads dont work as well as the emjoi ap99 aka optima gold. The price for these two items are the same so if u want the best for the same money, dont get this one , get the AP99 MODEL INSTEAD.</li>
    <li> 25May2008  Paula here in Phoenix. Don&#x27;t buy Emjoi epilators, the tweezer heads fail too soon. Sadly, in 5 months I went through 3 AP99 heads and one AP98 head, with a second one on the way out. I am going to switch to Braun. The Emjoi units work great, but don&#x27;t last.  Paula</li>
    <li> Not only did this product give me razor bumps on my chin area (I&#x27;m a girl by the way), it also had problems removing stubborn hairs.  The actual hair removal process wasn&#x27;t that painful but I was not pleased with the results. I returned this product and got the Braun 5270 Epilator instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for hair removal for a long time. It&#x27;s much less irritating than shaving with a blade or using depilatories. It&#x27;s far less painful than waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the original Epilady (loved it) and the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress. And I used them until they died. I was a little skeptical about this dual-head model, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the dual heads spinning might pinch my skin, but that is not a problem. Actually, this epilator works faster than the Gently Gold, which has a wider head. It&#x27;s easy to clean too. You can remove the heads entirely. You don&#x27;t have to dig around to brush them clean. This was a problem with the Gently Gold model. I don&#x27;t find the OptiMax more effective than the other two, but like it better for these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated to part with so much money for hair removal, but it&#x27;s a necessary evil. And it&#x27;s actually cost-effective anyway. I expect this to last many years, as the other two did. Over the long run, it&#x27;s much less expensive than other hair removal methods.</li>
