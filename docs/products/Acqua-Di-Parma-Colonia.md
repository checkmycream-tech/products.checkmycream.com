### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was under impressed by this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for anytime, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
      <li>but this is perfect.</li>
      <li>so it is about finding the best price.</li>
      <li>Great citrus/sweet smell goes perfect with Razo Rock XXX aftershave and a spritz of Giorgio Acqua di Gio.</li>
      <li>Excelent, very nice.</li>
      <li>It had good reviews</li>
      <li>So it smells good</li>
      <li>The cologne is long-lasting and very appealing and pleasant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, and attractively packaged.</li>
      <li>We both love it!</li>
      <li>Sort of citrus, rose, powder, smell.  </li>
      <li>Initially sweet, but quickly fades to a very pleasant and understated scent.</li>
      <li>The spray on this bottle is VERY FINE.  </li>
      <li>Amazing cologne originally made popular by Cary Grant</li>
      <li>Given the price of this product, I don&#x27;t want to spray more of it on.</li>
      <li>the descriptions of it, I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, &#x27;notes of citrus&#x27; etc.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Aroma combination is ok</li>
      <li>i had more disposable income, i would buy this--</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the price compared to what I pay in a fancy department store.</li>
      <li>Imdb reports this was Cary Grant&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>The smell is excellent, but is like water doesn&#x27;t  last.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and safely packed.</li>
      <li>I had read about Acqua Di Parma online, and I started investigating it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t too many places around that carry it, so when I found it online,I was</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT light fragrance which last ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Charming fragrance, fresh and masculine.</li>
      <li>The most timeless, classic fragrance ever!</li>
      <li>Very pleasing and get many compliments.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean, citrus and lemon.</li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;ve found it.&lt;br /&gt;Light, fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>yes, it is a classic; and it smells fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I discovered was that the longer I spent with the cologne, the more I liked it</li>
      <li>Thankfully not too sweet or fruity with just the right hand of spice.</li>
      <li>would most assuredly recommend this fragrance to anyone who wishes a classy scent.</li>
      <li>By far his favorite...</li>
      <li>Light citrus scent is very refreshing especially where I live in the tropics.</li>
      <li>My new absolute favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Lasts several hours and just the right blend of refreshing fragrance.</li>
      <li>you only need about 2 sprays AT THE MOST to give you all day coverage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i finally had a chance to put my nose on it when i, surprisingly, found it at the perfumery on Disneyland Anaheim last November 2012.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell - very clean.....but doesn&#x27;t really last as long as many claim.  </li>
      <li>Its more proper for an older person</li>
      <li>Anyhow, AdP is a very classic citrus that can&#x27;t be replaced.  </li>
      <li>Very exclusive.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Remember, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is unique, so this fragrance will smell differently on me than it does on you.  </li>
      <li>They have other versions that are more concentrated</li>
      <li>I first purchased this fragrance 10 years ago on a British Airways flight on a whim, and have worn it pretty much ever since.  </li>
      <li>Classic fragrance</li>
      <li>always a ton of compliments, retails normally for $120+</li>
      <li>No need to go over what everyone else has said about this classic fragrance (so far as the positives are concerned).</li>
      <li>classic and timeless male scent.  </li>
      <li>I found when I actually tried the cologne was something very unexpected.  </li>
      <li>With this bottle, I can barely detect it after 4-6 hours.</li>
      <li>I am starting to try some of their other products including the shampoo and body lotion which are very high quality.</li>

<li> of the negative reviews on this page are referring to the aftershave, deodorant, or the powder, not the cologne spray itself (which, oddly enough is the ACTUAL item that they chose to review by writing their reviews on this page).  </li>
<li> Expensive, smells that way, and worth every penny.</li>
<li> if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I would wear it every day if I didn&#x27;t crave a little variety.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Hate it ....</li>
<li> Smells awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing cologne originally made popular by Cary Grant</li>
    <li> The most timeless, classic fragrance ever!</li>
    <li> I had bought this cologne twice before from Bloomingdales. The scent used to last for 8-12 hours. With this bottle, I can barely detect it after 4-6 hours. Given the price of this product, I don&#x27;t want to spray more of it on.</li>
    <li> Excelent, very nice. Classic fragrance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years so it is about finding the best price. I was satisfied with the price compared to what I pay in a fancy department store.</li>
    <li> I had read about Acqua Di Parma online, and I started investigating it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t too many places around that carry it, so when I found it online,I was&lt;br /&gt;excited to order it and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;From the descriptions of it, I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, &#x27;notes of citrus&#x27; etc.&lt;br /&gt;What I found when I actually tried the cologne was something very unexpected.  It&#x27;s a very&lt;br /&gt;clean scent, almost soap-like and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from smelling it and trying to figure out the&lt;br /&gt;different scent layers.&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered was that the longer I spent with the cologne, the more I liked it&lt;br /&gt;and frankly, now I use it as the gold standard when trying other scents.  For years I&#x27;ve looked&lt;br /&gt;for a signature scent, something that would just be me and I think I&#x27;ve found it.&lt;br /&gt;Light, fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn.  Expensive, smells that way, and worth every penny. You&#x27;re not going to find anybody wearing it either. Very exclusive.  When asked, it&#x27;s \\&quot;something I picked up in Italy\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love the smell - very clean.....but doesn&#x27;t really last as long as many claim.  For the money, would like it to last longer.</li>
    <li> I was under impressed by this fragrance.  Its more proper for an older person so im&lt;br /&gt;Gonna give it to my dad as a fathers day gift.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Lesson learned not to purchase a scent without actually smelling it. It was recommended on Amazon as comparable to the Creed brands, so I thought I would give it a try. But it is not in the same category. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Charming fragrance, fresh and masculine. By far his favorite... We both love it!</li>
    <li> A classic, wear everyday, signature cologne.  Lasts several hours and just the right blend of refreshing fragrance. Sort of citrus, rose, powder, smell.  Very pleasing and get many compliments.</li>
    <li> always a ton of compliments, retails normally for $120+</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT light fragrance which last ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is unique, so this fragrance will smell differently on me than it does on you.  I first purchased this fragrance 10 years ago on a British Airways flight on a whim, and have worn it pretty much ever since.  The spray on this bottle is VERY FINE.  Keep in mind you only need about 2 sprays AT THE MOST to give you all day coverage. If you don&#x27;t know if this fragrance is for you or not, just buy a sample here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Colonia-Acqua-Parma-05-Cologne/dp/B00475GQ6Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395478076&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;acqua+di+parma&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua Di Parma is also a unisex fragrance.  So it smells good the fairer sex also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most assuredly recommend this fragrance to anyone who wishes a classy scent.</li>
    <li> Imdb reports this was Cary Grant&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> Hate it ....never will i buy cologne online without smelling it. It had good reviews so i thought of buying it</li>
    <li> Aroma combination is ok</li>
    <li> My new absolute favorite cologne. I would wear it every day if I didn&#x27;t crave a little variety. Great citrus/sweet smell goes perfect with Razo Rock XXX aftershave and a spritz of Giorgio Acqua di Gio.</li>
    <li> Light citrus scent is very refreshing especially where I live in the tropics. The cologne is long-lasting and very appealing and pleasant. Thankfully not too sweet or fruity with just the right hand of spice. They have other versions that are more concentrated but this is perfect. I am starting to try some of their other products including the shampoo and body lotion which are very high quality.</li>
    <li> No need to go over what everyone else has said about this classic fragrance (so far as the positives are concerned). Fresh, clean, citrus and lemon. Perfect for anytime, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative reviews on this page are referring to the aftershave, deodorant, or the powder, not the cologne spray itself (which, oddly enough is the ACTUAL item that they chose to review by writing their reviews on this page).  Anyhow, AdP is a very classic citrus that can&#x27;t be replaced.  Whether or not you want to pay the money for it is up to you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday. It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, and attractively packaged. It arrived promptly and safely packed.</li>
    <li> yes, it is a classic; and it smells fantastic!  i heard about this from my Style Guide from 2001 about mens dress/style.  Among Polo Green Big Pony, this is a classic scent that was featured in the cologne section of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally had a chance to put my nose on it when i, surprisingly, found it at the perfumery on Disneyland Anaheim last November 2012.  it blew me away with its elegance, finesse, and floral opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i had more disposable income, i would buy this--NO DOUBT.</li>
    <li> The smell is excellent, but is like water doesn&#x27;t  last.</li>
    <li> classic and timeless male scent.  Initially sweet, but quickly fades to a very pleasant and understated scent.</li>
