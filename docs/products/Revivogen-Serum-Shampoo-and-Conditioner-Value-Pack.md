### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>price is awesome considering you get 3 months out of it (shampoo and conditioner too).</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m very happy to say, my hair loss has virtually stopped and that it happened almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shampoos smell very good</li>
      <li>I will continue purchasing Revivogen serum and shampoo even after I reach my ideal look.</li>
      <li>THE SERUM IS GREAT - THE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>

      <li>hope that you will find Revivogen very effective in dealing with your hair</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>On behalf of my dad: this is a good product.</li>
      <li>instead i have a nice buzz cut that I am happy with for my age and genes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely important to me to look my best at all times.  </li>
      <li>BUT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT</li>
      <li>and I really was impressed with reviews on Revivoge.  </li>
      <li>After my research, I found using another product, a spray in called Tricomin, along with this is effective.</li>
      <li>I cut and style my own hair</li>
      <li>this product seems to work the best around the hairline creating new growth.  </li>
      <li>I had already used the shampoo, and loved it, so this value pack gave me an opportunity to try the conditioner, which is also fantastic, and the serum.  </li>
      <li>Much better than others i have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She informed that I shall be able to see hair loss improvement in 6 months at minimum.</li>
      <li>Omg i love this product.</li>
      <li>Now, all of that space has hair that is getting thicker and more pigmented.</li>
      <li>In Saudi Arabia, you will not be able to get it.</li>
      <li>hoping that in 10 or so years something better will come along.</li>
      <li>After using this product and then the shampoo/conditioner afterwards, I noticed that I lost more hair in the shower than ever before.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to try Nioxin to see if that works better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>Omg I love this product.</li>
      <li>The stuff that comes with Revivogen has a strong musky smell</li>
      <li>like this the BEST out of all the products I have used in the past; notable ones that worked (but not as well) for me were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nisim Scalp Treatment and Shampoo&lt;</li>
      <li>This product along with Tricomin has made a huge difference in my hair loss condition.  </li>
      <li>i believe using on a freshly cleaned scalp is better for absorption).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One important point regarding usage of Revivogen is that its usage may become an addiction.</li>
      <li>It is available in UAE/Dubai, UK and USA.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is available in UAE/Dubai, UK and USA.</li>
      <li>and it still is giving fantastic results.  </li>
      <li>One important point regarding usage of Revivogen is that its usage may become an addiction.</li>
      <li>Best to use it soon after hair loss though, those dead cells are dead.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>If your scalp starts to dry out, STOP using the product, regardless of their advice - their goal is just to sell you more product!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;He checked my hair and told me that my hairs and scalp was full of Chlorine deposits.</li>
      <li>full year.&lt;br</li>
      <li>shampoo and conditioner have a nice, natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>I am 71 and style my hair every day along with full make up.</li>
      <li>She told me to get an year supply of homeopathic medicines from her clinic and full payment in advance.</li>
      <li>asked me to buy another one, so it might have been good enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super oily and smells like Pledge.  </li>
      <li>easy to use, very practical, but does not smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>This Chlorine is added in the water by municipality of city to keep it germ free, but is hazardous to humans and changes the taste of water to bitter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>conditioner has a nice cooling feeling similar to tea-tree shampoos.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using installed Chlorine filter (in-line) after shower mixer and Revivogen, it gradually reduced my hair loss significantly and enough that I was not concerned about hair loss any more.</li>
      <li>, I am not sure though, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hairs, I use Revivogen Biocleansing shampoo, and I guess it&#x27;s good enough to cleanse, and has good scent</li>
      <li>As with many hair restoration products, this will work differently for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color also changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, if you are consistent with it and combine it with other stuff you should be able significantly reduce the hair loss to minimum</li>
      <li>At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops.</li>
      <li>It really has saved my hair!</li>
      <li>and I am expecting better results in future.</li>
      <li>He said that the first prevention to hair cure is to install a Chlorine filter after shower mixer as when we take bath, we absorb in the body a lot of chlorine from the water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure which product is most responsible for that, but I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>Tricomin is pretty much odorless.  </li>
      <li>no good, when you stop using l scalp is more oily and you lose a lot more hair.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s certainly stopped falling out.  </li>
      <li>After some months I always notice that the spray will either shoot a straight line of liquid or nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I got for my husband and has really boosted his confidence and changed his life.</li>
      <li>There are some situations where Revivogen cannot help much:  </li>
      <li>product works very well for me.</li>
      <li>I dont really</li>
      <li>All my existing hair has darkened, thickened, and become much stronger.</li>
      <li>I barely lose any hair now after a shampoo where before I would dread combing my hair out because the comb would be full of hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more sparse than ever, with a very visible wide part.  </li>
      <li>I emailed them and described the problem, and was told to wash every other day with a tar shampoo, but to be sure to continue to use the Revivogen.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;m growing more hair when I examine my roots, although that does appear to be the case, but if nothing else my hair is definitely fuller and thicker and small gaps in my hairline seem to have disappeared.    </li>
      <li>, I use the conditioner too, I am not sure if it&#x27;s any effective, maybe it helps a bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product and hope that, at a minimum, it can stop or slow down hair loss!  </li>
      <li>I know I can&#x27;t have grown new hair that fast</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if I have new hair growing in</li>
      <li>more thing is that in the first few weeks of each bottle each dose feels like it makes my scull/hair dry as if it&#x27;s more alcohol than anything else and later on</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>In Saudi Arabia, you will not be able to get it.contains small number of constituents rather than having composition of large number of chemicals.</li>
      <li>I have used Clearogen (by the same company) in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>The remaining hair is as soft and healthy as can be, and even adds a little body to the hair.    </li>
      <li>Where i was balding, new hairs have started to form.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have new hair growth</li>
      <li>It a very intense and proper care for my hair.</li>
      <li>Let me first introduce my case, I&#x27;m a 25-year-old male who started to lose his hair by the age of 18</li>
      <li>So, when I seemed to be losing more hair than usual, I ordered Revivogen.  </li>
      <li>At first, it was an annoyance, but now it&#x27;s a constant irritation.  </li>
      <li>However, if you attack your balding spots early, there could be a live follicle with just no hair coming out.</li>
      <li>the spray mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if you haven&#x27;t already lost most of your hair but you are in the early stages then this product combined with something like regain/rogain will help you maintain your current amount of hair or slightly increase</li>
      <li>, I started researching for something to regain my hair since a year, a year ago, I am 5A on the Norwood scale, which means my case is pretty advanced, specially at this age, I didn&#x27;t like to use Propecia, as I hear it affects male hormones, I wanted something all-natural, even if it means less effective, I picked Revivogen Scalp Therapy, knowing that a natural DHT blocker might help, I used it daily once, while using infamous Minoxidil 5% solution once daily, too.</li>
      <li>New hair is slowly coming in and my hair is more vibrant in color and definitely stronger.</li>
      <li>and I guess this is an action of Revivogen, not Minoxidil</li>
      <li>I completely removed it from my regime and my hair has regrown.</li>
      <li>Naturally, I saw two hair therapists for hair loss cure and a lot of research, I selected Revivogen for my hair</li>
      <li>Too early to judge if it will stop hair loss and help regrowth</li>
      <li>follicles(please find the review of HairMax Professional 12 Laser Hair Comb separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The strength, body and feel of the shampoo/conditioner is great, but the scalp treatment was time consuming, awkward, and seemed to have the opposite effect than advertised.</li>
      <li>This product has saved me from future wig shopping as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product along with Tricomin has made a huge difference in my hair loss condition.  I barely lose any hair now after a shampoo where before I would dread combing my hair out because the comb would be full of hair.  I have only used it for about 6 weeks but my hair seems thicker.  I know I can&#x27;t have grown new hair that fast but it still seems so.  I only do the treatment every 4 days and it still is giving fantastic results.  I cut and style my own hair so I can&#x27;t really tell if I have new hair growing in but it&#x27;s certainly stopped falling out.  The only complaint is the unpleasant oder of the serum but that&#x27;s a small price to pay  for peace of mind.  I am 71 and style my hair every day along with full make up. It&#x27;s extremely important to me to look my best at all times.  This product has saved me from future wig shopping as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I hope it keeps working.  I used Rogain and it worked for about 4 years and then my hair loss began again.  Try Revivogen, with the Tricomin.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> After using this product and then the shampoo/conditioner afterwards, I noticed that I lost more hair in the shower than ever before.  After a month I noticed visibly less hair than before I started this treatment.  The remaining hair is as soft and healthy as can be, and even adds a little body to the hair.    In all, I would recommend the shampoo and conditioner, but not the \\&quot;scalp treatment\\&quot;.  The strength, body and feel of the shampoo/conditioner is great, but the scalp treatment was time consuming, awkward, and seemed to have the opposite effect than advertised.</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT BUT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It hasn&#x27;t even been 30 days yet and already I see improvements in the health of my hair. New hair is slowly coming in and my hair is more vibrant in color and definitely stronger. I will continue purchasing Revivogen serum and shampoo even after I reach my ideal look.</li>
    <li> I have used Clearogen (by the same company) in the past and loved it. It got rid of my acne.  So, when I seemed to be losing more hair than usual, I ordered Revivogen.  Within a few weeks after starting it my scalp was itching and burning with pimples.  I emailed them and described the problem, and was told to wash every other day with a tar shampoo, but to be sure to continue to use the Revivogen.  After a few more weeks it was worse and I emailed them again.  They again encouraged me to continue to use the product.  So after 3 months the pain and itchiness was unbearable and I stopped using it.  Six months later, I&#x27;m still dealing with it, having gone to a dermatologist and had a biopsy done.  It came back with \\&quot;a layer of crust over folliculitis\\&quot;.  Apparently my scalp was so dry and compromised that follicular infection moved in. WARNING - If your scalp starts to dry out, STOP using the product, regardless of their advice - their goal is just to sell you more product!!  My hair is more sparse than ever, with a very visible wide part.  The product did not even slow down the loss while I was using it - if anything, it increased.  My scalp issues I&#x27;m sure have made the shedding worse on top of that.  I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on everything from mild and natural shampoos to moisturizing shampoos, medicated shampoos, aloe shampoos, aloe gel, prescription lotions, etc. - trying anything that might help to heal it up.  One prescription lotion costs $180 a bottle.  I research this problem incessantly on the web trying to figure out how to just get it to heal up.  Not to mention practically losing my mind trying not to scratch - my scalp itches 24 hours a day.  I also must mention that I had never before had any sort of scalp itching, scalp pimples, or dandruff before using this product.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this product. It really has saved my hair! A must have</li>
    <li> I have been having hair loss a lot. Every morning, I used to find hairs on my pillow and then my hair line started receding. Naturally, I saw two hair therapists for hair loss cure and a lot of research, I selected Revivogen for my hair therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First hair therapist I saw was a homeopathic doctor and was also dealing with hair loss issues. She told me to get an year supply of homeopathic medicines from her clinic and full payment in advance. She informed that I shall be able to see hair loss improvement in 6 months at minimum. Apart from this long treatment period, I was not happy with her advance payment in full for 1 year and so I saw another hair therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He checked my hair and told me that my hairs and scalp was full of Chlorine deposits. He used a digital microscope for the purpose to look at my hair and scalp and showed me my scalp status on computer monitor. He said that the first prevention to hair cure is to install a Chlorine filter after shower mixer as when we take bath, we absorb in the body a lot of chlorine from the water. This Chlorine is added in the water by municipality of city to keep it germ free, but is hazardous to humans and changes the taste of water to bitter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For prevention of scalp and hair from Chlorine, I had the Chlorine filter prescribed but for improvement in existing status of hair, he prescribes two items, Revivogen therapy and maintenance and HairMax Laser comb to revive the hair follicles(please find the review of HairMax Professional 12 Laser Hair Comb separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using installed Chlorine filter (in-line) after shower mixer and Revivogen, it gradually reduced my hair loss significantly and enough that I was not concerned about hair loss any more. In Revivogen therapy and maintenance kit, there is no \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\\&quot; chemicals that irritate the scalp, weaken hair follicles and strip them from their essential oils and vitamins. This SLS chemical is not present in Revivogen and also contains small number of constituents rather than having composition of large number of chemicals. With use, I have found Revivogen very effective and I recommend it to everyone suffering from hair loss. One important point regarding usage of Revivogen is that its usage may become an addiction. Once you use Revivogen for few months and see the improvements in hair loss, you would want to keep using it in the fear that you may suffer hair loss again if you do not continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Use minimum quantity for hair wash and then wash again with conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Hair Therapy: Use two droppers of Revivogen on your scalp every evening before sleeping and wash your hair in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you will find Revivogen very effective in dealing with your hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some situations where Revivogen cannot help much:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hair loss due to stress, depression, trauma and bereavement&lt;br /&gt;* Dead hair follicles&lt;br /&gt;* Skin diseases like Eczema&lt;br /&gt;* Hereditary hair loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Availability:&lt;br /&gt;It is available in UAE/Dubai, UK and USA.

    <li> I was somewhat skeptical about Revivogen Serum before ordering it - call it a healthy skepticism. I had already used the shampoo, and loved it, so this value pack gave me an opportunity to try the conditioner, which is also fantastic, and the serum.  I have been using the serum for about a month now and feel it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference in my hair.  I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;m growing more hair when I examine my roots, although that does appear to be the case, but if nothing else my hair is definitely fuller and thicker and small gaps in my hairline seem to have disappeared.    All in all I&#x27;m very happy with the product and hope that, at a minimum, it can stop or slow down hair loss!  The shampoo and conditioner are definitely winners as well and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Never noticed any results after a 6month program. Spend your money somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Let me first introduce my case, I&#x27;m a 25-year-old male who started to lose his hair by the age of 18, I started researching for something to regain my hair since a year, a year ago, I am 5A on the Norwood scale, which means my case is pretty advanced, specially at this age, I didn&#x27;t like to use Propecia, as I hear it affects male hormones, I wanted something all-natural, even if it means less effective, I picked Revivogen Scalp Therapy, knowing that a natural DHT blocker might help, I used it daily once, while using infamous Minoxidil 5% solution once daily, too. I have been using those simultaneously for 7 months now, and I can tell I have noticed differences! I believe Revivogen actually works, I am not sur eof Minoxidil worked or not though, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any new hairs, I only realized that all my already present hair started to grow healtihier, thicker and in length, I haven&#x27;t seen the hair at the top of my scalp taller than less than a centimeter, now it can go for 3 or even 4 centimeters long! and I guess this is an action of Revivogen, not Minoxidil, I am not sure though, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hairs, I use Revivogen Biocleansing shampoo, and I guess it&#x27;s good enough to cleanse, and has good scent, I use the conditioner too, I am not sure if it&#x27;s any effective, maybe it helps a bit. I totally recommend Revivogen, I will keep using it and I am expecting better results in future.</li>
    <li> Omg i love this product. I got for my husband and has really boosted his confidence and changed his life.</li>
    <li> Ive been using for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use, very practical, but does not smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Its working dor me though, so I dont really care.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoos smell very good</li>
    <li> After getting lukewarm results with Minoxidil (recommended by my doctor for pre-M hormonal hair loss), I&#x27;ve been using Revivogen in conjunction with NuHair supplements and Minoxidil.  Pros: I&#x27;m very happy to say, my hair loss has virtually stopped and that it happened almost immediately.  I used to lose handfuls of hair every time I showered (daily).  I&#x27;m not sure which product is most responsible for that, but I&#x27;m pleased.  I&#x27;ve been on my three-product regime for only a couple of weeks so it&#x27;s too soon to gauge hair growth.  Cons: my scalp is increasingly itchy and my hair is too dry.  At first, it was an annoyance, but now it&#x27;s a constant irritation.  I&#x27;ve decided to try Nioxin to see if that works better.  I also am not a fan of the serum.  I feel like I&#x27;m squirting furniture polish in my hair.  It&#x27;s super oily and smells like Pledge.  And because you use it at night, my pillow is starting to stink.  YUCK.  And -  you&#x27;d think with all that oil, I wouldn&#x27;t have an itchy scalp.  We&#x27;ll see how this other product works out...</li>
    <li> this product seems to work the best around the hairline creating new growth.  The chemical spray stinks, but if a person wants new hair growth, use it and wait about 2-3 weeks.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t protect colored hair from fading.  If they would put UV protectors in them- I&#x27;d use them every day!</li>
    <li> As with many hair restoration products, this will work differently for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem and why I purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27 with bad genes that just beg for my hair to thin and fall out. I started taking the Propecia pill at 17 and stopped a few years ago, switching to topical applications only. My hair was doing great for a while but I was diagnosed with Epilepsy, so between seizures, a ton of stress, and hardcore medications that also kill your hair, everything started to recede and show scalp. I was shaving my hair all the way off out of embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(June 6, 2014 - 4 months in)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works very well for me. I am currently on my 4th month of use, and my hair is coming back. All my existing hair has darkened, thickened, and become much stronger. I see much less of my scalp through my hair. Where i was balding, new hairs have started to form. I literally see brown sprouts of hair coming out of my skin where i was balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect hair to come and go as you use this product or anything similar. The process goes like this: Your hair is thinning and getting weak. It loses its color and strength, then starts to fall out and the hair follicle eventually dies. Once a hair follicle is dead. its dead, you will never regrow that. However, if you attack your balding spots early, there could be a live follicle with just no hair coming out. This product is supposed to help reverse that process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, as I used this product as directed every day, I now have a ton of baby hairs (Vellus hair, not to be confused with the peach fuzz all mammals have), growing on my temples. When I used to look at my profile in the mirror, it looked like my hair just stopped short about 2 inches back from where it used to be. Now, all of that space has hair that is getting thicker and more pigmented. If i look at my profile today, it just looks like my hair changes color at that 2 inch spot, but its there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that it continues to thicken and darken to match the rest of my head. I will try to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, people are commenting and noticing the difference. I no longer shave my hair all the way off, instead i have a nice buzz cut that I am happy with for my age and genes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It works! Best to use it soon after hair loss though, those dead cells are dead.&lt;br /&gt;-The shampoo and conditioner have a nice, natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;-The conditioner has a nice cooling feeling similar to tea-tree shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;-The price is awesome considering you get 3 months out of it (shampoo and conditioner too). Much better than others i have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As with all scalp treatments like this, the spray is kinda oily. I use it in the morning after i shower and dress so that it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillows while i sleep (The directions say before bed or later in the day, but i believe using on a freshly cleaned scalp is better for absorption).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this the BEST out of all the products I have used in the past; notable ones that worked (but not as well) for me were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nisim Scalp Treatment and Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin Scalp Treatment and Shampoo (System No. 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I also recommend taking a Biotin supplement, it helps your hair and nails and skin health. I use 10,000mcg daily.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  Only been using for a little while now.. seems to be working as described.  If I were to give on hint- use the scalp therapy serum before bed, as styling w/ product in is difficult :-)</li>
    <li> I had to used this product to stop my hair loss caused by [[ASIN:B002WUY8EK KERATIN Complex Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment 8 oz]] and [[ASIN:B001UPHQ7E Keratin Complex Care Conditioner (33.8 oz)]] and Shampo</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I found out it was actually the SLS (sodium lauthen sulfate) that was making my hair fall out. I completely removed it from my regime and my hair has regrown. Try buying Berts bees or any shampoo/cond without SLS for a few weeks before investing in expensive products.</li>
    <li> Used for 1 month. Like way makes hair feel and look. Too early to judge if it will stop hair loss and help regrowth</li>
    <li> Bad product didn&#x27;t do anything for me except for help lose more hair. At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops. I used it for 14 months with no results. Waist of a lot of money, if that&#x27;s what your looking for then this will do the job.</li>
    <li> Did not use this product.  I actually did a search for a specific product and did not notice this was not the product I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair was thinning several years ago so I did extensive research.  I found out Rogaine has bad side effects and I really was impressed with reviews on Revivoge.  I confess, I don&#x27;t used the solution often but I always use the shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t have new hair growth but I have not seen any further thinning of my hair.  After my research, I found using another product, a spray in called Tricomin, along with this is effective. Tricomin is pretty much odorless.  The stuff that comes with Revivogen has a strong musky smell so I would only use it before bed for overnight use.</li>
    <li> no good, when you stop using l scalp is more oily and you lose a lot more hair. I lost my hair and my money.</li>
    <li> It a very intense and proper care for my hair. All my friends recommended it to acquire for myself. I dont regret it at all.</li>
    <li> On behalf of my dad: this is a good product. It doesn&#x27;t do wonders, but is not totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;He asked me to buy another one, so it might have been good enough.</li>
    <li> I think the product is legit but there is something wrong with the consistency of the serum over time plus the spray mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if you haven&#x27;t already lost most of your hair but you are in the early stages then this product combined with something like regain/rogain will help you maintain your current amount of hair or slightly increase it provided that you use it for one full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed this practice for three years with 2-3 months breaks and my hair loss has dropped from 100+ per day to 10 per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is the quality of the spray mechanism is bad. After some months I always notice that the spray will either shoot a straight line of liquid or nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing is that in the first few weeks of each bottle each dose feels like it makes my scull/hair dry as if it&#x27;s more alcohol than anything else and later on it becomes too oily. The color also changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, if you are consistent with it and combine it with other stuff you should be able significantly reduce the hair loss to minimum hoping that in 10 or so years something better will come along.</li>
    <li> THE SERUM IS GREAT - THE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER - MADE MY HAIR STRAW LIKE - I WILL KEEP USING THE SERUM. B</li>
