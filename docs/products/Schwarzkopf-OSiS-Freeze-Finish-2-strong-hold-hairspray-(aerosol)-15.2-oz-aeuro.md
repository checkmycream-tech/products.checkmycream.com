      <li>I love osis products.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray, and I think I have tried every product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Love this spray.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gluten free which is important to me!</li>
      <li>Most important this does not ruin the style of the hair that you just fix it into because it just freeze what your hair deadlock in position..</li>
      <li>Is more effective than any competitive product and at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Works well on fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, flyaway hair and</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this product did not enhance nor hold my style.</li>
      <li>I do not believe this is a genuine &amp;#34;Schwarzkopf&amp;#34; hairspray.  </li>
      <li>cheerfully replaced an shipping mistake.</li>
      <li>I received this from Amazon in just a few days and the price was great!  </li>
      <li>Still the same great hold without turning your hair into bark.</li>
      <li>Hair is not too stiff, but holds the style perfectly.</li>
      <li>I find it very useful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super strong hold, but sticky at all, and you can still brush through your hair if you need to.  </li>
      <li>It is 100% original.</li>
      <li>I was pleased that it does not have an offensive smell, but much too sticky for my fine hair - will not purchase again.</li>
      <li>This hair spray is what you want on your clean hair when you don&#x27;t want to wash it every day…  Combe-able, shiny, where was I?</li>
      <li>You should clean the nozzle off to get the finest spray</li>
      <li>This is good, strong hairspray that brushes out nicely, but the aerosol dispensing mechanism is not very good.  </li>
      <li>Better really.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect when you&#x27;re curling your hair after curling a section, spraying it lightly to hold the curl, do your whole head, and your curls will NOT go limp.  </li>
      <li>it is not bad</li>
      <li>A bit strong of a hairspray, so don&#x27;t do more than one spritz if you still want your hair to be soft.</li>
      <li>Drys up quickly n hold the style in place.  </li>
      <li>A fantastic product that holds your style exactly where you want it.</li>
      <li>Works terrific and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a long time and have loved</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it a easy purchase for me.</li>
      <li>I always used the strong hold and was worried, but gave it a gamble because I like the product so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that we were recently able to find my wife&#x27;s favorite hairspray online for half-price of what we previously paid at one of our local salons and with free shipping too!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only hair spray that actually holds.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I spike my hair and this is all I need.</li>
    <li> good strong hold  will hold all day</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and find that it holds my baby soft hair very well.  I would like to be able to order a smaller bottle for packing and traveling; this one is VERY tall and can be heavy in small luggage.  Generally, though I really do like the product itself.</li>
    <li> works great! received the 1st one with no cap, and got a replacement within 2 days. amazing!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best hair finisher</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Great hairspray.</li>
    <li> Great product and value! Lightning fast shipping!</li>
    <li> cheerfully replaced an shipping mistake. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Best holding hairspray I have found that doesn&#x27;t have an offending smell. My husband tried and he loves it, too.</li>
    <li> Good product, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this is the best hairspray I have found for my fine limp hair.  It&#x27;s also kind to color.  Use sparingly as a little goes a long way.  I received this from Amazon in just a few days and the price was great!  I will order the Schwarzkopf color save shampoo in the near future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this brand of hairspray and I love it.  It really holds up to the heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray and got it in the mail really quick!!</li>
    <li> I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT THIS HAIR SPRAY LEAVES A BUILD UP ON MY HAIR. IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF OUR CRAPPY WATER(WELL WATER), BUT I DON&#x27;T REALLY KNOW WHY IT DOES IT. I LIKE THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES HAVE SUPER HOLD. I LIKE TO DO MY HAIR ONLY ONCE A DAY SO I LIKE A HAIR SPRAY THAT HOLDS UP ALL DAY LONG. THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT IS PERFECT FOR THAT EXCEPT IT LEAVES THE BUILD UP. THANKS</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> My fly away hair is more controllable.  The can is about eleven inches tall, and seems to last forever.  Smells nice, but not over powering, I have asthma and cannot tolerate strong scent.  I would suggest trying this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> It deserves a 4-5 star review, but I&#x27;m unhappy with the faulty spray nozzle on this can.  Every time I use it, the nozzle pops into the air and hits the floor.  I bought another product from the same manufacturer, that nozzle does remain on the can.  I do like this hair spray, it is strong- not a soft look- (the other strength I purchased does have a softer look) but it holds up very well if you need all-day strength.  The scent is more of an alcohol-based smell to me.  Others say it has a perfume to it.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product that holds your style exactly where you want it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This hair spray is best!! Used for years and love it!!</li>
    <li> Great hair spray, works well, very little flaking or residue.  You should clean the nozzle off to get the finest spray</li>
    <li> The guys who do my hair charge me 30 dollars for a haircut including tip and all. (Sheesh! $$$ I don&#x27;t trust other people to do it properly tho so every 2 weeks I need a new visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I always love the way my hair comes out. The wax/gels they use are awesome. I noticed this is their hair spray of choice and decided to look it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and it has been awesome. Not sure how much they would have tried to charge me had I tried to buy it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely recommended. I have been looking for good hair spray for quite some time and I found it.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this hairspray!!</li>
    <li> I like this spray it is a fine mist with good hold- I take off one star for scent- it is not bad I just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this product on every level.  The product did arrive on time, as promised, but the can had multiple dents.  The nozzle was clearly defective; it released a hard, straight, narrow spray (rather than broad mist).  The actual hold was medium and the spray felt heavy and pasty on my hair. I have fine hair and this product did not enhance nor hold my style. I feel like I got a different product than the one reviewed so positively in other posts. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product line - use the hair spray and mousse as have thick hair and sleek cut - need the hold and styling capabilities these products give me.</li>
    <li> Is more effective than any competitive product and at a reasonable price. Always available, unlike local stores which are routinely out of stockt.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I expected, easy to use and can hold hair firmly. Will definitely purchase a second one after mine is used up.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I took a chance. I used to use Pureology flexible until it was discontinued.This is not a flexible spray. Unfortunately, I have to toss this because it is damaging to my fine hair. It is &amp;#34;instant glue.&amp;#34; Very sticky without a natural look. I was pleased that it does not have an offensive smell, but much too sticky for my fine hair - will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great spray! I use it at work on my customers because it is workable and holds really well when I&#x27;m done with a style. I order it from Amazon because there isn&#x27;t a beauty supply near me that carries it &amp; I don&#x27;t have time to drive to the ones that do carry it.</li>
    <li> Has an unpleasant smell, I don&#x27;t even use it.  I love osis products. I think this was an old can. Disappointed</li>
    <li> bottles were loose in box but no damage. very little paper protection in the box so bottles moved around a lot.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this!  I have fine hair and it works great. This is a great price compared to what I paid in the salon.</li>
    <li> Drys up quickly n hold the style in place.  It is unscented which I love... Def gonna use this for my hair from now on</li>
    <li> good spray hair spray compare to the ones u buy at local pharmacies that smells toxic as crap.. This one was recommended by a hair stylist I know in the city..It holds hair really well, and does not make your hair look wet or stiff or leave any residue. Most important this does not ruin the style of the hair that you just fix it into because it just freeze what your hair deadlock in position..definitely a good finish spray.</li>
    <li> Never let u down, I have ordered this many times, hold your hair all the day, any style you want</li>
    <li> I do not believe this is a genuine &amp;#34;Schwarzkopf&amp;#34; hairspray.  I have been using this product for a long time and have loved it&#x27;s strong hold.  These last two cans I received appear to be made in another country, and the ingredients are listed differently.  Also, the size of the can is the same, but the weight is only 384 g net ( less than the advertised 15.2oz(430 g).  I have sprayed it repeatedly and there is almost no hold or stiffness to my hair.  It is like spraying water on it.  The &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deal is a great product and I am soooooo disappointed to have received these two cans that are not the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; product!!!</li>
    <li> Best spray for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used Schwarkoph OSIS freeze finish 2 for several years.  I have always been completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon.  Been using it for years (actually Fix 3), and it&#x27;s no longer easy to find in salons and beauty supply stores.  As others have stated I must reiterate: This is MEDIUM Control/Hold (Finish 2), NOT STRONG Hold/Control (Fix 3).  I always used the strong hold and was worried, but gave it a gamble because I like the product so much.  Well I&#x27;m happy to report I really don&#x27;t notice any difference!  (In case it matters:  I have a LOT of hair, but it&#x27;s soft/fine as opposed to thick.)  Still the same great hold without turning your hair into bark.</li>
    <li> Love this entire line of hair products.  The hairspray works great!  Hair is not too stiff, but holds the style perfectly.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray. Works well on fine hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend $25 for hairspray, but the reviews were so good- and I have very fine and hard to hold hair. This stuff is terrible, might as well spray  AIR  on my hair-- no hold at all..... This is the first time Amazxon wont send a return label and says  I cant return it..&lt;br /&gt;Im so upset, I may not order from Amazon again..</li>
    <li> Great product, hold well without making your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> it is very convenient. I find it very useful. It is good for keeping hair in position and doesn&#x27;t get very hard.</li>
    <li> Have used this product a lot, it holds great not always easy to find , glad  you carry it and priced a lot cheaper than to buy it at a beauty salon.</li>
    <li> This is good, strong hairspray that brushes out nicely, but the aerosol dispensing mechanism is not very good.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be clogged, just erratic and not of good quality.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so your average hairspray makes me break out terrible. the price on amazon was better than half than what I would pay at the salon. The OSIS freeze is a great product. well worth the money</li>
    <li> This is excellent hairspray and found I could purchase it from you. Thanks for making it a easy purchase for me.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is what you want on your clean hair when you don&#x27;t want to wash it every day…  Combe-able, shiny, where was I? IQ!</li>
    <li> This is great hair spray....well worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent, the best I have ever found.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> Perfect product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. I have fine, flyaway hair and this is the ONLY product I have ever found that holds without being stiff or sticky.  And it works the same whether in dry or humid air.  Will never use anything else--and I think I&#x27;ve tried just about all of it, anyway!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my thin short hair in place without being sticky or too weighted. I would recommend for people like me who have a hard time finding compatible product for thin and thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Holds really well and keeps some of the hairstyle even after sweating. A bit strong of a hairspray, so don&#x27;t do more than one spritz if you still want your hair to be soft.</li>
    <li> This hairspray was a least as good of their reputation. Better really. Soft, super hold. No overpowering fragance. Works in Houston humidity. Got my vote.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used; barely any needs to be used and it hold hair all day without looking like a &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. Very strong amazing for fine hair, holds curls, blowouts, etc. Does not make hair greasy or dusty. Have been using it for years it&#x27;s the only spray works for me I&#x27;ve tried every company out there.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray, and I think I have tried every product on the market.  This is a fine mist aerosol, and the hairspray is very light, dry, not stiff or sticky.  It looks natural and holds all day.  Most hairsprays work only a short time in my fine hair before weighing it down and just making it look dirty.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!  I have about 12 bottles of slightly used hairsprays of various brands in my bathroom if anyone wants them...</li>
    <li> Product I rec&#x27;d was perfect. Was not sure of product in review, diff size and description. Was very happy when product arrived. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and a &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; day is when it is &amp;#34;fluffed.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t need to use too much of this spray to get the hold I need. I also like that it has a neutral smell...not chemical, &amp; not perfume. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than some of the other hairsprays, but I keep ordering it because it works for my hair. I also like that I can brush through my hair at the end of the day and then in the morning re-fluff and spray for an even better style the second day.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray - you do not need a lot for your hair to hold in place.  It also does not leave any residue after you shampoo.  I pretty much stick to this brand.</li>
    <li> Holds the style for days</li>
    <li> I bought a Schwarzkopf OSiS Freeze Finish &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; while it delivered the Freeze Finish &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; which is also useful but not what I want.</li>
    <li> This is just the best hairspray ever and a great price too.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipment !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that we were recently able to find my wife&#x27;s favorite hairspray online for half-price of what we previously paid at one of our local salons and with free shipping too! For some reason, not very many salons carry Schwarzkopf products, but my wife loves everything they make and will not use Paul Mitchell or any other products now. Give Schwarzkopf products a try--You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  Yes, it is a bit more expensive than other sprays, but it leaves my hair soft to the touch and not sticky and gooey like some other brands.  It is the best value; i.e. I pay a bit more to get a better product that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Started using it at a salon then they didn&#x27;t carry it any longer so I ALWAYS stay supplied thants to this online source. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Holds firm in all weather. I don&#x27;t have to worry about humidity using these products.  It is expensive but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Schwarzkopf products. My sister has been a hairdresser for over thirty years and she&#x27;s used these products in her salon. This particular hair spray is strong though. I would recommend &#x27;pulse&#x27; sprays not just spraying your hair like you see in the movies! Hahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Deep South so with the humidity I need a good hair spray. I wear my hair short and  this hair spray does the job. I would definitely recommend it over many others that I&#x27;ve tried. I did try the Rusk brand and was disappointed because it had such a forceful spray.</li>
    <li> The spray holds my fine hair without weighing it down or sticking it together.  However, the can slowly leaks from the top causing a sticky mess at the base.  I keep it in a saucer. I don&#x27;t usually use aerosol sprays and this will be the last one.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this item.... it is bigger than it looks and I have no problem with it. Works terrific and I am very pleased with the product. It is 100% original. Would buy it again!!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, i don&#x27;t like the smell though</li>
    <li> such a nice hair spray</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than I can get it at the salon and with the same quality. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist swears by this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve been going to her for years.  I use her a lot to do my hair for photo shoots or events, etc. and my hair never budges at all! It&#x27;s a super strong hold, but sticky at all, and you can still brush through your hair if you need to.  It&#x27;s perfect when you&#x27;re curling your hair after curling a section, spraying it lightly to hold the curl, do your whole head, and your curls will NOT go limp.  They will stay full and beautifully curled until you wash it out (yes, I&#x27;ve sat in my same hair for days haha)  Great for any style, even just your general daily hair to keep it looking fresh all day.  I&#x27;ve never once had to touch up, which is great because the can is so tall, it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to put in your purse! Just spray it and go, you&#x27;ll never have to worry about touching it up!</li>
    <li> The only spray I use ... terrific hold, but stays soft after you comb through it, but holds</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> It even works on my wet hair! It holds the hair very well especially the front bang and my hair looks very natural. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very good hairspray and it&#x27;s gluten free which is important to me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. I like it so much.</li>
