      <li>I was so pleased when I received the package in the mail today!</li>
      <li>I wanted to try all of the BB creams, so the best and most economical choice was SAMPLES.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of bb creams and these samples are great to figure out which is best for my skin.</li>
      <li>I saw this sample pack available for a good price and it offered almost all of the ones I couldn&#x27;t decide between.</li>
      <li>It let me try out a bunch of different BB creams and find the ones that I liked the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very light on my foundation</li>
      <li>okay, no instructions on use.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad I purchased this sample set from Skin79.</li>
      <li>They also included a thank you note, which I thought was an adorable added touch.</li>
      <li>I feel that Misha was a bit thicker and covered better</li>
      <li>It was okay.</li>
      <li>While it is a bit thinner than the orange and gold, it matched my skin tone much better than the others.</li>
      <li>Have to say missha works better for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I would like to see more writing on each sample</li>
      <li>If I were not going to buy a full size the sampler helped me pick, I&#x27;d buy this again!</li>
      <li>The absolute best thing is how SOFT my skin felt while wearing these (any of them).  </li>
      <li>Great item to get if you want to try out a bunch of different BB creams to see if you like them :)</li>
      <li>good prices, unique products and fast shipping....</li>
      <li>They have so many, though, and it was hard to decide which would work best with my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin was smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs</li>
      <li>it also came with another free sample that wasn&#x27;t on the product&#x27;s page.</li>
      <li>My skin was smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs</li>
      <li>I will stick to tinted moisturizers because I like the consistency of those and prefer a light wash of corrective color over full coverage.</li>
      <li>Amazons original estimated delivery date was July 25th, but I just received it yesterday, and the order was placed  on June 28th.</li>
      <li>i am definitely a happy customer with my cute little samples of BB cream which i have been wanting to buy since ever</li>
      <li>I have more yellow in my skin even though I&#x27;m pretty light skinned so good thing they have samples.</li>
      <li>I ended out with purchasing the orange one as a full size.</li>
      <li>The sample of Skin 79 was good, although I had no idea which packages were what or if they were even different products since it was in Korean.</li>
      <li>Now I just have to pick one to buy full sized.</li>
      <li>I am totally buying the full size soon!!!</li>
      <li>The set includes two each of Super BB, Super BB Triple Function, VIP Gold Collection, Oriental BB cream plus, and BB cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is the very first review I&#x27;ve ever done on Amazon</li>
      <li>This one is by far my favorite and the one I plan buying the full size of.</li>
      <li>but I felt that this deserved the first spot!</li>
      <li>This really made it easy to figure out which formula was right for me and for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>I did ALOT of research online about BB creams and have discovered that the US versions that have become so popular are not actually BB creams but rather glorified tinted moisturizers.</li>
      <li>but the package seems to be pretty full of the cream though so</li>
      <li>Overall, the Pink was the best for my skin.  </li>
      <li>That was worth it</li>
      <li>It came in this cute pink envelope with a easy opening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been wanting to try an Asian bb cream for a while, but had no idea as to what brand I might like, whether they came in different colors etc, so I was happy to find this sample set.</li>
      <li>For those of you (like myself) who are curious about BB creams, this is an excellent way to get your feet wet without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>, it also made my skin feel nice and clean without the tight feeling.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend these for people with brown, tan, or more yellow toned skin.</li>
      <li>I ended up liking a different BB cream better.</li>
      <li>and I bought a large version of that.</li>
      <li>my favorite is the hot pink bb cream!</li>
      <li>Since all of these only come in one shade, this is a cheap and easy way to try several.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t have nearly as much oil control.</li>
      <li>It was in a pink package, and the bubble wrap contained all 8 samples in an adorable baggie as well as a sample of Milk Talk Strawberry.</li>
      <li>Misha had more a pink tint in there than 79 bb cream which made me look ghostly.</li>
      <li>Rated 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t really like the Orange at all.</li>
      <li>So, after doin research on all the different brands available, I decided to go with SKIN79&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get them to blend well and seemed to look very cakey and chalky.</li>
      <li>so I try to avoid it as much as possible but it did provide that great subtle shine you see on many celebrities on the red</li>
      <li>so I try to avoid it as much as possible but it did provide that great subtle shine you see on many celebrities on the red</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing a full bottle once I run out of my current foundation.  </li>
      <li>This one definitely was thicker and creamer in texture and the coverage was much better than the Hot Pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Orange: This one was great too but it made my skin have a slight orange tint, nothing oompa loompa-ish or anything but enough that you could see the difference between it and the hot pink.</li>
      <li>In my quest to learn more about BB Cream I ordered a few samples.  </li>
      <li>Could be because I don&#x27;t normally use any foundation and just spot correct with mineral powder</li>
      <li>but then it bubbles up on your face which is really fun and different</li>
      <li>But, since I&#x27;m 40 (yikes), my tried and true darn-near-waterproof makeup is too dry and cakey anymore.  </li>
      <li>The Gold didn&#x27;t last as long as the pink and the Orange faded even more quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am new to foundation and didn&#x27;t know where to begin</li>
      <li>Buy samples first and save a lot of hassle later trying to return the &#x27;USED&#x27; item!!!</li>
      <li>so far!~</li>
      <li>But it definitely surprised me when it came in yesterday!</li>
      <li>Try this sample pack if you&#x27;re curious before you commit to a full size of anything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always a bit cautious on using new cleansers because of my sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>its not heavy or cakey.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like how they all made my skin looked lighter than my natural skin color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally shiny</li>
      <li>The Pink did last most of the day, really only fading around 7pm or so.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well these bb creams evened out my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Plus: These ones were thick in consistency like the orange but gave me more of a yellow tint and made me look really washed out.</li>
      <li>The ONLY PROBLEM for this whole product is that the samples are alot smaller than what it looks like in the main picture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since all of these only come in one shade, this is a cheap and easy way to try several. There&#x27;s at least two applications worth of product in each one. I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;ve never tried BB cream, or never tried SKIN79&#x27;s BB Cream.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and missha. Have to say missha works better for my skin tone. This one has too much grey to work for me</li>
    <li> I did ALOT of research online about BB creams and have discovered that the US versions that have become so popular are not actually BB creams but rather glorified tinted moisturizers. Fans of the real Asian BB creams rave about them. So, after doin research on all the different brands available, I decided to go with SKIN79&#x27;s. They have so many, though, and it was hard to decide which would work best with my skin. I saw this sample pack available for a good price and it offered almost all of the ones I couldn&#x27;t decide between. I tried all of them and loved none of them. First, if you haven&#x27;t read about these creams, unless you have pale (ivory/porcelain) skin, this will not work for you. Second, it tends to be very thick. They claim to be lightweight, but it reminded me of a thick foundation. I couldn&#x27;t get them to blend well and seemed to look very cakey and chalky. Maybe my application was flawed, so I won&#x27;t blame the product, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Could be because I don&#x27;t normally use any foundation and just spot correct with mineral powder so i&#x27;m not used to that all-over mask feeling. I will stick to tinted moisturizers because I like the consistency of those and prefer a light wash of corrective color over full coverage. Try this sample pack if you&#x27;re curious before you commit to a full size of anything.</li>
    <li> I was so glad I purchased this sample set from Skin79. It let me try out a bunch of different BB creams and find the ones that I liked the best. I also got about 3 to 4 uses out of each sample. I also received 2 samples of BB cream cleanser which I LOVED! It is a gel but then it bubbles up on your face which is really fun and different, it also made my skin feel nice and clean without the tight feeling. Great item to get if you want to try out a bunch of different BB creams to see if you like them :)</li>
    <li> For those of you (like myself) who are curious about BB creams, this is an excellent way to get your feet wet without breaking the bank. And this brand gives you two samples of their entire BB cream line so there&#x27;s plenty to keep you happy. Also, a big shout out to the vendor Seoul Glamour for their lightning-fast shipping. Amazons original estimated delivery date was July 25th, but I just received it yesterday, and the order was placed  on June 28th. I have not tried them yet but will be back with an update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect way to try out bb cream! I recommend this over any other sampler. The seller sent this much sooner than expected, and even included a couple of extra samples not listed in the product description. Got about two to three applications from each little sample packet. If I were not going to buy a full size the sampler helped me pick, I&#x27;d buy this again! Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> you gotta try four different bb creams. A great set you have never tried skin79 bb creams as me and just want to try out each one a bit. I ended out with purchasing the orange one as a full size.</li>
    <li> Well i ordered my BB cream, i&#x27;d say about 2 weeks ago maybe? anyway the estimated delivery was supposedly anywhere from Nov 19 to December 7. [probably due to the fact that i live in Georgia and the product was coming all the way from Korea] so being the impatient person i am, it sort of disgruntled me. But it definitely surprised me when it came in yesterday! which was Nov. 8 2012. It came in this cute pink envelope with a easy opening. and inside was the cutest little thank you card for buying the product.~ it also came with another free sample that wasn&#x27;t on the product&#x27;s page. which made me even happier of course! lol :)&lt;br /&gt;So i am definitely a happy customer with my cute little samples of BB cream which i have been wanting to buy since ever and my little surprise sample. The ONLY PROBLEM for this whole product is that the samples are alot smaller than what it looks like in the main picture. :/ i&#x27;d say about half the size. but the package seems to be pretty full of the cream though so no worries there.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying from them again soon. good prices, unique products and fast shipping....so far!~</li>
    <li> I wanted to try all of the BB creams, so the best and most economical choice was SAMPLES. I&#x27;m glad i chose the samples because the BB cream i was going to buy was not the best one fo my skin type. I ended up liking a different BB cream better. Buy samples first and save a lot of hassle later trying to return the &#x27;USED&#x27; item!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like any.I have more yellow in my skin even though I&#x27;m pretty light skinned so good thing they have samples. I don&#x27;t like how they all made my skin looked lighter than my natural skin color. And yeah it does give it a grayish tint. Even though it&#x27;s suppose to oxidize it takes a couple hours for me to even notice. Even then I can still tell the slight difference. I&#x27;m not satisfied with the look. I feel that Misha was a bit thicker and covered better but it was the lightest one for me. Misha had more a pink tint in there than 79 bb cream which made me look ghostly. I had to put bronzer on to balance it out. It was okay. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend these for people with brown, tan, or more yellow toned skin.</li>
    <li> So this set of samples has great variety. I received the hot pink, orange, gold, and gold oriental plus for BB creams. I also received the BB cleanser and a sample of Aura Nymph Volumer. Here are my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pink: This one is by far my favorite and the one I plan buying the full size of. While it is a bit thinner than the orange and gold, it matched my skin tone much better than the others. Mind you I&#x27;m a blonde hair, blue eyed girl...that burns in the sun in about 5 seconds. I definitely have some redness on my face and dark circles under my eyes with horribly acne prone skin. It comes out looking slightly ashy, but seems to blend well with my skin color and didn&#x27;t make me look ashy at all after it was blended. I had to use a bit more of this one to cover up my blemishes but it made my skin look FLAWLESS and controlled my oil almost all day. I did use a small amount of bare essentials mineral foundation over it but only more to set the BB cream vs coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange: This one was great too but it made my skin have a slight orange tint, nothing oompa loompa-ish or anything but enough that you could see the difference between it and the hot pink. This one definitely was thicker and creamer in texture and the coverage was much better than the Hot Pink. I also used BE to set this as well but it didn&#x27;t have nearly as much oil control. I was shiny after about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Gold and Gold Oriental Plus: These ones were thick in consistency like the orange but gave me more of a yellow tint and made me look really washed out. It didn&#x27;t work for my skin tone at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB Cleanser: I haven&#x27;t used this yet. I&#x27;m always a bit cautious on using new cleansers because of my sensitive skin...I have a tendency to break out in a rash, so I&#x27;ll use this when I have a few days off when I know if I have a reaction, I won&#x27;t have to go out into public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aura Nymph Volumer: This stuff is great if you like the dewy look. I&#x27;m naturally shiny so I try to avoid it as much as possible but it did provide that great subtle shine you see on many celebrities on the red carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these had a great consistency and made it seem like I wasn&#x27;t wearing make-up at all. My skin was smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs (and I have horribly acne prone skin, especially on my chin). I wish I would have known about BB cream sooner. I was planning on buying the full size from Amazon but after reading reviews, it seems that fakes tend to be a common sale on Amazon. I&#x27;d rather pay a bit extra knowing I&#x27;m getting the real thing vs chancing getting a fake. I&#x27;ll buy mine from skin79northamerica.com.y so I try to avoid it as much as possible but it did provide that great subtle shine you see on many celebrities on the red carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these had a great consistency and made it seem like I wasn&#x27;t wearing make-up at all.

    <li> This really made it easy to figure out which formula was right for me and for my daughter.  Samples were enough for 2-3 uses each, enough to really consider how well the formula was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pearl formula is great as a skin highlighter, by the way.</li>
    <li> This is the very first review I&#x27;ve ever done on Amazon but I felt that this deserved the first spot! I was so pleased when I received the package in the mail today! It was in a pink package, and the bubble wrap contained all 8 samples in an adorable baggie as well as a sample of Milk Talk Strawberry. They also included a thank you note, which I thought was an adorable added touch. I am so very pleased with this purchase and it will be perfect to bring on vacation! I would definitely recommend purchasing these samples because you get to try 5 different BB creams as well as a cleanser!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so dewy finish foundation usually equates to an oil slick on my face. But, since I&#x27;m 40 (yikes), my tried and true darn-near-waterproof makeup is too dry and cakey anymore.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well these bb creams evened out my skin tone.  Overall, the Pink was the best for my skin.  It matched my skintone well (I&#x27;m very pale), evened out my red areas, and did not emphasize my large pores.  The Gold didn&#x27;t last as long as the pink and the Orange faded even more quickly.  The Pink did last most of the day, really only fading around 7pm or so.  None of them did anything for my under-eye circles, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to.  The absolute best thing is how SOFT my skin felt while wearing these (any of them).  I will be purchasing a full bottle once I run out of my current foundation.  Rated 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t really like the Orange at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of bb creams and these samples are great to figure out which is best for my skin. Keep in mind that bb creams can be wore by itself and it&#x27;s a great uv skin protector, which is very important for you skin. Some of the creams can be thick but a little goes a long way when you apply to you face and the product will last longer, even if their just samples. It does come with cleanser sample and it&#x27;s super awesome.</li>
    <li> I have fair, freckled, oily skin. I&#x27;ve always had foundations either be wayyyyy to dark for my skin, or oxidize and turn orange half way through my day. this sample pack is the perfect solution to my problems! my favorite is the hot pink bb cream! no orange skin at 2:30 in the afternoon! it matches my skin tone perfectly. its not heavy or cakey. and it photographs well! I am totally buying the full size soon!!!</li>
    <li> The sample of Skin 79 was good, although I had no idea which packages were what or if they were even different products since it was in Korean. That&#x27;s not really a fault though, since that&#x27;s where the product comes from. Works well!</li>
    <li> All of the colors were very similar and the amounts too much to use once,but not enough to use twice.  There are different types of BB creams in the mix, but the packaging wasn&#x27;t quite clear, except for the one for acne.  I would like to see more writing on each sample so you know what you&#x27;re sampling, and what effect to expect.</li>
    <li> okay, no instructions on use.  I am new to foundation and didn&#x27;t know where to begin so it is sitting in a box</li>
    <li> In my quest to learn more about BB Cream I ordered a few samples.  I&#x27;m very light on my foundation so each packet gave me several wears, but when I placed the unused portion in a plastic bag any that leaked out turned grey very quickly in a few days.  My sister borrowed one of the packets and used it in one application.  What I loved about this set is discovering the BB Cream removal.  That was worth it and I bought a large version of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try an Asian bb cream for a while, but had no idea as to what brand I might like, whether they came in different colors etc, so I was happy to find this sample set. The set includes two each of Super BB, Super BB Triple Function, VIP Gold Collection, Oriental BB cream plus, and BB cleanser. The seller threw in one sample of an Etude House BB cream as well. Every sample has worked with my skin tone which is very fair. I love them all! Now I just have to pick one to buy full sized.</li>
