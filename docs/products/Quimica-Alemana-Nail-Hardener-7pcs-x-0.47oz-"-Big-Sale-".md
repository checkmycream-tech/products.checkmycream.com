<li> My mom is from Colombia and she first brought this stuff back to the US a few years ago.</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t grow my nails but with this treatment I actually have to trim my nails because they get tool long</li>
<li> I finally have the long nails I&#x27;ve dreamed of.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;burning\\&quot; reminded me of the feeling I would experience after getting a new set of nails, it is bearable and not a huge deal.  </li>
<li> A lady at the Miami Airport recommended it a long time ago.  </li>
<li> I will continue buying and using this product as long as they make it, I am a customer for life.</li>
<li> but since this has formaldehyde one has to be careful with sensensitive skin.</li>
<li> Decided to go with my natural nail, they were weak and brittle.</li>
<li> Color last at least one week.</li>
<li> I started using Alemana and within a month/month and a half</li>
<li> My nails were always thin and fragile, I could never really get them to grow before finding this nail hardener, and I tried everything on the market.  </li>
<li> I apply it once everyday or every other day for about a week and then take it off and repeat!</li>
<li> I was shocked and amazed at the strength in my real nails.  </li>
<li> I was never able to make it through the \\&quot;grow</li>
<li> if you have thin nails, due to fake nails for example, you may feel a &#x27;burning&#x27; or &#x27;heat&#x27; on your fingers but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
<li> My nails are as hard as a rock</li>
<li> I purchased this product because I was doing &amp;#34;gel nails&amp;#34; at the salons and my nails got weak, split, etal.  </li>
<li> They were weak, chipping, and breaking which was never a problem for me.  </li>
<li> My nails were weak after using gel on them for years.</li>
<li> I have tried everything (my nails are so weak and they chip and peal often)</li>
<li> have now become addicted to it as well.  </li>
<li> and they haven&#x27;t broken.</li>
<li> I never write reviews, but for those woman out there who have bad nails like mine, please give this a try!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have ordered this product before, it&#x27;s the only strenghtner that works for my nails. I got this for all the girls in my family, as it works fabulous!!</li>
    <li> The best nail product I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping service and good quality.</li>
    <li> Definitely hardens the nails &amp; helps them grow. I did get the burning sensation when I used the hardner often. If I use it once every 5-7 days it doesn&#x27;t burn. Used as a top coat over my polish, my polish did not chip. Color last at least one week. Really like this product!</li>
    <li> The Quimica Aleman Nail Hardener is the best product of this kind that I have EVER used.  It took about 2 weeks to notice the difference.  If you will be faithful with the application you will be out of the artificial nails and back to your own before you know it! Plus you get a better price when you buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve used in 69 years that works. I finally have the long nails I&#x27;ve dreamed of. Follow the directions. Apply fresh at least once a week. Otherwise, like anything else, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My mom is from Colombia and she first brought this stuff back to the US a few years ago. I have tried everything (my nails are so weak and they chip and peal often) and this is the only thing that has ever worked for me! My nails are as hard as a rock and I would recommend this to anyone! I never write reviews, but for those woman out there who have bad nails like mine, please give this a try! I apply it once everyday or every other day for about a week and then take it off and repeat! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I love this produce. My order came on time. I did not have any problems with my order.  A great deal.  I will be ordering again</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! My nails were always thin and fragile, I could never really get them to grow before finding this nail hardener, and I tried everything on the market.  Now I am able to grow long beautiful nails.  I HIGHLY recommend this nail hardener.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was doing &amp;#34;gel nails&amp;#34; at the salons and my nails got weak, split, etal.  I started using Alemana and within a month/month and a half, my nails started growing stronger and healthier.  My nails are just beautiful and Alemana is also wonderful in keeping your nail polish from chipping.  This is just a fabulous product and would recommend to all who have problem nails and should be used for continued maintenance to keep your nails beautiful.</li>
    <li> Just as described and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Its truly amazing so good to I order for my wife , she is using this product from more then 5 years and is worked great</li>
    <li> Love this hardener.  if you have thin nails, due to fake nails for example, you may feel a &#x27;burning&#x27; or &#x27;heat&#x27; on your fingers but it doesn&#x27;t last.  As your new nail comes in you keep putting this hardener on and that burning goes away and your nails are really strong!  It&#x27;s worth every penny and it&#x27;s worth the wait for strong nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail product. My nails were weak after using gel on them for years. Decided to go with my natural nail, they were weak and brittle. A friend gave me this as a gift. AM hooked for life. Its the best product ever. My nails are strong, long and beautiful. Once a week is enough, it does not chip or fade. My nails are very long and hard as &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; :) On the first use it feels a little hot, but after a few seconds it goes away, not burning or anything. I got all my friends using it.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing nail growth and strength! nail salon ran out of this product and I found it here- I was thrilled and it was also 1/2 the price I was paying- so now  great nails and a great bargain.  Try this product- you too will be amazed!!  PS I LOVE Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I had a 15 year relationship with acrylic nails.  I was never able to make it through the \\&quot;grow out\\&quot; period to get rid of the acrylic.  I decided to try this product after reading the glowing reviews.  I have to say everyone was right, this product is a miracle!!  I soaked most of the acrylic off with acetone, buffed and filed the nails and started with a thin coat of this nail hardner.  I would repeat the soaking, buffing,filing and 1 coat of hardner every week.  After about 1 month I had gotten off the acrylic and had just my nails left.  I was shocked and amazed at the strength in my real nails.  I have shared this product with others and 3 of my friend have now become addicted to it as well.  I have bashed my nails on all kinds of corners and objects while cleaning and they haven&#x27;t broken. I will admit your nails will experience a burning sensation and you MUST not get any of the product on your skin. The \\&quot;burning\\&quot; reminded me of the feeling I would experience after getting a new set of nails, it is bearable and not a huge deal.  I will continue buying and using this product as long as they make it, I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff have terrific nails since using it...</li>
    <li> As a professional manicurist, this is the best nail hardener product I have used in my 25 year career.</li>
    <li> If you want healthy hard nails try this.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever tried! It even improves nail health. It takes a little longer to apply properly but worth the time! Definitely produces stronger nails!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! My nails were ruined after a gel polish manicure.  They were weak, chipping, and breaking which was never a problem for me.  I started using this after a friend recommended it.  It has fixed my problem and my nails are stronger than they have ever been!</li>
    <li> My nails have been breaking, peeling, cracking for years.  Now this product has healed them. I continue to use it and my friends are also using it at my urging.  We are all happy with the results.</li>
