      <li>It cleans my hair and leaves it fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>It leaves hair very soft and freshly scented, but for best results it is essential to remove as much product as possible from hair--especially from the scalp.  </li>
      <li>It dries so quickly and really gives my hair more body than regular shampoos.</li>
      <li>Love it, and with so little fuss to get clean hair!</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t even need conditioner or hair dressing of any kind when I use this, and my delicate, dry curly hair is in much better condition now that I only need to wash with regular shampoo and water once a week or so.  </li>
      <li>Hospital used this after my surgery, works very well if you thoroughly towel dry, may need to repeat if you have a lot of hair product build-up or very oily hair.  </li>
      <li>when she needed more it was hard to find and had to go without for a while.</li>
      <li>SHE IS USED TO SHOPPING AT THE OLD BRICK AND MORTAR STORES, BUT SHE IS LEARNING.</li>
      <li>It restores curliness to permed or naturally curly hair, but does not add body.</li>
      <li>Carry some in a tiny spray bottle and be always ready to shine.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does the trick and refreshes your hair nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t stay clean for an entire day, even if your hair wasn&#x27;t dirty to begin with.</li>
      <li>I used it at first without following the instructions and just applied it to dry hair.</li>
      <li>My 91 year old mom has been using this for several years.</li>
      <li>Takes much less time than a shower and works very well.</li>
      <li>I use it every 2-3 days when I&#x27;m out in the wild with limited water supply.  </li>

<li> Rinse\\&quot; in watery liquid form is tricky and wasteful to use as it squirts out and runs down a round-shaped scalp.</li>
<li> beats &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands hands down.</li>
<li> Does the job, but I rinse a little with wash cloths because it is concentrated.  </li>
<li> Use with disabled daughter.</li>
<li> (This product is superior though to the powdery scented sprays, which just smell nasty in themselves and merely redistribute scalp oil throughout all of the hair with the brush-out, leaving hair dull from the powder coating.)</li>
<li> Drying with a thick bulky towel may not work well for this.  </li>
<li> Failure to towel off scalp oil and styling product residue could explain the stickiness/gumminess noted by some reviewers.</li>

    <li> This was a lifesaver in my Mom&#x27;s last months. She could no longer get in and out of the shower, so bed baths were a must but couldn&#x27;t figure out how to wash her hair without soaking the whole bed.  This was the solution &amp; it worked great! Wish we would have found it sooner!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo when I&#x27;m camping or when I&#x27;m just in a hurry.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but I rinse a little with wash cloths because it is concentrated.  mix with some water prior to application and it is easier to towel dry out of hair.</li>
    <li> very good product!  Speedy delivery</li>
    <li> More cost efficient than the caps but cold to the head unless poured into the hands to warm.</li>
    <li> THIS&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT IS SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary for elderly persons who are invalid enough so that getting into a shower is only possible with help. No aide and you desire to spruce up, well follow directions and your locks will glisten. If it is good enough for astronauts it is OK for most all. It is perfect for a touch up when a shower is not readily available no matter what age you claim to be. Carry some in a tiny spray bottle and be always ready to shine.</li>
    <li> This product is a pure joy! Being able to have &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; hair, any time of the day is great! It dries so quickly and really gives my hair more body than regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> very good product leave hair nice and soft !!</li>
    <li> my mother is in a Nursing Home, so I have shared with the Nurses and they are happy</li>
    <li> It was for my mother and she was very happy with it</li>
    <li> MY MOTHER OF 80 WANTED THIS PRODUCT. I FOUND IT ON AMAZON AND BOUGHT IT FOR HER SAVING HER MONEY. SHE IS USED TO SHOPPING AT THE OLD BRICK AND MORTAR STORES, BUT SHE IS LEARNING. NOW SHE ASKS ME TO CHECK AMAZON FOR THINGS SHE NEEDS. I ALWAYS FIND WHAT SHE IS LOOKING FOR, LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND THE PRICES ARE THE BEST. WITHIN TWO DAYS WITH AMAZON PRIME IT IS AT HER DOOR STEP SHIPPED FOR FREE. CANNOT BEAT THAT. THANKS AMAZON FOR MAKING ME LOOK GOOD TO MY MOTHER.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this at a local drug store a few years ago for my mom who had undergone surgery and couldn&#x27;t use the shower. She loved it the first time. Her hair actually looks better when she uses it instead of regular shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.&lt;br /&gt;So when she needed more it was hard to find and had to go without for a while. I happened to check on Amazon one day and found a package of three for really the price of one bottle if I bought it in a drug store. Its a wonderful product and would recomend it to anyone with special needs or really if you just need a quick \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
    <li> Best no-rinse shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does the trick and refreshes your hair nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t stay clean for an entire day, even if your hair wasn&#x27;t dirty to begin with.</li>
    <li> I got this as was having surgery. This exceed my expectations. left hair fresh and clean. I use this product between hair washings and have even used it on my dog when it was too cold to bathe her. Love this</li>
    <li> I am not able to wash my hair as often as I&#x27;d like because the traditional shampoos make the psoriasis on my scalp flare up.  This is the answer!!  It does not flare up my condition and it leaves my hair soft, manageable, and most importantly, clean!  I would difinitely recommend this product if you are unable to wash your hair as often as you&#x27;d like.  Very easy to use...squeeze into hair, lather up, towel out.  (Hint: easily towels out - no need of rubbing your hair into oblivion)  Oooops!  Also smells clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> My 91 year old mom has been using this for several years. It really works! She has short somewhat thinning hair. It cleans and leaves a nice light scent. I won&#x27;t use anything else. No greasy residue!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 95 year old mom, it cleans but does not leave a shine like a real wash. It suds up like you should rinse it, Not sure if I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  it works perfectly to clean your hair without any water.  it is a lifesaver if you are bed ridden or can&#x27;t shower for any reason.  very convenient to have around.</li>
    <li> The best product in the planet, it really works.  When there is not the facilities to clean your hair, this product does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use post surgery, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  It left my hair feeling stiff and grungier than before I used it.  I was going to return it, but shipping costs are not worth it.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market for your loved one who is stuck in bed and can&#x27;t get to the shower/bathroom. Very essential and it has a nice fragrance and works well!</li>
    <li> Best no rinse shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Works well for days I am unable to shower.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great</li>
    <li> stuff works exactly as expected. beats &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands hands down.</li>
    <li> Hospital used this after my surgery, works very well if you thoroughly towel dry, may need to repeat if you have a lot of hair product build-up or very oily hair.  As another reviewer noted, it restores curly beautifully, so I started using it at home.  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner or hair dressing of any kind when I use this, and my delicate, dry curly hair is in much better condition now that I only need to wash with regular shampoo and water once a week or so.  Have tried other brands, none work like this product, could be used exclusively for a bedbound person or someone who cannot get in a shower or bathtub.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have to go somewhere last minute and realize that your hair is not as fresh as it should be. Takes much less time than a shower and works very well. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is the \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; used by NASA astronauts (very short hair).    This product should be packaged in a foaming dispenser!!  I have used this bottle to refill a Walgreen&#x27;s version of this product, no longer available, but apparently the same viscosity of this \\&quot;No Rinse\\&quot; formula.  Using \\&quot;No Rinse\\&quot; in watery liquid form is tricky and wasteful to use as it squirts out and runs down a round-shaped scalp. The manufacturer would sell more product if dispensed in a foaming bottle.    It leaves hair very soft and freshly scented, but for best results it is essential to remove as much product as possible from hair--especially from the scalp.  Drying with a thick bulky towel may not work well for this.  This is more effectively done on one&#x27;s own head, than on another person. Your fingertips must be used to meticulously massage product off the scalp and hair. Failure to towel off scalp oil and styling product residue could explain the stickiness/gumminess noted by some reviewers. It restores curliness to permed or naturally curly hair, but does not add body. (This product is superior though to the powdery scented sprays, which just smell nasty in themselves and merely redistribute scalp oil throughout all of the hair with the brush-out, leaving hair dull from the powder coating.)</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was some kind of gimmick and&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised but I am happily wrong.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom since she has limited mobility. It does a good job cleaning her hair with very little stress. This is a must have for someone who has mobility issues.</li>
    <li> Best no rinse shampoo I have found. I used it at first without following the instructions and just applied it to dry hair. It left my hair stiff and feeling a little oily. But when I applied it as instructed it worked wonderfully, leaving my hair soft, good-smelling, and looking very clean. I also found it good for perineal bathing if applied to damp skin/hair. If you try it follow the instuctions, mates.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried that is truly No Rinse Shampoo! Hair is clean, manageable, easily styled. Very pleasant mild scent. Perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> Great for elder care.  My mom loves it for in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Use with disabled daughter. Am very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I use this for both of my girls and their hair smells really nice. We don&#x27;t have to rinse it, just like it claims.</li>
    <li> This is great product for anyone who is incapacitated.  I used it for my mom after her stroke and bought this for my sister-in-law, who has chronic COPD and is in hospital with pneumonia.  Order came fast and was packaged securely.  Thank you.  Recommend seller and product.</li>
    <li> This is great! What a find for my husband who can no longer shower. It works as well as, or maybe better than, any shampoo ever. His hair is shinny, looks healthy, and smalls so good! This would be perfect after workouts or anytime shampooing will take too much time and effort.</li>
    <li> Good product for the occasional need to wash your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend daily use. It does leave a residue and makes the hair look clean but feels greasy.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this stuff.  I use it every 2-3 days when I&#x27;m out in the wild with limited water supply.  It cleans my hair and leaves it fresh smelling.  And, it helps to minimize the complaints about my odor from my wife when I get home!</li>
    <li> Indispensible stuff for a disabled guy like me, with a lot of neuropathic pain and spastic muscles, using regular shampoo and the gyrations needed for rinsing hurts. Love it, and with so little fuss to get clean hair!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and a good price. We use it to help a disabled person and it is becoming difficult to find this locally.</li>
