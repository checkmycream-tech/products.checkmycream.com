<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im not 100% in love with the LED lights, but they do their job. I don&#x27;t use the magnifier at all, its a bit too small, but the overall mirror is a great size.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup light i do wish that the magnifier was bigger or could mover more then just up &amp; down but i get the best lighting for my makeup and even doing my hair its a great size 8.5&amp;#34; wide and like 11&amp;#34; or so long so you get to see ur whole face and chest area or your head i do wish that there were notches or something to keep the mirror where i want it some time if i bump it it moves but the mirror is great the lighting is great all in all i love this mirror</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother ... Cheap !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size but the lighting leaves a blue cast on the face so it&#x27;s not the best to really see the true colors you are using. Other then that it gets the job done without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Big mirror, but the LEDs are super bright.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to cust reviews! TOTAL waste! The LED lights are exceptionally unnatural and I could not tell if I was putting on my make-up too heavily or otherwise. The *only* feature I liked was the swivel small mirror for amplification. I found the lighting to be very, very poor. My younger daughter has perfect eye-sight and even she said thought this caused unnatural distortion. I cannot understand those that said it is &amp;#34;too bright&amp;#34;-??! Also, once it is mounted on the stand, it is NOT easy to get apart for easy travel and packing. I would NOT recommend this mirror. Esp if you want a porable one for travel.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched and searched for that perfect make up mirror. I didn&#x27;t want to over spend either. I LOVE the TWO in one mirrors. I really like that I can swivel the magnifying mirror to the back, out of the way. The magnification is a must for us girls to get up and personal with that much dreaded close up though.😁 I like that it&#x27;s not this clunky plastic ugly $50 mirror, look around some of those mirrors are so expensive for an ugly plastic and it&#x27;s like are you serious?! It does have a plastic stand don&#x27;t get me wrong and Is it super fancy schmancy? NO...but comparatively speaking it looks good and I like the bright but not over bearing lighting. I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks now and it&#x27;s working out great. This was the best choice in my opinion of course that provided my MUST needs:&lt;br /&gt;1) Functional with BOTH good clear mirror AND magnifying in one, yet separate&lt;br /&gt;2) Good lighting&lt;br /&gt;3) Nice look&lt;br /&gt;3) Reasonable price!!&lt;br /&gt;There are some nicer looking good ones but are too expensive, don&#x27;t have lighting, don&#x27;t have magnification. All the others I searched lacked one thing or another. This for me was the closest and best option that had it all in one and gave me most for my dollars. By the way it&#x27;s battery operated which at first I was bummed about, but now I&#x27;m glad I have one less gadget to plug. I assume the battery should last a good while, I mean the light is only while I put on make up, or do my beauty routines, hair etc...but it&#x27;s not like I take hours doing these things. I normally don&#x27;t use it more then 10-20 minutes at a time, per day. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s average...idk? Anyway, so far so happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is my third battery operated makeup mirror and the best. The large size and magnifying mirror attached are just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  The mirror does not stay at an angle therefore I have to hold it in place while trying to apply my makeup. Would not recommend it</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE With this mirror. This is really a great buy! Best bang for your buck and if your into Beauty you want to add this to your collection. Love that it is portable and I don&#x27;t have to take up the bathroom mirror anymore! Perfect !</li>
    <li> Wish the actual mirror had a enlarger side and had a heavier base.  Tips pretty easily.  Otherwise it works fine.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it were a bit more sturdy. Other than that, the lighting is amazing and the mirror is perfect for a table top</li>
    <li> I would like this item better if the larger mirror had at least some magnification.</li>
    <li> Well, it IS portable, which is what i wanted. The light on this mirror is not very good. You put on too much makeup before you realize it. It doesn&#x27;t stay tilted very well. I do like the small magnifying mirror. It is okay for the price, it could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/27/2013 This thing eats up batteries quickly. When the batteries start to get weak, the lights will start to flicker and go on &amp; off. With fresh batteries, the lights are almost too bright. That said, it is still a good purchase for someone who wants to have an easily portable makeup mirror &amp; who knows the mirror&#x27;s \\&quot;limitations.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I rated my Vanity Mirror a 2 for 4 reasons, The screw that is provided, does not hold the Mirror in the angle or position that it is placed.  Mirror is Top Heavy so it swings freely back to its standing position. The stand that it sits on is not solid or heavy enough to hold the weight of the Mirror and finally,1 Bulb does not light up. Other then that I Love How bright it is and the size of the Mirror is perfect also I am very pleased with the 10x Magnifications Spot Mirror....</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome!  It&#x27;s the 1st battery one that I&#x27;ve found with lights actually bright enough to do my makeup.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a make up mirror for months &amp; I&#x27;m so happy with this one.  It&#x27;s huge compared to others &amp; the smaller mag mirror is so clear, as they can get blurry.  I see a few people posted about the screw in the back not being long enough.  I read the instructions &amp; used a screwdriver to finish the screw off so it&#x27;s nice &amp; tight.  Great mirror!  Better than some twice the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous!!! True studio quality lighting. Perfect for flawless application of makeup and accurate tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Magnification mirror shows so much that it allows you to see every pore in great detail- which can be scary, lol. Best gift she&#x27;s received in a long time because she actually uses it so much. When the lights go dim, a quick change of batteries brings the brightness back with a vengeance! Buy it now and you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> The bolt that the mirror came with was not long enough to go through and screw into the bolt to stay on. I figured something out to get it to work, and I LOOOOVE LOVE LOVE the mirror itself. Just really needs a longer bolt.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror but it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
    <li> Nice size mirror. I like how I can move the magnifier around. The lights are bright yet helpful.</li>
    <li> Had I taken the time to read the description carefully, I would have seen that this mirror is powered by battery only. I hate using batteries, but that&#x27;s my fault. It&#x27;s in the description. This mirror is very lightweight. The lights are very bright. It was simple to put the base on. I think this is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. Lighting is perfect, and the mirror is very nice quality. I am going to purchase one for myself!</li>
    <li> Goes through batteries to quickly. Otherwise, a good product.</li>
    <li> Mirror is perfect size and it is small enough to fit on your counter. Lights can be a bit bright.</li>
    <li> The size is big enough and I like the design but I don&#x27;t know how to use the little round mirror yet.....The lights are working good though it&#x27;s a little too shiny for me</li>
    <li> Pretty good. The little mirror doesn&#x27;t swing very smoothly. Could have been a little better designed perhaps.</li>
    <li> Quality as described.  The stand is a heavy plastic and I did not have any difficulty with&lt;br /&gt;the minimal assembly required.  The screw seemed to lock into place ok.  Love the&lt;br /&gt;size of the mirror and angle adjusts easily.  The 10x magnify mirror is small, wish it was&lt;br /&gt;at least 4&#x27; diameter.  The led lights are bright but not too bright.  Just got it today and pretty&lt;br /&gt;confident it will be very helpful in applying my make up.  Small mirror is great for tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Compact and probably could travel with it.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best 23.00 I have ever spent! No plug to worry about, beautiful bright lights, and it makes my vanity look awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to put close to where you&#x27;re sitting, so you can really see how your skin/face look without magnification, as you apply make-up-- and then, if you need it, use the little 10X magnifier.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror! I use it daily to do my hair.  I think the best feature is that it has a rectangular shape which provides more of a viewing area than the round ones. The lights can be a little distracting at first, but I either don&#x27;t use them or don&#x27;t focus on them when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update 12/29/14 - I have chosen to reduce the number of stars that I gave this product because, after a couple of months of use, I was unable to adjust the angle or position of the mirror and have it stay on its own. I have to put a rolled up pair of socks between the mirror and the arm of the stand in order for the mirror to stay in position.</li>
    <li> for my elderly mother, not easily manipulated for her</li>
    <li> This Jerdon lighted mirror is the shape of a tablet, very sleek and super offers a smaller magnifying mirror.  It is a battery operated mirror, its just awesome!  You have to assemble it yourself but really you don&#x27;t even need instructions to assemble, very easy.  The square mirror portion, can tilt, although sometimes it doesn&#x27;t stay.  But its very clear.  The actual stand portion (the white colored portion) is all plastic, I was consider getting the Conair three panel lighted mirror, but I am so glad I purchased this one.  It takes 4 AA batteries, I love it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely BEST mirror ever.  Super bright lights and I love the little magnified mirror.  The only thing I hate is it uses batteries.</li>
    <li> this mirror it&#x27;s great.  Light amount (cool white) is good. no heat produced.  height is also good to place it as tabletop and it will be perfect to do my long hair and makeup. The 10X little lens is too small.  I will get a bigger mirror and stick it to this little pc.. Quality of the mirror  is great  with no distortion</li>
    <li> Work out for me. I can use it anywhere in the house. Want to know how long it will last :) .</li>
    <li> Despite the bad reviews I thought I would still give this a shot.. Sadly I should have just passed and gotten something better!&lt;br /&gt;This is a VERY cheaply made makeup mirror, Not at all worth the 30$ spent!  Lights were so low that I had to be 2-3 inches away to see well.. The 10x mirror is useless! First off its cheap.. secondly if you even get close enough to use it the lights will not give you any light! Waste of my time/money and its going back right away.. Sad as I&#x27;ve owned other Jerdon mirrors in the past and they were never this bad!</li>
    <li> A good makeup mirror.  Lighting is not very strong but usable.</li>
    <li> Not too fond of the bright lights but it does help see the hateful chin hairs!!!!  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok, I expected more quality for the price</li>
    <li> I looked at every lighted make-up mirror I could find online, read all the available consumer reports on them, and finally decided on this one……I did a very good job!  I wanted something that had a large viewing area, LED lights so I did not have to worry about replacing bulbs.  I wanted the main mirror to be normal, not enlarged, but I did want an enlarged mirror for &amp;#34;hair tweezing&amp;#34;…I love how this one has an enlarged mirror that moves out of the way when not in use and that is right next to the regular mirror so I can look back and forth if I want to.  The on/off switch, located on the right lower corner of the rear side, is in a perfect location, easy to get to.  I like that the unit is very light, and doesn&#x27;t have a plug so I can bring it with me to different rooms (sometimes I like to put on make-up in the living room in front of the TV, other times in my bedroom).  Some reviewers have said they think the lights are too bright….I do not agree.  I think they are perfect.  You look right in the center of the mirror, not at the lights, so there should be no &amp;#34;blinding&amp;#34; issues.  Some people said they didn&#x27;t feel the unit is stable enough, I think its fine…haven&#x27;t had any issues knocking it over.  Also, the purchase price is very reasonable.  I bought mine for $35.99 + free shipping/handling.  I also think the tray on the base of the unit is convenient to put your eyeliner and mascara while you&#x27;re using it so they don&#x27;t roll off the table.</li>
    <li> This does not stay in place.  Always slips downward.</li>
    <li> I needed another mirror at my boy friends place &amp; searched through the &amp;#34;many&amp;#34; different selections offered on your site. I picked this one because its powered by batteries &amp; portable, the lite &amp;#34;LED&amp;#34; bulbs will last 10 of thousands of hours-something I didn&#x27;t have with my previous mirror with hard to find incandescent bulbs. Thanks again for selling this product. Hugs, Bethany.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a good mirror.  It works fine, and the magnifying glass is really nice because it moves to the back if you don&#x27;t need it.  It magnifies really well.  The mirror is extremely lightweight so you can move it around very easily.  I don&#x27;t feel that the lights do anything.  I was hoping to be able to see my skin more evenly because normally I have a window or light on one side so it&#x27;s not even.  This does not do that.  The lights (while bright if you look right at it) do not give off much light.  So you literally have to have another light on in the room which then takes away from it being even.  I like the little tray area in the front of the stand.  I put my tweezers and eye shadow brushes in there.</li>
    <li> Stop your hours upon hours if searching &amp; order this! I did a ridiculous amount of online &amp; offline shopping for a makeup mirror with great lighting &amp; glass that didn&#x27;t distort. I think I skipped over this one because it looked so different. That it turns out is a GREAT thing! No weird green/yellow/pink toned light for things like office, home or night. Who needs that? We have busy days! Who has time to wash your face &amp; reapply makeup 3 or 4 times a day depending in where you will be? Other mirrors had dim lighting. This produces a bright EVEN light on a large surface that allows you to see your face &amp; hair. It can be tilted to fit many angles &amp; just moving it backwards or forwards then tilting gives you a vast array of positions &amp; angles to choose from. The smaller magnification mirror than can be flipped forward when you need it is GENIUS for eye makeup application &amp; tweezing, or any close up magnified job. When you don&#x27;t need it, it easily flips to the back out of your way.&lt;br /&gt;Now. The lighting. This is a biggie and a possible deal breaker. I can say I suffer from severe migraines &amp; bright or intense light is a big trigger. From the other reviews I was afraid to order this thinking it would cause a migraine &amp; nothing is worth that pain. However, the other reviewers have my eternal thanks for the heads up!! When I switched it on the first time ( very nervously I might add ) I just told myself &amp;#34;don&#x27;t look at the lights.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t. I just focused straight ahead into the mirror which is VERY EASY to do! Keep your line of vision on your face and/or hair and the lights cause zero problems. I saw my first neurologist at 2 years old, thats how long (Im 43 now) and severe my migraines are. If I can use this daily with no problems I really believe anyone can. If you are somebody thats ultra curious and just HAS TO peek this isn&#x27;t your mirror if you are light sensitive in any way. But truly it is NO BIG DEAL &amp; NOT HARD to look at the mirror straight on. The surface is so big, the light so even &amp; bright, the magnifying mirror brilliantly placed &amp; distortion free once you find your sweet spot, plus the reasonable price add up to a GREAT mirror! I used it daily for over a month without reviewing and it&#x27;s consistently been great. I love it!!! Oh! Also, it is so lightweight I questioned it&#x27;s sturdiness but no worries there. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with tip overs or anything even tho my make up area is in a pretty high traffic area. Hope this helped, and I can save someone else A LOT of time I wasted!e is so big, the light so even &amp; bright, the magnifying mirror brilliantly placed &amp; distortion free once you find your sweet spot, plus the reasonable price add up to a GREAT mirror!

    <li> This is supposed to arrive with a screw or bolt to attach the two pieces and allow you to angle the mirror as well as batteries included.  It did not contain either, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a bolt that works for it.  I also find the LED&#x27;s too bright to look into the mirror.  I like the area to put stuff at the base, but the base is plastic and cheap looking.  The magnifying mirror works well if you get right up next to it.</li>
    <li> The LED Lights are very bright.  Clear image and is bigger than I expected.  It was easy to assemble and adjusts perfectly.  This was exactly what I was looking for and was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Had this for 6 months and now is not working consistently!  Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> I like its large, rectangle size. It would be nicer if it used cord instead of battery for power. I think this why the light is weaker than I think.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for what I need, a poorly lit bedroom. I wish the small 10x could be positioned where it does not get in the way of the bulbs on the side of the mirror. Also if the mirror could be adjusted up and down a bit. Overall pleased with price and quality. I&#x27;d recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just alright.  I think it looks and feels rather cheap (feels cheaper than it looks), and because of that I feel that it&#x27;s overpriced.  But it will certainly get the job done.  I haven&#x27;t bought a lighted mirror before so I can&#x27;t comment on how the light brightness compares to others, but I will say that it is probably bright enough for makeup application purposes.  I don&#x27;t find the lights blinding or particularly distracting.  The lights are cool in hue; they aren&#x27;t yellowish.  I like that the spot mirror can be moved out of the way of the main mirror.  One thing though, and this probably isn&#x27;t a big deal, is that the mirror won&#x27;t stay posed at certain angles, for example at the angle almost vertical and tipped halfway back.  The weight of the mirror will cause it to slide downward or tip backward all the way.  I doubt that that will bother anyone though because those are odd angles.  It will certainly work for my purpose which is to help me see everything while doing home brazilians.  Overall though, I wish it were a little bigger, or at least a little more solidly constructed for the price.  If your purpose is to have a nice vanity mirror, this will work and won&#x27;t take up much space, but I would still go with a nice weighted at the base round mirror just for aesthetic reasons.  I will update this review if I have any issues with the function of the product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  It is so light weight that I&#x27;ve even taken it on vacation with me in my suitcase.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love it, it has great LED lighting, battery operated ( two AA&#x27;s batteries ) with an on/off switch on the back. This light gives off more light than electric mirrors and yet it is not blinding. LED lighting use a lot less power than conventional lighting making the batteries last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a cord which would requires a outlet . Sometimes having a cord leads to tripping or pulling it off the table.&lt;br /&gt;The size is beautiful, it is not a six inch mirror it is much larger, the mirror it self it is 11 h x 8 w  inch&#x27;s, not including the stand.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great and you do not have to worry about it tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;The small  mirror on the side is great for tweezing and you can rotate it to the back when not in use..&lt;br /&gt;This is great for the price .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my great niece as a Xmas gift and she was completely thrilled with it.........just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> The led lights are way too dark.  After using this mirror, then seeing my face in daylight, I looked awful!  Went back to using my old makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> The ad did not say batteries required. The light is bright and everything works as expected.  But I would never have bought a battery operated mirror if the ad mentioned that.</li>
    <li> LED lights brighten up the canvas that is my face. The 10X magnify mirror moves up and down, and can be put behind when not needed. Great for detail work. Mirror itself tilts up and down. Would but 10 more if I needed them! Great value, great product!</li>
    <li> I got this so my dad could shave.  He is bed ridden now so this really came in handy.  He uses this every day to shave.</li>
    <li> OK - so all of the reviews you see about the LED lights being too bright - this think should be outlawed. Worse than the eye doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did: When I realized it would make me blind, I put little white stickers over each of the 20 lights and it is usable and provides GOOD-ENOUGH light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just couldn&#x27;t find even a significantly more expensive portable like this that was close to effecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money - DONT LOOK INTO THE LIGHTS DIRECTLY. Cover them up before you turn them on and you will say, &amp;#34;ahhhh, that&#x27;s what the reviewer meant!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this 4 months ago and after rarely using it, 2 months later  this product completely fell apart. It is very poorly made and I  would NOT recommend anyone to buy this! Sad Part is I cant even return it! Horrible! Will not be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> I have recently been on the hunt for a good quality, relatively inexpensive lighted mirror for my room so that I can apply makeup in the morning before work. I&#x27;ve never owned a lighted mirror before, and always just used a regular table-top vanity mirror with a goose-neck clip-on light. It worked fine for me, but I wanted something more practical due to limited bedroom space. After browsing Amazon for several mirrors, I liked the look of this Jerdon LED mirror the best, and bought it based on the high star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, the lights did not work at all. I tried two different sets of new batteries... and nothing. It was a small annoyance, but Amazon sent out another one immediately and the new one worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice quality mirror itself, and I really like the mini magnified mirror, but the lighting is just odd to me. It is EXTREMELY bright and distracting but is okay as long as you don&#x27;t focus on them. But the reason it is odd to me is that despite how bright the LED lights are, it still doesn&#x27;t produce a whole lot of light in the mirror reflection. It seems like a contradiction, but nevertheless that is what I experienced. The lighting is just not good enough for me to feel comfortable applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience some other issues people were having, such as the mirror not staying in place when tilting it, or the screw not fitting. I assembled it just fine and it seemed pretty sturdy to me, and had no problems keeping the mirror in place where I wanted it to be. This could have been a great mirror, but I ended up returning it to Amazon and kept searching for my perfect mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, I just want to say that I ended up purchasing about 4 different mirrors here on Amazon, until I realized that if I wanted a really good-quality makeup mirror I was going to have to pay for it. I just couldn&#x27;t find one bright enough for my needs, and ended up purchasing the SimpleHuman sensor mirror. It is very expensive, and I had certainly NOT intended to pay such a price for a mirror, but it really is perfect and I consider it an investment.It is very expensive, and I had certainly NOT intended to pay such a price for a mirror, but it really is perfect and I consider it an investment.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror.  Nice lighting.  My only wish is that the base would be easily removable for travel.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself works just fine but the lights are very dim and I have to replace the battery frequently. It is also hard to rotate/angle. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I went shopping again.</li>
    <li> This product works great and is very bright!  Perfect for the place that I needed it to be located!  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, although the smaller mirror works great, the main mirror is just not strong enough for my eyesight to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! All my makeup fits great. I love the lipsticks part.</li>
    <li> Really perfect and unique shape and the lights are extremely bright, but they flicker out somewhat quickly. Love that it&#x27;s battery powered though!</li>
    <li> Evidently I have hair growing on may face in places I shouldn&#x27;t have.  But see that is exactly why I needed this mirror.  The bolt is a bit short on the back but I&#x27;m sure I have a screw loose around here somewhere I can use or there is always Lowes.  The mirror is grate, good size, very bright, and adjustable.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite make-up mirror ever!!!  Seriously, if this product was made with a better mirror it would have gotten 5 stars.... but man, this really is cool.... It is battery operated so can be moved around... I have a make-up table and this works great...the magnifier mirror is so neat, small, so you can pull it out anytime for mascara, really getting the hair off my mustache and beard....I use one of those electric razors...so cool... Glad I purchased this....</li>
    <li> it works great and it looks great too.</li>
    <li> poor light and poor quality - don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> Love it Ease to assemble. Very light and doesn&#x27;t take up to much space. Would make a great gift !!!!!</li>
    <li> UPDATE!!!!    I finally decided to call the company&#x27;s customer service after 4 months.  They were awesome!  They said that it had a one year warrantee and they would just send me another one out.  I got it quickly and it works perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t blink, it&#x27;s bright and easy to transport.  I am in love with this mirror.... and the company.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.      Original review--I love this mirror for my travels.  I only have one complaint.  The lights seem to blink off when you bump it.  I don&#x27;t know if mine is just defective, but that&#x27;s the only problem.  It is perfect otherwise.</li>
    <li> I was sold on this mirror by the fact that it had the added spot mirror.  After sticking spot mirrors all over my mirrors for years, this seemed like someone finally had come up with a solution.  However  this mirror runs on batteries only, and the light quickly dims due to this.  Great idea if it had the option to plug it into an outlet. Had to return and bought another makeup mirror and just stuck a spot mirror on the side of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over a year now and it still working just fine. I only turn the lights on when necessary because they are rather bright. But overall this mirror combo is great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is incredible and is just what I wanted. The 10X magnifier is such a plus and is great for close ups especially of your eyebrows. It is the perfect size and fits perfectly on my small makeup table and will be great to travel with. It takes 4 AA batteries which I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I ordered it although I probably just didn&#x27;t fully read the description so be prepared when it arrives. Assembly is easy and if I can do it anyone who has a Phillips screwdriver can do it. Only 1 screw to affix, pop the bottom in, batteries and turn it on. Because the mirror is only on a short period of time each day I am pretty sure the batteries will last a very long time. I would recommend this mirror to anyone and the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was getting frustrated trying to find a decent make up mirror for my camper van...too small, too big, not enough light, no light, no magnification...AUGHHHH.  I stumbled across this while doing yet another search and chanced it.  It&#x27;s PERFECT!!  Battery powered, well lit with LED lighting and the magnification add on is easy to move.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and I&#x27;m very pleased with this mirror&#x27;s performance!  Think I might get one for home as well.</li>
    <li> Best mirror I have had in years!</li>
    <li> Bright and nice,  was looking for a good makeup mirror..</li>
    <li> How this mirror could even get 3 stars is beyond me! After looking and looking, I finally came across it at the store, came home assembled it in less than 5 minutes and I am IN LOVE!!! Lights are bright and perfect! Really shows the entire face very well. It does require 4 AA batteries which I prefer over electric, dealing with long chords etc.! Overall it&#x27;s AMAZING.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good product. I hadn&#x27;t realized that it was battery operated. I don&#x27;t know if it is too late, but I am going to return it. I need an electric powered makeup mirror that stays bright!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel or on your counter....base is a little cheesy but overall great for travel.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is very light in weight, And it does run on batteries (only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is big. The thin (in depth) mirror is 8 x 11&amp;#34;, but the whole shebang is just barely under 13&amp;#34; tall. Unless I remove the pedestal part from the mirror and repackage it with bubble wrap in the original box, I just don&#x27;t see this travelling well in my suitcase. I would be shocked if the mirror survived airline baggage handlers. Takes up too much precious room in the carry on, so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another Jerdon mirror, also labeled portable (also on Amazon), which I took on my last vacation. It doesn&#x27;t use batteries, but it is smaller overall, and thicker/sturdy and I packed it in with my clothes with no worries. I think I will continue to use it for vacations, and instead use this mirror for at home, where I think I will actually like it better since the mirror part is considerably bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lights will take some getting used to, but I think they present a realistic look for applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to see the 10x round mirror have a 5x mirror on the back so you could flip to whichever you like better. To be fair, I have a small 5x, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m not used to seeing my wrinkles quite so close-up-- where did they come from anyway? I swear they weren&#x27;t there this morning!  I imagine I&#x27;ll get used to that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but I am disappointed because I thought this would be a better travel mirror than the one I have, so 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This was a very poor purchase. The light switch doesn&#x27;t work well and the lights won&#x27;t stay on. It is poorly made.</li>
    <li> The lights flicker on and off all the time, even with brand new batteries. At this point it&#x27;s just a mirror that stands up.</li>
    <li> This is a great size mirror but the light feature is completely useless to me because its cool lights when warmer lighting would be better for my skin tone</li>
    <li> I love the mirror, perfect size, but I can buy a mirror for a few bucks.  I bought it for the illuminated view in order to apply my make-up.  As the illumination only lasted for about a month, I&#x27;m now left with a mirror that doesn&#x27;t light, not really all that helpful.  So, more wasted money.  Trying to figure out how to contact the seller in order to discuss this issue and see what we can do about it, but navigating around to figure out how to talk to someone is not as easy as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Yes this mirror is bright!  but bright is what I wanted...  just do not look directly at the lights and focus on your reflection. I wanted something portable so i didn&#x27;t have to mess with cords. I use this mirror 1 to 2 times a day and have not had to change the batteries yet (I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month). It&#x27;s a nice big size</li>
    <li> The lighting was great, and I looked forward to having a mirror with great lighting in order to best apply my makeup.  Well, after a few months, the light stopped working.  I changed the batteries, and nothing happened.  So now, it&#x27;s just a regular vanity mirror which I could have purchased for way less than $30.</li>
    <li> love this little mirror. It&#x27;s clear, but I wish the lights were brighter. for the price, I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> gets the job done, not the best quality. Would be nice it is was a plug in, otherwise make sure you invest in some rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured, girlfriend loves using it. The lights are bright and light up face well. Only problem is the 10x mirror is blurry and not used as often.</li>
    <li> The base is made of flimsy plastic. I expected something sturdier. The 10x mirror is too small to be useful. I have to squint to see the image.</li>
    <li> The mirror provides a great close-up on your face, but I have found the lights to be pretty useless. I usually end up turning on the overhead light when applying makeup because this one does not light up the face enough to apply makeup well.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Did not tilt like it was supposed to. Thought the first one I got was broken so I exchanged it, that one didn&#x27;t work either!!</li>
    <li> Wish this would have worked but the light is not good. It&#x27;s not nearly bright enough and has a strange blue/greyish tint to it.</li>
    <li> i wish the light was more yellow toned than the B R I G H T blue hue that it is currently. i love the size of the mirror, but sheesh! i need to wear sunglasses to look at this thing.</li>
    <li> The light that was already not that bright, but was JUST bright enough, quickly dimmed to a level providing no value what-so-ever.  One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon.</li>
    <li> Attractive mirror, but unless you are in a completely dark room, you would never be able to tell the lights are on. Way too dim and the cool coloring of them is not flattering.</li>
    <li> Ok so I won&#x27;t lie to you. This is a very good product. .. for the first week. The battery dies so quickly that you spend more money  on batteries than you do on the bloody mirror. And the worst part is they don&#x27;t even give you any instructions on how to put the mirror together. Yeah, you have to set up yourself. I don&#x27;t think they realise that there are people out there like me whos brain just doesn&#x27;t understand how to set up things. But besidrs that, it works ok i suppose.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My wife uses it daily and really likes it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Mirror stays no matter which way you tilt it. Can&#x27;t imagine how it could be improved. Well worth the price and way better than all of the mirrors that they have in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond that are way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Awesome. This mirror is light weight but sturdy. The lights work well. I love the swing around magnifying mirror. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! I feel like a Hollywood star!  The lights are bright and do not get too warm.  The size is great and cannot beat the price for this product.  The magnifying mirror is awesome.  Perfect for a closet shelf or on the counter.</li>
    <li> I liked this mirror as far as the shape, large area, additional magnification option but the lights were just to harsh. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll be sending it back to look for something similar but with more natural lighting for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> The mirror meet my expectation.  and I wish it can be improved if there is a rotating stopper at the neck joint.</li>
    <li> this mirror is just okay. the LED lights are super bright and it is almost uncomfortable to do your make up with the lights on. it is good for when you need to see something very close up on your face, but just for everyday make up i would not recommend this mirror, also i could never get the mirror to stay in the upright position. it always seemed to fall back down whenever i would position it in the place that i wanted it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for months now and it&#x27;s still working great.  The lights are a little too bright for me because I&#x27;m sensitive to light so I just stuck some stickers over some if the lights  I really like how light weight it is and that you can bend the base all the way back so it can sit on my bed without tipping over. The little magnification mirror is nice to have for plucking eye brows but I rarely use it. I don&#x27;t recommend picking it up with the metal bar that the little magnification mirror is on because it will eventually come out but you can just stick the metal piece back in when it does. I&#x27;ve dropped mine on the carpet several times and it&#x27;s still fine. I really like that it takes batteries and doesn&#x27;t need a cord. You don&#x27;t have to change the batteries very often either.  It takes 4 AA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Works well, lights are very very bright. My complaint is that the screw that holds the mirror on to the stand is as tight as it will go yet my mirror will still tip all the way forward at the slightest hump.</li>
    <li> The 10x mirror is very small and you must be very close to use it. The lights were VERY bright at first, but then they started to flicker (even with new batteries.) Within a couple weeks it didn&#x27;t stay bright and it was like putting on your makeup with a night light. So I returned it.</li>
    <li> I WANT to love this mirror, it is the perfect size, look,  love the tray and the mag mirror, but the damn thing does not tip at all.  Either stands fully upright or slams down to the bottom.  Tough to apply mascara when you&#x27;re using one hand to balance the damn thing!  I have tried to screw in tight, but then the tilt bar just falls our and spills everything.  Why is this so?  Does anyone know the number of customer service or how to fix?  It is a source of great unnecessary frustration as I&#x27;m rushing out the door and I&#x27;m about to throw it out the window!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great for me. The lighting is even and the little mirror is handy.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. She loved it!! Just the right size!</li>
    <li> light is brite stays cool, just wish it had a reversible magnified side the same size as the front. the magnified mirroe is just so small and when you bring it around front the mirroe falls downward. I have another make-up mirror that is great magnified side , I use both.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for</li>
    <li> Lighting is great, my makeup application has been easier and better than ever. I can literally do my makeup in the dark now.</li>
    <li> The white plastic looks very cheap, and the light is so unnatural. It casts a bluish tint on face, which is odd. Am looking for another option.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Only dislike is that the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay in place at an angle, which means unless I prop it against something or sat in on a high counter, I have to lean low to see myself.</li>
    <li> The reviews were right. The mirror does not stay up at the lowest tilt which is frustrating since that is what I seem to use the most. The lights are bright... so dont look at them... look at yourself. Works good, I have had it for months and batteries are lasting great.</li>
    <li> The mirror you love to hate. This is amazing, you can see EVERYTHING. Fast delivery, great packaging. Very smooth transaction</li>
    <li> This is pretty wonderful. It looks a bit cheap because of a really blatant white plastic frame that isn&#x27;t making any effort to look better than that. However the mirror is wonderful. I&#x27;m thinking about how to kill that base. Hmm.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lighting. A must have. Just wish it had a plug instead of using batteries.</li>
    <li> Love it. Only issue is the screw doesn&#x27;t keep the mirror sturdy. So the slightest touch of the mirror causes it to drop all the way down.</li>
    <li> My search is over!!! Finally found exactly what I was looking for, sleek, bright and modern looking mirror. Love the LED lighting and the mirror is a perfect size, I&#x27;m makeup artist so this mirror is outstanding for makeup application.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. She moves around her home to put on makeup so needed something highly portable. Very cool appearance. Bought her rechargeable batteries with a charger so she won&#x27;t run out of light.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new makeup mirror and I saw this one and decided to order it.  I just got this about an hour ago, and as soon as I opened it I was amazed... however I put batteries in it, turned it on and.... HALF of the lights are not turning on!!!! UGH&lt;br /&gt;So it is an amazing MIRROR however I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you truly want a lighted mirror... disappointed it doesn&#x27;t work :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace my Jerdon tri-fold lighted mirror (http://www.amazon.com/Jerdon-JGL9W-Tri-Fold-Magnification-Settings/dp/B0000AFUT3/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1437512855&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;jerdon+three), which suddenly died after seven years. I wanted to stick with the Jerdon brand, because my mom and I have owned Jerdon mirrors for decades and generally have been pleased with their quality and performance. (I of course would have loved it if my tri-fold mirror had lasted longer than seven years, but I used it almost every day over those seven years, and all products have a limited lifespan.) I didn&#x27;t feel the need to get another tri-fold mirror, as I found I didn&#x27;t use the different light settings or the side mirrors much, but I still was looking for excellent lighting and some degree of magnification. A few weeks into owning this Jerdon mirror, I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The lighting is some of the best and brightest I&#x27;ve seen in makeup mirrors I&#x27;ve tested (and I&#x27;ve tested quite a number of them), and I don&#x27;t find it blinding, as some other reviewers have. I can see my face clearly, and the amount of magnification in the little round mirror is perfect for close work like plucking eyebrows. The large size of the rectangular mirror is great for seeing all of my face and hair, and the angle/tilt adjusts easily and securely, keeping the mirror stable.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sit well, always tipping forward. Lights are too dim to use with close-up mirror.</li>
    <li> Would be great if it would stay tight.  The screw doesn&#x27;t hold the mirror in place.  Every time I barely tough it the mirror falls flat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use when applying makeup in a closet space with no electricity.  It is placed on a shelf at shoulder-level, so I needed a mirror with a short stand.  This mirror was inexpensive compared to some of the more elegant, metal mirrors and so I was not surprised that is is a fairly inexpensive, plastic frame.  If it were not for the LEDs, I think this would be a product in the $12-15 quality range. But the LEDs cost money, so I think the price I paid of $28 was fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 11&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34; rectangle seems huge compared to the little 6&amp;#34; round I had been using prior.  I love how large the viewing area is.  The LEDs are a bright, white light.  It is not quite as soft as daylight and not quite as harsh as fluorescent office lighting, but in between those two.  I really like it, it works well for me and I am normally in a space with natural, incandescent lighting or daylight all day.  The LEDs which span the outline of the frame are a bit distracting at first, it almost has the feel of a light shining right in your eyes.  They are bright and you have to get used to not looking at them.  I just focus on my face in the center and now I don&#x27;t notice them as much. If you have sensitive eyes, you would probably want to spend more money for one with more diffused light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toggle switch to turn the light on/off is on the back right corner, so you reach up with your right hand and flip it unseen.  It is quite easy.  They lights are immediately on and bright, no warm-up time required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification mirror is awesome. It is 3&amp;#34; in diameter and they say 10x.  I can&#x27;t speak to the accuracy of the power because I don&#x27;t have another mirror to which to compare.  It is attached with a sleeve to a metal bar that swivels to the front or back of the mirror.  It can move up and down on the bar, so you can adjust it to exact height you want.  I only use it once a week or so for plucking, so it is no problem for me to swivel it on its frame to the front to use and then swivel it back afterward so it is not in the way of my viewing area on a daily basis.  I really like how it is not permanently mounted to the front of the mirror so that when I don&#x27;t need it I don&#x27;t have that distraction in my viewing area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base of the frame has an indented area to hold some small items.  I use it to place my eye glasses when I apply.  The base holds the mirror well, it has never tipped over on me, but it is lightweight.  I imagine that if placed at counter height in a high-traffic area it would tip over if bumped.  The tilt feature works well, I use it daily and it is easy to tilt and stays in place well.frame to the front to use and then swivel it back afterward so it is not in the way of my viewing area on a daily basis.

    <li> This mirror gives great light and is the perfect size and the additional 10x mirror is perfect for precise applications and moves out of the way when not in use.</li>
    <li> It is a good mirror. The lights fused on mine within a few months. So now its just a mirror, not a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, very brightly lighted mirror! Love the extra magnified mirror that can stay on the front or be moved out of the way! Good buy</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  This is a very cheap, poorly made mirror.  Also has bad lighting.  It doesn&#x27;t adjust, you have to pick it up!  The magnifier is practically useless.  I was not happy with this purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else.</li>
    <li> Lights are almost too laser like. It is not very good except if you use the tiny magnifying glass. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I am very particular about quality of craftsmanship. However in this case, the flimsy frame and plastic base, are more than overcome by the magnificent quality of the lighting and the magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> Not as well made as I would have liked for the price.  Lights are not real bright and its BATTERY operated..boo.</li>
    <li> I had several regular plug in lighted mirrors but the light bulbs would burn out and the switches would break. I read the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. Yes it is super bright almost blinding at first but eventually you get use to it. I&#x27;m hoping the Led light will last longer. Also nice not to have more cords on the counter. This is battery operated. So far I really like!!</li>
    <li> I use this mirror to put my makeup on every day.  I love the small magnified mirror attached to it.  The lighting isn&#x27;t the best but I don&#x27;t usually need it.</li>
    <li> OMG I absolutely love this mirror. I thought the 11 by 8 mirror would be to small but its not. I can see my whole head and even my big hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights are a bit too bright but I suppose its for make up application, eye brow plucking and pimple popping (dont front like yall dont pop pimples). I mainly use this mirror for fixing my hair and doing my eyebrows. So its perfect for me. Love the little tray at the base I can just stick my tweezers or hair pins there for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get a vanity table but since I have this Ill just use it at my desk.</li>
    <li> Really bright lights on this thing. Surprising with using 4 AA&#x27;s. Wife loves it and how mobile it is as well.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as a 15X magnifier but is only 10X.</li>
    <li> This mirror Is good. But not what I was looking for I wanted a plug-in mirror not one that ran on batteries but it still look nice and very functional</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. It&#x27;s the perfect size and I love the lights. The only downside is that sometimes it wont stay in the position I wanted to be, but other than that I really like it.</li>
    <li> Had this mirror for a awhile now and love it! Bright clean light and little magnification mirror makes it so easy to remove make up even after you remove your contacts. My mirror would not stay at certain angle, so I had to tape a match box to the back, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me. My only complain is no AC adapter, but rechargeable batteries help, though a have to charge them every 5 days or so.</li>
    <li> Cheep, tacky looking stand, the lights aren&#x27;t nearly bright enough to be much help if you&#x27;re trying to put on makeup in a low light situation.</li>
    <li> My GF loves it the tiny precision mirror is prefect for when she needs it and really moved out of the way when not need.her only concern as of now it&#x27;s that the big mirror doesn&#x27;t rotate. When she is using it and it has items in the bottom, when she shifts in either direction she ends up having to move the entire mirror and reajusting it. She does love the brightness of the LED bulbs which helps to lighten up the room unfortunately the tint makes the shades of colors look different so she usually doesn&#x27;t use the light which was the whole point behind getting this light.</li>
    <li> I love it just what I ordered</li>
    <li> Returned this item when I received it. One of the pieces was missing. Wasn&#x27;t crazy about it any way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for one month &amp; have changed the batteries 3 times!!&lt;br /&gt;light is perfect the first day, then it begins to fade....fast</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a makeup mirror with reasonable price but didn&#x27;t want to go with the small 6&#x27;&#x27; oval mirrors. This one offer big clear view and the lights are bonus. The big mirror is clear and nice. The light is very bright. My only complaint would be that you need to get very close to the small 10X mirror to have good vision, otherwise it&#x27;s distorted. Nevertheless, I think this works better than other options here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am baffled by all the glowing reviews for this mirror; it is a piece of junk! It is ridiculously flimsy and shoddily made, plus once you put the base together you cannot take it apart again. The angling feature doesn&#x27;t work at all; as another reviewer mentioned, it just slams back down into the straight vertical position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that isn&#x27;t as bad as the actual lighting though. These LED lights give a very harsh blue light. I don&#x27;t mean like typical office fluorescent lighting, but more like lighting you&#x27;d find in an operating room or something. And it doesn&#x27;t light your face evenly at all -- when I look straight-on into the mirror, somehow the middle of my face is in shadow and the edges are brightly lit. Tilting and moving my face just moves where the shadowing is. It&#x27;s bizarre, and makes the mirror basically useless for makeup application or anything else really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design idea of this mirror is unique, and would be awesome if it was actually decently made and had decent lighting. But sadly, it&#x27;s not and it doesn&#x27;t. I almost never return stuff, but this is going back. Pure junk; don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The concept of the mirror is great. Remember it is portable, not travel-friendly. Because it is battery operated, you can use it anywhere. If you have an RV, or you travel often by car, then you can take it along. The main mirror is generous in size, the lights are bright, if they are too bright then find some white tape to cover a few of the bulbs. (Sounds tacky, but in my opinion, if something works for the most part, and a gentle tweak makes it better, then I can live with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3 star/o.k. rating is due to the fact that the swivel that keeps the mirror positioned needs to be re-engineered. It does not hold its&#x27; place well. I am thinking of jamming a rubber band back there...I&#x27;ll see if that works. The general concept is great, but it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple reason for my rating (3 stars &#x3D; &#x27;its&#x27; o.k.&#x27;) is that I have not found anything better that is portable that suits my needs. (Large mirror, lights, 10X additional mirror that swivels out of the way, battery operated.) I do not use this mirror for my personal daily use, I have another plug-in higher-end type for that. But, for a traveling MUA (make-up artist) this does the job.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why everyone complains about battery life.  Unless your spending an hour a day in front of this thing the battery life is great</li>
    <li> LEDs are bright. Didn&#x27;t realize it was battery operated so cordless was a plus. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> LCD lights have blue cast to them and the little mirror is so small its hard to use</li>
    <li> Love this mirror the size is perfect, and the light on it is bright. Love love love strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror! It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and I like it. The lights are bright enough for me, it&#x27;s not super bright but it works well for me in a dimly lit room. I like the little magnifying mirror that has a swivel, found it very useful when I want to use the tweezers. It can be moved up and down to adjust height and the mirror can be tilted as well. Overall a great product and I&#x27;m glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday and so far looks great. Super easy assembly and the mirror is bright!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy the mirror after reading some of the reviews. I am glad I did buy it. I love it. It is large enough that you can see all of your face when applying makeup. The magnification mirror is great. Perfect for putting on your mascara. I love that you can adjust the height of the mirror. It is, as others have said, quite bright, but you can &amp;#34;look past&amp;#34; the bright LEDs. I have other more expensive mirrors, and this one beats them all. Well worth the money and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lighting is decent.  Magnifying mirror is an added bonus, but the construction is poor.  Assembly required and for me, the mirror will not stay in place when tilted, which is annoying.</li>
    <li> This worked great, except I wish the angle adjustment positioner stayed in place. I had to find things to prop it in the right angle.</li>
    <li> JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY PUT IT TOGETHER THE BOLT THAT GOES IN THE BACK HAS NO SREW TO HOLD IT IN PLACE. I WAS DISAPPOINTED .</li>
    <li> I received my mirror today I am very pleased .... Only thing is I thought it plug in to the wall it doesn&#x27;t it runs off double A but that still fine</li>
    <li> I take this with me on trips.  Very handy.</li>
    <li> Is a great portable mirror, light weight and adjustable. Wasn&#x27;t sure when I first saw it if it was going to be good looks a little cheap but it really does do the job well.</li>
    <li> Loved this when I got it, especially the little mirror as it makes things very clear which is not always a wonderful thing but it is helpful.  The regular large mirror and lights took a bit to get use to because the lights are a bit unique but I loved that it was cordless, just what I was looking for.  Fast forward 5-6 months since my purchase and the light started flickering on and off a few days ago and and has been permanently out now since yesterday.  Such a shame.  The price and the style were exactly what I wanted. I would have reordered if it had lasted at least a year at that price point.  I would not say to not purchase it, just be aware that it may not last as long as you might hope. The price point might make it worthwhile to you and if you just need a portable mirror without a light, it still works for that.</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> This Makeup mirror is FANTASTIC!!! I read some negative reviews... I don&#x27;t and haven&#x27;t had anything go wrong at all !!! I have looked for a mirror for a long time and they want SO MUCH MONEY for them everywhere they are all too small and the light sucks ... The list for me goes on....do I looked on Amazon since I have prime ... Saw  The Jerdon Mirror it us absolutely superb !!! I use it everyday!!! Haven&#x27;t even changed the batteries ... I have had this for quite a long time  and like I said I use it EVERYDAY!!!  I am a hairdresser and I have been in the beauty industry for 30 years...so I have seen many things come and go!!! Get this mirror ... You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> Arrived past and just as described.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with a plug, but a decent size mirror. The base measures  7 1/4&amp;#34; long × 5&amp;#34; wide. It&#x27;s  1/2&amp;#34;  high in the back receding to 1/4&amp;#34; in front . The front has a compartment measuring 6 1/2&amp;#34; × 2&amp;#34;  for earrings , makeup brushes or for those items you don&#x27;t want to roll away or lose before your able to put them in or on.The large mirror is  1&amp;#34; thick. It&#x27;s 8 1/16&amp;#34; wide × 11&amp;#34; long. Therevare 20 LED lights spaced  1 3/4&amp;#34; from the other. Each light is  1/16&amp;#34; in diameter. The 10 × mirror is 3  3/4&amp;#34; round, 1/2&amp;#34; wide. This mirror is attached to that steel, rod youmsee in the photo. The rod is attached to thevtop, and bottom of the plastic miiror frame. The 10× mirror can slide up &amp; down this rod , adjusting to the users height. This rod also can pivot out of the way of the large mirror so you have the entire use of this generous sized mirror.The  rod extends past the mirror by  21/2&amp;#34; , so while in front of the large mirror it isn&#x27;t touching the mirror at all. No way for it to scratch or damage the larger mirror. This mirror is completely flat , some mirrors have a slight curve to them whereon the edge of those mirrors it will become distorted,  this one gives you a perfect reflection from edge to edge . In the back of this mirror houses the 4 AA battery compartment, and the main power switch. Once the batteries are installed , you turn the switch on, you have the ability to turn the lights on and off from a touch mirror button that is built in to the lower center front of the large mirror. This button is  3/4&amp;#34; round and easy to see. The mirror is attached to a back arm with a screw , you can pivot the mirror to the position best for you. When the mirror is flush against the back it measures 2 3/4&amp;#34;, but you still have the base. I myself can see traveling with this fairly easy. Just placing the base of the mirror against the wall of any suitcase, or in the bottom of any travel bag. Wrapping the mirror in a garment or towel , that&#x27;s what i do. I do not find these lights to low or to bright for my needs. They don&#x27;t look blue at all either. Others may have had that experience but I haven&#x27;t. I have the black one , but I&#x27;m getting two white ones as gifts . As for the small screw in the back that has been mentioned, yeah it could be longer, so if &amp; when that becomes my problem , I will take it out  and go to my neighborhood hardwardware store any simply spend 25 cents for one a 1/2&amp;#34; longer. 💄THANKS FOR READING, BYE 💄in a garment or towel , that&#x27;s what i do.

    <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s very large, the lights are bright, and the little mirror is genius. I&#x27;m so thrilled, I&#x27;m about to buy another one!</li>
    <li> Love love love this mirror</li>
    <li> This mirror doesn&#x27;t stay up like its suppose to.</li>
    <li> Mirror keeps slidding down as you are using it.  Have tightened it several times but continues to do the same.  When the batteries start to run out the lighting is very dim.  I use it for about 10 minutes, batteries have to be changed to frequently. :-((</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and esthetician. This mirror is perfect for me. The mirror is very large, and since its battery operated, it is easily portable. With the lights being so bright, and the lil 10x mirror, it gives me the ability to see everything and I can finally perform precise extractions on myself. Yes, the brightness does make your makeup look a bit &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; normal light, so I just turn the light off to see what my makeup looks like in normal light. The tray area is nice too, as it holds my extraction tools.</li>
    <li> very nice mirror for the price</li>
    <li> This has been the greatest online purchase regret I&#x27;ve ever made. I&#x27;m not an engineer or lighting expert. But I am a multi-decade beauty professional. During that time, I have never used a worse mirror than this one. The LED lights do not illuminate your image in the mirror. But directs narrowly focused beams that shoot right past either side of your head. All it does is make you look more washed out and ghostly than you would even look in office lighting. It is so ghastly as to be completely un usable. A make up mirror should mimic out door natural lighting. I assumed (stupidly) that since my LED TV is capable of producing natural skin tones, that the LED would be good on a make up mirror. WRONG!  You would think that a company of this size would test market this thing to, oh I don&#x27;t know, Make up Artists? But alas and alack, I realize that they could not have done what most successful companies do. I&#x27;m going to try to exchange or get a refund. I&#x27;ll be getting the traditional little round bulb ones. There are some great bulbs to be had, if you do&#x27;t like the ones that come with them.</li>
    <li> I wanted  a mirror with a clear image so that I could apply makeup.  However, the LED lights were blinding without illuminating the mirror.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I needed a mirror for my poorly lit vanity area.  It&#x27;s ok for the price as an adjustable mirror with magnifier, but it is a bit cheap.  The screw on the back that holds the mirror in place/keeps it from going completely vertical is pushing on plastic and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the lights.  Oh my god.  I thought I had turned on a star in my face the first time I switched it on.  There are SO MANY LED bulbs on this thing that it is blinding.  LED lights are supposed to be very bright so I don&#x27;t know why they put so many on this mirror.  And the color of the light is not flattering at all.  It&#x27;s a very cool blue that borders on being neon hued.  It&#x27;s unusable as a lighted mirror unless you&#x27;re interested in going prematurely blind.</li>
    <li> grat mirror comes apart easily flimsey</li>
    <li> The lighting is not the best. Or maybe it is just my older eyes!!  :)</li>
    <li> Nice mirror but I wish the lights were a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> Screw won&#x27;t get tight enough so it hard to elevate the mirror where I want it</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. it&#x27;s a good size, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on a counter top and it is a REALLY clear mirror. I once heard someone say that not all mirrors are created equal and I must say that this mirror has a really nice clarity to it and is great quality. it shows everything true to it&#x27;s image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 out of 5 stars was because the bottom stand is not all that heavy (it&#x27;s just a light plastic) and it would&#x27;ve been even better if it was a heavier material to weigh down the mirror so it feels sturdier. also the way the mirror tilts up and down is not all that good either. it isn&#x27;t sturdy the way you tilt it (either higher or lower to accommodate what you desire for the angle). if you tilted it up higher and bump into it a few seconds later (which I have when testing it) it falls back down to the original angle which is down.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I really like it and it serves it purpose and I would reccommend it if you don&#x27;t mind the little inconviences i wrote about earlier.</li>
    <li> The bolt that attaches the mirror to the stand doesn&#x27;t hold the angle of the mirror in place well at all. Have to prop it to get it to stay at the right angle. Otherwise it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t mind LED lights and non-glass mirror material.</li>
    <li> OK for the price, I guess. Previous reviews have commented on the glaring lighting which I knew about before I ordered it. If  needed to be in front of the device on a regular basis , I would invest in a more substantial unit made of glass and better lighting which costs a lot more.</li>
    <li> Maybe mine was defective but it didn&#x27;t work out so I returned it and bought the one that folds out and it works way better.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! I especially love the 10 magnification. If you have those sneaky, creepy, chin hairs, you can see them and get rid of them before they show up to the naked eye. I did not think I would like not being able to plug it in, but it actually pretty handy. Now I can put my make up on in the room the tv is in. I get the morning news and weather now. Get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Very modern mirror. I love that it is battery operated. This makes the mirror very portable. I only wish the magnified mirror portion was just a little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> I have poor lighting in my room and needed something to help with my makeup routine. I chose this based on the reviews and it was something different than a round vanity mirror, also was curious as to how the LED would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lights are INTENSE, and a little rough for a morning routine for me personally, seeing as that I don&#x27;t fully wake up before doing my makeup. But it&#x27;s perfect for doing your makeup before going out. It&#x27;s basically the same lighting as something a makeup counter would have, which is really nice. The LED is a huge help in doing an even and precise job on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way they designed the magnifying mirror is really unique and helpful when I need it. You can see EVERYTHING with this combination of mirrors, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took one star off because it&#x27;s hard to store for what I need it for. I would like if the bottom flipped up so that I can store it flat in my makeup drawers. For my small space it&#x27;s a little too large to leave out and have it not look odd in it&#x27;s placement. But, despite all that, I didn&#x27;t want to return it because it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great mirror but doesn&#x27;t stay when moved flops around design flaw I assume I just prop mine up with makeup drawer and it works</li>
    <li> my favorite! definitely worth the buy</li>
</ol>
