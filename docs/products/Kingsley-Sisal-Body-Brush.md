      <li>Dry brushing feels great!</li>
      <li>This brush is priced fairly, well-constructed with materials of natural origin, easy to maneuver, feels great on skin, and arrives fast.  </li>
      <li>Finally getting a good cleaning!</li>
      <li>Wore out very quickly.</li>
      <li>shorter handle is easy to work with.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent tool for promoting better circulation, removing dead skin, and leaving skin feeling polished and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A good product for older people when they are showering or bathing.  </li>
      <li>Pretty amazing brush.</li>
      <li>Nice at first.</li>
      <li>Nice firm bristles and a beautifully crafted, easy to hold handle.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>It is really great, good size (not to large), rough bristles that stimulate blood flow.</li>
      <li>Handle too short, should have known when I bought it, but otherwise a great brush.</li>
      <li>However, it is cheap, so I should have known.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Since this wasn&#x27;t good for what I bought it for, I have it to my 3 year old.</li>
      <li>Whether you are health- &amp; wellness-conscious or looking to add a classic, elegant touch to a sumptuous gift basket you&#x27;re putting together, this is a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re not as rough, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
      <li>love love my new skin brush will buy again form your company</li>
      <li>Using this brush makes me feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Great for dry brushing and exfoliation.</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin, so maybe it&#x27;d work better for someone else!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be re-purposing it as a parts cleaning brush in my shop where it will be just about right!</li>
      <li>The handle is the perfect length, the stiffness of the bristles is brisk at first but softens to perfection with a little time and use.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin I would avoid this product, but I liked using it since I felt like it cleaned me thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I wanted a brush like this, but wasn&#x27;t sure the handle would allow me to get the whole body</li>
      <li>It will probably last for years with good care.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice size and easy to hold in your hand to scrub your entire body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Being that the brush is on the cheaper side, I don’t keep it in the shower because bristle wells seem like they could grow mold pretty easily.</li>
      <li>The bristles were fine but the wood split after the first use when the moisture evaporated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush or about two months and keeping with a 15 minute routine every day my cellulite has been reduced tremendously and</li>
      <li>Mildew / Mold formed quickly and is not coming off with soap / shampoo.  </li>
      <li>A fabulous, first quality brush.</li>
      <li>with my opinion of the minor shortcomings, this is a good body brush</li>
      <li>I finally found a company that was pretty good and stayed with them until this purchase of this brush, on a lark, because of the reviews.</li>
      <li>This was my third time buying a body brush for myself and I must say I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re a regular drybrusher you will love this!</li>
      <li>It takes off that layer of old dull outer skin, and stimulates the circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of a bath brush is so important and this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Also just an all-around fantastic scratcher for those itchy, hard-to-reach spots.</li>
      <li>Does a nice job on my back though.</li>
      <li>but maaaan is it worth it.  </li>
      <li>an aside, would be nice if there was an objective rating system for brush bristles.</li>
      <li>Might be a good body brush for those with sensitive skin, but feels a bit too soft for me.</li>
      <li>Great brush...not too stiff and not too scratchy.  </li>
      <li>beautiful brush, bought it for shower still using it for dry brush, it&#x27;s the perfect stiffness for my skin, use to use a stiffer one when I was younger, this one will help me get back my younger ;)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it for dry brushing my skin. It is really great, good size (not to large), rough bristles that stimulate blood flow. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bristles are tough enough to actually scrub/exfoliate my skin. A lot of brushes seem too soft to actually do anything.&lt;br /&gt;The shorter handle is easy to work with. I can reach all of my back no problem.&lt;br /&gt;The head of the brush is about the size of your palm, which I think is a good size.&lt;br /&gt;The cost is just right. I won’t feel bad about throwing out after some good use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Being that the brush is on the cheaper side, I don’t keep it in the shower because bristle wells seem like they could grow mold pretty easily. I would just make sure it has a chance to totally dry out after each use and rinse it out well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Love this body brush!</li>
    <li> Great product . . . fast delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent brush the bristles are very firm would not recommend people new to dry brushing but if you&#x27;re a regular drybrusher you will love this! Additionally I love the leangth of the handle, it&#x27;s long enough to reach everywhere but it&#x27;s not cumbersome into long like most to dry brushes are and the handle does not detach which often falls off with other Drybrushes.</li>
    <li> love love my new skin brush will buy again form your company</li>
    <li> Poorly made, does not hold up at all.  Had it in use for less than a week, split in two.</li>
    <li> A little stiff but I knew that when buying it. Definitely a brush to use after your skin becomes more accustom to brushing. It does soften a bit when wet.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the shower, with soap, and on dry skin... it&#x27;s a little bit like a torture. I mean, it looks nice and all, but it&#x27;s so scratchy. I mean, I realize I bought a body brush, and body brushes are made to be rather scratchy, but I really need to wait until I scratch off the old skin and a thicker, more calloused layer forms. Then it won&#x27;t scratch as badly, perhaps. Don&#x27;t use it on your chest, underarms or inner thighs though. I&#x27;m serious.</li>
    <li> A good product for older people when they are showering or bathing.  It gives you that extra reach when your body doesn&#x27;t perform as it once did.</li>
    <li> This is labeled as a body brush but the bristles are way too stiff to use anywhere except maybe to scrub feet.</li>
    <li> If u have sensitive skin be careful how much and how hard u brush the bristles can be a little rough in tender areas. Helps underarm dirt and darkness</li>
    <li> When you first use it it s a little bit stiff, but after several uses it becomes perfect for whole body use. Great fir feet in shower if you are a senior.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing brush. Gives a hard scrub that leaves me feeling invigorated. It&#x27;s a nice size and easy to hold in your hand to scrub your entire body. Rinses well and hangs to dry.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Dry brushing feels great! And makes me feel great. I recommend it to anyone looking for a brush</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have whipped out my measuring tape before buying this, but this brush is way to small for me. the thing is literally the size of a big hair brush. I would have returned it, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> beautiful brush, bought it for shower still using it for dry brush, it&#x27;s the perfect stiffness for my skin, use to use a stiffer one when I was younger, this one will help me get back my younger ;)</li>
    <li> Love it for body dry brushing!!!!!!  It takes a few times to get use to the feel of the stiff bristles but maaaan is it worth it.  I use it daily right before my shower then apply a super intense moisturizer and my stretch marks AND minor cellulite have SIGNIFICANTLY faded away!!!!  I&#x27;ve had both for several years and now I&#x27;m literally brushing them away!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is extremely rough. I can&#x27;t use it on anything except my feet.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, not too soft yet not too rigid. The shape of the handle is comfortable and easy to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Left a wash rag on top of it and the wood cracked the first night.  That and the bristles just about scratch my back off.</li>
    <li> Firm bristles, good for nice relaxing wet scrub.</li>
    <li> Nice firm bristles and a beautifully crafted, easy to hold handle. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush...not too stiff and not too scratchy.  Small enough to slip into my gym bag, long enough to get to that spot on the middle of my back that I just couldn&#x27;t reach before. :)&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time (2 day Amazon Prime).  Very pleased with this seller...</li>
    <li> Right texture, but the handle is a little too short for working on my itchy back.</li>
    <li> Very hard..bristles come out..mildews fast</li>
    <li> I love this brush....the bristles are firm and great for dry brushing the tough skin of your knees and elbows...I use this all over my body especially behind my thighs...this works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough brush, but the bristles weren&#x27;t as stiff as I wanted.  It&#x27;s well made though, &amp; if you intend on using it for fairly tender or sensitive skin, this is a good one.</li>
    <li> This brush is rough for dry brushing, but I like it. I am new to dry brushing, but tend to have itchy dry skin, so this brush is working for me. I would not recommend it for new dry brushers with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m not an expert.</li>
    <li> I like that the bristles are made from sisal and not from boar&#x27;s bristles. I also like that the brush and handle are all of one piece, so the head doesn&#x27;t slip off.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now as a dry brush before showering and it works well. The bristles are firm enough to do a good exfoliation job.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer, the bristles are too rough and leave red blotches and scratches on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used bristle body brushes for years and never experienced this.</li>
    <li> Gets my back nice and clean, I&#x27;m surprised how much dirt it&#x27;s able to scrub off every time. I have long arms and I&#x27;m pretty flexible. The brush is long enough for me to reach everything, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a wee bit longer.</li>
    <li> Very stiff and irritating brush at first. Use it a few times and it breaks in nicely. Great for dry brushing and exfoliation. Also just an all-around fantastic scratcher for those itchy, hard-to-reach spots. Trust me, you need it just for that, at least. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dry body brush that I could also use wet.  This is perfect.  The bristles are pretty stiff and so very exfoliative when used dry before a shower (I do it in the shower or bath before I turn on or sit in the water), then great for exfoliating wet before you shave or to get hard-to-clean parts extra clean (top middle of back, bum buns, pits, et cetera).  Very good price, delivered, for Amazon Prime customers.  I will probably be purchasing more for gifts.  Thank  you seller, thank you Amazon.  :)</li>
    <li> got this to dry brush my back.  Good size and the handle allows you to reach every spot.  the bristles are firm, but not irritating.  Good product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this brush for scrubbing our feet. Its stays firm, even when wet and it seems to be holding up well in the shower. When its time for a new foot brush, I will definitely buy this one again!</li>
    <li> Bristles way too hard.</li>
    <li> The handle is short. This will take some getting used to. Otherwise, great brush. Even comes wrapped in a nice little bow if you want to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush, I just wish the handle was a bit longer. I use it in the shower and still have to contort a little to get my entire back. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 5&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m not tall. If the handle was two inches longer, this would be my dream brush. It&#x27;s holding up very nicely to daily use in the shower and all the bristles are staying in.</li>
    <li> I wanted a brush like this, but wasn&#x27;t sure the handle would allow me to get the whole body but it works just fine. I happen to be flexible enough to get the back otherwise I would&#x27;ve opted for a longer handle brush. I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a month now and it&#x27;s still keeping together. You can see a bristle or two starting to pull away, but I expect that.</li>
    <li> I feel cleaner and more invigorated after scrubbing down with this brush. Only first use. Hopefully it lasts.</li>
    <li> Just what it looks like - a great body brush. Well made. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush since January 25, 2014. I use it every morning...to date there are several [three thus far] segments of bristles that have fallen out. It&#x27;s my understanding that there are no returns for this item, which is a shame since the seller labels themselves as \\&quot;Quality You Can Trust\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a picture, but unfortunately Amazon does not allow an image to be inserted into this message.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product, or seller.</li>
    <li> great quality but way harsher than a loofah. i have sensitive skin, so maybe it&#x27;d work better for someone else!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush: it arrived just as described / guaranteed, and the quality is nice.  I use it for dry brushing-- even though I am not an expert on the practice &amp; haven&#x27;t been doing it for too long, I feel that this will likely get the job done for the majority of individuals who want to reap the benefits of this energizing &amp; healthful regimen.  This brush is priced fairly, well-constructed with materials of natural origin, easy to maneuver, feels great on skin, and arrives fast.  Whether you are health- &amp; wellness-conscious or looking to add a classic, elegant touch to a sumptuous gift basket you&#x27;re putting together, this is a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;! (And if you are crafting a pampering / home-spa style gift basket for someone else, consider ordering a brush for yourself! hehe)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s between firm and medium. I love it that way. I used it as a dry brush and wet.</li>
    <li> After learning about dry brushing, I decided to give this one a chance.  It works very well as a dry brush to use before showering.  I have a feeling that this one is meant for someone that has been dry brushing for a while though because the bristles are a little rough.  Don&#x27;t let that deter you though because after a few weeks of using it, my skin has adjusted and it&#x27;s perfectly ok now.  From a scale of 1-10, 10 being the roughest, I&#x27;d say this brush is around a 6.  It isn&#x27;t a Brillo pad which I&#x27;d consider a 10 for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little short too but if you&#x27;re flexible, you can hit your back with it some too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any experience using it in the shower.  It&#x27;s definitely a good brush and it feels durable.  None of the bristles have fallen out which is a good thing since I tend to use more force on areas like the soles of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with my opinion of the minor shortcomings, this is a good body brush and I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it.  It will probably last for years with good care.</li>
    <li> I love this for a body brush- My first one- It even is just the perfect length for back brushing. I strictly use it for body brushing</li>
    <li> Wore out very quickly. Nice at first. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shower brush.  The handle and bristles dry relatively quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them getting moldy.  The bristles are just hard enough that they exfoliate well but aren&#x27;t overly rough on your skin.  Plus the handle is long enough that you can get your back too!</li>
    <li> thank u....i needed this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for dry brushing every day before showering, and have noticed a pretty signicant improvement in my skin over the last month. At first the bristles felt a little stiff, but I noticed right away how soft, clean, and invigorated my skin felt after it&#x27;s use. This is an excellent tool for promoting better circulation, removing dead skin, and leaving skin feeling polished and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use my dry brush for about 5-10 minutes before a shower, working in soft, circular strokes brushing towards the heart. After showering, I always follow up by moisturizing with coconut oil.  I love this product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very very stiff and scratchy, perfect for dry brushing!</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> Could have been a little longer but the sucker is sturdy and the bristles give a good cleaning, it also macks for a good back scratcher, like I said a longer version would rate 10 stars</li>
    <li> Small and functional.  The bristles are much stiffer than the one I previously owned and I like it.  It arrived quickly in minimal packaging.</li>
    <li> I love how stiff the brushes are!</li>
    <li> Good face brush. Might be too stiff for some, but I love it. Might be a good body brush for those with sensitive skin, but feels a bit too soft for me. Handle is too short to reach your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is holding up well after a few months of continuous use. Slight discoloration from water getting into the dents from dropping it, but that&#x27;s normal for wood. In 5 months of use, two plugs of bristles have come out so far. So, not perfect, but is holding up reasonable well. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, would be nice if there was an objective rating system for brush bristles. No one describes the stiffness or softness in a uniform way, so it&#x27;s really a crap shoot when you order.</li>
    <li> very harsh brush and the wood part went grey and black in a few weeks, I threw it out, could have gone moldy</li>
    <li> I used it in the shower to scrub my feet. The bristles are stiff enough to scrub well, but not painfully so.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but the handle is very short. Definitely cannot reach your back with this brush. Overall, not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> This was my third time buying a body brush for myself and I must say I&#x27;m in love with it! The bristles are soft enough that my skin isn&#x27;t turning red, but firm enough where I can feel and see a difference happening. I&#x27;ve had this brush or about two months and keeping with a 15 minute routine every day my cellulite has been reduced tremendously and my skin feels so good! Although I must warn that if you have seriously sensitive skin this brush is not for you at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously recommend this brush to who wants to improve their skins condition a little bit, but doesn&#x27;t mind a little firmness!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 3 or 4 times now. It has a funky smell to it, but the more I use it, the smell goes away. So hopefully, eventually the smell will go away altogether. As far as the bristles, they are very rough. I saw some reviews that said it takes some time to soften up, so I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s soon! However, it does the job well. I don&#x27;t have any soap residue on my skin anymore. I used to use a loofah and thought it was doing the job. However, I would scratch my skin right after using it, and there was SO much soap residue under my nails! Now when I use this brush, I do the scratch test, and there&#x27;s nothing under my nails. Finally getting a good cleaning! I use it on my elbows, too. I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re not as rough, so that&#x27;s good! Overall, it&#x27;s a great product. If the smell completely goes away, and the bristles soften up, then it&#x27;ll be a 5-star product!</li>
    <li> Very stiff, very sloughing, very strong brush. It will give you a good rubdown. Healthy for muscles and skin. I just love it. I do follow with a good soft brush and lots of good moisturizer. A fabulous, first quality brush. You won&#x27;t find better. The loop at the end is very handy, also (small details ;).</li>
    <li> If you use this in the shower to exfoliate your back, which is what I wanted, it gets gross and moldy very quickly. This is probably because the wood is low quality/ not sealed/ whatever. However, it is cheap, so I should have known. I tried to keep it clean, but ended up throwing it away not too long ago. Lesson learned. Also the handle was shorter than I expected, even knowing the product details.</li>
    <li> Short handle and stiff bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I like it for the price.</li>
    <li> I used the Kingsley SIsal Body Brush for  5 days.  Just 5 days and it starting craking in the wood near the brissels.  I will post pictures soon.  The Crack is big enough that I could put a finger nail in the crack.  This product is rubbish.  I am grateful that I purchased the brush via amazon which has world class customer service.</li>
    <li> The bristles were fine but the wood split after the first use when the moisture evaporated. Still useable, for now,  but may not last very long.</li>
    <li> on my second one....  can&#x27;t find a replacement!</li>
    <li> This is exactly as the picture, the bristles are a bit too firm for my liking, but that is personal preference I guess.  I actually use this in the shower as dry brushing with this would be too harsh for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower the bristles get bent very easily but have been holding up compared to an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; brush I bought at Target that started loosing bristles just after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but haven&#x27;t seen any major improvement in skin tone, texture etc.</li>
    <li> After about a week of use and it hanging in my shower the wood got what looks like mold on it.  All on the area that the bristles are is green with mositure.  Other than that the brush felt good and I liked the length but it got gross quickly so in the trash it went.</li>
    <li> I use this EVERY day. Bristles are somewhat coarse at first but become softer with time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been skin brushing all my life, since the 80&#x27;s, and always found it near impossible to find a good stiff brush. I finally found a company that was pretty good and stayed with them until this purchase of this brush, on a lark, because of the reviews. This brush is THE brush I have been seeking all my skin&#x27;s life. It&#x27;s stiff and hard and delicious on my silky skin, hungry to stay silky with invigorating brushing daily in the shower. It&#x27;s divine beyond compare. My old brush was going kaput, was never this strong, and my skin, after just one use with this one, I notice is way softer already. I&#x27;m getting a second as back up. LOVE this brush. Love it. Please click yes if this was helpful, thanks!</li>
    <li> This brush is awful. It left scratch marks on my back. After one month of use, the wood became very moldy!</li>
    <li> Found this to be a quality item. Has a great &amp;#34;dual&amp;#34; purpose!  Bristles are holding tight after generous use! Such a better choice that those plastic shower &amp;#34;scrunchie&amp;#34; puffs.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a quality made product, but the couple of times I used it in the shower, I had to stop because it smelled horribly of onions. I was able to return it for a refund, no questions asked, thank goodness. Sorry, Kingsley!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body brush for a few months now and it&#x27;s holding up very well. The bristles are quite stiff so it took awhile to get used to the scratchy sensation but it doesn&#x27;t leave red marks on my skin at all. I use it before I jump in the shower and before bed every night. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference with the firmness of my skin and I would definitely purchase another one of these brushes when it&#x27;s time to replace this one.</li>
    <li> Very small and strong to use when showering which makes for cleaning easier and feeling more fresh because of extra layers f dead skin that it removes. To leave your other layer of skin healthy and clean looking.</li>
    <li> Extremely soft. For dry brushing, much firmer bristles are better. Since this wasn&#x27;t good for what I bought it for, I have it to my 3 year old. He loves it. It is made well, quality wood, only flaw is extremely soft...and some people might consider that a positive.</li>
    <li> I started using a body brush to help exfoliate my back since I have really bad acne. I have only used it for a week now and my back seems to be clearing up a bit. If you already have existing zits, the brush initially is a little rough so use gentle strokes when scrubbing. I use a 10% benzol peroxide wash to scrub with. I feel much cleaner using this than using a loofah. It gets a 4 because it is a little rough on the skin starting out.</li>
    <li> This is a great body brush.  Not too soft, not too rough.  Just right. The workmanship is very fine.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is my second one, the first bought at a now defunct shop and used to death before I found this one.  The handle is the perfect length, the stiffness of the bristles is brisk at first but softens to perfection with a little time and use.  I use this in the shower: soap it up, gentle scrub, rinse well and hang to air dry.  I&#x27;ve never had any problems.  Delighted Amazon makes this available.  M.</li>
    <li> I got this to use to give a good hard scrub to my feet, and it works great! The bristles are stiff, but they give just enough.</li>
    <li> Handle too short, should have known when I bought it, but otherwise a great brush.</li>
    <li> I use this in the tub, and it scrubs me just right, not too hard, not too soft.  I wish it had a longer handle, but it still does the job.  It feels sooo good.  And my skin likes it.  It is soft and smooth after I use this.  It takes off that layer of old dull outer skin, and stimulates the circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of a bath brush is so important and this one is perfect.  I am seeing softer, smoother, healthier skin since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Kingsley, if you ever make this one with a longer handle let me know.  Until then, this is my ultimate bath brush.</li>
    <li> Ok for feet, but it is really too short, to clean your back, and the handle feels like it should be curved, to reach around, your back side.</li>
    <li> Using this brush makes me feel squeaky clean. I use it with soap in the shower. I thought the handle would be too short to allow me to wash my back, but it was fine. If you&#x27;re taller than 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; you may run into some issues though. If you have sensitive skin I would avoid this product, but I liked using it since I felt like it cleaned me thoroughly.</li>
    <li> not a long enough handle</li>
    <li> Perfect size for a tiny shower. Great wet or dry brush. Recommend.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, works very well for dry body brush, the hardness is perfect for daily brush...great for my soft skin...love it ;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I found this much to stiff to use as a body brush. Actually painful. I&#x27;ll be re-purposing it as a parts cleaning brush in my shop where it will be just about right!</li>
    <li> Mildew / Mold formed quickly and is not coming off with soap / shampoo.  Does a nice job on my back though.</li>
