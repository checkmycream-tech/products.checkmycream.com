<li> One short spray is enough to last you for the better part of the day, plus it doesn&#x27;t smell bad when you sweat.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> Too much is overpowering in a bad way</li>
<li> Not overwhelming.</li>
<li> This was a Christmas gift, very hard to find body  spray in Kilo.</li>
<li> Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> One of my favorite scents. Axe will probably discontinue it now!</li>
    <li> At first, it seems this stuff can smell strange, but, for me, it seem to get a lot better.  I wear it all the time, and I get no complaints.  :)</li>
    <li> This is my Husbands favorite Axe and I must say I think it smells yummy on him ! Two thumbs up ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of all AXE products.  Period.  Order it and make your sweetie happy.  You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>

    <li> Product differs from image displayed. All said and done, this is the best product in the AXE range of bodysprays. Not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. The body spray came as advertised, and was undamaged. The scent is exactly what I was expecting, and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Was sent incorrect scent and used it had tried to get to a person and return it for the correct one but it was tqken so much time I couldnt&#x27;t wait so iI used this scent any way. I don&#x27;t know why no one checked it for the proper scent. I don&#x27;t feel like this was appropiate.. - No reply for this..</li>
    <li> Smells like a tuna sandwich when you leave it in your locker all day on a hot day. Think I may of gotten a mislabeled bottle of Axe Tuna-ilo</li>
    <li> The pic shows the old round top can which i wanted because the new can doesn&#x27;t smell the same.Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift, very hard to find body  spray in Kilo. I could find everything else but the spray., My husband loves it!</li>
