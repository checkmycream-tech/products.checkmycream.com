      <li>It works really well and smells great.</li>

      <li>and my face feels nice and clean before bed.</li>
      <li>I like to use this when I wash my face at night and need to make sure it is clean.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel fresh :) i use it every night before I go to sleep.</li>

      <li>This is an overall great product</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference from any other astringent, but it does a good job!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes to the product itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of astringent my daughter will use!  </li>
      <li>From O.J.&#x27;s Beauty Lotion to Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean and Merle</li>
      <li>Without the strength how can it help get rid of any blemishes let alone clean the face?</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean or refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and is more gentle like a toner.</li>
      <li>it really refreshes your face, but the blackheads i feel like i get them more often then i did before</li>
      <li>If there is a pimple ready to come out, I dab that spot with more of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and minty clean.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel clean and fresh without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>This has increased my confidence and made me feel more ready to face the day with a smile.</li>
      <li>This is my first astringent, and I quite enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Good for oil skin not for dry skin</li>
      <li>One of my favorite parts is that it smells really good which is hard to find in an astringent.</li>
      <li>It is just OKAY I would return to using the Biore&#x27; TRIPLE Action instead.</li>
      <li>Although I like it, because I have to pause and think about the ingredients each time when I decide to use it instead of a more natural toner, no five stars.</li>
      <li>I have bumpy skin and my husband noticed how clear my skin has gotten I need to purchase a couple more</li>
      <li>The product is also a great value as I use very little on each application.</li>
      <li>This product is great - it&#x27;s pretty much the same product as their Triple Action Astringent -</li>
      <li>If you want something very light, not strong at all then this is okay.</li>
      <li>a side note, if your skin is too sensitive to use the Biore toner every day, try alternating with one of the alcohol free varieties of Thayer witch hazel.</li>
      <li>and I have smooth clear thighs.</li>
      <li>When I first got this product it seemed to work wonders, now those wonders have diminished or cease to exist.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth, clear, and helps my makeup and moisturizer go on smoother.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>I bought several other brands trying to find a great replacement with no luck.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without this biore astringent, so fresh and awakening</li>
      <li>First they change their look, (I liked the mint green color) and now they are stopping the production of this astringent.</li>
      <li>Lastly the 8 oz bottle is very generous, and much more than many other brands offer.</li>
      <li>However there&#x27;s too many strange ingredients to comfortably use on a daily (morning/evening) basis.</li>
      <li>First, the scent is fresh, and not harsh like many other astringents.</li>
      <li>and I feel it cleans it really well.</li>
      <li>and I use it over my whole face.</li>
      <li>and it does the job very well.</li>
      <li>This astringent didnt do much in controlling oil or reducing my pimples.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>Even after I stopped using that, though, this really hasn&#x27;t managed to get rid of it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this item.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about a month now though, and if I use the blemish treating astringent nightly, I do not have any pimples at all, so it is working much better than expected for my purposes!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this astringent on every other day as spot treatment on my oily sensitive skin. For me, it dries out my face too much to use all over, everyday but spot treating drys up just the blemish.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I actually tried it on razor bumps I always get on my inner thighs etc. I was overjoyed to find it actually cleared it right up and I have smooth clear thighs.</li>
    <li> It works really well and smells great. I noticed a vast improvement in my complexion after I started using this twice a day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - quickly clears up any blemishes.  Product has nice smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this item. It makes my face feel fresh :) i use it every night before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> Results I noticed after using this product for about a month or so..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin when used moderately, like one application a day.&lt;br /&gt;2) Treats pimples effectively.&lt;br /&gt;3) Although not tremendous, but I have seen a satisfactory reduction in my blemishes and spots.&lt;br /&gt;4) This astringent has prevented excess clogging of my pores and also doesn&#x27;t sting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a believer of expensive popular brands. I only buy and use products that I think will help me deal with my skin problems on a regular basis. Biore blemish treating astringent is one of them.</li>
    <li> It is just OKAY I would return to using the Biore&#x27; TRIPLE Action instead. It is very weak. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean or refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer it be clear instead of blue. Why the added dye/color. I would prefer the effort go into the strength and quality of the product instead. Very disappointed. If you want something very light, not strong at all then this is okay. Not for me at all. Without the strength how can it help get rid of any blemishes let alone clean the face? Dislike.</li>
    <li> it really refreshes your face, but the blackheads i feel like i get them more often then i did before</li>
    <li> My daughter suffers with acne, after switching to this from clean and clear astringent, her blemishes cleared up considerably better.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for a couple of years. I have always loved it. Makes my skin feel clean and fresh without drying my skin. All the suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I bought several other brands trying to find a great replacement with no luck. None of them compared. I came to Amazon and thankfully found some so I bought three bottles!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have oily acne prone skin and this is a great toner.&lt;br /&gt;If used twice a day it did start to make my skin a bit flaky but now using it once a day or even every other day it works great&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have un realistic expectations i bough this to help out with break outs and help with the oil and it does the job very well. i still break out&lt;br /&gt;but thats something that will always happen when you have acne issues. It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and minty clean. it doesn&#x27;t sting after applying unless you have been over exfoliating your skin. this will probably be my forever toner!</li>
    <li> Does what astringent should do - removes dirt!! Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference from any other astringent, but it does a good job!</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of astringent my daughter will use!  She loves it!  She refuses to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this astringent!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all and I feel it cleans it really well. I also use a soap for the face. I used to buy it at Walmart, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I knew Amazon would have it. I highly recommend it, especially if you have pimples or a greasy face.</li>
    <li> Really pleasant smell, very mild feel. Feels refreshing but no stinging.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and because it has alcohol (the smell of alcohol is quite strong), I only use it when I have blemish, it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> I was so upset to see that I couldn&#x27;t purchase this in stores anymore. I am afraid they may be discontinuing this product. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;My skin would look like a bumpy glazed ham without this product. First they change their look, (I liked the mint green color) and now they are stopping the production of this astringent. I don&#x27;t want to use the damn strips!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this because it was on sale at the time and I was looking to try something new. First, the scent is fresh, and not harsh like many other astringents. It also feels very refreshing on the skin. I apply just a small amount on a cotton ball and I use it over my whole face. I do not have a lot of acne anymore, however I usually always have one or two small pimples. I have used this for about a month now though, and if I use the blemish treating astringent nightly, I do not have any pimples at all, so it is working much better than expected for my purposes! Lastly the 8 oz bottle is very generous, and much more than many other brands offer.</li>
    <li> The only astringent that keeps my face clear. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. I need to order more soon!</li>
    <li> I love Biore, I have been using their products for years. I like to use this when I wash my face at night and need to make sure it is clean. I use a cotton round and place the astringent on it and my face feels nice and clean before bed. I have been using this for years and continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is great - it&#x27;s pretty much the same product as their Triple Action Astringent - just repackaged.  I have been using it for years and years, even since the old packaging.  HOWEVER, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because the new bottle leaks if you don&#x27;t keep it upright.  You cannot travel with this product or even keep it in your purse.  I always wrap it in a ziploc bag when I travel, and when I unpack, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of the product into the bag.  It&#x27;s just not worth the hassle anymore if I can only use this at home, and there are plenty of other toners out there that have decent packaging if Biore isn&#x27;t willing to fix this issue.  Great way to lose long-time customers - cheap out on your bottle.</li>
    <li> Although I am in my late 20s, I still struggle with acne breakouts, which can be embarrassing to a young professional. I have been using this product for the last month and it has been wonderful. It does not dry out my face and it has dramatically reduced the amount of breakouts I experience. The product is also a great value as I use very little on each application. This has increased my confidence and made me feel more ready to face the day with a smile.</li>
    <li> Honestly not even sure if this helps or not. In the end I still get acne almost every other day and my face still looks red in the acne prone areas.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably try something else.</li>
    <li> The blemish treating astringent is a 100% effective product, your pores look like youngers and your skin is more healthy!! I recomend for a friend</li>
    <li> I have very acne prone skin and had yet to find something that actually helped me. This is an overall great product but I don&#x27;t suggest using it as it says, up to 3 times a day. It is very drying to the skin so should be used no more than once a day, I actually started breaking out more doing multiple times a day. Is very strong chemical wise, keep away from eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years. For the record, it used to be green and came in a cylindrical bottle. This is the newer formula with a slightly different scent, but is more or less the same product. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s longer sold in stores except some Walmarts. Not as harsh as other drugstore brand astringents (Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, etc.) and is more gentle like a toner.</li>
    <li> for clearing the skin and getting rid of blemishes really effective. Better than any product that my daughter tried in Europe. Als did not dry the skin as much as she expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price. My sons like using it. They say it works the best of similar products tried. Did I mention they use it. (It is hard to get my sons on any skincare routine.)</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this biore astringent, so fresh and awakening</li>
    <li> This is the best toner I used that comes close to Clinique&#x27;s toner. It doesnt stink when you use it on your skin and it helps reduce acne. It also doesnt leave your skin feeling super dry but you definitely should use a moisturizer or else it will feel dry later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like the cap of the bottle as it&#x27;s hard to get the product on a cotton ball so I just transferred it over to my empty Clinique bottle. Much better as you get more product and surface area to cover the cotton ball.</li>
    <li> Great astringent I have bumpy skin and my husband noticed how clear my skin has gotten I need to purchase a couple more</li>
    <li> This is my first astringent, and I quite enjoy it. It leaves a nice cooling feeling and has a nice scent. After using it for several days in a row I think my skin reacted and I started getting patches of bumps on my skin and so I discontinued use and now only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, been using it for years and it gets rid of pimples that are just starting to form! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for the last week and a half to two weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen a dramatic change in my skin complexion. I&#x27;ve been using it along with the Bioré pore unclogging facial scrub and the two work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave any greasy parts (as compared to my previous toner, Neutrogena rapid clear) and works quickly. Hilly recommended.</li>
    <li> I mostly use it for cuts, so maybe I should have bought rubbing alcohol. Still, does the trick</li>
    <li> This is the only astringent that I will ever use. My skin is a little sensitive and will become really red if I use something harsh to clean my face and some astringents will make my face hurt and leave it with red blotches. This product did not do that to me. it cleans without being too harsh and that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product it seemed to work wonders, now those wonders have diminished or cease to exist. It does not keep my face from breaking out or rid my skin of blackheads. However, it may be best to keep in mind that acne is a battle I have been fighting for at least 10 years and not even a round of Accutane could get rid of it. I will still use it the extra clean feeling I get from using a toner, not it purported properties.</li>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
    <li> i use it everyday - excellent product. thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Amazon is the only place I can find it now. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this at night after cleansing. It really helps clear the complexion. Be careful not to use it too often, as it can be over-drying to your skin.</li>
    <li> Its active ingredient is the salicylic acid that other pimple treatments use.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because something I was using to moisturize my face was making me break out but this didn&#x27;t help.  Even after I stopped using that, though, this really hasn&#x27;t managed to get rid of it.  I use it before and after washing my face, and before and after exfoliating.  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ll finish out the bottle.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this Biore Blemish Treating Astringent and it seems to work well.  It helps to fight pimples by drying them up.  This astringent doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin like some others can do.  Her skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to get as shiny as before when she didn&#x27;t use Biore.  If a teenager recommends it, it must be good :)</li>
    <li> It seems to work well. I have not had to use it that often.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I change between this product and another brand.</li>
    <li> I love this astringent. Using a cotton pad, I find that it cleans my face well without any sting. It&#x27;s also helped minimize any pore or blackhead issue.</li>
    <li> This product works great on your skin. No burning, it works great for acne, blemishes such as whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
    <li> I rarely ever write reviews because I feel like there are enough reviews out there, but this product is actually review-worthy! I have dealt with acne more recently in the past 3 years, and I simplified my skin care routine, but added this toner as my one acne-fighting product. I use it in the morning and sometimes at night. It leaves my skin smooth, clear, and helps my makeup and moisturizer go on smoother. Definitely a good deal too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It cleans and tightens pores. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, but I now can find it online! Not overly drying, but gets the dirt and grime off your face.</li>
    <li> Very good toner to use after washing face, gives you that tingling and clean feeling. However there&#x27;s too many strange ingredients to comfortably use on a daily (morning/evening) basis. Although I like it, because I have to pause and think about the ingredients each time when I decide to use it instead of a more natural toner, no five stars.</li>
    <li> This has a mild fragrance that is not repulsive or sickening.  It also has a little tingle to it when applied to the face.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Good for oil skin not for dry skin</li>
    <li> This product is awful.. it very strong on skin and makes you breakout more.. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin or red skin/rosacea.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of my blemishes very fast , and prevents them from coming back !!! It cleans deep down inside of the pores extremely well !!! There&#x27;s not a pimple on my face at this moment.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Very good price.  Does not dry out skin as much as Johnson and Johnson or Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear all of my blemishes and blackheads, but it does minimize them and speeds healing time.  I have used this for years (even when it was still packaged as the Triple Action Astringent) and I prefer it because it does not contain alcohol and my skin can tolerate it twice per day.  I use it in conjunction with non-Biore brand facewash, lotions, and serums.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works immediately to prevent, reduce, control acne on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and other acne medicines.  This is the only one that works.  And it starts working immediately.  I usually wash my face before I sleep and then dab my face with this stuff.  If there is a pimple ready to come out, I dab that spot with more of this stuff.  When I do this, I notice that the growth of new pimples is stunted, and the pimples start to fade away with daily use.  It may not work for everyone, but it really works great for my oily skin.</li>
    <li> Its okay. This astringent didnt do much in controlling oil or reducing my pimples. I still like my Clinique clarifying lotion better.</li>
    <li> This astringent really helps in keeping my skin clear. It has also helped to fade old acne scares.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore so Amazon it is! !!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face, I just have to make sure I put on my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I ran out of Triple Action Astringent and found this instead. The ingredients in this product are identical to those in Triple Action; they&#x27;ve just re-packaged it and marketed it as a new product to make it gender-neutral. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes to the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 2% Salicylic acid like a lot of other acne treatments, but the inactive ingredients distinguish it from some of the other toners/medicated pads I&#x27;ve used. It actually smells pretty pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t leave anything sticky behind, and the witch hazel does help reduce irritation. Also, if you are switching from medicated pads, the bottle of toner lasts a long time and you have the choice of using a less abrasive applicator (in my case, generic cotton squares). Definitely recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, if your skin is too sensitive to use the Biore toner every day, try alternating with one of the alcohol free varieties of Thayer witch hazel.</li>
    <li> This astringent is perfect for preventing acne and leaves you with a super clean, refreshed, and really nice cooling sensation. One of my favorite parts is that it smells really good which is hard to find in an astringent. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different astringents throughout my adult life, but this one beats them all.  From O.J.&#x27;s Beauty Lotion to Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean and Merle Norman Luxuvia toner, I was pleased with the results I experienced.  Yet, none of them exceeded the value or the overall results I achieved with this astringent.  Smaller pores, clear complexion, and clean skin have been the result for me WITHOUT the skin dryness I was expecting.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Product is the same that my wife gets in the big box stores. It is way more convenient to purchase online instead of waiting in line for a small product.&lt;br /&gt;She states she would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Also the prices is usually better on here.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal! Great product!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Biore products</li>
    <li> Nice product, affordable price</li>
    <li> An excellent product and like Biore&#x27; products in general.&lt;br /&gt;The Biore Blemish Treating Astringent leaves skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;refreshed and not taunt or dry and helps in keeping skin&lt;br /&gt;blemish free.</li>
