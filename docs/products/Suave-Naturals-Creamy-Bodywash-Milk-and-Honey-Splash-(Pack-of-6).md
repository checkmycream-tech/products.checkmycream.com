    <li> Great and difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  I enjoy using it. Was a good price from Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of Suave body wash in the past, but the Milk and Honey Splash is the best. I love the feeling after I&#x27;ve completed my shower. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out it feels soft, silky, and clean. The smell is incredible. The price of the 6-pak was the best bargain I&#x27;ve ever seen. I hope I can purchase this product at the same price in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and has a great lather to it.  I would recommend this to my friends and family</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and securely packaged.  This product goes a long way.  Just a squeeze on your washcloth, sponge or puff and you have&lt;br /&gt;oodles of suds.  The fragrance is subtle.  The soap makes your skin soft.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great Deal for subscribe and save. Our whole household uses it, so the bathroom smells quite delectable at all times.</li>
    <li> Excellent Suave choice in bodywashes.</li>
    <li> For many years I use body wash under Suave. I always purchased different variety of the body wash and it does not matter to me if people don&#x27;t like to use Suave body wash.</li>
    <li> A product that we always buy but now I can get in a larger quantity and exceptional value.  It is on my subscription list now!</li>
    <li> After using this bodywash for a couple of days I found myself being chased bears, well being chased more often than usual. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with this bodywash.</li>
    <li> Great price for this item. The shower soap does what it&#x27;s suppose to, cleans my skin. I used it a couple dozen times. For me, I really, really do not like the smell and will let my other family members use it.</li>
    <li> I gave up on using bar soap as every kind I tried either dried out my skin or irritated my delicate regions. I had a coupon for Suave body wash so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so thankful I did! Every time I take a shower now I feel like I stepped into the spa. This stuff smells like sugar cookies. It has the creamy consistency of an expensive lotion. It lathers amazingly well with just one squirt and leaves me smelling so delicious! I just want to kiss my skin when I get out of the shower. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive parts! Win-win!</li>
    <li> Decided to try these on subscribe and save. They are a good value. Moisturize well and are not too expensive. Replaced the more expensive Nivea I had been buying.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. We get it via &amp;#34;subscribe and safe&amp;#34; from Amazon, every 2-3 months, which helps us save 15% on the price.</li>
    <li> I gave this produce 5-stars because I know the company name its produces.  The Suave natural creamy body-wash is just great. The amount in the pack draw my attention especially cost of the pack.</li>
    <li> This body wash is the best moisturizer at the best price, especially in the 6-pack.  So convenient not to have to go to WalMart and get it, shipping is free with Prime membership!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but, does leave your skin soft.</li>

    <li> Smells great.  Suds up very well also.</li>
    <li> I love this warm, sweet scent</li>
    <li> Not as &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; as I would like. Has a nice, light scent that is not overpowering like some body washes can be. Not very moisturizing for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I usually like milk and honey flavored items but this I can&#x27;t stand. My grand daughter who is 7 likes it so she got them all.</li>
    <li> This product description clearly states pack of 6.  I received only one.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend because they do not sell this soap at our local store.  She was very happy with the service and quality of the soap.  Happy girlfriend&#x3D;happy me.</li>
    <li> Good body wash at a great price</li>
    <li> Love Suave bodywash, creamy - moisturizing and the sent is heavenly.  Hubby loves the smell.  I love the savings and how it makes my skin feel,</li>
