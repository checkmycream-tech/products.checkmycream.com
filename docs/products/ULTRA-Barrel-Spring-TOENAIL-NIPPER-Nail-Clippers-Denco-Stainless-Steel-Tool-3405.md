      <li>Feels good in my hand.</li>
      <li>we were sure these would be good clippers because of the rave reviews it had however</li>
      <li>High chrome flawless polished finish.</li>
      <li>, they must not have very strong nails if they are telling the truth..  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Its better to spend a bit more money and get a good German made one.</li>
      <li>Extremely happy, fantastic alternative to traditional clippers and great strong center spring.</li>
      <li>German ones for years and years that were great, but finally dulled.  </li>
      <li>Had to sharpen it first to get it to work at all.</li>
      <li>Heavy, works smoothly, and cuts easily.</li>
      <li>Just like the one I inherited from my father 55 years ago, which worked very well all those years.  </li>
      <li>Really helps in keeping toenails clipped.  </li>
      <li>Very disapointed.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cut .</li>
      <li>This one was made in Italy and it&#x27;s exactly like the old one; no difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them for less than three months, and they seem to cut OK.</li>
      <li>This one feels in my hands just as durable as the old one and so, naturally, I will pass it on to my grandson.</li>
      <li>Too much effort to cut my tough nails vs. other clippers I own.</li>
      <li>just bought and really like Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree Products and theydo</li>
      <li>Cuts thick toe nails easily.</li>
      <li>The photo looked just like the Italian professional clippers my wife and I</li>
      <li>Adequate but no more</li>
      <li>But the small arm on the bottom is too short to lock the clippers closed, so they don&#x27;t fit well in my drawer compartment or my travel toiletry kit.</li>
      <li>Found u can&#x27;t go &#x27;cheap&#x27; on these, especially with touch or thick nails, also known as bear claws!  </li>

<li> 6-10 dollars less expensive than similar quality at local stores.</li>
<li> maybe enough other customers were equally unhappy??  </li>
<li> Small size reduces needed leverage.</li>
<li> my husband who has thick toenails tried to cut his and all the clipper would do was make a mark on them..  if he tried to force a cut the nail was ripped..  </li>
<li> I have thick toe naills.</li>
<li> No, I am not happy with it.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> absolutely awful..  </li>

    <li> I have thick toe naills.These clippers are wonderful.</li>
    <li> absolutely awful..  it doesn&#x27;t warrant even one star..  we were sure these would be good clippers because of the rave reviews it had however, they must not have very strong nails if they are telling the truth..  my husband who has thick toenails tried to cut his and all the clipper would do was make a mark on them..  if he tried to force a cut the nail was ripped..  we were allowed to return these so maybe enough other customers were equally unhappy??  just bought and really like Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree Products and theydo not rip they nip..</li>
    <li> Rapid delivery, good quality and well designed product</li>
    <li> Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
    <li> They were purchased for my brother who is really impressed with them.</li>
    <li> GREAT.  finally a good pair.  Found u can&#x27;t go &#x27;cheap&#x27; on these, especially with touch or thick nails, also known as bear claws!  I have a fungus that causes nails to ridge and thicken up.  These are the best I&#x27;ve found.  iAd German ones for years and years that were great, but finally dulled.  Now I can snip or cut with no pain.......</li>
    <li> Just like one my father had years ago. Cuts thick toe nails easily. Feels good in my hand. I expect this to last for decades.</li>
    <li> Not quite the quality i had in my old Miller Forge clippers, not as heavy. Adequate but no more</li>
    <li> Had to sharpen it first to get it to work at all. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for less than three months, and they seem to cut OK. But the small arm on the bottom is too short to lock the clippers closed, so they don&#x27;t fit well in my drawer compartment or my travel toiletry kit. The photo looked just like the Italian professional clippers my wife and I used for years, but upon close inspection they appear to be an inferior product. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Just like the one I inherited from my father 55 years ago, which worked very well all those years.  That one was made in Germany and lost it in my travels.  This one was made in Italy and it&#x27;s exactly like the old one; no difference.  This one feels in my hands just as durable as the old one and so, naturally, I will pass it on to my grandson.</li>
    <li> No, I am not happy with it. Doesn&#x27;t really cut . Just sort of mashes.  Don&#x27;t like it at all. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> Too much effort to cut my tough nails vs. other clippers I own. Small size reduces needed leverage. Suggest buyers research and purchase a different product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and well packaged. High chrome flawless polished finish. Heavy, works smoothly, and cuts easily. 6-10 dollars less expensive than similar quality at local stores.</li>
    <li> Comments from husband.  Great.  Really helps in keeping toenails clipped.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy, fantastic alternative to traditional clippers and great strong center spring. I am looking forward to working with these. Thank you</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut nails well and it can&#x27;t be locked. Its better to spend a bit more money and get a good German made one.</li>
