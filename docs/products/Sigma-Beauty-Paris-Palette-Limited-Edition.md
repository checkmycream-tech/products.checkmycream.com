### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Anyhow Beautiful palette!</li>
      <li>As for the blushes, Peche is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Everything about it is perfect</li>
      <li>Sigma brushes are also the best</li>
      <li>As the product is wonderful</li>
      <li>This palette is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Beautiful palette.</li>
      <li>The Paris palette from Sigma is just beautiful, from the mosaic box itself to the glittering contents.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great all around.</li>
      <li>The packaging is sturdy AND adorable, the brushes are great, and the color payoff is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>The colors are gorgeous on my olive skin tone.</li>
      <li>Really good palette.</li>
      <li>Good colours with and without glitter.</li>
      <li>colors are unique and beautiful!</li>
      <li>Great colors, blend nicely and great price:)</li>
      <li>well worth it because the colors are just beautiful in person!</li>
      <li>Love the colors!</li>
      <li>I use this one and the blushes and the highlight I use everyday because they are just perfect for my skin tone, and the color are so beautiful and pigmented that when you apply look AMAZING... and the brushes that come with it are so great quality</li>
      <li>The colors are amazing.</li>
      <li>I am especially happy that these colors work well for my cooler skin tone, since it seems that most companies cater to people with more golden tones to their skin.  </li>
      <li>but this is the best so far!</li>
      <li>This palette is suitable for all season.</li>
      <li>Blend well, bright and bold</li>
      <li>The rouges are super good.</li>
      <li>The eye shadows are super good.</li>
      <li>There is a variety of finishes on the eyeshadows, from matte to sparkly, and some bright bold colors alongside more neutral (but not boring!)</li>
      <li>At a glance my favorite shade is Orsay, but Triomphe is my favorite shade to wear.</li>
      <li>My most favorite makeup palette ever.</li>
      <li>On top of that, there was no packing slip in my package for a return.</li>
      <li>I use it for every day make up and for more glamorous look.</li>
      <li>As lovely as the colors look in the pictures, they&#x27;re even better in person.  </li>
      <li>I love the colors, the feel of the shadows and blushes, and the adorable names they chose.</li>
      <li>how much more should I expect?</li>
      <li>I love this palette.</li>
      <li>I love the blush and highlighter.  </li>
      <li>LOVE all the sigma products</li>
      <li>Love the brushes.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it, the colors, the quality and the design.</li>
      <li>I simply adore this palette, from its gorgeous packaging to the great shades available.</li>
      <li>Loved the gift: another sigma brush is never too much!</li>
      <li>so I love that you get two full size brushes in this set!</li>
      <li>Great value for money, since this pallete is very complete.</li>
      <li>So many different amazing pallets, but this one is my very favorite.</li>
      <li>The mirror is fabulous and if you don&#x27;t want the mirror, you can fold it under to prop up the palette for easy, 45 degree access.</li>
      <li>Overall happy with the purchase and delivery.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I love this palette the most out of my entire collection.  </li>
      <li>I recently brought a Paris Eyeshadow and Blush Platte and a travel make up brush set, i was pleasantly surprised that the products were delivered so quickly and am very happy with the quality of the products.</li>
      <li>Completly in love with my Sigma Paris Palette Limited Edition, great combination of the intense colors.</li>
      <li>The brushes that it comes with are such good quality and even the packaging is just so feminine and well made.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use the eyeshadow too often as it&#x27;s so dark, but the colors are beautiful.</li>
      <li>I love it 2 much</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>the blushes included are very soft and the brush makes it super easy to apply them even for a novice like me.  </li>
      <li>I have SOOO much makeup from so many prestige high end cosmetics.</li>
      <li>The mirror is very large, the eye shadows blend easily, and the brushes are oh so soft!</li>
      <li>The colors go together really well, and it&#x27;s possible to create a very wide variety of looks with just this one palette, from work-appropriate neutral to date-night sexy or bright and daring.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this palette to anyone thinking of trying out Sigma, they&#x27;re my new favorite brand!  </li>
      <li>I used makeup remover to clean it off but this is a new product</li>
      <li>Can only recomend this palette :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at this palette since it first came out and just decided to buy it.  </li>
      <li>The shadows are very pigmented and blend amazingly easily, and Sigma always has colors with a twist: an unexpected duo-chrome (Triomphe), an unusual shimmer (Notre Dame), or a fun sparkle (Orsay).  </li>
      <li>I would advise buying directly from their site, however, since they usually have discounts and free gifts with purchase :)</li>
      <li>I love the colours (eye shadows), they are different and deep from what i have seen resently.</li>
      <li>The one I received has black mold along the left side with a bit on the bottom and top edges.  </li>
      <li>Considering how much you get in a single palette, it really is a bargain.</li>
      <li>Shadows are highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very pigmented with limited fallout, and the brushes are soft and apply the product</li>
      <li>Next time I will  just buy directly from Sigma.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was just dark eye shadow powder</li>
      <li>Did show up a little black/dirty from the black shadow but was easily cleaned with some makeup remover and a Qtip.</li>
      <li>Earned 5 stars specially because the two brushes (combined price of the two brushes are actually more expensive than the 49 bucks paid for the palette!!)</li>

<li> long to buy this palette of shadows, in September this year and we are in November and hope to date.</li>
<li> A little will definitely go a long way and this will last a very long time.  </li>
<li> Some fallout so treat like loose mineral powders.</li>
<li> It arrived with black residue all over the inside and outside of the pallette.</li>
<li> however if you go on there site check it out; also the gurus have a 10 bucks coupon off to use on sigma, i am not exactly sure if it has expires because i recently bought mine.</li>
<li> This was my first expensive palette i bought!</li>
<li> but the fallout might be messy for those who would.</li>
<li> However, the booklet it comes with is a waste of space because you could go on the youtube \\&quot;gurus\\&quot; who went to paris that was sponsor by Sigma, share their color of why they pick that color.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s stuck firmly to the compact plus all of the shadows are intact and show no sign of damage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a totally Paris obsessed person (this is David&#x27;s wife, by the way) and after I saw this online, I had to have it.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve been playing with it like crazy, creating lots of different looks.  </li>
<li> and I was so badly waiting for it to come earlier</li>
<li> Aside from that the mirror was dirty looking.</li>

    <li> The one I received has black mold along the left side with a bit on the bottom and top edges.  At first I thought it was just dark eye shadow powder but it&#x27;s stuck firmly to the compact plus all of the shadows are intact and show no sign of damage.  I am sending it back.</li>

At a glance my favorite shade is Orsay, but Triomphe is my favorite shade to wear. As for the blushes, Peche is perfect for me. I will definitely be recommending this palette to my friends and family!</li>

A little will definitely go a long way and this will last a very long time.  Sigma brushes are also the best so I love that you get two full size brushes in this set!</li>

    <li> Beautiful palette. Earned 5 stars specially because the two brushes (combined price of the two brushes are actually more expensive than the 49 bucks paid for the palette!!)</li>
    <li> long to buy this palette of shadows, in September this year and we are in November and hope to date. how much more should I expect? even as my credit card payment please me solve my problem</li>
    <li> This palette is absolutely gorgeous! The colors are amazing. You can create tons of different looks with this palette.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE all the sigma products but this is the best so far!</li>
    <li> If you are hesitating on buying this... dont. Get it. colors are unique and beautiful! I bought one for myself, and another as a gift for a friend!</li>
    <li> This was my first expensive palette i bought! well worth it because the colors are just beautiful in person! However, the booklet it comes with is a waste of space because you could go on the youtube \\&quot;gurus\\&quot; who went to paris that was sponsor by Sigma, share their color of why they pick that color. Furthermore, you will not be paying 13 bucks plus shipping like on here. Support sigma, yes, however if you go on there site check it out; also the gurus have a 10 bucks coupon off to use on sigma, i am not exactly sure if it has expires because i recently bought mine. So you would have to check it out and see where it would be cheaper to by. Anyhow Beautiful palette!</li>
    <li> Really good palette. The eye shadows are super good. Good colours with and without glitter. The rouges are super good. And the make up brushes are exelent. I love the colours (eye shadows), they are different and deep from what i have seen resently. Can only recomend this palette :)</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Blend well, bright and bold (eye primer makes a big difference though). Some fallout so treat like loose mineral powders. I DONT travel with theme but the fallout might be messy for those who would. Love the brushes. Overall happy with the purchase and delivery. Did show up a little black/dirty from the black shadow but was easily cleaned with some makeup remover and a Qtip.</li>
    <li> It arrived with black residue all over the inside and outside of the pallette. I used makeup remover to clean it off but this is a new product and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that. Aside from that the mirror was dirty looking. I&#x27;m questioning if this pallette has been used and returned. On top of that, there was no packing slip in my package for a return. Next time I will  just buy directly from Sigma.</li>
    <li> I love it 2 much&lt;br /&gt;good shipping&lt;br /&gt;thank you my dear</li>
    <li> My most favorite makeup palette ever. I have SOOO much makeup from so many prestige high end cosmetics. So many different amazing pallets, but this one is my very favorite. The colors are gorgeous on my olive skin tone. The brushes that it comes with are such good quality and even the packaging is just so feminine and well made. I love this palette. I want to buy extras just so that when they no longer are sold I can still have them to last as long as possible!</li>
    <li> The Paris palette from Sigma is just beautiful, from the mosaic box itself to the glittering contents.  There is a variety of finishes on the eyeshadows, from matte to sparkly, and some bright bold colors alongside more neutral (but not boring!) shades.  The shadows are very pigmented and blend amazingly easily, and Sigma always has colors with a twist: an unexpected duo-chrome (Triomphe), an unusual shimmer (Notre Dame), or a fun sparkle (Orsay).  The colors go together really well, and it&#x27;s possible to create a very wide variety of looks with just this one palette, from work-appropriate neutral to date-night sexy or bright and daring.  I am especially happy that these colors work well for my cooler skin tone, since it seems that most companies cater to people with more golden tones to their skin.  This is also the palette that got me started on wearing blush:  the blushes included are very soft and the brush makes it super easy to apply them even for a novice like me.  I would definitely recommend this palette to anyone thinking of trying out Sigma, they&#x27;re my new favorite brand!  I would advise buying directly from their site, however, since they usually have discounts and free gifts with purchase :)</li>
    <li> Great colors, blend nicely and great price:)</li>
    <li> I got my palette in the mail on Tuesday and I&#x27;ve been playing with it like crazy, creating lots of different looks.  I can honestly say that I love this palette the most out of my entire collection.  It&#x27;s almost dethroned Naked 2 by Urban Decay, which is quite a feat.  As lovely as the colors look in the pictures, they&#x27;re even better in person.  They&#x27;re very pigmented with limited fallout, and the brushes are soft and apply the product well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence because of the price - as I was - I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.  Considering how much you get in a single palette, it really is a bargain.</li>
