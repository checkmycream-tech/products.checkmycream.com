    <li> Gave as a gift and the recipient said they liked them a lot. Makes a nice present.</li>
    <li> Great product, gives you a total refreshing feeling. Very relaxing nice smell received this product at reduced cost for honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> These bath salts smell AMAZING. Definitely provides a relaxing and calming experience. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing!! I can&#x27;t wait to indulge in a hot bath and use this! So nice!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I bought to enjoy after a long days hard work . It really soothes and relaxes me to a point where I can fall right asleep. I&#x27;m buying more for family and friends, great gift ideas!</li>
    <li> These are an awesome gift for my wife...they came fast and she loves them</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very nice and smells lovely</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this stuff. Turns your bathtub into a spa. Turn down your lights, turn on your music and pour some of this salt into your bath and you&#x27;re good to go. The scent is amazing and it will relax your whole body.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I love the effect.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Smells great and is a great way to end the day!</li>
    <li> Love these salts.makes your skin smell soft while the smell relieves stress. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent. Relaxing.</li>
    <li> These bath salts smell amazing!  Leave your skin feeling great!!!</li>
    <li> These salts made a lovely, refreshing soak!  The aroma is wonderful and long lasting.  The salts left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  This product is a lot more expensive than many other brands of bath salts but, I can honestly say that I could tell the difference.  This is definitely a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves them! She said her skin feels amazing, the smell is perfect, and she said her favorite thing about them is they don&#x27;t leave a greasy film on the bathtub like other products she has tried, even products from places like Trader Joe&#x27;s. You can tell these are high quality and you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed these bath salts,the lavender relaxes you and leaves your skin soft. There are only 3 ingredients in this product,which I really like. They do have a strong lavender smell which for me is enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product with a lovely long lasting scent. This were perfect for my usual Friday evening relaxation session. The salt &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; quickly, and really helped to soften the water. This was especially noticeable for me since we have hard water and don&#x27;t use a water softener. I&#x27;m not usually a huge fan of Lavender scents, but this was actually very pleasant and not overpowering. I&#x27;m a new stay at home mom, and sometimes just taking a bath is all the &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time I get. These salts definitely made me feel relaxed and &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34;like. A little definitely went a long way. Love them and will be ordering more. I&#x27;ve tried other bath salts, and frankly found that plain old epsom salt was better at softening than they were. Also, I prefer baths salts that have a long lasting fragrance. Most other salts smell great at the beginning of the bath, but at the end there isn&#x27;t even a trace of scent left.</li>
    <li> These salts smell so nice. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. They are very aromatic, and calming. Nice to use in a warm bath.</li>
    <li> You will love these bath salts!!!  Lavender is by far my favorite essential oil and this container of bath salts is so fragrant!  It is heavenly scent to help you ease away those stresses that we all have.  I have used this for a few baths and I used a little with a little coconut oil added to it for a scrub.  It worked wonders as a scrub also.  I highly recommend you try these!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!  Ease your worries away~~~~~</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Quality product!</li>
    <li> The bath salts are amazing. The smell is great. They really help take care of your dry winter skin. A must buy.</li>
    <li> The lavender fragrance is so relaxing. I love the smell of lavender, but I often find some products are too strong. These lavender bath salts are just what I need after putting to kids to bed at the end of a hectic day.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful ... Really make you relaxed</li>
    <li> The lavender salts smell wonderful and my skin feels so soft. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Loved this! Made the water super soft and it smelled amazing</li>
    <li> Great. It was really relaxing and it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome... Nice and relaxing</li>
    <li> Smells good when I put into the bath and it totally relaxes my body. Exactly what I needed after a long day of stress. The lavender smell is subtle but it does relax me right away.</li>
    <li> Smelled great &amp; dissolved quickly. Also left my skin feeling softer than other bath salts I have tried that seemed drying.</li>
    <li> My own personal heaven. I just love these lavender bath salts. I was having a hard time sleeping and wanted to try something natural. Not only does this help me relax, it puts me right to sleep and my skin feels so soft.</li>
    <li> Deep lavender fragrance, nice mineral salts.</li>
    <li> These bath salts smell SO good and leave your skin soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Smells great, relaxing and I feel my skin soften</li>
    <li> After a work out or run, I&#x27;ve always relied on Epsom salt to relieve my tired an achy muscles.  I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with these bath salts as it seems to be comparable to Epsom while offering a fragrant scent.  I don&#x27;t recommend using this product in a hot tub due to the residue left behind.</li>
    <li> My skin is super soft after using these salts.  Also, it helped my back pain and was incredibly relaxing.  Yaay.</li>
    <li> Smells great. It make  your skins and water feel soft.</li>
    <li> This bath salt is definitely superior to most others I have used previously! I very much appreciate the minimal number of safe ingredients. As a highly sensitive person, I hate how most bath salts have tons of irritating fragrances added. With only sea salt, vitamin e, and lavendar essential oil I don&#x27;t have to worry about this issue with these high quality bath salts! I live a high stress lifestyle. I need bath salts like these to unwind once or twice per week, and I don&#x27;t want any added stress over harmful ingredients. The smell is divine and I will be back to purchase more! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I could smell these salts as I opened the box and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them! They dissolve quickly so you&#x27;re not left with residue on your bath tub. The aroma is amazing. I started to relax before I ever touched the water just from the scent.</li>
    <li> I would recommend bath salt to others. Has a pleasant smell. Make sure salt is completely dissolved be getting in. Salt is hard and will just the bottom of your feet.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the box, the first thing that amazed me was the wonderful lavender scent.  Then I took a bath with the salts.  It was like a nice spa experience.  The salts make your skin feel nice and soft, and clears and relaxes your mind!  Love these salts.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and relaxing. It really helps me after a long day.</li>
    <li> Love these bath salts! I purchased them for my girlfriend (who was very appreciative by the way), and she absolutely loves them!&lt;br /&gt;They smell terrific and are quite soothing so she says.</li>
    <li> Smells like lavender not some weird off smell like some do. Works good. Love it.</li>
    <li> VERY relaxing! My new favorite bath product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great. Left my skin very soft!</li>
    <li> Loooooovvve the smell of this bath salt. It&#x27;s a great relaxation when I put this in the bathtub.  Smell stays there for a long time. Salt dissolves pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!!Shipping was fast and I received it pretty quick.I could literally smell the scent of Lavender through the box it was shipped in and it smelled great!I am a Lavender fiend because of the benefits it provides me and when I seen this during a promotional offer I had to buy it!I love taking baths and I do not get to take those very often they are more like a 10-15minute shower now that I have a toddler.So I do not get the luxury of soaking for over an hour or so in the tub and relax anymore.I was very excited to try this out and was able to when my daughter went to bed.The directions calls for 1/2 a cup of bath salts per bath and sadly you only get 2 baths with this jar.But I really enjoyed my bath this lavender bath salts were amazing.I felt so relaxed and any aches or pains were washed away.It was a real treat to soak in this bath salt mix.I just love the way the smells were released while the bath salts dissolved.Great way to unwind after a long day or just pamper yourself.This bath salts from ZenBath comes in a 16oz jar and contains only 100% sea salt, vitamin e oil, &amp; Lavender essential oils.No other additives or anything else added to it.It is also made in USA.I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t have time to bathe (kids&#x3D;no time) but I did make time to try this out and it was amazing. I never really like the smell of lavender but this was not bad at it. Definitely made me relax.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are amazing, and smells great!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a bath after a long day and these bath salts make it glorious!  If you like lavender you will love these.  The scent is instantly relaxing!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
    <li> These bath salts smell wonderful and make the bath like a spa.  This is a much deserved luxury.  Don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> Oh - this smells great!  Leaves me so soft!</li>
    <li> This is a very refreshing bath salt. I usually take a warm bath when im feeling sore from working out and it has made it better. Would recommend to anyone who likes to have a refreshing bath</li>
    <li> While the product itself is nice - the amount you recieve for the price is a bit astronomical. There is only enough for approximately two baths. There are similar, cheaper products available.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Love it!</li>
    <li> This is such a Great value! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells divine! Nice sized jar of salts!  Has made bath time even more relaxing!</li>
    <li> These are excellent bath salts. They are great to relax in. I&#x27;ve even used them on a sprained ankle once - poured some in a big pan of hot water and dipped my feet in.&lt;br /&gt;They also smell great!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain here, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, after a long stressful day I put some in a bath and just got to relax. It is quite a large jar too so I have plenty left for several more baths. It dissolved quickly and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product. My wife loves it, its very relaxing and it looks and smells great. We really enjoy taking a bath with these salts and they are very refreshing. Great quality product and great presentation!</li>
    <li> These bath Salts smell absolutely wonderful.They make the water soft and very relaxing.My skin came out feeling very soft.You dont need to use alot</li>
    <li> These smell so good and make my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> Just used this today.  I was having a terrible day and so I took a bath. I was soothed and comforted by the light scent of lavender and my whole body was soft when I emerged feeling relaxed and calm from the tub.  I don&#x27;t soak in the tub often for lack of time. But I am so glad I had this around today. I feel so much better.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> These smell so good and I put them in my bath and it smelled awesome! I love these bath salts! I would recommend these to others for sure!</li>
    <li> Great on my skin and the smell reminds me of the spa.</li>
    <li> Very soothing. This is great after a long day.</li>
    <li> I use this product at least 3 times a week.  The lavender really sets into easing the mind and brings you to such a peaceful place.  My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward.  Definitely a product to help you reach your maximum zen!!</li>
    <li> As a mother of 3 little kids, this lavender bath salts make my bath time so relaxing, it&#x27;s always been a perfect thing to do to end a busy day.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with this product!  I love the smell and it makes for an awesome spa time.  The packaging is easy to open and the crystal are simple to use.  I love how the aroma awakens me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first. Lavender is not my favorite scent. Instantly, before I opened the package I could smell it. It has a wonderful relaxing scent. Not too overwhelming either.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful in the bath, and was great to soak my feet in as well.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Bought another one for a friend and she LOVES it! This is a great gift idea. Still using my container. :)&lt;br /&gt;I love this Bath salt by ZenBath. It is very effective. I started going to the gym after a very long break and as expected had very sore muscles. A nice soak in these bath salts helped me relieve tension and muscle discomfort. I agree with other reviewers, the quantity is quite generous and as claimed, a little goes a long way with this nourishing skin care formula. I also like the container it comes in, so easy to store. I use Epsom salts regularly but this bath salt is definitely more than that. Definitely buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love it!!! The jar came in a box without any cushion. I was scared it was broken but it&#x27;s fine. I am excited to bathe with it!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> They smell great and obsorbed easily in the water making a refreshing and relaxing bath. Very soothing smell</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; lavender fragrance and my bath feels so luxurious.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with lavender scent that last. These are great for those nights you just need to relax. ( for me almost every night) A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need to use much. Love them and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> So relaxing and lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was offered this at a low cost for my biggest review. The smell was absolutely amazing. I used about half for my bath and added some regular Epson salt. My skin felt great afterwards. It&#x27;s perfect for your bath before bed. The lavender is very relaxing.</li>
