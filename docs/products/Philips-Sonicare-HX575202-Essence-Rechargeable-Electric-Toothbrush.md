<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite Sonicare toothbrush. It is simple, effective and a Sonicare. What more can I say. The Sonicare toothbrush alone has prevented all cavities since I started using one. I used to have 1-2 cavities per year before my dentist suggested I invest in a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this model to the other fancier models I have owned in the past. It just seems beefier and made to last . Sometimes less is more. And the power on this model is just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Read the instuctions. Do not press while brushing.  If you are sloppy, unscrew the brush &amp; dry under it, and the holder.  Do not run the handle under the water.  Then you will be happy...and smile!!</li>
    <li> We have used the first edition Sonic care brush for 9 years. I think that is a first ,to use the same one that long! It finally died, so we replaced it with the Sonicare Essence e5500. It brushes vibrantly,the handle is turned so the liquid doesn&#x27;t run down your hand.Best of all,it seems to run longer. We are very pleased with our purchase.                                             D. Jones</li>
    <li> After reading a ton of reviews on the different types of electric toothbrushes I decided to give this one a shot and we LOVE it!! It works great, my mouth feels very clean, the timer is very handy and it&#x27;s not so loud that wakes me up when he uses it at 5 in the morning. Definitely worth the buy and cheaper here than in the store.</li>
    <li> We have been using Sonicare products for about 10 years now and love them. They really do a great job removing stains and keeping teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric toothbrush based on good reviews on amazon. However I had predetermined I wanted a Philips electric toothbrush. I was very impressed with their customer service on my previous toothbrush. After having problems with it initially, they quickly sent me a replacement. That&#x27;s what good service, and backing up your product should be like.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using a regular brush again.  Admittedly the first couple times can be somewhat shocking to have it gyrate so vigorously, but you get used to it with in a couple days.  In short, this brush makes you feel like you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist every day.  My teeth are also noticeably whiter after roughly 4 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Great replacement toothbrush for an older model sonic that was left behind on a trip. The longer, more narrow brush head is great. After trying the e5500, was glad to have lost my other sonic! The carrying case is an added bonus! I love the 30 second timer as it ensures I brush evenly (and long enough!). My dentist loves that I use the sonic, as well!</li>
    <li> I love this simple, no-frills model that has just what I need. It has the quadpacer 30-second interval timer. The price was great and the toothbrush performance can&#x27;t be beat. I opted not to get one of the fancier models that has tons features that really aren&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Wanted just the basic sonicare, with two brushes.  Didn&#x27;t want all the extra settings, this is what we wanted, happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I have use the Sonicare toothbrush for about 10 years now.  I had gingivitis (bleeding gums) before I started using the Sonicare.  After about 6 months my gums were healthy and my teeth have never been cleaner.  I would recommend the Sonicare to anyone.</li>
    <li> A good product recommended by my dentist. I like the new 30 second pause. This is my second sonicare. I would like the brush replacements to stay standard. The only reason I had to replace my old unit is that the brushes were no longer available. Buy lots of brushed in case that happens again!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USEING THIS BRAND OF T/B FOR 3YRS. NOW IM UPGRADING TO THE ONE MY HUSBAND HAS.I&#x27;VE HAD THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CAVITIES EVER. IT&#x27;S SO WORTH THE MONEY ESPECIALLY IF YOU BUY FROM AMAZON.SO JUST BUY IT YOU NEVER REGRET IT.........</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.    Unfortunately, I have had to buy three of these over the last two years, since the button that turns the brush on has broken in the first two, each after about two years of use.    If Philips fixes this, they have a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  I love the 4 - 30 second timers...one for each quadrant.  I was disappointed that the base was not solid.  The base/handle is constructed of two pieces.This is unlike my original which was a solid base/handle.  There is more dripping with this 5500 type of base/handle.  I was wondering what the reason is.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Owned a Sonicare original for over 10 years until the batteries finally wouldn&#x27;t hold charge for about 2 days. Bought a new e5500. After 24hrs of charging it will run for about 2 minutes. If unused, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge after 30 minutes (elapsed time, not 30 minutes of use!).  Seems like the Philips buy-out ruined their quality control. Very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Essence 5500 is an excellent power toothbrush, and it replaces a previous Sonicare toothbrush that I used for many years. The new model has a redesigned head that works even better and is easier to clean. Sonicare recommends dividing the cleaning chore into four zones: inside upper, outside upper, inside lower and outside lower, and the brush pauses every 30 seconds to remind you to shift to the next zone. The sonic head seems a little harsh at first, if you are not used to a powered toothbrush, however this impression goes away quickly. To lessen the shock, this brisk action is diminished for the first 12 brushings. To paraphrase Lee Iacocca, if you can find a better toothbrush, buy it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used.  My teeth feel really clean through the entire day.  I have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month. It is wonderful! My teeth are whiter and feel like I have just been to the dentist. My wife is using it as well and feels the same way. We think it is such a great product we even purchased one for our parents. You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Got this toothbrush over 3 years ago.  For the first few weeks of brushing it feels pretty strange and now I cannot imaging my life without it!  I have given these as birthday presents to my ENTIRE extended family.</li>
    <li> This is superior to the other electric toothbrushes I have owned. My only comment of caution would be that the TRIAL PERIOD-which lasts at least a week-was a bit off-putting.  It took a while before I could get used to the angle of the brush and the vibration--each time I would hit the edge of my tooth it was as if I was in the dentist&#x27;s chair.  That being said, as soon as I became comfortable with the brush, the vibration seemed to be less and less. Now I look forward (almost) to using this toothbrush as it does an amazingly thorough job at cleaning. Highly recommend--just be patient while you get used to it!</li>
    <li> I just got this sonicare brush yesterday and have used it twice now. The first time I literally felt like my brain was still rattling about an hour after I brushed. This morning I brushed again and enjoyed it much more. It does really get your mouth feeling clean, and I think the more and more I use it the better each time will feel. The quadrant timer function is a little wierd at first. The beep is barely audible. However, it&#x27;s almost like the pulsation of the moving brush kinda pauses as it beeps and to me that is a better indication of the 30 seconds. I LOVE that the head is SOOO small and can reach all the way to the back of my mouth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to see that there really are no moving parts. Even the charger base is just a flat area that you put the bottom of the handle base (also flat) on. Even the area that you hook up the head to is just flat with no moving parts. It&#x27;s kinda wierd, but I like it. I feel like there&#x27;s less room for me to screw something up! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this. I hope it&#x27;ll make my \\&quot;brites brighter\\&quot;. I think it will. It does really make you feel fresh, clean and scrubbed up.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush saved me from expensive gum cleaning.  I made an appointment to get my 6mm gum pockets treated with cleaning agents and antibiotics.  After hearing that I bought this toothbrush and set to work while my appointment came near.  Due to scheduling conflicts my appointment ended up getting delayed 2 months.  After dutifully flossing almost daily and using this gem once a day (plus regular toothbrush 1x a day), I was very glad to hear the hygienist tell me that my deep pockets were gone and no treatment was necessary.  Even with the co-pay, this toothbrush paid for itself.  Outstanding!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used!  Your mouth feels totally clean after use, and it has to be good for your gums and teeth!</li>
    <li> Best power toothbrush for the money.  Your teeth do feel like coming out of the dentist everyday.  I agree with other reviewers that the extra toothbrush is great. Brushes do wear out quickly.  Nice feature is a slight pause when it is time to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.I would have given this brush a \\&quot;five star\\&quot; but you have to keep brush charging all the time (energy waste)</li>
    <li> Initially I feared the arm to the brush was too spindly and would easily break.  Also thought the brush itself was too small.  In fact, though, it works great and I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall performance.</li>
    <li> I love the way my teeth feel \\&quot;dentist office clean\\&quot; after every brush.  I also like the smaller angled head.  I had an older model from about 8-10 years ago that wouldn&#x27;t recharge any more so I bought this one.  It&#x27;s head was straight out from the handle and much larger and less comfortable to have in my mouth.  I also got a great deal on this from Amazon compared to what I would&#x27;ve paid locally, plus I avoided sales tax and had free shipping!</li>
    <li> I really hate brushing teeth.  This device really gives me the willies when I use it.  So far my teeth are a lot cleaner then when I used an old fashioned tooth brush.  It takes some time to get used to the tooth buzzing willies that come with the sonic cleansing action.</li>
    <li> This product is unreal. My wife got me one for Christmas. After one use, my teeth felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning. You know that feeling where your tongue thinks your teeth are slick as ice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, something else I noticed was my stains were going away on my teeth and they were getting white quicker than all the different whitening agents I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use a regular toothbrush again, the difference is so obvious that I feel foolish for using anything else all this time!</li>
    <li> I think that this thing is great.  Pro&#x27;s: It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, it moves the brush heads.  Set up was easy.  Recharging the battery was/is simple.  Travel case appears sturdy.  It comes with two heads, which we use for me and the wife.  I think that my teeth have gotten a shade lighter, my teeth are pretty coffee and smoke stained.  If you actually read the documentation that comes with it, it will tell you that the brush will pause momentarily to let you know that its been thirty seconds and to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth, (the manual suggests top outside, then inside, then bottom outside, then inside).  Cons: If you switch out the heads frequently, as we do, then you will want to make sure that the brush head is fully on the main unit, otherwise it will humm loudly.  Not a big deal, just do while your brushing.  If you move the brush head out of your mouth while brushing, be prepared to have toothpaste spray all over the place.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t have any real cons, its just that I have to get used to how this thing operates.  Other thoughts: I think that I will purchase another main unit so that when I leave town on business I can take it with me and leave one for my wife, who absolutely loves this thing.  Oh, don&#x27;t try to put toothpaste on the brush head when its turned on.  My experience with that was that the toothpase simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on it! :)</li>
    <li> Not much to say that others haven&#x27;t said already.  The tooth brush works great.  I have noticed a significant improvement in whiteness and overall clean feeling.    Also, I use a Swedish smokeless tobacco product which can cause rough patches on the gums and yellowing between the teeth.  A completely unexpected benefit, this toothbrush eliminated both problems within a week.</li>
    <li> This my first time for an electric toothbrush.  I found it rather tickled my mouth, if that makes sense.  The vibration is a different feeling but the results are fantastic.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews for various models, this one made the most sense.  It has the quad pacer, battery life alert, and an extra brush head - costing less than the more expensive, newer \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; models.  Plus I followed the advice of others and charge it up, take it out of the cradle and wear it right down, and I get a good two weeks @ twice a day before I need to charge again.   The brush head is much smaller than other cheaper electric models and it really gets into every crevice.  My dentist recommended a Sonic model after a cleaning and said you can over brush and get receding gums. As for the vibration, you get used to it after a while, and my teeth feel SOOOOO clean! So go ahead and use a little of your tax refund money and treat yourself...or save it and spend SO much more in the dentist chair later on LOL!</li>
    <li> I picked out this brush by going to amazon and finding the best reviewed toothbrush, which was this one, so there are already a ton of great reviews explaining how good this thing is, but it was so good I had to add my own as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Philips gear, i think they have great quality (already have and love one of their waterproof electric razors) and this is no exception. The whole toothbrush unit is sealed totally, not even any metal contacts (the charging base is similarly featureless, the charging takes place by induction). The heads are very solid and simple, and they have a big powerful magnet projecting out the base, so it&#x27;s easy to store all your spare heads by sticking them on the side of the bathroom cabinet. The head of the brush is also really small, so it&#x27;s VERY easy to reach around your mouth and polish every single surface in their, which was never possible for me with a manual toothbrush head. And it all feels very tough, the carrying case that comes with it (room enough for a disassembled body and one head) is also really nice, simple and tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it is easy enough, although it did take a few days to get used to the way it works (like never scrubbing, just slowly polishing the teeth with the head, and never taking it out without turning it off first to avoid toothpaste spray going everywhere). The &#x27;quadpacer&#x27; thing is annoying at first but now I like it, it&#x27;s easy to move over every tooth in a corner of your mouth and at the little pause move on to the next without thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work as advertised with stains, I had some coffee stains on my lower front teeth, and within two weeks they were almost entirely gone, in fact all my front teeth are much white now. And another advantage is that you really do have that &#x27;straight from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling. Sometimes i&#x27;ll catch myself running my tongue over my teeth just enjoying the smoothness. It&#x27;s a massive difference compared to manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush is that the charger is not 110/240 like most chargers are, so I had to go out and buy a 240 -&gt; 110 voltage convertor to use it here in Europe, but that&#x27;s not a big deal compared to amount I like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is fantastic, I keep it off the charger and use it until it runs down after advice I saw here at amazon. And it has a lovely way of saying it has a low charge, a little burping vibrating beeping spasm after your two minutes are up. Very mac-like too with a little white light in the switch that indicates low power and charging states.ke about this brush is that the charger is not 110/240 like most chargers are, so I had to go out and buy a 240 -&gt; 110 voltage convertor to use it here in Europe, but that&#x27;s not a big deal compared to amount I like this brush.

    <li> For years I have used the Braun Oral B. It was fine and less expensive than the Sonicare. After the Oral B died, my dentist recommended the Sonicare. Though it is more expensive than the Braun, it is head and shoulders above it in quality and cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Had a different brand older version and this is far superior.  Does a much better job cleaning teeth.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Sonic toothbrush..I like it so much that when it is time to replace it I buy another one.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I had so so so many problems with my teeth over the years and every time I went to the dentist I had to go back several more times to get cavities and such filled.    At my last dentist appointment, a little over 6 months from purchasing this product, I had absolutely no cavities! My dentist and his staff were impressed and I was happy I didn&#x27;t have to go back four or five more times.    Ironically, I do have to go back to get my wisdom teeth ripped out, but what toothbrush can really prevent that?</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and glad that I bought it.  After reading many reviews on the sonicare essence, I had to try it out myself and so far it&#x27;s a pretty Great toothbrush! :)</li>
    <li> Seems to be a better toothbrush than the one my dentist was hawking and sold me for twice as much. Seems to clean my teeth better too. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, it does a good job of brushing your teeth. Great service and good prices.  This was the best price around on the net and in the stores.</li>
    <li> I had my Sonicare Advantage for 7+ years before it bit the dust with a bad switch.  So I just replaced it with the Essence which is close to the original. I was a little concerned that they had changed the design after reading some reviews, but it&#x27;s as close to the Advantage as you can get.  Of the concerns was liquid getting under the brush head unit, thus the model not lasting very long.  Since I&#x27;ve had this unit for only a week, I&#x27;ll have to see if this one will last another 7 years; it should with proper care.  But the other concern was a non issue with me, probably because I learned how to use it the right way.    As the manual says, the biggest thing is to keep your lips closed around the brush head.  It takes a little getting used to, but with practice it becomes second nature. It prevents that liquid from running down the handle or spattering all over the place.  Also, don&#x27;t use as much toothpaste as you would normally use with a manual toothbrush; you don&#x27;t need it and all it does is make a ton of suds you don&#x27;t need and can&#x27;t contain inside your mouth while brushing.  I store my unit in the charger between uses and store the brush head in the holder each time.  Also, after rinsing the brush, let it vibrate pointing the brushes down into the sink to shake off the excess water and then cap it.  With proper care and use, this thing should last a very long time and keep your gums and teeth healthy and happy and maybe even spend less time in the hygienist&#x27;s chair.</li>
    <li> My last Phillips electric toothbrush lasted 10 years!!!  This model is easier to use, priced well, &amp; I hope lasts as long. I killed my 1st brush by letting water get into the charger base. Be sure to wipe handle and base dry...good prodct.</li>
    <li> When I told my friends I bought the Sonicare, they said \\&quot;it&#x27;s about time.\\&quot;   It does taking some getting used too, but it does a great job.  The fact that it&#x27;s timed makes sure you get all your teeth cleaned.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to avoid the spill-age of toothpaste while the moving the brush in my mouth. lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and they&#x27;ve all lasted quite a while before the battery dies out. I feel like it cleans my teeth better than a regular toothbrush and I know I must brush my teeth longer with this since it doesn&#x27;t turn off until you&#x27;ve brushed for two minutes.  The only thing I would like it to do is beep at the 30-second intervals.  It only has a brief pause.  I thought I picked up the same model I had previously which beeped, so if an audible reminder is important to you, this isn&#x27;t the model that beeps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric toothbrush recently and am sorry I did.  Although the manual does not mention it, Sonicare expects you to:1) remove the brush unit from the handle,2) clean it, and 3)store it separate from the handle each time you use the toothbrush.  I recently had trouble replacing the brush unit and called Sonicare for help, only to find out the operator knew less about the toothbrush than I did and was unaware of the cleaning procedure outlined in the manual.  I finally managed to get the brush off but have been having a difficult time finding a place where I can purchase the toothbrush unit, which needs to be replaced every 3 months!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  My dentist advised me to purchase an electrical tooth brush because my teeth were so bad and my periotontic was getting worse everytime I saw him for my dental appointment.  He even put me for every 2-month cleaning schedule for a whole year.  Of course, my dental insurance only allowed me to clean my teeth twice a year and I needed to pay on my own expense for the extra cleaning services.  I used this tooth brush for a month long.  Since then, I felt my teeth were clean and refresh in my mouth.  My next dental appointment is approaching and I hope my dentist can re-schedule me for every 6-month.</li>
    <li> Love my Sonicare! I&#x27;ve been using one for years. The new one I got for Christmas is even better than my old one.</li>
    <li> This item was a replacement for my original Sonicare.  I am more than please with it because it has saved m e a bundle of money.  I have problem teeth, and prior to the Sonicare I regularly contributed to the Dentist in a big way.  Now all I need to do is 2 cleanings per year.  This really works!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare purchase (as a gift).  These toothbrushes pay for themselves many times over in dental health, brightening smiles, and improving gum health, and will also decrease dental expenses.  This is a great deal.  Positive transaction, as usual.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks and find it very efficient in cleaning my teeth.  I would recommend that anyone who is looking for a battery-run toothbrush to consider getting the Sonicare Essence.</li>
    <li> We bought this in November and have had mold issues within the brushhead mechanism. We have cleaned it, even soaked it in bleach but it&#x27;s a PIA to continue to try to cope with the design flaw. Additionally, it is true that the handset is very difficult to keep clean and collects water and toothpaste residue. Even the threads around the outside of the handle are difficult to keep clean.  We will be looking at either Oral B - Pulsonic, or another SoniCare with the pin-type brush head attachment.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a good sonicare.  the more expensive are more trim and easier to hold, but they work the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used sonicare for my electric toothbrush needs and they haven&#x27;t disappointed. I upgraded my old one and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Not complicated to use and has built in 2 minute timer.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved this brush through amazon. Wow, what a diffrence i can see already. After waiting the recomended 24 hour charge time i used my brush and it was one of the deepest cleans i have gotten since i went to the dentist.    I am a chewer, and from that i have some stains on my front teeth that i have always hated. After using this tooth brush only three times i see a difference in not only teeth color (much whiter) but also gum health. My gums are becoming healthier with every use.    Some things to be ready for:    1) The brush head is very small for my mouth, it is perfect for someone with small teeth and a small mouth. I wish the brush head was a little bigger.     2) It tickles at first. Very much so. I didnt have any problem with it realy but it did make me laugh a little when i did the back of my front teeth. This tooth brush will progressivly get stronger over 12 uses. I think this feature is nice because if you have never used one before it can be a bit much at first.     3) Make sure you turn it on when its in your mouth and turn it off before you take it out. I had to clean my mirror three times so far because the vibrations sling toothpast every where lol.    All in all this is the first sonic toothbrush i have ever used, but because of the results i have seen so far and the price i am now a sonic user for life.    -Kalvin</li>
    <li> Great price for a great toothbrush. Not the top of the line model, but does everything I need. Only thing missing is the \\&quot;remaining charge meter\\&quot; on handle, so you don&#x27;t know exactly how much charge is left. For this price you can get two and always have one on stand by. Also worth noting, the brush from other models do fit this one too.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this sonicare package.  great toothbrush, convenient carrying case, extra head - all for under $70.  Quick shipping a plus.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ... had an old one ... it finally died and had to buy a new one ... it is better than I expected ... light weight and glides effortlessly over my teeth ... LOVE IT .... Oprah should have given this away!!</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth feeling cleaner than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used. My oral hygienist mentioned that it&#x27;s the best out in the market, very good for the gums too. I jumped on it. Every piece of advice she&#x27;s ever given me was correct. The brush starts off gentle and builds up for the first 12 days. I felt a bit sore and uncomfortable around days 4-6 but then I got completely used to it. I think I notice an improvement in the stain department too. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes would never go back to a manual toothbrush again.  Have tried other brands but always go back to Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Has lasted us a long time.  High quality, would buy again</li>
    <li> this is a replacement for my previous sonicare which i had for 4+ years and even though this doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bells and whistles, it does what its supposed to do and it does it very well....highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Easy to us and appears to clean teeth much better than just using any normal toothbrush. I have thoroughly brushed with a manual brush and then went back over my teeth with the Essence and managed to dislodge additional food particles stuck between teeth before flossing. Highly effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this after the dentist recommended this particular brand of toothbrush to my wife. We bought this particular model because it came with a spare head. I was always skeptical of electronic toothbrush condemning them for making humans more lazy. I felt this was for lazy people who do not want to move their hands around while brushing.  The fist time, I even found it uncomfortable to have a vibrating brush in my mouth. Just felt very odd. At times when the non bristle part of the brush touched my teeth I thought my teeth would break with this amount of vibration. But, I learnt to use it properly in a couple of days and I can feel my teeth so much cleaner than ever before.  In the words of the dentist \\&quot;Each time I use it, my teeth feel as clean as I have gotten it cleaned from a dentist\\&quot;  If you have never tried out an electronic toothbrush, I encourage you to try it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does exactly what other reviewers have stated.  Makes your mouth and teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned every time you use it.  Personally I did not find the vibration or sound bothersome, though, it is a little loud. I consider this a minor flaw when I can get dentist-clean teeth everyday at home. I am pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Some other versions of Philips Sonicare have more \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;, but the don&#x27;t really add much and those models cost almost twice as much.  There&#x27;s an even cheaper version, but it doesn&#x27;t have the Quad-pacer feature, which is important for making sure you brush long enough.</li>
    <li> I had a prior Sonicare toothbrush that lasted me for about 8 years.  This is the best  toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Your teeth feel so clean its fantastic!</li>
    <li> I first heard about Sonicare tooth brushes from Oprah Winfrey about 15 years ago. It&#x27;s not that I often watch her show, but one time I did and at that time she wholeheartedly recommended Sonicare. She was absolutely correct!! Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be without a Sonicare tooth brush even for even one day. These tooth brushes will save you mucho dental bills and will be instrumental in promoting tooth and gum health. Of course you still have to floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 3 or 4 of these brushes over the past 15 years or so and not one has stopped working due to mechanical failure. Just like the energizer bunny, these brushes keep on going and going. The only weak point with the tooth brush is that the battery wears out after 5 or 6 years. Sonicare could remedy this by making their brushes with a detachable battery pack so you could easily replace the battery. However, if they did this, it would reduce the number of tooth brush sales they make and and would reduce their coporate profit because the brushes would probably last 15 to 20 years. Planned obsolescence is alive and well in the Good Old U. S. of A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read on other reviews that you can increase battery life by charging the battery fully and then using it (discharging) until battery power is fully depleted. This I have read will eliminate to some extent the \\&quot;battery memory issue\\&quot; where batteries do not hold a charge as well or for as long if you do not fully discharge it before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 5 to 7 years from now when you need a new Sonicare, make sure you remove the nickel cadmium battery and dispose of it properly. Ni Cads are nasty on the environment and must be properly recycled. There are instructions in the owners manual on how to disassemble the unit for battery removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respect your teeth! Buy a Sonicare tooth brush!your teeth! Buy a Sonicare tooth brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare for years. I brush twice a day for two minutes and floss once a day and have not had any cavaties in that time. The things I like best about the Sonicare are the brushing action, 2-minute timer broken into 30-second intervals, and the ability to always maintain a full charge. The units wear out after a while though, which is not surprising for a rechargeable battery driven device.</li>
    <li> This item works great plus it is recommended by dentist all over. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one, it is great.[[ASIN:B000AMRIIK Philips Sonicare Essence e5500 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> I like the product but I do not think it is functioning properly. I would like to talk with someone about it.</li>
    <li> I know it sounds cheesy, but I honestly love this toothbrush! I have been using an electric Sonicare toothbrush for over 8 years now and will never change brands. It works wonderfully! The battery stays charged for a long time, the charger is small and convenient, and I change the toothbrush head every 3-4 months. I am kind of hygiene freak and my dentist always tells me what wonderful teeth I have so I love it. I even convinced my boyfriend to get one too and he loves it. Nothing is better then fresh breath!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Sonicare electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years. The Elite model was my favorite, but it failed prematurely due to a problematic on/off switch (rubber covering failed).  The first time, it failed under warranty, but the second failure wasn&#x27;t covered (they&#x27;ll only replace it once).  Based on feedback from a Sonicare customer service rep, I recently replaced it with the more basic Sonicare Essence e5500 model; but it was big, clunky and noisy, so I returned it. Instead I purchased an Oral B, which I love; very happy I made the switch.  The quality of Sonicare products seems to have slipped.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes ever since they came out. They really make a difference. Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I have found  I highly recommend getting one from Amazon</li>
    <li> This is a great product as I had used a previous model for several years.  My one complaint is the handle is very slippery and you have to be careful while using it as it hard to turn it to different positions unless you keep a firm grip on it.</li>
    <li> Probably the best bettery operated toothbruch on the market.  I loved it from the start.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare power toothbrush for a number of years, &amp; plan to always use one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare toothbrushes since they came out.  My father is a dentist and we got some samples to try out.  I had tried the Oral-B rotary style brushes and I feel that the sonicare is superior and the brush heads seem to last longer.  Plus, with rotary there is more friction which, if you overbrush, can wear down your enamel and possibly hurt your gums (many people do not know that you can overbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken the sonicare on travel many times for weeks on end and the battery life is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people find it difficult to pay close to $100 for a toothbrush and then having to buy replacement brush heads at $10 a piece every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can afford not to use a sonicare.  Your dentist will definitely be able to tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there is no substitute for flossing.  When they come out with one, someone will become a multi-millionaire.</li>
    <li> This is the third Sonicare tooth brush I have used these past years.  It requires very little maintenance and is quite efficient at promoting oral health.  My visits to the dental hygenist reveal minimal amounts of calculus thanks to the Sonicare Essence brush.[[ASIN:B000AMRIIK Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd sonicare toothbrush I have purchased.  It was recommended by my dental hygenist and I have been totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> this is my first electric toothbrush...... love it!!  feels like a professional cleaning everytime.  i like the auto timer feature too.  keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Been a Sonicare user for years.  Going back to the E-series after failures on some of the \\&quot;newer and better\\&quot; models bought for my wife (the ones including the UV sanitizer) that just stopped working or charging.  The E-series seems rock solid.  Shipping was very fast.  However, a pet peeve.  The packaging of the unit was the too typical almost invulnerable sealed plastic.  HATE IT!  Some day someone is going to manage to cut an artery and die opening one of these packages.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a gift, and bought this for my dad for Christmas.  We both LOVE this power toothbrush.  My teeth ARE getting whiter, and they feel so clean - like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;ve never used any other toothbrush that left my teeth feeling as clean.  I&#x27;ve not had any problems with mine, at all.</li>
    <li> good product improved over last model. the brissels are stronger and the charge lasts longer. it feel better in your hand</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare died so I got this one for my birthday.  I don&#x27;t like it nearly as well.  The handle has no rubber on it and when wet, it slips out of my hand.  DUMB!  The toothbrush is smaller too and I don&#x27;t like that as well.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting in all the cracks and crevices.  Just not the quality I have come to expect.  Other bummer is that it is a different charging unit from my husband&#x27;s.....why not make them uniform????  I guess that&#x27;s too much to expect.    UPDATE 8/11.  This unit DIED this month.  That&#x27;s LESS THAN A YEAR!  Do NOT buy this model.  I asked my dentist what the best method for brushing my teeth and he still said Sonicare, so I have purchased another model.  If this one does not serve me well, I will switch brands.  My first Sonicare lasted well over 5 years, but this one.....a total lemon.</li>
    <li> Brushing correctly with this toothbrush, does clean you&#x27;re teeth like you&#x27;ve just come from the denist.  Highly, highly recommend, so did my dentist.</li>
    <li> This is the way to go.  If you need bells and whistles on your toothbrush, order the 9800 model.  Both models will clean your teeth the same way.</li>
    <li> It took a little time getting used to the action of this toothbrush but I really like it now.  I won&#x27;t know whether it has accomplished my goal until several months down the road but in the mean time I at least know I am brushing my teeth the full 2 minutes and sometimes more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for years, getting my first one after I was diagnosed with gum disease.  I don&#x27;t really know whether it helps with gum disease -- I don&#x27;t really think that any \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; below-the-surface cleaning is going on -- but there&#x27;s no doubt that the vigorous brushing (I think they say 33,000 strokes per minute!) keeps your teeth clean!  (By the way, this is my first time of buying this model.  I used to use their original model (the one with the straight-line brushes), but they no longer sell that model with the additional \\&quot;30-second timer\\&quot; (when you turn the brush on, it runs for 2 minutes; with the 30-second timer, you also get a beep every 30 seconds so you can brush a different \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; of your mouth, which is very helpful).  This model was the cheapest one I could find that also had the 30-second timer.)  There&#x27;s no question that after you&#x27;ve used a Sonicare, if you for some reason have to brush by hand again, you&#x27;ll realize what a mere \\&quot;lick and a promise\\&quot; cleaning you were giving your teeth before!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000AMRIIK Philips Sonicare Essence e5500 Power Toothbrush]]  I had an older unit that finally stopped working, so I decided to purchase another one.  The e5500 has some new \\&quot;timer\\&quot; features that slightly \\&quot;burp\\&quot; at 30 second intervals to notify you to move to another quadrant of your mouth.  This model comes with an extra brush head and a travel case. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, in great shape, and works perfect.  It keeps the teeth clean, makes your mouth feel refreshed, and stimulates your gums.  The timing mechanism is particularly  handy.</li>
    <li> Great product for dental care. The only drawback is the cost of the replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> We love our new Sonicare Essence e5500! This is our second Sonicare toothbrush, the old one finally giving up after nearly nine years of use by two of us. This new one is lighter weight, gives a signal when to switch positions and even beeps when its time to recharge it. We&#x27;ve taken it on a couple of short trips and the travel case works great. The only improvement we can think of would be for the travel case to hold two heads instead of just one, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to pack the second one separately. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used several different electric toothbrushes over the years and the Phillips Sonicare is hands down the best.  The speed of the Sonicare is much better than my previous toothbrushes as well.  I just got back from the dentist and the results proved how much better the Sonicare is as much dentist said the amount of plaque and the overall health of my teeth is much better than last time.</li>
    <li> Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.     1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That&#x27;s what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.     They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)    2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don&#x27;t have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son, who has special needs.  It replaced a previous model that has been discontinued, and for which replacement heads are no longer available.  Both toothbrushes have made a great improvement in my son&#x27;t oral hygiene.  It is very easy to use, gets to all areas of his mouth. and cleans thoroughly.  His dentist is very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> The sonic toothbrush is pretty good it works for me doesn&#x27;t grind your gum to the bone and does a pretty good job and yes flossing is still a must but all in all the sonic has a 2min timer shuts off,, charges well and holds a good charge for a pretty long time,,,it&#x27;s good wish I had one about 20 years ago,,</li>
    <li> This is my third sonicare, so I obviously like this product overall and how it performs. The one thing I don&#x27;t care for on this model is that the handle is a bit too thick, in that it feels large in my hand (and I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;8\\&quot; woman), so if you&#x27;re smaller than me, it might seem uncomfortably large for you, too. I believe one of their other models has a more streamlined handle.    The other thing is that you need to be careful about how you push the little round rubber on/off disc. DO NOT USE YOUR NAIL IN ANY WAY. The only reason we had to buy a new one was that the button got wrecked and pushed into the handle so that we couldn&#x27;t access it anymore. Mind you, this took about a year and a half or more to happen, but if it had been a better design it wouldn&#x27;t have happened at all. If you&#x27;re careful to use just the soft part of your finger you should be okay.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare produce I&#x27;ve used (the first lasted around 4 years), so I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m biased; I like the design concept.  My teeth feel polished after I use it.  I like the features of this product, the quadpacer especially which makes it easy for me to keep track of what I&#x27;m doing before I&#x27;m fully awake or ready to collapse at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old model: The slant of the brush head makes it easier on the hand, more natural / ergonomic.  The brush head is more slender than the old and the collar design is better; so far I&#x27;ve not seen any liquid leak past the collar to create the mess that some reviewers describe.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll move up to an Elite the next purchase, but for now I find that this produce gives me the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could just get around to mailing in the rebate form...</li>
    <li> after using oral b for years i was talked into buying the rotadent from my former dentist for 150 bucks. what a waste of money that was. my fianace&#x27; is a licensed dental hygienist and she recommends sonic care. i wish i hjad known her before i blew 150 bucks on the rotadent. it was a piece of crap and lasted about 6 months before it fell apart. dont get shafted like i did . buy the sonic care and have a happy. clean mouth your wife or girlfriend will want to kiss your clean mouth more often.lol!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and my teeth and gums have never felt better.  This product is and does everything it claims.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Essence 5500 Power Toothbrush is everything I wanted it to be, with one exception.  The 30 second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; that signifies moving on to the next quadrant needs to be a little louder.  But, hey, I can live with that because this product lived up to its hype, and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> If you want your teeth clean - this is the toothbrush for you.  I tried other electric toothbrushes before but were not satisfied with the results.  The Sonicare Essence has excellent brushing and cleaning power due to the speed of vibration. It also has an automatic shutoff so you concentrate on moving the brush around your teeth rather than counting strokes.  Two minutes of brushing and your mouth and teeth feel smooth and grit free.  Love it!  Highly recommend the Sonicare to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! Not only am I brushing longer but more often.  Brushing my teeth has become a very relaxing experience and my teeth definitely are whiter and cleaner. Cleared up my bleeding gums which were becoming a major problem even though I had been using my cybersonic toothbrush for years. The timing mechanism is extremely helpful. Definitely worth the investment.  Best price anywhere on a gold box special and great service.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got the 5500 Power Toothbrush, where you  put the toothpaste on the brush. The newer model with toothpaste inside sounds yukky. Obviously this brush is much more effective than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I have expensive dental work (crowns and a bridge) and I have always felt that the spin brush provided a good brush, but I never felt I could get it clean below the gum line. The Sonicare toothbrush is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I just wish I had found it sooner. It leaves your whole mouth refreshed and it&#x27;s true it feels like you&#x27;ve had your teeth cleaned at the dentist everyday. It&#x27;s a totally different kind of clean. You just have to try it to understand. The price was the reason I waited so long, but trust me it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like it. Since I have already owned other products by this manufacturer I knew what to expect. Shipping was timely.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews sound like they were written by Sonicare reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since they first came out. However, when they first came out they were owned by a small company in Washington that produced a quality product and had excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original company was bought out years ago and the product has gone down hill. I&#x27;m sure if you read all the reviews, you will find many that complain about MOLD. My original Sonicare lasted 12 YEARS and never had a drop of mold in it. The next one - etype- I bought began to develop mold immediately.  I wrote to the company, they told me to clean it.  Bull, I&#x27;d have to clean it with BLEACH after every brushing. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical of what so often happens when a major corporation wants a monopoly, the product quality slides and the prices go up. I will never buy another Sonicare toothbrush. They gouge you on the price of an inferior product built on a brand name with a huge reputation, then they gouge you on the replacement heads forever after.  Well, I suggest looking around. There are a lot of excellent new ones on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it does a good job cleaning - if you don&#x27;t mind sticking something in your mouth that has mold over every surface under the brush. And please, don&#x27;t tell me I don&#x27;t \\&quot;clean it good enough,\\&quot; that&#x27;s corporate crap.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was exactly as described and shipped to me quickly.  It arrived before the listed ship date.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare brand toothbrushes.  I had the 5500 model for several years and it died on me.  I started using the battery powered brushes, but they just didn&#x27;t do the awesome job that the Sonicare does.  This model is a definite improvement from the older model...from the handle, which fits better into my hand, to the head wich is smaller and helps me to brush my back molars all the better.  I was going to go for the cheaper model, the one without the quad placer timer, but I decided that it was worth it to pay more because I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth properly.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a tooth brush could be worth $80.00  It has proven to be worth every cent and MORE......  It has improved my gums as well as keeping my teeth fantastically clean.  Easy to use.  Easy to travel with.  I am impressed and grateful it works so well!    I believe you will be as well.</li>
    <li> Nothing lasts forever, and my old Sonicare that I had for over seven years finally wore out (the batteries would no longer take a charge).  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Sonicare for years, so had no doubts about buying a new one... the e5500 is much improved over my old one... it is much easier to keep clean and the thin neck enables you to keep your mouth closed during brushing so the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t dribble down your chin.  The Quad-Pace feature is great for helping me ensure that all my teeth get proper time with the toothbrush.  I feel very strongly that if you follow the instructions, you will have cleaner, whiter, healthier teeth than just using an old manual toothbrush.    Excellent quality, good features, and perfect design!</li>
    <li> Great product, the smaller size brush helps get into the difficult spaces providing good cleaning. The 30 second timing for each area is an excellent help. I&#x27;d buy it again with no reservations.</li>
    <li> Previous Sonicare owners say that this newer product works better.  They really like the results they are getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have great teeth. I know this cause I&#x27;ve seen some snaggle tooth people out there. Every time I go to the dentist I get the same thing said to me at the end of the actual dentist inspection, \\&quot;You have great looking teeth Mr. Cole. But you don&#x27;t floss do you?\\&quot; I hate when he asks me that cause I know that he knows that I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why my gums are inflamed usually (not bad or anything). And that&#x27;s why you see blood on that dang dental floss there buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well last year I bought this sonicare cause I was curious how good this thing actually was. And I&#x27;m telling ya, it really does make your mouth feel a heck of a lot cleaner than you are used to. I can reach the back of my teeth easily with this. I also can brush my tongue and the roof of my mouth with this with no worries (well except for my gag reflex, but that&#x27;s not the brushes fault... hehe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year went by with me using this and I had my annual check up again. Of course I&#x27;m brushing my shoulder off cause I&#x27;m thinkin I&#x27;m hot stuff with my perfect teeth (kiidddinngg...sooorrttaaa), but still I&#x27;m expecting to hear that same line. After all the praise, the doc starts to get up and I say to him, \\&quot;Uh? No flossing?\\&quot;. He says to me that I don&#x27;t need it and it looks like I floss all the time to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHA CHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush automatically paid itself off without a doubt. I did not floss one time that whole year. The only difference between those two visits was the toothbrush. Man I love this thing! I would highly recommend spending a few extra bucks on this (ok more than a few... it&#x27;s more like 70 bucks I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first start using it though it&#x27;s a pretty weird experience. If you don&#x27;t do it right it feels sorta like taking a glass beer bottle (or coke bottle for you kids out there) and knocking it around on your teeth... hehe. Trust me when I say you&#x27;ll learn quickly how to brush correctly with this... lol. Also make sure you keep the toothbrush in your mouth. I&#x27;ve learned not to take it out and try to talk to someone. Cause all I did was take it out and then there was toothpaste flinging left and right like a mist machine on crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more cool thing is that I haven&#x27;t put it on it&#x27;s charger in almost 2 and a half months and it&#x27;s still charged and vibrates just like it had been taken off the charger. So in case you got a quick trip to go on, you can just pack it in it&#x27;s little plastic carrying case and it&#x27;s good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t second guess getting one of these. Trust me when I say you wont regret it.out and try to talk to someone. Cause all I did was take it out and then there was toothpaste flinging left and right like a mist machine on crack.

    <li> I really like this powerbrush. My previous brush was the Sonicare 4100, and it was good, but I find the Essense e5500 easier to maneuver (less bulky), and seems to be more effective in removing plaque. It is easier to brush the back teeth, and behind the teeth.  It is rapid, and that takes a little getting used to. It does seem to work quickly to \\&quot;toughen\\&quot; the gums; the first few times I used it, it hurt a little; but then no problem. Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush based on other reviews. I am so happy I did. It does a great job in cleaning and really gives you that dentist cleaned result. It holds a charge for about 2 weeks, after charging for 24hrs, so you do not need to keep it pluged in.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Braun electric toothbrush for years &amp; have been very happy with it.  I recently purchased the Philips Sonicare-Essence for my husband &amp; he loves it!  It covers more &amp; is quieter.  I also holds a charge for longer</li>
    <li> I have used this product ever since it came on to the market. The product keeps the teeth white, clean, and smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My friends and I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since our early 20s, and this has been our collective experience.    PROS:  -Once you use Sonicare it is hard to go back to a regular toothbrush.  You don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling that you get from the vibrations.  You can feel the sonicare get between the grooves in your teeth where a regular toothbrush just feels like you&#x27;re rubbing the top surfaces.  -There are always deals on this toothbrushes; mail-in-rebates, etc.    -Charge lasts for a long time.  I only charge mine every two weeks.  -I love the timer feature which lets you know you&#x27;ve been brushing for 30 seconds.  I usually brush longer than 2 minutes as well because it does feel like you&#x27;re massaging your gums.    CONS:  -Somewhere between the base of the brush-head and where the handle meet is this hollow area.  It inevitably lets water, toothpaste, saliva etc. and collects in the nook (upper portion of the handle).  **This is how I have prevented this.  Always remove the brush-head from the handle and just put it on before you use it.  It takes less than 10 seconds so it&#x27;s no big deal.  With this method you can just rinse the inside of the handle and the bottom of the brush head.  **Rinse the loose gunk out of it by running it under the sink and use Lysol or Clorox Wipes to clean the rest of the gunk from the handle if you don&#x27;t use the above drying method.  **The Flex version which apparently doesn&#x27;t do this but there is an added cost.  -I stick with this version because the brush-heads seem to be cheaper than the newer Flex models.  -There is no battery indicator.  If you lose track of when you charge it, it just might die on you out of nowhere, leaving you with a half-brushed mouth. So I often either use a back up toothbrush or manually brush with a Sonicare (although I think it ruins the bristles quicker that way).</li>
    <li> Simply the best.  If you care about your teeth or gums, use this.  Your dentist will do nothing more than compliment you . . . over and over!</li>
    <li> I gave a Sonicare toothbrush to my son for his birthday.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was something he&#x27;d want, but it was a hit.  He loves how well it cleans his teeth.  It&#x27;s like the hygienist does when he gets his teeth cleaned.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.  My teeth always feel incredibly clean and healthy after I brush them.  I would highly recommend it to whomever is considering it.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush. However, when I sent in the rebate materials I was told I sent in an invalid Philips&#x27; bar code. I was meticulous in my inclusion of the right information and clipped the bar code directly from the box. Satisfied with the toothbrush...unsatisfied with the rebate service.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this toothbrush it&#x27;s well made and solid.  I like the design of the head, it&#x27;s smaller than a standard toothbrush and as a result can get all around your mouth with no issues.  One  great feature of the brush are the ends of the bristles, they are rounded not cut flat like other brushes which makes them feel very soft and comfortable when in use.  Your mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;ve just ingested an entire bowl of crunchberries after you brush and your gums don&#x27;t get jabbed by the end of the bristles.  The unit is completely sealed from getting water inside the mechanism and battery casing, I mean you can&#x27;t remove a cover it&#x27;s completely sealed which means you can clean the casing completely -- very sanitary.  Use gel toothpaste with it, it makes a big difference in how clean your mouth feels afterward.  With the right toothpaste this makes my mouth feel as clean as going to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is our second Sonicare toothbrush, and we can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It is so improved from our first one.  The angle of the head seems to allow for much better reach and cleaning.  We recommend this highly; everyone needs one!</li>
    <li> This is a great Electric Toothbush.  It is nice and compact.  It comes with a travel case making it very easy to travel with.  A great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I had an old-school sonicare that I loved.  Even my dentist/hygenist noticed a huge difference once I started using the sonicare, my teeth were whiter and she found she did less scrapping and cleaning than her other patients.  When the battery died after 4 yrs, there was no question that I was getting another one.  These new ones are great, they are more powerful than my old brush, and the smaller angled brush head actually seems to work better.    I picked the e5500 over the e7300 for several reasons.  Both have the smartimer and quadpacer features that I depend on, and for the extra $10, you only get a recharge indicator on the e7300.  I don&#x27;t need that, since I recharge it every couple of days, and I appreciate the extra brush head that comes with the e5500.    FYI, if you&#x27;ve never owned a sonicare before, it takes a while to get used to, but you do get used to it.  And you have to unscrew the brush from the base and clean both parts regularly (I do about once every week).</li>
    <li> One of the best buys I have ever made. My teeth actually feel cleaner after using this.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare works great. Teeth feel cleaner than they ever felt using a regular toothbrush. My wife and I both use the same base and switch brushes easily with a couple turns of the brush on or off. Has a built in timer to let you know when to switch from one area of mouth to another. Turns itself off at the end of the cycle. This unit comes with two brushes. Not sure what the higher priced Sonicare units offer that would be worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush last year for Christmas and I LOVE it.  It actually  makes you want to brush your teeth more.  When I&#x27;m done, I feel like   I&#x27;ve had a cleaning at the dentist.  The brush holds a charge for 2 weeks  so I took it on vacation with me without a worry.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product, it is like going to the dentist for a teeth cleaning.  Excellent, the best!!!!!  I even told my family members to buy this product.  A++++++++</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have one myself, on recommendation from my dentist, and loved it so much I gave it as a Christmas gift.  It arrived before the estimated time and was exactly what I was expecting.  I receommend this to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use our new toothbrush daily.  It comes with two heads.  It makes your teeth feel as clean as a visit to the dentist.  Our dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my boyfriend and he says that he feels like his teeth are professionally cleaned daily.  He loves the timing feature that ensures you get adequate brushing time.  I think I will buy myself one next.</li>
    <li> I have owned for a few weeks now and I cannot find a problem!  Very convenient on the sink!  Charger has no problems and I love the toothbrush!  I owned the older sonicare before this one and I cannot believe the difference in power.  I love the ergonomics of it also while brushing!</li>
    <li> Does a good job but not easy to clean on the inside, vibration&#x27;s a little too rough and loud.</li>
    <li> From the first time I tried the Sonicare, I absolutely loved it! I ordered the Philips Sonicare because my dentist suggested it. I have some nerve problems in both arms but worse in the right arm and I am right-handed. I was having a hard time brushing, even left handed. It is so easy to use - I don&#x27;t have the feeling that I haven&#x27;t done a good job brushing my teeth. My husband thinks that my teeth just plain look whiter all the time! I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone!</li>
    <li> This item came in the factory box and was well protected enroute.  I shop-  ed around for this item and found it to be even cheaper on this site than   Wal-Mart.  This item works extremly well; my dentist uses one and also   thinks it is great.  The shipping was efficient and fast.</li>
    <li> I never even considered buying a powered toothbrush before, but I was on one of my Amazon buying sprees and saw this for a great price, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was very amazed at how much smoother my teeth felt, like they had just been cleaned by a dentist!  The vibration of the brush head is something I am not fond of, but very willing to put up with in order to have cleaner teeth!  The brush head doesn&#x27;t look too sturdy, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and it&#x27;s fine, so I guess it&#x27;s stronger than it looks!  One thing to always keep in mind is to not turn it on before it gets put into your mouth, and once it&#x27;s in your mouth do not take it out until it&#x27;s turned off, or else toothpaste will spray over everything!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Works perfectly, should have done this years ago!!  Teeth feel smooth &amp; super clean!! I will highly recommend this to all my Friends &amp; Family</li>
    <li> Your teeth feel silky smooth after using this thing. I&#x27;m glad I paid extra for the Sonicare version with the interval timer. It comes in handy. I don&#x27;t have to do my own countdown at each section of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I received this product extremely fast and am thrilled with it.  It cleans your teeth better than any electric toothbrush I have tried. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a month and it works well. My mouth feels really clean. Second toothbrush came with this for hubby. Good value</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare Toothbrush. I owned the Quadpacer before and this time bought the Essence e5500. I was happy with my first one and I&#x27;m even happier with this second one. It is a little louder than the Quadpacer but the tilted brush head is much more efficient. Excellent Product.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling really refreshed.  After just a few weeks my gums are much healthier.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush on the market this is my 3rd one and a must if you are getting dental implants.  Overpaid on Amazon could have purchased locally for 1/2 of what I paid, but I needed it.</li>
    <li> Fluid leaks into the battery necessitating very frequent cleaning. Sonicare has been getting progressively worse. This is probably related to ownership by Phillips. My first one (original Sonicare) lasted 8 years, second one 2 years. I don&#x27;t think this one will last the year.  My advice, check out the higher end models and see if they have a better design.</li>
    <li> For many years I found out I was brushing all wrong.  In fact I had to have three teeth that had to have extra support put in because I actually grooved them by brushing too hard.  Now I let the unit do the work by just setting them on every tooth.Really happy with the results.  I would recommend this product  for your own safety.</li>
    <li> Best dental appliance.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement for our very old Sonicare toothbrush so went with this model because we liked the standard size brush heads rather than the smaller size.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush helps get great checkups. We buy replacement battery/handles every few years or so. Nice timer system keeps you on track. Great bargain on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used an electric toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  But I can compare it to a regular toothbrush....and it totally blows away regular toothbrushes.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my teeth are noticeably whiter, and they feel smooth just like when a dentist cleans them.  The vibration from this brush takes a little getting used to.  The nice feature about this model is that it slowly increases the speed over the first 6 or 7 times that you use it to let you adjust to the vibration.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I don&#x27;t even notice the vibration anymore.  If you want cleaner teeth and less visits to the dentist I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since they first came out (early 1990&#x27;s). Love the company.  My old sonicare lasted over 10 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With this product, it seems easy to clean so far. I do it after every use. I haven&#x27;t had problems with odor as other users note (I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks or so). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.  It brushes \\&quot;dental clean.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Just arrived today... used it once.... oh man.... I don&#x27;t remember the last time my mouth and teeth felt this clean.  Oh right... the last time I went to the dentist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love it.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare e5500 for a week.  It works great and leaves your teeth with a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> We just ordered two of these as replacements for the Sonicares that we have been using for the past few years, as they were approaching the end of their useful life - battery-wise.  Replacing the batteries is not an option, and it is the primary expense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For anyone that has not tried a Sonicare - they are wonderful!  It sounds corny, but even my dentist could see the difference - honest.  Once you get accustomed to using one, you don&#x27;t want to use ANYTHING else.  Ours always go with us when we travel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are not cheap, but you only have one set of teeth - if you take care of them.  Find something else to pinch your pennies on instead.</li>
    <li> My dentist highly recommends the Sonicare line, and I can honestly say that my dental appointments have been much nicer (i.e. lower numbers of problems) since I started using them about five years ago.  This model is great in that it has the automatic beep every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.  The smaller head also allows you to get into the more difficult-to-reach parts of your mouth.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using the Sonicare Essence Toothbrush for a month now and we love it!!  Our teeth feel clean all over and our smiles are getting whiter.  We will be going to the dentist within the month and are anxious to hear his report.    We have not had any problems with the toothbrush and we recommend it very highly!!</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush. I have used a sonicare in the past and was very happy with it. I just recieved a new one and it is well worth the price. your teeth will feel a thousand times cleaner than regular brushing. Also, my boyfriend and I are able to use the same toothbrush because it came with 2 brush heads. You will like it!</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like the Sonicare Essence power toothbrush.  It works much better than a manual brush, and the 4 phase time feature is quite nice.  What I do not like about it is the cost.  The replacement heads are very expensive, and you&#x27;ll need to change them at least every couple of months.</li>
    <li> I bought a sonicare set a few years ago.  It worked but we didn&#x27;t really like it, so we put it away in a closet.  I decided recently to give it another try, but no matter how long I leave it plugged in, neither of the toothbrushes will work.  What&#x27;s going on?  I can&#x27;t see where one might install a new battery, so I am stumped.</li>
    <li> Upon ordering this product, I knew that I would be getting a great item. I was right. You have to allow the brush to charge before using. The replacement heads are a bit on the higher price side, but I will not go back to a regular manual brush again. With sensitive teeth and gums- get this. Don&#x27;t forget to clean your head and the brush on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist due to my receding gumlines because I brush really hard. This toothbrush was truly the answer and more. It does wonders in terms of cleaning and it is very simple to use. It takes a few days getting used to the feeling, but after that you won&#x27;t put it down, and regular brushes will feel weird. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I had used the original sonicare model for 6 yrs and finally it stopped working.  I like this new model because of the small brush size head which makes it easier to get to back teeth.  Only problem is the charger seems to get a build up of scum which has to be cleaned often - even though I clean the toothbrush base before putting into the charger.</li>
    <li> I have had some gum disease for 20 years. After I used sonicare for two weeks, I had an appointment to have a crown put on.  The dentist could not believe how healthy my gums are.       As per instructions, the sonicare has a two minute cycle broken into four segments.  I usually use the Sonicare for three to four minutes. No more Oral B for me! Now if Sonicare could cure baldness!!!</li>
    <li> I looked around quite a bit before I purchased these. I got 4 four my children, and they love them. And they arrived the same day i ordered them! I highly recommend these - some more expensive moddels are available, but these do the job very well. The extra features aren&#x27;t really needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 weeks. Products work well. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about a month now and purchased it based on a recommendation from my dentist and dental hygenist.  I&#x27;ve used the cheaper powered brushes like the SpinBrush and this blows them away.  My teeth feel so much cleaner and my gum health has improved dramatically.  The fact that this model is $40 cheaper than the Elite and has nearly all of it&#x27;s features is a double bonus even when considering the extra brushing head bundled with that model.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and like everyone always told me once you start using one you can&#x27;t go back to a non electric brush.</li>
    <li> This one is so much better than the previous model I owned.&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter, faster, with the perfect angle. Very handy to travel as it comes with a travel case and the charge holds well for a short trip.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to maintain clean. I think it is a very good product with a middle range price. I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush would have saved me thousands of dollars of dental discomfort if I had bought one years ago. Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned when I use it</li>
    <li> I bought a Philips Sonicare, just because it&#x27;s a Philips. I have many good products bought in the past from Philips. I never expected this brush to be this good. In the beginning it feels a bit strange, because of the speed and sound of this brush. It also feels as if the dentist is working on your teeth... not pleasant. After a couple of times the unpleasant feeling turns into a pleasant feeling (have to get used to it). Then you can see your teeth to begin to whiten. So no expensive whitener needed, just good toothpaste should do the trick with this brush.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product earlier, then maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have had to suffer through so many cavities and fillings and dental bills.  Since using the brush for a week so far, I&#x27;ve felt my teeth feeling cleaner and looking brighter (I smoke and drink coffee).  The beep/pause after every 30 seconds is nice and I generally find myself brushing my teeth for 4 minutes instead of two.  Besides working really well, it also motivates me to floss more. It&#x27;s such a simple and enjoyable way to take better care of my health that I think the cost of the toothbrush and replacement heads are worth it. I&#x27;m sure Phillips could come up with a way to make cheaper replacement heads but it&#x27;s a business that needs to make money for profit.  Just be grateful that (those who complain about the cost) can even afford the luxury of such a brush - some people can&#x27;t even afford the basic necessities to take care of their health in the United States.</li>
    <li> My 2-year-old grand daughter was visiting when this toothbrush arrived.  Since it has 2 heads, she got one and I got the other.  She learned to put the toothbrush in her mouth before turning it on so the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t splatter.  She loves the vibrating sensation and I like how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done!!</li>
    <li> This is our second Sonicare toothbrush. (The last one died after many years of use.) This version is pretty much the same, with the addition of a little beep/pause every 30 seconds to remind one to move on to another section of the mouth. For some reason, that makes the 2-minute brushing period seem to go faster. This is an effective and efficient product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I used the previous one for a handfull of years, until the battery died.  This Essence e5500 model is a generation newer, and fits my need precisely.  Using the Sonicare is like having your teeth cleaned by an hygenist (almost) every day.  I love them.  The Essence model has a smaller head that makes reaching into your mouth easier.  It has all the bells and whistles I want, which is a light to tell when its charged, and a beeper to give me four, 30-second meassurements during brushing.  Get one.</li>
    <li> This is our 4th sonicare toothbrush and as with the others we&#x27;ve had , it is just great---our dentist highly recommends this product for continued teeth and gum care with excellent results .</li>
    <li> Only without the scraping!  My teeth feel so smooth and clean, just like they&#x27;d been cleaned by the dentist.  I was an agressive brusher before, but this is amazing.  My gums even feel so much stronger now.  I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth look whiter now than they ever have as well.  I&#x27;ve noticed this toothbrush on the Friday sale, several different weeks.  If you&#x27;re looking to buy, I highly recommend doing it on a Friday, check out the Friday sale.</li>
    <li> The first Sonicare (I believe it was A) was perfect but finally the battery died. This version is a pain in the kiester! I have to wrap a wash cloth around it because saliva and toothpaste run down the sides and leak into where it connects to the base, no matter how careful I am.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a try after reading so many good reviews about this product.  I was very disappointed. I don&#x27;t understand why the speed cannot be changed.  It&#x27;s too fast for me and the head is not soft enough.  For about $90, I certainly expected much more.  I felt it was not different from a electronic razor with a toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> The brush works great, and doesn&#x27;t take as long to get used to as the original Sonicare brushes.  Charges well, and so far we have not noticed any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to buy one of these?? Definitely cleaner teeth with this toothbrush.  I have always had a hard time getting to my back molars before this toothbrush.  The head on this is smaller than a standard toothbrush, but being automated, you dont have to jam it against the back of your cheekbone to try to get to your rear molars.  Came with a spare toothbrush head.  I admit that I drink alot of coffee and use tobacco products, and I have noticed significant whiter and cleaner teeth with the same toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for about 10 years and this is my third one.  The others just wore out (which happens after a few years). This e5500 is great! Better than the original and well worth the money! My dentist says that my teeth are in great shape and I told her I use a Sonicare. She said it&#x27;s working wonderfully!  &lt;br /&gt;Highly reccommended &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a month but it seems to have plenty of power to deliver the automatic 2 minute brush routine and seems to give a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I followed the recommendation of my dental hygienist and my sister. My teeth feel really clean after brushing with my Sonicare Essence e5500. This model is a great choice for a single person. The only problem was resolved when I quickly learned not to open my mouth when using an electric toothbrush.     I am anxious to get a report from my dental  hygienist when I go for my cleaning in December.</li>
    <li> This brush works very well and is a definite step up from the older sonicare models.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the cost.  The extra head is a bonus- they are expensive to buy in the store- usually $25 for 2.</li>
    <li> So far no problems.  Used it for about a month now.  The future will tell</li>
    <li> Love my Sonicare! Use every day. Three+ times. Gets under gums. Dentist compliments me on clean teeth! Highly recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> Despite rinsing and wiping the exterior of this unit after each use, a pool of slime soon forms in the charging base.  It&#x27;s even worse inside the top of the handle, visible when the brushing element is unscrewed.  If you want to avoid a disgusting mess, you really need to disassemble this unit every day for a thorough cleaning.  That&#x27;s a lot to ask for a tool that is supposed to make our lives easier.  I used a previous Sonicare model for years without ever encountering this issue.  My wife&#x27;s toothbrush is identical to mine, and it has exactly the same problem, so there&#x27;s pretty obviously a serious design flaw with this model.    A CHEAP FIX:  The problem is that the gaskets in the brush head don&#x27;t seal out liquids.  One possible solution is a product called \\&quot;Sonic Seal\\&quot; [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads (3 Pack of Blue, Pink, Frost)]] available on Amazon -- currently 3 for $16.95.  Pretty expensive for what&#x27;s essentially a toothbrush condom, so I tried making my own in three easy steps. (1) Take a latex glove and cut off one of the fingers. (2) Cut off a very tiny section at the end of the detached fingertip (the resulting small hole will stretch temporarily in the next step). (3) Slip the glove finger down over the brush head, leaving the tip end above the top gasket of the brush head, and pulling the rest of the latex down to where the brush head joins the handle. Voila, no more slime build-up.  (Keep the glove on hand in case you have to make more protectors later on.)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great when it holds a charge.  The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore.  I&#x27;ve owned this brush for 18 months and the battery life has slowly gotten worse over the past 6 months.  Originally I would be able to brush without charging the battery for over one week.  Now the brush won&#x27;t hold a charge for two brushes (so it won&#x27;t even last one day).    I&#x27;m returning the brush to Phillips for a replacement since they will replace the brush inside two years.</li>
    <li> Our last one gave out after many years and owed us nothing. The new design is an improvement over the old design and seems to contain all the good elements of the old design.</li>
    <li> this electric tooth brush is THEE BEST i&#x27;ve ever had! In less than 5 min your teeth feel like they just were cleaned by a dentist!   Do not hesitate to spend this money on this product! You are going to love it and at is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Our teeth have never been so clean! With 2 brush heads it meant we only had to buy one brush...so far we have noticed that our teeth are so much cleaner than when we used a regular electric toothbrush and they appear whiter too!</li>
    <li> Found the toothbrush to be very good for my teeth and gums. Cleans all the plaque and food caught in between the teeth. Great on hart to reach places like in back of my wisdom teeth. User&#x27;s guide said I could expect to have to recharge the power brush every two weeks. I am going on 4 weeks and the  charge is still good.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I are very pleased with this toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t notice the problem some people say about the splashing.  The price was great and the product is as stated.  efficient, easy to use and has a nice design.  Philips sent me a full rebate on my purchase of a new head....  it is good for one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the purchase.  I have recommended this to many friends</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare unit and I like this one even better than the  first one.  The neck has a smaller diameter and angle which makes it more  efficient in my estimation.  I give it a five star rating and would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had an older model sonicare, and it lasted me over 4 years before the battery simply would not hold a charge. After going back to a regular toothbrush for a couple weeks, I broke down and bought this as a replacement. I definitely prefer the new style brush head to the older model, and this model still provides that extra-clean feeling that I simply wasn&#x27;t getting with the manual brush.     I highly recommend this product. As a college student without dental insurance, I can say that an ounce of prevention is worth four cases of beer.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare FlexCare. The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
    <li> After 8 months of use once a day by one mature adult the toothbrush failed completely.  It will not even turn on.  I would not recommend the e5500 Power Toothbrush to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare tooth brushing system takes a couple of days to adjust to due to the rapid vibrations that create a tickling sensation, but the benefits are great.  I can never get such a smooth feel to my teeth with manual brushing and the vibrations give great stimulation to keep the gums healthy.  This last purchase was for our third Sonicare over the last 15 years.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, wish it came with a smaller head though. [...].</li>
    <li> My disappointment is that it&#x27;s not built nearly as well as my older model and probably won&#x27;t last as long; seems cheap by comparison. Also, no matter how well you wipe it after use, it still leaks water from the joint of the holder and the brush head. This transfers to the charger.  Small point perhaps, but sloppy. As with my older model, the inside cavity must be cleaned I&#x27;d judge weekly. My older brush from Philips did not leak though. I&#x27;m thinking of returning the e5500  toothbrush and buying my older model again.    That said, it does a decent job of brushing and the angled brush head is convenient. My older model also did a decent job of brushing.</li>
    <li> overall, this is  my 2nd sonicare, and overall i&#x27;d say its a fine, excellent product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;a couple of notes: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. the brushheads that come standard with this package are very stiff. They make manual toothbrushes with soft heads...i don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t offer the same with electronic brushes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. there are a lot of little tiny crevices which can get dirty/clogged fast....which makes cleaning a pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. the newer models seem louder than the previous models. The older ones had this pleasant light humming noise,,,,but this model functions with a loud obnoxious buzz(similarly like the oral b&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> We have in the past used an Oral B power toothbrush and this one (Sonicare Essence e 5500) is by far the best.  My husband and I both had problems with bleeding gums; by using the Sonicare it has stopped. We have better check ups at the dentist&#x27;s office now.  We would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does as good as, if not better, job than my hygenist.  My teeth feel polished and squeaky clean after use.  It also tickles the roof of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Out of the box the product worked. Within the first 6 weeks it ran out of power after 1 brushing.  Even when charged for 12 hrs.  The pulse timer and auto turn off also stopped functioning.  The first few weeks were good.  I am trying to return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest - I don&#x27;t have good teeth genes. Both my parents have multiple crowns, and despite my efforts (and best attempts to make up for neglecting my teeth when I had braces), cavities would always appear. About a year ago I noticed a funny taste coming out of the base of my back teeth. It wouldn&#x27;t go away even though I tried my darnedest to brush and floss back there. I had them checked out, and the dentist recommended I get 3 of those back teeth crowned, since decay was starting to go underneath them.    I was horrified. I&#x27;m only in my mid-twenties, and certainly didn&#x27;t have the funds to pay for 3 molar crowns. In my desperation to try anything, I bid farewell to $100 and bought the Sonicare. Now I&#x27;m kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t buy this years ago.    Just a week after using the Sonicare, the funny taste coming from my molars was completely gone. A month later, I got another appointment at another dentist&#x27;s (didn&#x27;t fully trust the first one since she recommended crowns so adamantly and quickly for someone my age). A clean bill of health this time - I even told this dentist about the first dentist&#x27;s recommendation and he was horrified since he didn&#x27;t see anything fishy in the x-rays.    The vibrating took a bit of getting used to. It actually felt harsh the first few days, but once accustomed to, the clean feeling is addictive.    I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for about a year and now I can&#x27;t imagine brushing without it. Having your teeth feel really clean is a nice thing to have, certainly, but for people who just don&#x27;t have good teeth, this is a bona fide toothsaver. Anyone with a family history of dental problems NEEDS to use the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush is an excellent product.  It is easy to use and recharge.  It cleans my teeth better than any brush (manual or electric) that I have had.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to a regular toothbrush after using the sonic.  Its like getting a dentists cleaning everyday!  One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> After about 10 years, our old Sonicare finally gave up the ghost.  This one is even better.  It weighs less than our old one, and I share it with my husband.  We&#x27;re both very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I will definitely recommend this to all my friend who want a good tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Genetics gave me bad teeth, but I&#x27;m thinking that this fabulous technology could have prevented a mouthful of fillings. The vibration takes some getting used to, but my teeth and gums have never felt better. I love that \\&quot;fresh-from-the-dentist-office-clean\\&quot; without the stress and the expense!</li>
    <li> Bought the e5500 to replace an earlier model we have used for nine years. (Battery finally gave out - not replaceable).  Operation is much the same, with the 4x30 second timed sequence (30 sec to clean each quadrant). New brush head design is much improved to clean between teeth.  Highly recommend for good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I love this Sonicare Toothbrush.  The size of the head gets in all the right places...the vibrating speed is comfortable...After the 2 minutes, you feel like you have had a professional cleaning!</li>
    <li> I was an Oral B user for over a decade until I had trouble finding replacement heads.  I purchased another Oral B - this time the Cross Action (budget-friendly) but the unit burned out in less than 6 months.  I was so annoyed that I thought I&#x27;d give the Sonicare line a shot and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  This toothbrush gives a MUCH better cleaning and just feels better on the teeth and gums.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but found myself using it more than he does. Lol.    The handle fits well in the hand; the brush(es) are easily interchangeable and screw on tightly.  It charges quickly.  We usually store the handle on the charger, so I can&#x27;t say too much about the battery life, though it has lasted well over 2 days for us.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that, with daily use, the brush seems to remove the slight plaque build-up you can sometimes get inbetween dentist visits.    As others have said, the vibrations take a little getting used to, and you&#x27;ve got to be careful to keep your lips closed (otherwise you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time cleaning the sink and counter and cabinet and mirror.)  But after a very short amount of time you&#x27;ll be wondering how you thought your teeth were clean with using a brush.  I tell you, that polished feeling is addictive!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have a basis for comparison with any other power toothbrushes but I think it would be fair to say that this thing is among the best. I have been using the Sonicare essence e5500 for about 1.5 years now and my teeth have never been so clean. I havent had any cavities in that time and I think my teeth look even whiter than before. The brush is very easy to setup and use, first time users will feel funny after using it but you will get used to it. Make sure you take the time to thoroughly brush your teeth. All in all a great product at a great price (I paid about 60 on clearance).</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for me, but I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it from him or Walmart. Amazon.com is the cheapest, I like this product because it does a really good job at getting your teeth clean. I hihgly recommend it especially from Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> The best investment I made in my dental care was deciding to purchase this Sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s great for cleaning teeth--I mean my teeth really feel squeaky clean after using it. I do not feel that sticky film on the ridge of my teeth, as I do when using a regular toothrush. Another great feature of the toothbrush is that once powered up, it doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged for well over a week (I&#x27;d think more closely to two weeks). I&#x27;m in a job where I&#x27;m doing more and more travel, so the convenient travel case that comes with it is heaven sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviewers commented that the little pause/beep that the brush gives to indicate that it&#x27;s time to move on to another quadrant in your mouth can be annoying. I agree; it is a little annoying. I tend to ignore that beep/pause, and continue in my normal brushing routine. To each his or her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my toothbrush now for almost 2 years, and I hope it will last for years to come. I recommended the toothbrush for my mom as well, and she loves it too. The toothbrush may be a little costly, but it is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace older model that we had for 5 years. Product is perfect and we use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This new design works better than previous designs.  The brush and stem fit better in the mouth with less splash and the brush better fits the contour of the teeth.</li>
    <li> This review is for people who are trying to decide on the Sonicare or a Braun Oral B (or ANY spin brush for that matter).  My previous toothbrush was an Braun Oral B, and in my experience, the Sonicare is way superior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Oral B has a rotating head.  Well, after several uses, I&#x27;ve noticed that the head starts getting loose and my lips and cheeks sometimes get pinched in the gap between the head and the neck of the brush.  This causes me to have to change the brush even before it&#x27;s due.  Also, it seems that the Oral B allows a lot of water to enter into the metal parts that make the head spin.  Therefore, while brushing, the water along with toothpaste seem to clean those parts which results in dirty water in your mouth!  It&#x27;s not pretty sight rinsing out your mouth and toothbrush and seeing grey water in the sink! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So after dealing with spin brushes for several years, I decided to give the Sonicare a try.  Besides all the hassles of the spin type brushes, most importantly, the Sonicare cleans better.  I was surprised at how well it performed since I thought the Oral B was a huge step above a manual brush.  But the Sonicare makes my teeth feel even *cleaner* and I love how it makes my gums feel as well!  When the Sonicare first came out in the market, I knew that there was no way the head would even fit in my small mouth (with all my wisdom teeth in tact!) so that&#x27;s why I never considered it before.  However, the current design of the brushes is fantastic.  They are compact and angled and I have no problems reaching all my teeth.  I have a feeling once you try the Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never go back to any other toothbrush.  It&#x27;s really *that* great!</li>
    <li> I really love my Sonicare toothbrush. After using it my mouth feels great.  The dentist says it is helping my gums as well. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> My teeth look and feel cleaner.  This was a great price also, get one for yourself!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is comfortable to hold and reminds you of the 30 seconds you need to spend on each part of your mouth. Recommended by my dentist, I can feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a deep cleaning at my dentist office, because he said I wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean enough from brushing.  I love the timer on this product (who watches the clock to make sure they&#x27;re brushing for 3-4 minutes at a time?!)  I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel!!</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job    I just hope I can disable the \\&quot;auto-off\\&quot; function, because 2 minutes is not long enough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this quick; this is a fantastic toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter in 2 weeks of use and the feeling you get after you brush is only felt when you leave the dentist. The first time using this product was odd as you are not used to the vibration and the high speed of the brush head, but after a few uses all is well.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is amazing!  It&#x27;s the greatest toothbrush.  I love the quadpacer and the angled brush head.  My teeth are \\&quot;straight from the dentist\\&quot; clean!</li>
    <li> Phil    ips[[ASIN:B000M4DIJ4 Philips Sonicare e7300 Sonic Toothbrush]  Had the original Philips for 8 yrs.  It was beginning to fry and decided to get a new one as I liked the product.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  Teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been cleaned by a dentist.  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few electric tooth brushes in my time and none compare to this Sonicare tooth brush.  Everytime I use it my teeth feel like I just came out of the dentist office with smooth silky textured teeth.  I have even noticed that they have gotten whiter as I use it and I do not use teeth whiteners.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced but affective electric tooth brush this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement. I already wore out my first one, but I used it for years. This time I expect it to last longer, because I will use the pad of my finger to turn it off and on; not the tip of my fingernail!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare.  The first one lasted over ten years and I&#x27;m replacing it only because the battery no longer holds a charge.  If one does not jam the bristles into the teeth, the brush will last as long as the unit.  I regularly take the brush apart, soak it in a weak solution of bleach water and clean off residue inside the brush and charger.  UVs don&#x27;t reach the inside and the chargers. And when the magnets inside the brush head get rusty brush them with a soft copper brush or scrape a little of the rust off with a pocket knife. Two brushes are needed for two people (unless you don&#x27;t mind sharing) but otherwise an extra is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a Sonicare I bought many years ago.  I decided to upgrade and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  Your dentist will love you for using a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My grandkids have used Socicare for years while in braces. After I went to the dentist recently and he had to spend a lot of time scraping gunk off my teeth, I decided to try one. I love the way it gets my teeth ultra clean with little effort. It remains to be seen if it will prevent the build-up of that gunk (plaque) but my dentist says it should help a lot.    It takes a bit of getting used to the vibration, but the step-up system helps with that. After a week or so, it no longer felt strange.    The unit takes a long time to charge (up to 24 hours), but runs for two weeks of normal use (twice a day brushing) on a charge. I usually charge mine every week. I like the fact that there are no electrical contacts on the unit. It charges magically without any electrical connection between the base unit and the hand unit. Cool!    The cost of replacement brushes is the only negative I see about Sonicare. My grandkids say a brush will last about 6 months. Two came with the unit, so I won&#x27;t have to replace them for a while. But when I do, I expect to find the best price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure when I purchased this (maybe &#x27;06 &#x27;07), but I am just now getting around to posting a review in 2014 and am proud to say that this thing is just as good as the first week I had it! I have witnessed others around me purchase other kinds over the years with disappointing results. I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else. Thanks Philips Sonicare, much love.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush. The first one (10+ years ago) was as subtle as a bulldozer but it gave me a dentist grade cleaning every day until it died after five years of loyal service. The second one (now 5 years old) still works, but the company stopped making the replacement heads for it.     The E5500 is great! The new format of brush head is much smaller than what I was using before. The quadrant timer is better, the ergonomics are better and the price is MUCH better! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but Sonicare made a great product even better! I&#x27;m looking forward to another five years of service!</li>
    <li> great dental care product that will hopefully help me keep my original teeth just a bit longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and I&#x27;ve always had good teeth, brushing at least twice a day with a regular toothbrush, but my regular 6 month checkup and cleanings were taking over an hour, with a lot of digging, scraping and bleeding. Afterward I would have those mild headaches and \\&quot;not enough flossing\\&quot; guilt feelings only a dentist can give you.  He and his hygienist had been bugging me to buy one of these for several years, but I always thought paying this much for a toothbrush was ludicrous!      I was being cheap in the wrong place.  After only 2 months of regular use with the SonicCare, my latest checkup and cleaning lasted just 20 minutes, with minimal scraping and very little bleeding -- my gum tissues were \\&quot;in great shape\\&quot; I was told.  And no dull throbbing headache or flossing lecture afterward either (even though my flossing habits are still minimal, at best).    I bought the least expensive model I could find and am really happy I did.  I don&#x27;t care why this works, what all the lab studies show, all I know is I&#x27;m REALLY happy I did, I use it now and will continue to do so and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.</li>
    <li> I rarely rate things like this but I have been amazed.  My husband bought two of these and after he started using it, he insisted that I try the Sonicare.  Wow - my teeth feel dentist-fresh every day.  I went traveling and decided to bring my old toothbrush - I actually missed my Sonicare.  I would highly recommend this toothbrush.  Far superior to a regular electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I had the older version with the bigger flatter head... I bought e5500 for my girlfriend and it come with two attachments    the attachment fit on my older version I like the smaller head and angled brush of the e5500.</li>
    <li> This brush has been the best ever since it first became available. The original version did not have a timer. The timer on this is a bit annoying and they should either remove it or put continuous as a default setting. The company is ignorant because it does not seem to know what scrubbing means. The timer is equivalent to telling a surgeon to stop scrubbing after two minutes. Scrubbing reduces bacterial count quite a bit but only if one scrubs all soft areas for minimum of 5 minutes including tongue, back of the mouth etc.</li>
    <li> sonic toothbrush works wonderfully, price was very good and item shipped in a timely maner</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a Sonicare toothbrush that we have had for years. The unit has given us excellent service!</li>
    <li> I wish I had known of this product two years ago.  I would have save over $2000 in dental services charges and avoid a great portion of dentists greed(You should know these guys are just about repeated trips to their clinics).  I love it.  It help me keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I am using the SonaCare purchased 10 years ago and it is still going strong. When I first started using it I thought it was knocking the fillings out of my teeth . . .but it was plaque that was being removed.  I would not be without a SonaCare now.  This purchase was for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I thought the power toothbrush I had for about 12 yrs (Sonicare)was still doing a good job until I got the Philips Power toothbrush.  Boy what a big difference in the vibration of the toothbruch and how light it is.  Very satisfied with the purchase of them.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind that the Sonicare toothbrushes last under a year - even when you replace the heads and follow all their instructions - then this is for you.  At my dentist&#x27;s insistence, after a first failure for a more expensive model, I bought this lemon (after reading all the reviews).  It almost made it to 10 months...I am switching to oral B.</li>
    <li> This is the closest new model Sonicare in features to the old Sonicare that finally died when the battery refused to take a charge.  This model arrived with NiMh batteries, a big improvement over the old NiCd batteries.  Fair price as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and to give you an idea at how well it works, she doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance and hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in 6 years when she had an extended hospital stay. During that time, they gave her a dental exam and cleaning and the hygienist remarked at what great shape her teeth were in considering she hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist for that long. She brushes twice a day and flosses as well.</li>
    <li> this was a replacement purchase for my wife who has used this product for many years as recommended by her dentist. received product in excellent new condition   not much more to be said!</li>
    <li> My fault, but the price was a rip-off.  This item can be purchased for $100 less than I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I like it.  CHECK PRICES.</li>
    <li> I am very well pleased with this product, will not go back to conventional brushing, but does need cleaning after each usage...</li>
    <li> I can never go back to a regular toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my oral hygienist and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This item is the epitome for taking care of your teeth.  After using this toothbrush for the last 10+ years it seemed to be on the verge of going to toothbrush heaven because it wasn&#x27;t accepting a charge anymore.  We purchased the same type because we liked the way the old one worked.  When I unplugged the unit and got ready to throw it away, I noticed that the inside of the Charging Base had a lot of calcium buildup.  I cleaned out the deposit and at this point we are still using the older toothbrush and keeping the new one as a backup.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush and I still love it.  My first one lasted a good 10 years before it finally died.  A great sturdy product!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush in early January and have used it for about a month now I think it&#x27;s great. My teeth are cleaner and less stained, also my gums feel like they are in a lot better shape.</li>
    <li> I was wondering if it worth to spent more than $50 for a tooth brush, but I am sure that it&#x27;s worth. Buy it at Amazon&#x27;s Friday sale for a great deal under $80!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great.  It has been a long time since I used an \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; and am impressed with the different movements that the current products have.</li>
    <li> We had the Advance model of this toothbrush for probably 6 years and it worked flawlessly so when it died we looked at Sonicare again and are not disappointed that we did. This model is even more vigorous in its brushing action than the Advance and you can really feel that your teeth are clean when you finish. It also has a smaller body and redesigned brush neck which all work and feel better. The charger base also has a place on the underside to wind excessive cord which our previous model did not so now its nice and neat on our sink. Our one complaint is the brushing timer. It pauses every 30 seconds or so to let you know its time to move on to the next section of teeth so you can give all your teeth equal brushing time. In theory, I think this is great and we can&#x27;t fault Sonicare for adding this feature especially since we knew about it when we ordered it but for us, in real world usage, its annoying. We would also like to see Sonicare bring the price of replacement brush heads down a bit. Overall, we&#x27;ve had it for about 1.5 months and it cleans well. We also feel its ease of use encourages us to brush.</li>
    <li> This is a very wonderful product.  Was shipped very fast.  According to our dentist, it was a smart purchase!</li>
    <li> My hygenist recommended that I get a Sonicare.  What a great product.  It takes a little getting used to the vibrating feeling on your teeth, but what a difference it makes.  My teeth are noticably whiter and my gums feel much better.  It is set to run in four 30 second increments which is great to make sure you cover your entire mouth for the appropriate amount of time.  My mouth feels great every time I brush!  I withhold the rating of five stars, as no product is perfect.    As always, AMAZON is super fast with products arriving.  Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love my electric - sonic brush!!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and my mouth feels refreshingly clean after brushing... much more so than with a manual tooth brush.  Also, I usually floss before I brush but just to test the efficiency of this product I&#x27;ve been flossing after I brush and there&#x27;s usually nothing between my teeth.  I&#x27;m really impressed... this is a great buy!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Love the e5500, like going to the dentist!Am VERY happy with the size, power and price.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Sonicare 3 months ago. I believed the first unit to be defective because the toothbrush head would not screw on flush with the base. Ultimately, this would cause a lot of bacteria to build up so I sent for a replacement. Amazon was great about sending a new one right out and I received it within a couple days. Unfortunately, the new one had the same problem, but not as bad, so I went and ordered the Sonic Seal. Check it out if you are thinking about getting this brush! If it weren&#x27;t for this miracle little seal I definitely would have returned the brush because the gunk that builds up in the crevices is so disgusting. The last thing I want to add to my To Do list is &#x27;clean toothbrush&#x27; !!!  I don&#x27;t understand how Philips can justify selling such a cheaply manufactured brush at this high of a cost.      Well, it&#x27;s 3 months later and I am happy to report that my teeth and gums are healthier than they have ever been. My teeth are much brighter and my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore. I don&#x27;t floss less, but I&#x27;m noticing that when I floss, there is less to floss after brushing. I brush 2-3 times a day and have only charged my brush 3 times in the past 3 months. Even better, the brush itself is still in good shape. I think some reviewer&#x27;s  brushes get worn out so quickly because they are brushing their teeth too hard. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use the Sonicare like a standard toothbrush because it will lead to the degeneration of your gums! Even though I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t support Philips for misleading their customers, the Sonicare, for now, has held up to it&#x27;s end of the bargain. I only hope that it will last more than 2 years. Oh, and make sure to fully drain the battery and then charge it back to 100% for optimal battery life.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for the original Sonicare for my husband and myself. I bought the set with two units and one charger. Even though I like the new brush head and noticed its brushing action is improved with this model, I found that one of the units (the one I use) doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  The old one went two weeks.  I am lucky if this one goes a week. Sometimes 4 days is all it stays charged.  The unit my husband uses hold a charge for at least 2 weeks just like the older model.    I called customer service and they had me perform some tests and put the phone up by it so she could hear the sounds when doing the tests. She said it was fine as it passed the tests.  She advised me to return it to the charger daily if necessary.  I explained that my husband&#x27;s didn&#x27;t need that frequent charging and she just ignored that fact.    I was considering getting one of the newest models and seeing if they are any better, but might just switch to Oral B, as that is what my dentist uses.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000AMRIIK Philips Sonicare Essence e5500 Power Toothbrush]]  This toothbrush is handy, easy to use, leaves my mouth feeling clean, massages the gums. If I forget to recharge after the evening cleaning, it still works full power the next morning. I am happy with my choice of this Philips Sonicare Essence e5500 Power Toothbrush and would recommend it to a friend.  Christa</li>
    <li> Great and comfortable brush. Took a little while to reach full charge, but was able to use the very next morning. The timer feature is great! I know how long to brush each section then move on. No more guessing.</li>
    <li> Yes Sonicare is the market leader. However, their quality control is slipping. I purchased this toothbrush in Sept 2010. By January 2011 it would no longer hold a charge. Past the product return window.  I did buy another Sonicare, but I&#x27;m also posting this review for others to be aware. They will replace the handle, but only 28 days from purchase for cash return.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in only 4 days from the purchase date and arrived in excellent condition. I can&#x27;t remember when my teeth ever felt this clean after brushing. I would recommend this to anyone concerned about proper dental care.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product and now I do too.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything other than Sonicare!  It also holds a charge for a week - so I don&#x27;t even need the travel charger for weekend trips.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric brush and it is everything that other reviewers claim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We have used Sonicare power toothbrushes for a number of years and this is by far the best one yet.  The shaft is long enough to get into hard to reach areas in the mouth and the brush size is perfect.  This is especially important when you have a \\&quot;small mouth\\&quot; to quote our dentist.  I would highly recommend this model to anyone who has had a problem with the larger heads and shorter shaft models.</li>
    <li> My old, original Sonicare brush died, and since I had such good luck and success with the toothbrush in the past, I got the e5500 as my replacement.    Compared to the original Sonicare, the e5500 has some nice improvements: easier to clean charging base, smaller brush-head and slimmer, easier to grip handle. The toothbrush cleans very effectively and I have no reservations in recommending this brush to anyone.    My only complaint is that I believe the brush is louder than previous models. Not loud like living by the airport or anything, but loud enough to notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I got this new sonicare for christmas, and was amazed at how much more powerful it was than the older model i had been using for a few years...recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My hygienist kept telling me to purchase this toothbrush, but the price kept me from committing. I found a great price on Amazon and now I can&#x27;t believe that I waited so long.    It is completely efficent at cleaning your teeth and gums. It feels great and I have seen a noticeable difference in my teeth in just a few weeks!    I would definitely suggest getting this toothbrush. it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This thing is loud!  You can&#x27;t brush your upper teeth without it vibrating loudly against your lower and vice versa.  And remember.  Once you use it it&#x27;s not returnable.  Worst $80 I&#x27;ve ever lost.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a more expensive model. When purchasing the e5500 I made my choice for two reasons: the price and the fact that I did not need the two handles that come with the more expensive model. I did not pay attention to the head size. The e5500 has a VERY small brush head. It works, it does the job, but it is half the size and 2/3 of the width of the manual brushes I have used all my life. I find myself picking up my old brush all the time now.</li>
    <li> I bought a $[...] roto-dent toothbrush from my dentist, and it doesnt even come close to this. Within the first week, i can no longer see the stains i had on my front teeth anymore! and my gums look so healthy...This thing is no joke, i never had such clean teeth before, without a professional cleaning.  I also dont keep it on the charger like another reviewer recommended...Just be sure to tighten the head every few days, because i thought it needed a recharge, and all it needed was the head to be screwed back tight on the toothbrush body..2 weeks, and still going strong with no charge!  [...] is where you need to go to buy a seal for this, so you dont have to take it apart to clean it..highly recommended.  I know this may sound strange, but i actually look foward to brushing my teeth now..unbelievable toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really Good! I´ve used for years and I am pleased with the way it functions.</li>
    <li> This is the second we have purchased. The first one must have lasted close to 3 years before the sealed battery finally wore out. I had gingivitis and since using this toothbrush, my gums have not receded one bit. This one may cost more than others but, when I checked a couple years ago, it was the highest rated electric toothbrush available. It was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> So I bought this after seeing all the advertisements about how great sonicare is, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brush leaves much to be desired for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head screws into and a rubber pad rest on an area inside the handle that and this is what delivers the vibrations.  Yet, in this area water gets trapped and start to allow mold and other things to grow within the area.  Take off the brush head and you see black mold inside and all along where the brush screws in.  If you are not grossed out by this you should be.  It is impossible to clean this area well.  I have tried basically everything and still specks of mold remain and it grows back quickly.  Not sure how this effects my oral hygiene but I wish I had known beforehand.</li>
    <li> i bought this to help with keeping my teeth majorly clean and to ward off periodontal disease, which so far it seems to be doing. at first its a bit hard to get used to and it sent shivers down my spine, but after a coupla weeks im fine with it now. its a greta product, and was recommended by several friends, including my dentist.</li>
    <li> recommeded by my dentist...I&#x27;ve been using sonic for YEARS ....makes dental cleanings easy and my dental hygenist very happy!...me, too</li>
    <li> I love my electric toothbrush.  I have had one for years and would not want to be without it.  As soon as my last one quit working, I replaced it. Good toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Using  this product  for the past 5 years . It definitely cleaning the teeth much better the mechanical toothbrush, but  lasting ( in my experience only for 2 years ) Needed to buy new one and it is  more expensive then previous one  Still have to put your health and teeth first</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush since it first came out umpteen years ago. Great product! And my dentist loves it, too!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and an outstanding bargain.  Saves tons of $ every time I visit the dentist.  Strongly urge all to buy and use daily</li>
    <li> I am now in my 3rd year of using this toothbrush. I have been gifted a few other electric toothbrushes over the years and this one is by far my favorite. It gets my mouth the cleanest without completely irritating my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that, after a few years of use, the charge that the toothbrush holds is noticeably less. My wife and I use the same base and just swap out the head - we MIGHT get a week on a charge - but it&#x27;s usually closer to 5 days. It takes about 24 to fully recharge. This is my only qualm, and after 3 years, it can be expected. I intend to be a sonicare customer for a long time.</li>
    <li> I would not be without my Philips Sonicare.  It is perfect for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;teeth and gum massage!  I stay cavity free and my gums are&lt;br /&gt;the best that my dentist has ever seen for someone my age.</li>
    <li> Like that it has the quad pacer so you know when you need to move toothbrush to next quadrant.  Has a long battery life.</li>
