      <li>These are not as easy to find anymore.</li>

      <li>I bought this to clean out from under my nails.</li>
      <li>Being metal, they take more abuse than the &#x27;modern&#x27; abrasive on a foam core.</li>
      <li>Glad to have this particular file.</li>
      <li>I am very please with it, and I am certain it will give me many years of use.</li>
      <li>strong long lasting file much better than what is sold in most stores today .GREAT !</li>
      <li>Amazing that you can&#x27;t find these in local stores anymore.</li>
      <li>Curable, effective, and will last me forever (I expect).</li>
      <li>I use the rounded side to push my cuticles back after softening in soapy warm water.</li>
      <li>Worked good but be careful it will eat your finger tips up.</li>
      <li>I do have one other that is a bit more special, but this Trim is your basic good quality reliable nail file.</li>
      <li>I can easily file and smooth finger or toe nails with this product in a short time.</li>
      <li>I very much recommend thid product.</li>

      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>

      <li>Go and buy a much better, cheaper Revlon one from the local drug store.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would improve is I wish the file were a bit more aggressive</li>
      <li>Thanks for having the same great product for that long..</li>
      <li>She prefers this kind to any other file.</li>
      <li>For a simple device like a nail file the fact that it is made of stainless steel should be enough to make it good.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find these anymore, thanks Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>OK to carry for an emergency fix, but harder to use than the diamond files.  </li>
      <li>very flimsy but</li>
      <li>active customer of many</li>
      <li>Nothing special, feels the same on both sides.</li>
      <li>When I need to file I want to make quick work of it and get back to business.</li>
      <li>Unfortunatley, I feel that it does not finish&lt;br /&gt;the nails as smoothly as my older brand files.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have quite enough bite for me and costs much more than necessary.  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality nail file.</li>
      <li>and I love the pointed edge to help when I get nail polish a little off.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without the one I have</li>
      <li>its corse metal does the job just dont push to hard or it will bend very easily</li>
      <li>Anyway, great product, very thin and strong, exactly what I needed for the tough to get corners of my nails.</li>
      <li>A bit to flexible but works well so far</li>
      <li>The metal is soft and bends when used.</li>
      <li>This is only ok -- because the handle is hard to hold.  </li>
      <li>Made from stainless steel and doesnt  wear out like other nail files.</li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be like the ones that used to be available in stores everywhere, but it&#x27;s a little smaller and thinner than expected.  </li>

    <li> Prefer metal files and for some reason, they are so hard to find.</li>
    <li> These are not as easy to find anymore. This is just like I used over the past 30+ years.</li>
    <li> great for a quick file in your purse for on the go touchup. Amazing that you can&#x27;t find these in local stores anymore. Its only the disposable emory boards now. I do have one other that is a bit more special, but this Trim is your basic good quality reliable nail file.</li>
    <li> A tad narrow,but gets the job done,the cut is fairly aggressive,but suits my needs.</li>
    <li> The emory boards and whatnot just don&#x27;t do it for me. When I need to file I want to make quick work of it and get back to business. This metal is probably the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The metal is soft and bends when used.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, feels the same on both sides.Will last longer than files with the plastic handle that breaks under pressure. If you want a file with smooth &amp; course sides ,look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> THESE FILES LAST FOREVER</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I don&#x27;t know why the regular stores never stock this type of file anymore.</li>
    <li> So happy to find these metal nail files. Lost several at airports some time ago, and have never been able to find in stores since. I find the newest type of files for sale dull and unsatisfactory.  These are great!</li>
    <li> not much to say--a file is a file.  But will last forever--a bonus.</li>
    <li> Needed something quick and easy for time when nails split or snagged off.  Would have been better if it had different strength sides.</li>
    <li> Good product, but these things used to cost about a dollar... what happened?</li>
    <li> Just what my Mom asked for Mothers Day.  She prefers this kind to any other file.</li>
    <li> I love these things! You&#x27;ll never need another nail file again (unless you lose it).  Its a GREAT investment.  Its washable, a great travel size, and even works on thicker nails.  To top it all off, it even arrived in a timely manner.  I very much recommend thid product.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my nails, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as a regular emery board.  Plus it has an odd vibrating sensation that I don&#x27;t get from regular files.  It does work though.</li>
    <li> I lost mine...at least 40 years old and couldn&#x27;t find a new one.  I&#x27;m a happy customer once again. Thanks for having the same great product for that long..</li>
    <li> I am probably the only one that wanted a thinner metal nail file for getting under my nails. Most reviews talk about the file area, and I&#x27;m sure that is as advertised. I am another of the Revlon faithful that cannot find them anymore. I just like them for getting UNDER my nails.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be like the ones that used to be available in stores everywhere, but it&#x27;s a little smaller and thinner than expected.  Still, it works fine.  Glad to find it, since these metal nail files are not too easy to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> this is what I have been looking for in every drug store.  No one carries them any more and they are far superior to the emery files you can buy.</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  Made from stainless steel and doesnt  wear out like other nail files.</li>

    <li> Very small and rough.  OK to carry for an emergency fix, but harder to use than the diamond files.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does not file nails good at all I thought the file was very dull. It ripped my nails</li>
    <li> This is only ok -- because the handle is hard to hold.  It is thin and flat, so quite hard to grip.</li>
    <li> It is just lines sawed into the metal, not a very effective filing surface.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great file and I love the pointed edge to help when I get nail polish a little off.</li>
    <li> These were like ones that used to find in stores locally but they do not carry them now. These are a bit pricier than the cheaper ones carried in stores locally but I think the quality is better. I can easily file and smooth finger or toe nails with this product in a short time. Put one in my travel suitcase - stuck it in side pouch of my check bag so I won&#x27;t have any issues at security. Packaging arrived intact and days ahead of estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I have been using a stainless steel nail file for years, but recently I have had trouble finding them in our local stores.  I was thrilled to find this Trim stainless steel nail file on-line.  Unfortunatley, I feel that it does not finish&lt;br /&gt;the nails as smoothly as my older brand files.</li>
    <li> Probably the WORST item I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon ... and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;an active customer of many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just does not file your nails.  It makes them a bit ragged,&lt;br /&gt;which ain&#x27;t my look ... and the one sent does not match&lt;br /&gt;the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.  Avoid!!</li>
    <li> Alright but not as well made as I was hoping. Still, it works alright.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works great.!</li>
    <li> This nail file is like what use to be available in stores everywhere .A strong long lasting file much better than what is sold in most stores today .GREAT !</li>
    <li> For a simple device like a nail file the fact that it is made of stainless steel should be enough to make it good. Unfortunately this &amp;#34;stainless steel Nail File&amp;#34; is almost useless. The cutting surfaces are made in a pattern that makes my nail bounce and move off to the side. It makes a rough cut and is hard to use. Go and buy a much better, cheaper Revlon one from the local drug store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok ,but I would have preferred it if it had a shaped point to get under the nails. Hard to find in this country. If the tip had been shaped then I would have given it 5 *</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, but yet I wasn&#x27;t able to find this in a retail store! Anyway, great product, very thin and strong, exactly what I needed for the tough to get corners of my nails.</li>
    <li> The metal is thin and sharp. If you are filing close to the skin, there is a good chance you can cut yourself right under the nail as if it was cut with a knife.</li>
    <li> I use the rounded side to push my cuticles back after softening in soapy warm water. I can&#x27;t live without the one I have so I needed another one in case I lose mine. I could not find locally. Great value.</li>
    <li> Curable, effective, and will last me forever (I expect). Great purchase - can&#x27;t seem to find these in any stores near me!</li>
    <li> After I cut a 3rd finger with it, I finally decided it was time for it to go to garbage.</li>
    <li> Just a metal nail file. I bought this to clean out from under my nails. Works well.</li>
    <li> Good for fingernails. A bit too short for toenails.</li>
    <li> Works great for filing my finger and toe nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file I have ever owned.  I never give 5 stars to anything, but this deserves it.  Would recommend to everybody who uses steel nail files.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would improve is I wish the file were a bit more aggressive</li>
    <li> Sharp and removes nail as intended.</li>
    <li> A bit to flexible but works well so far</li>
    <li> This is a high quality nail file. I am very please with it, and I am certain it will give me many years of use.</li>
    <li> very flimsy but its corse metal does the job just dont push to hard or it will bend very easily</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have quite enough bite for me and costs much more than necessary.  I am now using automobile files which work well and are cheap.</li>
    <li> Glad to have this particular file.</li>
