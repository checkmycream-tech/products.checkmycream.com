<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, soothing and pleasant scent. Should add a controlled pour attachment to the bottle.</li>
    <li> Very pricy for 4 fl oz.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to take away any stars because I&#x27;m sure the product is good, but I went back to using plain hazel that is much cheaper. The smell is totally different on this one. Almost burned my nostrils.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, who recently shaved off his beard. He loves it, and says it really helps soothe his skin and prevent bumps.</li>
    <li> A great after shave especially if you nick yourself.</li>
    <li> I will admit that at first I didn&#x27;t much care for this product due to it&#x27;s overly musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;Though it does sooth and lather the skin to a wonderful aftershave feel.&lt;br /&gt;But after using the product with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream (a wonderful cream recommended to those man enough to use a straight razor) I found that the two aromas come to a wonderfully pleasant and enjoyable manly smell.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, no smell of it,like it</li>
    <li> no complain at all, I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Really helps if I  get razor burn. Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber and I use these on all of my clients ( it stings there face after the shave ) but all of my clients say that it makes there skin feel good and it also heels the skin .</li>
    <li> I shave both my face and head, so I&#x27;m always trying to find a great post shave skin soother.  Well, I can stop looking.  This fits the bill!.  A few drops rubbed between the hands will cover face and head with great results.  A bit of sting, in a nice way and then my skin is quickly relieved and feels BBS and moisture quenched.  You will know that your shaving effort was rewarded in the right way. Wait a few moments, and enjoy the refreshed feeling, then splash on your favorite after shave, and you&#x27;re ready for whatever is in store.  Look no more.  This is the best you&#x27;ll find.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the name. Ended up enjoying it immensely along with my other products. Great shave.</li>
    <li> It has been difficult to find an aftershave that does not exacerbate my chemical sensitivity disorder as well as addressing my shaving needs. I was pleasantly surprised at the great cool feeling as I applied Thayer&#x27;s to my skin. I highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Produced the most horrendous, lingering, burning, stinging effects on my freshly-shaved face. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using this product twice. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> really a nice after shave. keeps skin renewed. made in usa.</li>
    <li> Works great. Stings just a little. Scent wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> Only after shave I will use. Glad I stumbled on it a while back. Soothing without having an overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and performs it&#x27;s task as advertised, leaving your skin feeling fresh and smooth.  It loses one star because of it&#x27;s size.  This would make a nice &amp;#34;Travel Size&amp;#34; for a shave kit...not what we expected.</li>
    <li> The best aftershave astringent on the market I use Thayers everyday after shaving my face and head... great stuff!</li>
    <li> I get ingrown hairs and razor bumps as a result. Thayers is soft and closes the pores back up gently which I&#x27;ve noticed greatly reduces the redness. The aloe is soothing and helps take the sting out of the initial application when you apply it. 4 ounces lasts quite a while as you need very little after a shave to get your skin back in shape. Terrific stuff, don&#x27;t like shaving without it.</li>
    <li> My husband says &amp;#34;If every man tried Thayers After Shave, every man would use it.&amp;#34; He has sensitive skin and has been using Thayers for years.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me. Makes skin smooth after a shave.</li>
    <li> Just what i expected, good cheap witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with Clubman Pinaud for an aftershave that leaves my skin feeling great, no razor burn</li>
    <li> Great product!! Keeps my skin moist after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is not a product that will change your life expectancy. It will, however, sugnificantly improve shaving and the rest of the day. I find its mild astringency when used after a pass with an alum block and before a decent aftershave balm, to be just right.</li>
    <li> Feels good on frequently shaven face.  Cool and refreshing, with just the right amount of alcohol. Invigorating.</li>
