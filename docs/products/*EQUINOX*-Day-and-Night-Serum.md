### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If I can help just 1 person with making their decision to not try these products, then I will be happy.</li>
      <li>Equinox FREE trial is a rip off!!</li>
      <li>Any product that is supposed to be so amazing doesn&#x27;t need to use scam tactics and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many creams &amp; serums that are supposed to even your skin&#x27;s complexion &amp; minimize wrinkles that I can&#x27;t even count them.</li>
      <li>I love the serums they go on well and do their job for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I hope this is a lesson I have learned before ordering any further items without checking the reviews first!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more</li>
      <li>Wrinkles appear diminished &amp; my complexion is more evenly toned.</li>
      <li>They bank on you not reading the fine print if there is any.</li>
      <li>They offer you to try their product for free, just pay for shipping.</li>
      <li>This has really shied me away from internet purchases of skin care products; if it seems too good to be true, it usually isn&#x27;t and this is a perfect example!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>also did not suite my skin thought it was free trial but was billed for it.</li>
      <li>got the FREE TRIAL OFFER just pay postage.</li>
      <li>but when you agree to a free trail, I guess you are agreeing to get it each month.  </li>
      <li>many people I am a truly honest person and am horrified at this total CON.</li>
      <li>Avoid buying this product unless you just want to try it and can buy super cheap here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I thought I had a full 2 weeks to try it.  </li>
      <li>my account for full price can&#x27;t stop it ,I call .</li>
      <li>The product arrived rather quickly and I started using the product the evening it was received.</li>
      <li>You aren&#x27;t really getting a free trail.  </li>
      <li>So if you plan on ordering your free product, which isn&#x27;t free you better be home and take no trips, for your account will be charged every month $99 and if you ordered their other product RVTL you will be charged $93.</li>
      <li>After having used it now for forty plus days I really don&#x27;t see much of a change at all and the product seems to be sticky on the face.</li>
      <li>I am very disturbed at the reviews I&#x27;ve read about this company taking money out of your account without your knowledge.</li>
      <li>My wife uses this Serum, it really works.</li>
      <li>I have however contacted my bank and they are kind enough to put a &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; on any future withdrawals from my account by this company.</li>
      <li>Lets face it, as we get older, we all keep hoping for that miracle product that helps our appearance.</li>
      <li>The seller was professional &amp; very prompt.</li>
      <li>With Equinox, I noticed a definite change by the end of the first week.</li>
      <li>This product, along with the RVTL anti-aging cream, is a complete rip off scam job!  </li>
      <li>This company offers a free trial and it is not true.  </li>
      <li>since then four payments have been taken of nearly £100 each in the space of two weeks - my bank statement came yesterday..  </li>
      <li>Even thou the company offers a 14 day refund/return, you receive the product 10 days in, you use it, and before you know it 14 days are gone</li>
      <li>I sent off for a free trial of Equinox day and night cream,  thinking it would be a small sample and paid on my debit card for £4.95 postage and packing</li>
      <li>Apparently this product was advertised on the Dr. Oz show, so shame on you, Dr. Oz.  </li>
      <li>Although I purchased this product directly from the Equinox company, my credit card was charged almost $200 for a product which was offered for $30 (in big, red print) with no shipping charge.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product actually works.  I have tried so many creams &amp; serums that are supposed to even your skin&#x27;s complexion &amp; minimize wrinkles that I can&#x27;t even count them. With Equinox, I noticed a definite change by the end of the first week. Wrinkles appear diminished &amp; my complexion is more evenly toned. I will continue to purchase this product. The seller was professional &amp; very prompt. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product arrived rather quickly and I started using the product the evening it was received. After having used it now for forty plus days I really don&#x27;t see much of a change at all and the product seems to be sticky on the face. I do use primer after applying the Equinox in the morning so its basically on all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to think long and hard if I would purchase this again. Lets face it, as we get older, we all keep hoping for that miracle product that helps our appearance. This one may work for you,but it didn&#x27;t for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avid shopper</li>
    <li> This company offers a free trial and it is not true.  I was charged almost $200 after I was charged for the shipping.  Trying to deal with the company is useless.  They are rude and uncaring.  The product also has done nothing for me. I would tell anyone to stay away from this company!</li>
    <li> Avoid buying this product unless you just want to try it and can buy super cheap here on Amazon. It did little for my skin and some of it accidentally in my eye necessitated medical treatment.  If you deal later with this company do not give them your bank account or credit card information. You will find yourself shorted over 200 dollars and no one will help you, not this company or your bank. I say &amp;#34;run&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Even thou the company offers a 14 day refund/return, you receive the product 10 days in, you use it, and before you know it 14 days are gone and you&#x27;re stuck with a bunch of expensive and inferior products that don&#x27;t work.  This has really shied me away from internet purchases of skin care products; if it seems too good to be true, it usually isn&#x27;t and this is a perfect example!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This company is a Scam. They bank on you not reading the fine print if there is any. They offer you to try their product for free, just pay for shipping. I did not know it was a trial, but your trial starts the day you order, not the day you receive the product. This is where the scam begins. So if you plan on ordering your free product, which isn&#x27;t free you better be home and take no trips, for your account will be charged every month $99 and if you ordered their other product RVTL you will be charged $93. Their address is in Nevada, but this is a foreign based company. I threw my order in the trash. Any product that is supposed to be so amazing doesn&#x27;t need to use scam tactics and doesn&#x27;t work. Learned my lesson. Next time you order a product have a lawyer with you. This does not reflect on Amazon, this order came from their web site.</li>
    <li> the pump did not work also did not suite my skin thought it was free trial but was billed for it.</li>
    <li> I, too, fell into the trap of &amp;#34;free postage&amp;#34; for a trial sample - and £4 was taken from my account.  since then four payments have been taken of nearly £100 each in the space of two weeks - my bank statement came yesterday..  BEWARE, it&#x27;s a con.</li>
    <li> I sent off for a free trial of Equinox day and night cream,  thinking it would be a small sample and paid on my debit card for £4.95 postage and packing (I only had £5.00 in my bank account that day)  come payday £185.00 was stolen from my account for two products.  The packages came with no agreement details or credit note.  and yes ive been well and truly robbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bank gave me the phone numbers of both accounts and the gentlemen at customer services credited me with £40.00 for each item as he said I ticked the box  Terms and Conditions,  what a fool.  I didn&#x27;t keep admin details so I couldn&#x27;t prove him wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many people I am a truly honest person and am horrified at this total CON. its made me ill.</li>
    <li> You aren&#x27;t really getting a free trail.  They keep sending you stuff and charging $185 each month until you cancel.  I didn&#x27;t sign up for anything but when you agree to a free trail, I guess you are agreeing to get it each month.  It is a scam.  They have a $40 restocking fee and $15 shipping fee. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SITE.  They rip you off.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this Serum, it really works. I was having problems getting it from supplier before we leave the Country. And I found these 2 and have received them, YOU saved the day. Thank You. I wish I could place this product on a monthly order.  Leo</li>
    <li> Equinox FREE trial is a rip off!! They card your credit card close to $200 before you know it. Everyone cheated needs to contact their Attorney Generals office and file a complaint. Tweet and post to Facebook! They need to be shut down one way or another for being a total scam!!</li>
    <li> if I could give it a 0 I would it is the worst product I have ever put on my face within two days of the first application I had red blotches all over my face and now I have little welts that will not go away. Hate the product hate the company don&#x27;t buy this piece of trash.</li>
    <li> Although I purchased this product directly from the Equinox company, my credit card was charged almost $200 for a product which was offered for $30 (in big, red print) with no shipping charge.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I fell into the \\&quot;free\\&quot; 14-day trial trap.  I would be almost $200 richer.  I got the product late.  I thought I had a full 2 weeks to try it.  What was I thinking?!  When the charge showed up, I immediately called to cancel and offered to return the products (I also ordered the RVTL).  I was told I wouldn&#x27;t be charged.  Imagine my surprise when that didn&#x27;t happen.  What&#x27;s more they denied that I was told that.  To add salt to the wound, the stuff is useless.  I see no change.  The manufacturers, Phoenix Labs and Sheridan Labs should be ashamed of themselves for selling such expensive but ultimately worthless \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products in such a disreputable way.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars are deceiving.  See more reviews under the Equinox Instant Wrinkle Erase/Remove, it&#x27;s the same product and the same sad story.  Also check out Scambook for a truer picture of this horrible company.</li>
    <li> This product, along with the RVTL anti-aging cream, is a complete rip off scam job!  All I can say is &#x27;do not fall into this trap&#x27;!  I&#x27;ve been trying to cancel my order for days now.  I sent back both products and they are still billing me.  The customer service people are not helpful, the phone connection to them keeps cutting out every few seconds or so, can hardly understand them....in one word, horrific!  I will never order a product like this again unless I thoroughly research all the customer reviews, which by the way, 9 out of 10 of the reviews are negative, either for how the product does not work, or for the charges they keep charging you on a monthly basis.  Apparently this product was advertised on the Dr. Oz show, so shame on you, Dr. Oz.  Also Facebook was pushing ads about these products too.  Perhaps they both need to know how awful these products/companies are.  If I can help just 1 person with making their decision to not try these products, then I will be happy.</li>
    <li> After checking my bank account I realized  £185.95 had been taken out! I didn&#x27;t read the small print, money will come out every other month and the face serum will keep coming! I contacted my bank to put a stop and e-mailed the company. Doubt if I will get a refund, my stupid fault.</li>
    <li> I am very disturbed at the reviews I&#x27;ve read about this company taking money out of your account without your knowledge. I have just received my &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; and have used it but obviously its too soon to give any opinions. I have however contacted my bank and they are kind enough to put a &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; on any future withdrawals from my account by this company. I hope this is a lesson I have learned before ordering any further items without checking the reviews first!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the serums they go on well and do their job for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;I got the FREE TRIAL OFFER just pay postage. I am getting the trials still every month for a year and auto draft my account for full price can&#x27;t stop it ,I call . Products keep coming...</li>
